Exhibit 99.1

Exhibit 99.2
NORWALK, Conn., November 2, 2004 . . Priceline.com Incorporated (Nasdaq: PCLN) today reported 3 quarter 2004 gross travel bookings of $432 million, a 44% increase over a year ago.  Gross travel bookings refer to the total dollar value inclusive of taxes and fees of all travel products purchased by consumers.  Revenues were $235.9 million versus $243.4 million for the same period a year ago.
rd
 
Priceline.com's GAAP gross profit for the 3 quarter 2004 was $51.1 million.  Priceline.com's GAAP net income for the 3 quarter 2004 was $9.3 million, or $0.23 per diluted share.  Pro forma gross profit for the 3 quarter 2004 was $51.7 million, up 27% over the same period a year ago.  Pro forma net income for the 3 quarter 2004 was $11.3 million or $0.28 per diluted share, which exceeds First Call analyst estimates of $0.27 per diluted share and represents a 15% increase over the prior year.  Pro forma gross profit and pro forma net income exclude the after-tax effects of non-cash amortization expense of acquisition-related intangibles (primarily associated with priceline.com's acquisition of Active Hotels and a majority of the equity of Travelweb LLC).  Pro forma net income further excludes the effects of stock-based compensation expense, option payroll tax expense, minority interest credit and, when applicable, the payment of non-cash preferred stock dividends.  The attached financial and statistical supplement reconciles pro forma financial information with priceline.com's financial results under GAAP and the section below entitled "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" provides further information about the use of pro forma financial measures used in this press release.

Airline ticket unit bookings, which include published-price and Name Your Own Price tickets, grew 65% compared to the same period a year ago.  Hotel room night unit bookings grew 27% compared to the same period last year and rental car day unit bookings increased 12% year over year. Hotel room night unit bookings include bookings of Travelweb, which was acquired in May 2004, and ten days of results from Active Hotels, which was acquired in September 2004.  Rental car day unit bookings include bookings of RentalCars.com and Breezenet.com, which were acquired in June and December 2003, respectively.
 
"Priceline.com's growth in gross bookings and gross profit dollars continued at an industry-leading pace, fueled by new products and product improvements, as well as contributions from Travelweb," said priceline.com President and Chief Executive Officer Jeffery H. Boyd.  "On the bottom line, solid expense controls allowed us to report better-than-expected earnings, despite the negative impact of the hurricanes on bookings and cancellations in the southeast during the quarter."
 
A major development in the 3 quarter for priceline.com and its hotels service was the acquisition of UK-based Active Hotels Ltd., one of Europe's leading Internet hotel reservation sites, on September 21, 2004.  For the twelve months ended September 30, 2004, Active Hotels had gross travel bookings of approximately $160 million, an approximate 100% increase over the same period a year ago.  Priceline.com said it expected the acquisition to be accretive to its earnings (before non-cash amortization expense associated with the acquisition) for the 4 quarter 2004 and for 2005.  Active Hotels will continue to be managed by Active's Europe-based management team.
rd
th
The acquisition of this profitable travel service expands priceline.com's footprint in the European travel marketplace and broadens the Company's inventory of hotels. Active Hotels works with a base of 8,000 participating European hotels.  Active Hotels' distribution system includes 1,500 independent Web sites throughout Europe, plus company-owned Web sites like ActiveReservations.  Active Hotels' services are available in English, French, Spanish, German and Italian.
 
Forward Guidance
 
Looking forward, Mr. Boyd commented, "With priceline.com's expanded product line, including retail products, we believe that we are better positioned to compete in the busy holiday travel season than in previous years.  Moreover, we believe that our ongoing initiatives to offer retail choices to our hotel and rental car customers, expand packaging and destination commerce and build on Active Hotels' leadership position in Europe should provide a firm foundation for growth into 2005."
 
Priceline.com stated that it remained comfortable that 4 quarter year-over-year growth rates for gross travel bookings, revenue, pro forma gross profit and airline ticket, hotel room night and rental car days unit sales, without giving effect to the acquisition of Active Hotels, would be in line with the second half averages given in its previous guidance issued in August.  The Company also issued the following guidance for the 4 quarter 2004, which is inclusive of the results of Active Hotels:
th

A reconciliation of pro forma financial results to GAAP results is included in the attached financial and statistical supplement.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
Pro forma gross profit excludes the after-tax effects of non-cash amortization expense of acquisition-related intangibles primarily associated with the acquisition of Active Hotels Ltd. and a majority of the equity of Travelweb LLC.  Pro forma net income excludes the after-tax effects of non-cash amortization expense of acquisition-related intangibles (primarily associated with the acquisition of Active Hotels Ltd. and a majority of the equity of Travelweb LLC), stock based compensation, option payroll taxes, minority interest credit and, when applicable, the payment of non-cash preferred stock dividends.  Pro forma net income and pro forma gross profit are "non-GAAP financial measures," as such term is defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and may differ from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Priceline.com believes that pro forma net income and pro forma gross profit that exclude the after-tax effects of non-cash amortization expense of acquisition-related intangibles are useful for investors to evaluate priceline.com's future on-going performance because they enable a more meaningful comparison of priceline.com's projected cash earnings and performance with its historical results from prior periods.  Stock based compensation and preferred stock dividends are excluded from pro forma net income because they do not impact cash earnings and are reflected in earnings per
share through increased share counts.  Option payroll tax often shows volatility unrelated to operating results since the expense is driven primarily by option exercise activity and the market price of priceline.com's common stock. The minority interest credit associated with priceline.com's equity ownership of Travelweb LLC is excluded from pro forma net income because priceline.com is funding all of Travelweb's operations.  The presentation of this financial information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The attached financial and statistical supplement reconciles pro forma financial information with priceline.com's financial results under GAAP.
