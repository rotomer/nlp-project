Item 2.01
Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets
                                         
 
On September 21, 2004, Priceline.com Holdco U.K. Limited (the "Acquirer"), a newly formed, wholly (indirectly) owned English subsidiary of priceline.com Incorporated (the "Company"), entered into a Sale and Purchase Agreement with shareholders and option holders of Active Hotels Limited ("Active Hotels"), one of Europe's leading online reservation providers to the hotel industry.  Pursuant to the Sale and Purchase Agreement, the Acquirer acquired approximately 98% of the share capital of Active Hotels and acquired the remaining 2% on October 8, 2004.  The total consideration for all Active Hotels shares was 90 million (approximately $161 million), which was determined through arms-length negotiation and paid in cash.  The Company also incurred approximately $4 million in costs directly related to the acquisition.
 
In connection with the acquisition, the Company sold a 2.3% equity interest in Active Hotels (the "Purchased Shares") to a group of Active Hotels employees for a cash purchase price per share equal to the purchase price per share paid by the Company to acquire Active Hotels. The Company also granted restricted stock (the "Granted Shares") representing an additional 1.1% equity interest in its Active Hotels subsidiary to certain employees of Active Hotels. The holders of the Purchased Shares and the Granted Shares can require the Company to purchase the Purchased Shares and the Granted Shares at certain future dates for a purchase price equal to their then fair market value. In addition, the Company can require the holders of the Purchased Shares and the Granted Shares to sell the Purchased Shares and the Granted Shares to the Company at certain future dates for a purchase price equal to their then fair market value.  Subject to certain exceptions, one-third of the Granted Shares will vest on each of September 15, 2005, 2006 and 2007.
 
The shareholders and option holders of Active Hotels were Bamboo Investments (No.2) Limited, Close Technology & General VCT plc, The First Close Technology Fund and various individuals and employees of Active Hotels.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
 
To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Active Hotels Limited
 
We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Active Hotels Limited ("the Company") as of 31 December 2003 and 2002, and the profit and loss accounts, the cash flow statements and related notes 1 to 19 for the years then ended.  These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
 
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
 
In our opinion, such financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at 31 December 2003 and 2002, and the results of its operations and cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United Kingdom.
 
Accounting principles generally accepted in the United Kingdom vary in significant respects from accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  The application of the latter would have affected the determination of shareholders' funds at 31 December 2003 and 2002 and net profit (loss) for each of the years then ended to the extent summarized in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements.

NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS
Year ended 31 December 2003
 
1.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES
                                     
 
The financial statements are prepared in accordance with applicable United Kingdom accounting standards.  The particular accounting policies adopted are described below.
 
Accounting convention
 
The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention.
 
Tangible fixed assets
 
Depreciation is provided on cost in equal annual installments over the estimated useful lives of the assets.  The rates of depreciation are as follows:
 
 
Deferred taxation
 
Deferred tax is provided in full on timing differences, which result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, at a future date, at rates expected to apply when they crystallise based on current tax rates and law.  Timing differences arise from the inclusion of items of income and expenditure in taxation computations in periods different from those in which they are included in financial statements.  Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
 
Leases
 
Assets held under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are capitalised at their fair value on the inception of the leases and depreciated over their estimated useful economic lives.  The finance leases are allocated over the period of the lease in proportion to the capital amount outstanding and are charged to the profit and loss account.
 
Rentals under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account as they are incurred.
 
Grants
 
Income arising from Government grants is taken to the profit and loss account to the extent that it relates to expenditure charged to the profit and loss account in the year.
 
Foreign exchange
 
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates ruling at the dates of the transactions.  Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated at the rates ruling at that date.  Translation differences arising are dealt with in the profit and loss account.
2.
TURNOVER
                                     
 
Turnover represents amounts derived from the provision of goods and services which fall within the company's ordinary activities after deduction of trade discounts and value added tax.  Turnover is recognised on the date of departure.
 
The company's turnover arises from facilitating hotel bookings over the Internet.  The company's assets, premises and employees are located in the UK.  The geographical analysis of turnover in 2003 based on hotel location was:  UK - 6,453,490 (2002:  2,054,482) and Rest of Europe - 715,425 (2002:  104,008).
 
3.
INFORMATION REGARDING DIRECTORS AND EMPLOYEES
                                     
 
 
Directors' share options are disclosed in note 13.

7.
TAX ON PROFIT (LOSS) ON ORDINARY ACTIVITIES
                                     
 
 
The standard rate of tax for the year, based on the UK standard rate of corporation tax is 30% (2002 - 20%).  The actual tax charge for the current and the previous year differs from the standard tax rate for the reasons set out in the following reconciliation:
 
 
 
 
Losses can be utilised against future trading profits.  Capital allowances in excess of depreciation will reverse over future periods as depreciation is charged to the profit and loss account in excess of capital allowances claimed.
8.
TANGIBLE FIXED ASSETS
                                     
 
 
Included within fixed assets are assets with a net book value of nil (2002 - 9,627) held under finance lease agreements.
 
Webphones were previously disclosed as a separate class of asset.  These have now been included within computer equipment.  The net book value of these is nil (2002 - nil).

13.
CALLED UP SHARE CAPITAL
                              
 
 
During the year the company issued share capital to the holders of B' ordinary shares and C' ordinary shares as they were entitled to subscribe in cash at par for an additional number of B' ordinary shares or C' ordinary shares whereby the total number of shares would be held at an average price of 1.60 per share.  The entitlement to this additional subscription was as set out in the Articles of Association of the company, and arose as the net profits for the year ended 31 December 2002 were less than 500,000.  As a result, shares were issued at par to B' shareholders (337,710 B' ordinary shares of 0.1p each) and C' shareholders (52,130 C' ordinary shares of 0.1p each) on 20 May 2003.
 
Share rights
 
Income
 
On 14 January 2004 and annually thereafter, there is a right to a dividend of all of the net profits shown in the latest published audited accounts of the company limited to the extent that the company has sufficient distributable reserves to allow such payment whereby dividends would be paid in the following order of priority:
 
A' and B' ordinary shares - a dividend per share calculated by that proportion of net profits that represent the proportion of total share capital held by A' and B' ordinary shareholders.
 
Ordinary and C' ordinary shares - a dividend per share capitalised into ordinary and C' ordinary shares calculated as the balance of net profits divided by the latest share issue price.
 
Deferred shares - a fixed dividend of 0.001p per share, if a dividend is declared on A' or B' ordinary shares.
 
Return of capital
 
On a return of assets, distributions are made in the following order:
 
Ordinary shares and A', B' and C' ordinary shares - an amount equal to the proportion of total share capital.
 
Deferred shares - no rights to any return, except in the case of a take over, listing or disposal in which case there will be an entitlement based on the level of total consideration, as set out in the Articles.
 
Votes
 
Ordinary and A', B' and C' ordinary shares - 1 vote.
 
Deferred shares - no votes.
 
Share options
 
At 31 December 2003, the company had issued the following share options over ordinary shares of 0.1p:
 
 
Directors' share options were granted to (i) M Witt, (ii) A Currie and (iii) B Murphy.
 
Included in the options granted in May 2001 are 305,000 of options over shares already in issue and held by directors of the company (15,000 of these options have lapsed).
 
In April 2004, 23,750 share options were granted to employees at an exercise price of 6.50.
 
At the year end the company had committed to issuing 67,500 options, but had not done so.  These options are to be issued to (a) B
Murphy (a director) under an unconditional contractual arrangement (25,000); (b) B Murphy (a director) under a conditional
contractual arrangement (25,000); and (c) A Currie (a director) under a conditional contractual arrangement (17,500).  B Murphy's employment with the company ceased on 31 May 2004.  Accordingly, on this date, his contractual option arrangements were no longer commitments of the company.

Summary of the main differences between the accounting principles generally accepted in the United Kingdom and the United States of America as they affect the Company's financial statements
18.
                              
 
The financial statements of Active Hotels Limited were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United Kingdom (UK GAAP), which differs in certain respects from generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (US GAAP).
 
Recognition and measurement differences
 
Other than as described below there are no material recognition and measurement differences between UK and US GAAP that affect the Company.  Shareholders' funds as of 31 December 2003 and 2002 and net profit (loss) for the years then ended under US GAAP would be as follows versus that reported under UK GAAP.
 
 
 
(a) Stock compensation
Under UK GAAP, the accounting rules related to stock compensation are largely contained within . Abstract 17 addresses the debit, or charge, to the profit and loss account.  It requires that the market price of the shares on grant date less the exercise price of the share benefits to be expensed over the period of performance.  Under UK GAAP there is no authoritative literature or guidance addressing the determination of market price in the context of privately held companies.
UITF Abstract 17 Employee share schemes' and UITF Abstract 13 Accounting for ESOP trusts'
 
Under US GAAP, companies may elect to follow the accounting prescribed by either Accounting Principles Board Opinion 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," (APB 25) or SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation" (SFAS 123) as amended by SFAS No. 148 Accounting for Stock Based Compensation  Transition and Disclosure.  Compensation is recorded for the cost of providing the stock options or share awards to the employee over the relevant service period.  The costs can be determined based on either the intrinsic value method (APB 25) or the fair value method (SFAS 123).  Active Hotels has elected to follow the accounting prescribed under APB 25.
 
Under the intrinsic value method, compensation for services that a corporation receives as consideration for stock issued through employee stock option, purchase, and award plans should be measured by the quoted market price of the stock at the measurement date less the amount, if any, that the employee is required to pay.  If a quoted market price is unavailable, the best estimate of the market value of the stock should be used to measure compensation.
 
US GAAP is more prescriptive in its guidance on how to determine the best estimate of market value for the purposes of accounting for stock compensation in a private company, including the recently issued   Furthermore, practice requires consideration of subsequent market transactions in assessing the estimated fair value.
AICPA Practice Aid, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation.
 
The reconciliation includes a difference in this area between US GAAP and reported UK GAAP.
 
(b) Website Development Costs
Under UK GAAP, UITF 29 requires the costs of developing a website to be capitalized to the extent they lead to the creation of an enduring asset delivering benefits at least as great as the amount capitalized.
Website development costs
 
UITF 29 was effective for all accounting periods ending on or after 23 March, 2001.  Prior to the issuance of UITF 29, UK GAAP permitted website development costs to be expensed as incurred.  Commercial exploitation of the Company's website started in early 2001.  Accordingly no website development costs have been capitalized under UK GAAP.
 
Under US GAAP Emerging Issues Task Force Issue 00-2:  provides guidance on accounting for costs to develop a web site and is dependent upon the stage of the development.  This adjustment recognizes under US GAAP, the impact of capitalizing the web site development costs at the balance sheet date as well as the effect on net income (loss) of the amortization therein for the year.
Accounting for Web Site Development Costs
 
Presentation and classification differences
 
Balance sheet
 
The format of a balance sheet prepared in accordance with UK GAAP differs in certain respects from US GAAP.  UK GAAP requires assets to be presented in ascending order of liquidity in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 1985, whereas under US GAAP such assets are presented in descending order of liquidity.  In addition, under UK GAAP a current asset is defined as one that is not intended for use on accounting basis in the company's activities whereas US GAAP defines a current asset as one that is "consumed in the operating cycle".  Thus current assets under UK GAAP may include amounts that fall due after more than one year, whereas under US GAAP, such assets are classified as non-current assets.
 
Deferred taxes
 
Under UK GAAP the net deferred tax asset is reported within debtors due within one year.  Under US GAAP deferred taxes are classified according to the classification of the related asset or liability for financial reporting purposes.  Under US GAAP the deferred tax liability related to fixed assets of 24,763 as at 31 December 2003 would be classified as a long term liability.
 
Statement of cash flows
 
The financial statements of Active Hotels Limited include a statement of cash flows in accordance with the revised UK Financial Reporting Standard No. 1 (FRS 1).  The statement prepared under FRS 1 presents substantially the same information as that required under FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows (SFAS 95).
 
Under FRS 1 cash flows are presented for (i) operating activities; (ii) dividends from joint
 
ventures; (iii) dividends from associated undertakings; (iv) servicing of finance and returns on investments; (v) taxation; (vi) capital expenditure and financial investment; (vii) acquisitions and disposals; (viii) dividends; (ix) financing; and (x) management of liquid resources.  SFAS 95 only requires presentation of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities.
 
Cash flows under FRS 1 in respect of taxation and servicing of finance and returns on investments are included within operating activities under SFAS 95.  Cash flows under FRS 1 in respect of capital expenditure and acquisitions and disposals are included in investing activities under SFAS 95.
 
Therefore under US GAAP the following amounts would be reported

SUMMARY OF THE MAIN DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED KINGDOM AND THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AS THEY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 
The financial statements of Active Hotels Limited were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United Kingdom (UK GAAP), which differs in certain respects from generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (US GAAP).
 
Recognition and measurement differences
 
Other than as described below there are no material recognition and measurement differences between UK and US GAAP that affect the Company.  Shareholders' funds as of 30 June 2004 and 2003 and net profit (loss) for the six-month periods then ended under US GAAP would be as follows versus that reported under UK GAAP.
 
 
 
A description of the differences between UK and US GAAP is set at Note 18 of the annual financial statements.
 
Presentation and classification differences
 
The format of a balance sheet prepared in accordance with UK GAAP differs in certain respects from US GAAP.  UK GAAP requires assets to be presented in ascending order of liquidity in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 1985, whereas under US GAAP such assets are presented in descending order of liquidity.  In addition, under UK GAAP a current asset is defined as one that is not intended for use on accounting basis in the company's activities whereas US GAAP defines a current asset as one that is "consumed in the operating cycle".  Thus current assets under UK GAAP may include amounts that fall due after more than one year, whereas under US GAAP, such assets are classified as current assets.
Statement of cash flows
 
The financial statements of Active Hotels Limited include a statement of cash flows in accordance with the revised UK Financial Reporting Standard No. 1 (FRS 1).  The statement prepared under FRS 1 presents substantially the same information as that required under FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows (SFAS 95).
 
Under FRS 1 cash flows are presented for (i) operating activities; (ii) dividends from joint ventures; (iii) dividends from associated undertakings; (iv) servicing of finance and returns on investments; (v) taxation; (vi) capital expenditure and financial investment; (vii) acquisitions and disposals; (viii) dividends; (ix) financing; and (x) management of liquid resources.  SFAS 95 only requires presentation of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities.
 
Cash flows under FRS 1 in respect of taxation and servicing of finance and returns on investments are included within operating activities under SFAS 95.  Cash flows under FRS 1 in respect of capital expenditure and acquisitions and disposals are included in investing activities under SFAS 95.
 
Therefore under US GAAP the following amounts would be reported
 
 
 
Introduction
 
On September 21, 2004, Priceline.com Holdco U.K. Limited (the "Acquirer"), a newly formed, wholly (indirectly) owned English subsidiary of priceline.com Incorporated (the "Company"), entered into a Sale and Purchase Agreement with shareholders and option holders of Active Hotels Limited ("Active Hotels"), one of Europe's leading online reservation providers to the hotel industry.  Pursuant to the Sale and Purchase Agreement, the Acquirer acquired approximately 98% of the share capital of Active Hotels and acquired the remaining 2% on October 8, 2004.  The total consideration for all Active Hotels shares was 90 million (approximately $161 million), which was determined through arms-length negotiation and paid in cash.  The Company also incurred approximately $4 million in costs directly related to the acquisition.
 
In connection with the acquisition, the Company sold a 2.3% equity interest in Active Hotels (the "Purchased Shares") to a group of Active Hotels employees for a cash purchase price per share equal to the purchase price per share paid by the Company to acquire Active Hotels. The Company also granted restricted stock (the "Granted Shares") representing an additional 1.1% equity interest in its Active Hotels subsidiary to certain employees of Active Hotels. The holders of the Purchased Shares and the Granted Shares can require the Company to purchase the Purchased Shares and the Granted Shares at certain future dates for a purchase price equal to their then fair market value. In addition, the Company can require the holders of the Purchased Shares and the Granted Shares to sell the Purchased Shares and the Granted Shares to the Company at certain future dates for a purchase price equal to their then fair market value.  Subject to certain exceptions, one-third of the Granted Shares will vest on each of September 15, 2005, 2006 and 2007.
 
The shareholders and option holders of Active Hotels were Bamboo Investments (No.2) Limited, Close Technology & General VCT plc, The First Close Technology Fund and various individuals and employees of Active Hotels.
 
The Company accounted for the acquisition using the purchase method of accounting.  The accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2003 and for the six months ended June 30, 2004, combines the historical consolidated statements of operations of priceline.com Incorporated and Active Hotels Ltd., giving effect to the acquisition of Active Hotels as if the transaction had occurred on January 1, 2003.  The Company made pro forma adjustments to the historical consolidated financial information to give effect to events that are (i) directly attributable to the acquisition, (ii) expected to have a continuing impact on the combined results, and (iii) factually supportable.  The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Statement of Operations excludes amortization expense attributed to the estimated fair value of sales backlog acquired since the adjustment is non-recurring in nature.  The Company will amortize the estimated fair value of sales backlog acquired amounting to $1.4 million over three months from the acquisition date in its consolidated financial statements.
 
The pro forma financial information should be read in conjunction with the:
