As of November 30, 2004, priceline.com Incorporated ("priceline.com") and Lowestfare.com Incorporated will no longer offer retail airline tickets on Northwest Airlines Inc. as a result of a disagreement over terms of distribution.  Priceline.com has not sold airline tickets on Northwest Airlines in its product since May 2002.  Priceline.com believes that ticket sales will be made up by other participating airlines and does not believe the cessation of sales of retail airline tickets on Northwest Airlines will have a material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial condition.
