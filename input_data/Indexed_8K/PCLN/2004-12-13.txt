The First Supplemental Indenture also changes the Company's obligations in the event the Company is required to pay a make whole premium with respect to the 2.25% Notes by eliminating the Company's right to pay the make whole premium with shares of the Company's common stock and requiring the Company to pay the make whole premium in cash.
 
                In addition, on December 13, 2004, the Company entered into a Second Supplemental Indenture with American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, the trustee for the Company's 1.00% Convertible Senior Notes due January 15, 2010 (the "1.00% Notes").  The Second Supplemental Indenture changes the Company's obligations in the event the Company is required to repurchase the 1.00% Notes upon certain events set forth in the Indenture relating to the 1.00% Notes by eliminating the Company's right to repurchase the 1.00% Notes with shares of the Company's common stock and requiring the Company to repurchase the 1.00% Notes for cash.
 
The First Supplemental Indenture and the Second Supplemental Indenture are attached as exhibits hereto.
