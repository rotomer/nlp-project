"We believe that priceline.com's strong growth in gross travel bookings for the 4 quarter, fueled by the success of our new air product and results from Travelweb and Active Hotels, solidified our position as a growth leader among the major full service online travel companies.  We are particularly proud of the fact that we have reestablished strong growth in our top line over the last two years while also consistently delivering market-leading increases in bottom line profits." said priceline.com President and Chief Executive Officer Jeffery H. Boyd.  "Our retail airline ticketing option was very popular with customers during the busy holiday travel season.  Now that customers are accustomed to this option for their airline tickets, we believe that they will respond favorably as priceline.com offers more retail options for hotel rooms, rental cars and vacation packages.  Priceline.com's opaque travel options, particularly for hotel rooms and rental cars, continue to offer exclusive savings and a distinctive choice for consumers. By effectively using retail and opaque products in a complementary manner, we believe that priceline.com is becoming a preferred one-stop-shop for the leisure traveler.  We also offer suppliers a number of attractive distribution channels that meet their needs in a variety of market environments."
th
2004 Highlights
 
January  Launched new airline ticket product giving consumers the choice to shop and compare from a list of low published fares and itineraries, or use priceline.com's Name Your Own Price product for greater savings.

With over 10,000 participating hotels, Travelweb provides a leading retail hotel product to complement  priceline.com's Name Your Own Price product.

Forward Guidance
 
Looking forward into 2005, Mr. Boyd said, "We intend to build on the success of our airline tickets service by building priceline.com's retail and opaque options into a complementary one-stop travel service.  In the 2 quarter of 2005, priceline.com intends to rollout the choice of retail hotel reservations along with a new advertising campaign emphasizing the choices available for all of our products.  We believe that this transformation is making priceline.com a compelling choice for leisure travelers.  In Europe, Active Hotels will continue building inventory and distribution across Europe while integrating Priceline's U.S. inventory and customer base into its product offering and distribution reach.  Active Hotels also intends to relaunch the priceline.co.uk web site in the coming months to offer seamless access to Active Hotel's hotel inventory."
nd
 
The Company also issued the following guidance for the 1 quarter 2005, which includes the results of all priceline.com companies:
st
 
Gross travel bookings growth of 30-35% on a year-over-year basis; and
 - 
                 
Pro forma gross profit growth of 30-35% on a year-over-year basis.
 - 
                 
 
"We expect solid growth from across our product lines in the 1 quarter 2005," said Mr. Boyd. "In particular, we expect year-over-year growth in our hotel product will be enhanced by the results of newly-acquired Active Hotels and Travelweb.  We expect a reduced growth rate for our airline tickets product since we are now comparing to a prior-year period in which all of our retail and opaque ticket options were available to customers."
st
Priceline.com said it expects 1 quarter 2005 pro forma net income of between $0.18 and $0.22 per diluted share and GAAP net income of between $0.07 and $0.11 per diluted share.  Priceline.com also said that it was comfortable with current First Call analyst's consensus estimates of $1.18 per diluted share of proforma net income for full-year 2005.
st
 
"We believe solid growth in unit sales and gross profit contribution in 2005 will enable priceline.com to continue to invest in product development, advertising and supply initiatives that will benefit our customers, suppliers and stockholders." said Mr. Boyd.
 
A reconciliation of historical pro forma financial results to GAAP results is included in the attached financial and statistical supplement.  Pro forma net income per diluted share guidance for the 1 quarter and full-year 2005 excludes the after-tax effects of non-cash amortization expense of acquisition-related intangibles (primarily associated with the acquisitions of Travelweb LLC and ActiveHotels), stock-based compensation expense, option payroll tax expense, minority interest benefit, and the payment of non-cash preferred stock dividends, which, when aggregated, are expected to total approximately $4.5 million and $18.5 million respectively.  In addition, pro forma net income per diluted share guidance for the 1 quarter 2005 and full-year 2005 excludes the anticipated impact of  EITF 04-08 ("), which was effective as of December 15, 2004 and which revises the method for calculating diluted shares outstanding for purposes of computing GAAP net income per share.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
Pro forma gross profit excludes the after-tax effects of non-cash amortization expense of acquisition-related intangibles primarily associated with the acquisition of Active Hotels Ltd. and Travelweb LLC.  Pro forma net income excludes the after-tax effects of non-cash amortization expense of acquisition-related intangibles (primarily associated with the acquisition of Active Hotels Ltd. and Travelweb LLC), stock based compensation expense, option payroll tax expense, minority interest benefit and, when applicable, the payment of non-cash preferred stock dividends.  In addition, pro forma net income per share excludes the accounting impact of EITF 04-08
(""), which was effective as of December 15, 2004 and revises the method for calculating diluted shares outstanding for purposes of computing GAAP net income per share
Effect of Contingently Convertible Debt on Diluted Earnings per Share
.
 
Pro forma gross profit, pro forma net income and pro forma net income per share are "non-GAAP financial measures," as such term is defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and may differ from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Priceline.com believes that pro forma gross profit, pro forma net income and pro forma net income per share that exclude the after-tax effects of non-cash amortization expense of acquisition-related intangibles are useful for investors to evaluate priceline.com's future on-going performance because they enable a more meaningful comparison of priceline.com's projected cash earnings and performance with its historical results from prior periods.  Stock based compensation expense and the non-cash expense associated with the payment of preferred stock dividends are excluded from pro forma net income and pro forma net income per share because they do not impact cash earnings and are reflected in earnings per share through increased share counts.  Option payroll tax expense often shows volatility unrelated to operating results since the expense is driven primarily by option exercise activity and the market price of priceline.com's common stock. The minority interest benefit associated with priceline.com's equity ownership of Travelweb LLC is excluded from pro forma net income because priceline.com has been funding all of Travelweb's operations.  Finally, the accounting impact of EITF 04-08
(""), which requires that priceline.com use the "if-converted" method of accounting for convertible debt instruments when calculating earnings per share,
Effect of Contingently Convertible Debt on Diluted Earnings per Share
has been excluded because the common stock that underly priceline.com's 1% Convertible Senior Notes
and priceline.com's 2.25% Convertible Senior Notes are generally not issuable unless our common stock trades at prices of $44.00 per share and $45.54 per share, respectively.
 
The presentation of this financial information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.
