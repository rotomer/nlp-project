On May 9, 2005, priceline.com Incorporated announced its financial results for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2005.  A copy of priceline.com's press release announcing these financial results and certain other information is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
 
Priceline.com conducted its 1 quarter 2005 earnings conference call on May 9, 2005.  During the call, priceline.com said it expected 2 quarter 2005 gross travel bookings and revenues to increase approximately 25% and 5%, respectively, over the same period in 2004.  Priceline.com announced that it expected consolidated advertising expenses of approximately $23.0 million in the 2 quarter 2005 and expected slightly more to be spent "off-line" than "on-line."  Priceline.com estimated that sales and marketing expenses in the 2 quarter 2005 would be between $10.5 and $11.0 million.  Priceline.com stated that it expected personnel costs to be approximately $10.0 to $10.5 million in the 2 quarter 2005.  With respect to 2 quarter 2005, priceline.com stated it expected general and administrative expenses of approximately $4.5 to $5.0 million, information technology expenses of approximately $3.0 to $3.2 million, and depreciation and amortization expenses, excluding acquisition related amortization, of approximately $2.6 million.  Priceline.com stated that it expected cash income tax expense of approximately $200,000 in the 2 quarter 2005 and did not expect to have any meaningful income tax expense on foreign sourced earnings in the 2 quarter 2005.  In addition, priceline.com noted that its "organic" gross travel bookings would have grown approximately 23% in the 1 quarter 2005 when compared to the 1 quarter 2004, assuming that priceline.com owned both Active Hotels and Travelweb during both periods and excluding the sale of hotel rooms by Travelweb through Orbitz (the sale of which priceline.com noted it did not expect to extend past the end of the expiration of the Travelweb-Orbitz contract at the end of 2005).

Exhibit 99.1
 
NORWALK, Conn., May 9, 2005 . . . Priceline.com Incorporated (Nasdaq: PCLN) today reported its financial results for the 1 quarter 2005.  Gross travel bookings for the quarter (the total dollar value, inclusive of taxes and fees, of all travel services purchased by consumers) grew 40.8% year-over-year to $507 million.  Revenues were $233.4 million, a 4.1% increase over a year ago.  First quarter 2005 results include the operating results of Active Hotels, acquired in September 2004, and Travelweb, acquired in May 2004.
st
 
Priceline.com's GAAP gross profit for the 1 quarter 2005 was $57.7 million, up 33.0% over the previous year, while GAAP net income for the 1 quarter was $4.1 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, a decrease of 9.1% over the previous year.  GAAP net income was negatively impacted in the 1 quarter of 2005 by previously disclosed non-cash amortization expenses associated with the acquisitions of Travelweb and Active Hotels. Pro forma gross profit for the 1 quarter 2005 was $58.1 million, up 33.9% over a year ago.  Pro forma net income for the 1 quarter 2005 was $8.4 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, which exceeds First Call analyst estimates of $0.20 per share and represents an increase of more than 60% over the prior year.  The section below entitled "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" provides a definition and information about the use of pro forma financial measures used in this press release and the attached financial and statistical supplement reconciles pro forma financial information with priceline.com's financial results under GAAP.

"With $507 million in gross travel bookings in the 1 quarter, priceline.com's bookings have more than doubled over the last two years," said priceline.com President and Chief Executive Officer Jeffery H. Boyd.  "We believe our strong long-term performance has been due in large part to the introduction of new services and markets, and the online and offline marketing that we are putting behind our well-known brand."

travel service to a one-stop, full-service travel company.  Today, priceline.com's search technology and leading travel inventory allows customers to choose between published-price and opaque airline tickets, hotel rooms, packages and rental cars.  This unique ability to shop, compare and save on priceline.com is being communicated through a new TV advertising campaign featuring William Shatner.  With the extensive published hotel inventory and content now available on priceline.com, in addition to our TV campaign, we are now also able to be more aggressive in online channels where customers are looking for information about hotels before buying."
"With the 1 quarter 2005 launch of our new retail hotel service, we have completed the transition from a niche Name Your Own Price

"Throughout the balance of the year, we intend to continue to pursue service improvements, such as optimization of the new hotel service, inventory and destination enhancements for packages and roll-out of cross-sell and destination services offerings.  Active Hotels intends to continue building its business in rapidly growing European markets and we intend to continue efforts to integrate inventory, for example with the recent relaunch of priceline.co.uk, which now offers both priceline.com and Active Hotels services.  We believe the combination of new service and
 
 
market initiatives and our brand and marketing investments position us well to continue growing the business."
 
Forward Guidance
 
For the 2 quarter 2005, priceline.com is guiding investors to the following financial targets:
nd
 
Year-over-year increases in gross travel bookings and pro forma gross profit of approximately 25%.
 - 
                 
Year-over-year increase in revenue of approximately 5%.
 - 
                 
Pro forma net income of between $0.34 to $0.40 per diluted share, and GAAP net income of between $0.25 and $0.31 per diluted share.
 - 
                 
 
"We believe solid growth and operating performance in 2005 will allow us to continue our investments in service and market expansion and advertising," said Mr. Boyd.  "Our guidance assumes only a modest positive contribution from the new hotel service, as it is too soon to predict the longer-term results of the relaunch and new advertising.  That said, we are comfortable with the current First Call analysts consensus estimates of $1.20 per diluted share of pro forma net income for full-year 2005."
 
A reconciliation of pro forma financial results to GAAP results is included in the attached financial and statistical supplement. Pro forma net income per diluted share guidance for the 2 quarter and full-year 2005 excludes the after-tax effects of non-cash amortization expense of acquisition-related intangibles (primarily associated with the acquisitions of Travelweb and Active Hotels), stock-based compensation expense, option payroll tax expense, and, as applicable, the payment of non-cash preferred stock dividends, which, when aggregated, are expected to total approximately $4.0 million and $17.5 million, respectively. In addition, pro forma net income per diluted share guidance for the 2 quarter 2005 and full-year 2005 excludes the anticipated impact of EITF 04-08 ("Effect of Contingently Convertible Debt on Diluted Earnings per Share"), which was effective as of December 15, 2004 and which revises the method for calculating diluted shares outstanding for purposes of computing GAAP net income per diluted share.

 - 
                 
adverse changes in the Company's relationships with airlines and other product and service providers which could include, without limitation, the withdrawal of suppliers from the priceline.com system (either priceline.com's retail or "opaque" services, or both):
 
 - 
                 
the loss or reduction of global distribution fees;

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
Pro forma gross profit excludes the after-tax effects of non-cash amortization expense of acquisition-related intangibles primarily associated with the acquisition of Active Hotels Ltd. and Travelweb LLC.  Pro forma net income excludes the after-tax effects of non-cash amortization expense of acquisition-related intangibles (primarily associated with the acquisition of Travelweb LLC), stock based compensation expense, option payroll tax expense and, when applicable, the payment of non-cash preferred stock dividends.  In addition, pro forma net income per share excludes the accounting impact of EITF 04-08
(""), which was effective as of December 15, 2004 and revises the method for calculating diluted shares outstanding for purposes of computing GAAP net income per share
Effect of Contingently Convertible Debt on Diluted Earnings per Share
.
 
Pro forma gross profit, pro forma net income and pro forma net income per share are "non-GAAP financial measures," as such term is defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and may differ from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Priceline.com believes that pro forma gross profit, pro forma net income and pro forma net income per share that exclude the after-tax effects of non-cash amortization expense of acquisition-related intangibles are useful
 
 
for investors to evaluate priceline.com's future on-going performance because they enable a more meaningful comparison of priceline.com's projected cash earnings and performance with its historical results from prior periods.  Stock based compensation expense and the non-cash expense associated with the payment of preferred stock dividends are excluded from pro forma net income and pro forma net income per share because they do not impact cash earnings and are reflected in earnings per share through increased share counts.  Option payroll tax expense often shows volatility unrelated to operating results since the expense is driven primarily by option exercise activity and the market price of priceline.com's common stock. Finally, the accounting impact of EITF 04-08
(""), which requires that priceline.com use the "if-converted" method of accounting for convertible debt instruments when calculating earnings per share,
Effect of Contingently Convertible Debt on Diluted Earnings per Share
has been excluded because the common stock that underly priceline.com's 1% Convertible Senior Notes and priceline.com's 2.25% Convertible Senior Notes are generally not issuable unless our common stock trades at prices of $44.00 per share and $45.54 per share, respectively.
