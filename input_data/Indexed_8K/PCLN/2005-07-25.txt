Duties
 
You are employed as a Chief Executive Officer in which capacity during working hours you shall devote all your time, attention and skill to your duties of employment.

3.1
          
 
You may also be required to work additional hours by way of overtime either as and when requested to do so by the Company or when the proper performance of your work so requires.  You will not be entitled to be paid extra remuneration for any such additional hours worked in excess of your basic weekly hours.
3.2
          
 
4.

Remuneration, Expenses and Deductions
 
Your basic salary is 110,000 per annum (or such higher sum as the Company may subsequently determine and notify to you) payable by credit transfer monthly in arrears, less tax and NI contributions. Although the Company will review your basic salary annually, you have no entitlement to a salary increase in any year.
5.1
          
 
You will be paid or reimbursed for any reasonable expenses properly incurred by you while performing your duties on behalf of the Company, subject to your producing receipts in respect of such expenses when requested by the Company, and subject to your compliance with the Company's rules and policies relating to expenses.
5.2
          
 
The Company shall be entitled at any time during your employment, or in any event on termination, to deduct from your remuneration hereunder any monies properly due from you to the Company including but not limited to any outstanding loans, advances, relocation expenses, training costs, the cost of repairing any damage or loss to the Company's property caused by you (and of recovering the same), any sums due from you under paragraph 6.2 below and any other monies owed by you to the Company.

The Executive shall also be entitled to receive by way of further remuneration a bonus of up to 40,000 per annum subject to reasonable performance targets being met and calculated in accordance with a formula to be set in advance and decided upon at the sole discretion of the Board, following discussion with the Executive.  The bonus entitlement, calculation and payment thereof shall be agreed on a six monthly basis.
5.4
          
6.
            
Holidays
 
In addition to the Public holidays normally applicable in England, you are also entitled to 25 working days' paid holiday in each complete calendar year.  The Company's holiday year is from 1 January to 31 December.
6.1
          
 
On the commencement and termination of your employment, you will be treated as having accrued holiday on a pro rata basis of 2 days' holiday for each complete month of service in that holiday year calculated by reference to your first or last date at work (as appropriate).  If, on the termination of your employment, you have exceeded your accrued holiday entitlement, this excess will be deducted from any sums due to you.  If you have holiday entitlement still owing the Company may, at its sole discretion, require you to take all or part of your outstanding holiday during your notice period or to pay you a sum in lieu of accrued holiday.
6.2
          
 
You must obtain the prior approval of the Board before booking holiday dates.  Not more than two weeks may be taken at any one time, save at the Board's discretion.
6.3
          
 
Holiday entitlement for one holiday year must be taken in the same holiday year.Failure to do so will result in forfeiture of any such accrued holiday not taken unless you obtain prior consent from the Board for excess holiday to be carried over to the following holiday year.  In that case, any rolled-over holiday undertaken by 31 March of the following year, shall be forfeited.
6.4
          
 
 
7.
            
Sickness
 
If you are absent from work due to sickness or other medical incapacity, the Company will continue to pay your normal salary ("Company sick pay") up to a maximum of 130 working days (whether consecutive or not) if any period of 12 consecutive months.  Thereafter you shall continue to be paid Company Sick pay or salary only at the discretion of the Board.
7.1
          
 
Company sick pay is inclusive of any Statutory Sick Pay ("SSP") to which you may be entitled, and will be based on your normal salary less any State benefits claimable by you on account of your sickness or injury, less normal deductions for tax and NI contributions etc.
7.2
          
 
After your Company sick pay is exhausted, you will continue to receive SSP when you qualify for it under the prevailing legislation.  Where Company sick pay and SSP are payable for the same day of sickness, you will receive the higher of the two sums.  Further details of the SSP Scheme are available from the HR Department.
7.3
          
 
In all cases of absence you must notify the Company on the first morning of your absence, giving the reason for the absence and its anticipated duration.  If you are sick or otherwise medically incapacitated for more than seven consecutive days, then a medical certificate (signed by a doctor) must be produced to the Company.  Thereafter medical certificates should be submitted regularly to cover the full period of absence.  On each occasion a medical certificate expires and you do not anticipate you will be returning to work, you must notify the Company on the first morning following the expiry of the medical certificate.
7.4
          
You are also required to complete the Company's Absence Notification Form for all absences (regardless of duration) and submit it to the HR Department.
7.5
          
 
The Company reserves the right to require you to undergo a medical examination by a doctor or consultant nominated by it, in which event the Company will bear the cost thereof.
7.6
          
 
Your entitlement to Company sick pay and SSP are subject to the Company's right to terminate your employment in accordance with paragraph 16 below and the Company shall not be liable to provide, or compensate for the loss of, such benefit(s).
7.7
          
 
8.
            
Pension and other benefits
 
The Company does not operate an occupational pension scheme in respect of your employment and there is therefore no contracting-out certificate in force in relation to the State Earnings Related Pensions Scheme.
 
9.

Dear Andrew
 
THE WORKING TIME REGULATIONS 1998
 
I am writing to you in relation to the Working Time Regulations 1998 ("the Regulations").  As you may be aware, the Regulations impose certain limits on the hours which employees can be required to work, and guarantee employees minimum daily and weekly rest periods.
 
One of the principal restrictions contained in the Regulations is that employees must not work more than an average of 48 hours per week over a 17 week period. This includes any overtime worked, irrespective of whether it is voluntary or compulsory.
 
Employees can choose to "opt-out" of the Regulations, and voluntarily agree to work, where necessary, more than 48 hours per week.  I am therefore writing to you to ask whether you would be prepared to agree to opt-out of the 48 hour limit.  If you agree to opt-out this will not mean that the Company will insist that your hours exceed the 48-hour average limit.  The Company will, of course, continue to ensure that your working hours are not excessive for health and safety reasons.
 
If you are happy to opt-out please sign, date and return the attached Opt-Out Agreement.  Your other entitlements under the Regulations will be not be affected.
 
You will see from the attached Agreement that you are entitled to terminate the Opt-Out Agreement by giving 4 weeks' notice in writing to the Board.  If you do serve notice to "opt-in", the Company will then be obliged to comply with the 48-hour maximum immediately following the end of that notice period.
 
I should emphasise that you are not obliged to opt-out of the 48 hour weekly working hours limit, and indeed, apart from our ensuring that your weekly working hours are in compliance with the Regulations, no aspect of your employment with the Company will be adversely affected in the event that you decide not to opt out.
 
If you have any questions about this letter or the attached Opt-Out Agreement, or should you be concerned about signing the Agreement, please speak to the Board.
 
I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for your continued commitment to the Company.
 
Yours sincerely
 
 
For and on behalf of
ACTIVE HOTELS LIMITED
I understand that the effect of the Working Time Regulations 1998 is to limit my average working time to a maximum of 48 hours, inclusive of overtime, over a 7 day period averaged over 17 weeks.  I understand that should I not wish to work in excess of 48 hours then I will suffer no detriment, nor be treated any less favourably than any other employee.
 
Given these understandings I wish to dis-apply the effect of the Regulations in relation to the maximum 48 hour limit, the effect of which is to remove the 48 hour maximum limit in relation to my employment indefinitely.  For the avoidance of doubt the terms of my contract of employment referring in particular to my undertaking to workhours in addition to my contractual hours where reasonably necessary are not affected by this agreement.
 
Additionally I agree that should I wish to revert to the 48 hour maximum as specified in the Working Time Regulations, I will give the Company and in particular my manager a minimum of 4 weeks' notice, in writing, of the cancellation of this agreement in order that they can make the necessary business arrangements to meet operational/customer requirements.

Purpose of Election
 
This joint election is made pursuant to section 431(1) Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003 (ITEPA) and applies where employment-related securities, which are restricted securities by reason of section 423 ITEPA, are acquired.
 
The effect of an election under section 431(1) is that, for the relevant Income Tax and NIC purposes, the employment-related securities and their market value will be treated as if they were not restricted securities and that sections 425 to 430 ITEPA do not apply.  Additional Income Tax will be payable (with PAYE and NIC where the securities are Readily Convertible Assets).
 
Should the value of the securities fall following the acquisition, it is possible that Income Tax/NIC that would have arisen because of any future chargeable event (in the absence of an election) would have been less than the Income Tax/NIC due by reason of this election.  Should this be the case, there is no Income Tax/NIC relief available under Part 7 of ITEPA 2003; nor is it available if the securities acquired are subsequently transferred, forfeited or revert to the original owner.
 
3.
             
Application
 
This joint election is made not later than 14 days after the date of acquisition of the securities by the Employee and applies to:
 
 
Acquired by the Employee on 21 September 2004.
 
Exhibit 10.83

Extent of Application
 
This election under section 431(1) ITEPA disapplies all restrictions attaching to the securities.
 
5.
             
Declaration
 
This election will become irrevocable upon the later of its signing or the acquisition and each subsequent acquisition of employment-related securities to which this election applies.
 
In signing this joint election, we agree to be bound by its terms as stated above.
 
 
 
Where the election is in respect of multiple acquisitions, prior to the date of any subsequent acquisition of a security it may be revoked by agreement between the employee and employer in respect of that and any later acquisition.
