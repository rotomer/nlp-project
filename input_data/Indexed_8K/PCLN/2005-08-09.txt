Regulation FD Disclosure
 
On August 8, 2005, priceline.com Incorporated announced its financial results for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2005.  A copy of priceline.com's press release announcing these financial results and certain other information is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
 
riceline.com announced that its gross travel bookings, which refers to the total dollar value, inclusive of all taxes and fees, of all travel services purchased by consumers, for the 2 quarter 2005 were $569.5 million, $77.5 million of which were generated from priceline.com's international operations, primarily sales by Active Hotels.
Priceline.com announced revenue of $266.6 million in the 2 quarter 2005, approximately $12 million of which was generated from the company's international operations.  P
nd
nd
 
Priceline.com noted that its "organic" gross travel bookings would have increased approximately 9% in the 2 quarter 2005 when compared to the 2 quarter 2004, assuming that priceline.com owned both Active Hotels, which was acquired in September 2004, and Travelweb, which was acquired in May 2004, during the entire 2 quarter 2004 and excluding the sale of hotels rooms by Travelweb through Orbitz (which was responsible for approximately $18 million and $37 million, respectively, of gross travel bookings during the three and six month periods ending June 30, 2005) (the agreement governing the sale of Travelweb hotel rooms through Orbitz was restructured by the companies at the end of the 2 quarter 2005).  Priceline.com also noted (a) that its international "organic" gross travel bookings would have increased approximately 65% in the 2 quarter 2005 when compared to the 2 quarter 2004, assuming that priceline.com owned Active Hotels during the entire 2 quarter 2004 and (b) that its domestic "organic" gross travel bookings, excluding hotel room sales through Orbitz, increased approximately 3.4% in the 2 quarter 2005 compared to the same period in the prior year.

The company stated that during the 2 quarter 2005 it curtailed some of its television advertisements and diverted some of those dollars towards on-line advertising.  The company noted that this was one of the principal reasons why its 2 quarter 2005 pro forma net income per share results were at the high end of the company's previously announced 2 quarter 2005 guidance, despite a shortfall in 2 quarter pro forma gross profit relative to its previously announced guidance.
nd
nd
nd
nd
 
During the call, priceline.com announced that it expected consolidated advertising expenses of approximately $25 million in the 3 quarter 2005 and expected approximately 65% of that amount to be spent "on-line."  Priceline.com estimated that sales and marketing expenses in the 3 quarter 2005 would be between $10.8 and $11.3 million.  Priceline.com stated that it expected personnel costs to be approximately $10.1 to $10.6 million in the 3 quarter 2005.  With respect to 3 quarter 2005, priceline.com stated it expected general and administrative expenses of approximately $4.7 to $5.2 million, information technology expenses of approximately $2.4 to

rd
rd
$2.7 million, and depreciation and amortization expenses, excluding acquisition related amortization, of approximately $2.6 million.  Priceline.com stated that it expected cash income tax expense of approximately $1.25 million in the 3 quarter 2005 comprised of alternative minimum tax and additional income taxes in Europe.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 NORWALK, Conn., August 8, 2005 . . . Priceline.com Incorporated (Nasdaq: PCLN) today reported its financial results for the 2 quarter 2005, which were consistent with the projected results announced by the company on July 14, 2005.  Gross travel bookings for the quarter were $569.5 million, a 20.3% increase over the same period a year ago.  Gross travel bookings refer to the total dollar value, inclusive of all taxes and fees, of all travel services purchased by consumers.  Revenues in the 2 quarter were $266.6 million, a 2.8% increase over the same period a year ago.  Second quarter 2005 results include the operating results of Active Hotels, acquired in September 2004, and Travelweb, acquired in May 2004.
nd
nd
 
Priceline.com's GAAP gross profit for the 2 quarter 2005 was $65.2 million, up 21.3% over the same period in the previous year, while GAAP net income for the 2 quarter 2005 was $12.4 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, vs. $0.28 in the same period a year ago.

Pro forma net income for the 2 quarter 2005 was $16.8 million, or $0.41 per diluted common share, an increase of 28.1% over the same period in the prior year and exceeding the First Call average analyst estimate of $0.37.  The section below entitled "" provides a definition and information about the use of pro forma financial information used in this press release and the attached financial and statistical supplement reconciles pro forma financial information with priceline.com's financial results under GAAP.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
"Priceline posted strong bottom line results in the second quarter aided by our diverse service offerings and expense controls," said priceline.com President and Chief Executive Officer, Jeffery H. Boyd.  "Solid growth in priceline.com's European operations and the launch of our new U.S. retail hotel service helped drive solid growth in gross travel bookings."
 
Mr. Boyd continued, "In an increasingly competitive online travel market, priceline.com continues to focus on developing new services and markets, offering differentiated products under a distinctive brand, and operating one of the market's most efficient cost structures. The recent acquisitions of U.K. based Active Hotels and Netherlands based Bookings B.V. make Priceline Europe one of Europe's largest and fastest growing online hotel reservation services with a unique combined inventory of approximately 18,000 hotels.  With the launch of our new U.S. retail hotel service last quarter, priceline.com's customers now have more ways to enjoy unique savings for all their travel needs.  Finally, we have established what we believe to be an important new source of customers next year for our opaque services through the marketing partnership with Orbitz, which we announced last quarter.  We believe these initiatives will make significant contributions to our results in the coming quarters."
 
Forward Guidance
 
Looking forward, Mr. Boyd said, "We believe that priceline.com has a unique complement of travel services in the U.S. market, and a leading position among European online hotel reservation services.  Going forward, we plan to build on our strengths in those markets with further service enhancements and advertising support where appropriate.  Also, we intend over time to continue to integrate our global service offerings to make them available to all priceline.com customers, regardless of where they live.  We believe priceline.com is well-positioned to continue building its business through the balance of 2005 and beyond."
 
Priceline.com issued the following guidance for 3 quarter 2005:
rd
Year-over-year increases in gross travel bookings of approximately 35%;
 - 
                 
Year-over-year increase in revenue of approximately 2.5%;
 - 
                 
Year-over-year increase in pro forma gross profit of approximately 40% to 42%; and
 - 
                 
Pro forma net income of between $0.34 to $0.40 per diluted share.
 - 
                 
 
For the full-year 2005, priceline.com said it expects pro forma net income to be in the range of $1.20 to $1.30 per diluted share.
 
A reconciliation of pro forma financial results to GAAP results is included in the attached financial and statistical supplement.  Pro forma gross profit guidance for the 3 quarter 2005 excludes the after-tax effects of non-cash amortization expense of acquisition-related intangibles associated with the acquisition of Travelweb LLC.  Pro forma net income per diluted share guidance for the 3 quarter and full-year 2005 excludes the after-tax effects of non-cash amortization expense of acquisition-related intangibles (primarily associated with the acquisitions of Travelweb and Active Hotels), stock-based compensation expense, option payroll tax expense, and, as applicable, the payment of non-cash preferred stock dividends, which, when aggregated, are expected to total approximately $5.0 million and $17.5 million, respectively.  In addition, pro forma net income per diluted share guidance for the 3 quarter 2005 and full-year 2005 excludes the anticipated impact of EITF 04-08 ("Effect of Contingently Convertible Debt on Diluted Earnings per Share"), which was effective as of December 15, 2004 and which revises the method for calculating diluted shares outstanding for purposes of computing GAAP net income per diluted share.  Finally, pro forma gross profit and pro forma net income per diluted share guidance for the 3 quarter and full-year 2005 excludes the after-tax effects of non-cash amortization expense of acquisition-related intangibles associated with the July 2005 acquisition of Bookings B.V., which the company is unable to forecast at this time without unreasonable effort.

forward-looking statements. The following factors, among others, could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements:
 
 - 
    adverse changes in general market conditions for leisure and  other travel services as the result of, among other things, terrorist attacks;
 
 - 
    adverse changes in the Company's relationships with airlines and other product and  service     providers which could include, without limitation, the withdrawal of suppliers from the priceline.com system (either priceline.com's retai l or "opaque" services, or both):
 
 - 
    the loss or reduction of global distribution fees;
 
 - 
    the bankruptcy or insolvency of another major domestic airline;
 
 - 
    the effects of increased competition, including, without limitation, adverse effects from the continued consolidation of on-line travel intermediaries;
 
 - 
    systems-related failures and/or security breaches;
 
 - 
    difficulties integrating recent acquisitions, such as Active Hotels and Bookings B.V., including, ensuring the effectiveness of the design and operation of internal controls and disclosure controls of acquired businesses;
 
 - 
    legal and regulatory risks; and

For a detailed discussion of these and other factors that could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements, please refer to the Company's most recent Form 10-Q, Form 10-K and Form 8-K filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Unless required by law, the Company undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
 
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
Pro forma gross profit excludes the after-tax effects of non-cash amortization expense of acquisition-related intangibles.  Pro forma net income excludes the after tax effects of non-cash amortization expense of acquisition-related intangibles, stock-based compensation expense, option payroll tax expense and, when applicable, the payment of non-cash preferred stock dividends.  In addition, pro forma net income per share excludes the accounting impact of EITF 04-08 (""), which was effective as of December 15, 2004 and revises the method for calculating diluted shares outstanding for purposes of computing GAAP net income per share.
Effect of Contingently Convertible Debt on Diluted Earnings per Share
 
Pro forma gross profit, pro forma net income and pro forma net income per share are "non-GAAP financial measures," as such term is defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and may differ from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Priceline.com believes that pro forma gross profit, pro forma net income and pro forma net income per share that exclude the after-tax effects of non-cash amortization expense of acquisition-related intangibles are useful for investors to evaluate priceline.com's future on-going performance because they enable a more meaningful comparison of priceline.com's projected cash earnings and performance with its historical results from prior periods.  Stock based compensation expense and the non-cash expense associated with the payment of preferred stock dividends are excluded from pro forma
net income and pro forma net income per share because they do not impact cash earnings and are reflected in earnings per share through increased share counts.  Option payroll tax expense often shows volatility unrelated to operating results since the expense is driven primarily by option exercise activity and the market price of priceline.com's common stock.  Finally, the accounting impact of EITF 04-08 (""), which requires that priceline.com use the "if-converted" method of accounting for convertible debt instruments when calculating earnings per share, has been excluded because the common stock that underly priceline.com's 1% Convertible Senior Notes and priceline.com's 2.25% Convertible Senior Notes are generally not issuable unless our common stock trades at prices of $44.00 per share and $45.54 per share, respectively.
