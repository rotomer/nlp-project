Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
On July 14, 2005, priceline.com ACME Limited (the "Acquirer"), a newly formed, wholly (indirectly) owned English subsidiary of priceline.com Incorporated (the "Company"), entered into a Share Sale and Purchase Agreement with shareholders and option holders of Bookings B.V. ("Bookings"), one of Europe's leading providers of online services for booking hotel reservations.  The Share Sale and Purchase Agreement is described in greater detail in section 2.01 below.
 
Item 2.01.  Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.
 
Pursuant to the Share Sale and Purchase Agreement, the Acquirer acquired 100% of the total issued share capital of Bookings.  The total consideration for all of the Bookings shares was approximately $135 million, including direct acquisition costs and certain post-closing adjustments.  Substantially all of the total consideration for the Bookings shares was paid in available cash.
 
As part of the transaction, the Company, priceline.com International Limited ("New UK Holding"), a newly formed, wholly (indirectly) owned English subsidiary of the Company and direct owner of the Acquirer, and the Acquirer entered into arrangements with six key members of the management of Bookings.  Under these arrangements, the key managers purchased securities in the form of Series C ordinary shares of New UK Holding, representing approximately 6% of the share capital of New UK Holding for a total consideration of approximately 10.6 million (approximately $18.7 million).  In addition, the key managers of Bookings were granted restricted stock units that are payable in Series C ordinary shares of New UK Holding with an aggregate fair market value of approximately $1,000,000.  Subject to certain exceptions, these granted restricted stock units will vest on February 1, 2008.  The restricted stock units will not vest if the manager is not a "good leaver" or no longer a "group" employee at the vesting date.  The definition of "good leaver" includes managers who are dismissed, other than for cause, following a change in control of the Company.
 
As provided in the Articles of Association of New UK Holding, the holders of the Series C ordinary shares have the right to put their shares to the Company (through a wholly (indirectly) owned subsidiary) and the Company (through a wholly (indirectly) owned subsidiary) has the right to call the Series C ordinary shares, in each case at a purchase price reflecting the fair market value of the shares at the time of exercise.  Subject to certain exceptions, one-third of the granted Series C ordinary shares will be subject to the put and call options in each of 2006, 2007 and 2008, respectively, during the relevant annual option exercise period.  Moreover, subject to certain exceptions, all of the Series C ordinary shares issuable under the granted restricted stock units will be subject to put and call options in August 2008.
 
Certain employees of Bookings were also granted an aggregate of 150,000 non-qualified stock options to acquire shares of the common stock of the Company under the priceline.com Incorporated 1999 Omnibus Plan, as amended (the "Plan"). In addition, certain managers of Bookings were granted an aggregate of approximately 54,000 restricted stock units that are payable in common shares of the Company under the Plan.  The grant of these restricted stock units payable in common shares of the Company was in lieu of cash consideration that those managers of Bookings were to be paid under the existing Bookings employee retention plan.  Subject to certain exceptions, including accelerated vesting upon certain events constituting a change of control, the restricted stock units granted pursuant to the Plan will vest ratably over a three-year period, with one-third of the restricted stock units to vest on the first, second and third anniversaries of the date of the grant of such restricted stock units.
 
The restricted stock units of New UK Holding, and the restricted stock units and non-qualified stock options of the Company, were issued to Bookings management as employee compensation arrangements in the ordinary course of business and were not part of the purchase price consideration.
 
The foregoing descriptions of the Share Sale and Purchase Agreement and the Articles of Association of New UK Holding do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by
reference to the complete texts of the agreement and the articles of association which are included as Exhibits 10.1 and 2.1, respectively, and incorporated herein by reference.  The Articles of Association of New UK Holding were amended on September 28, 2005, to reflect modifications made thereto since its inception.  The articles of association, as amended, are filed herewith.

On 1 January 2004, Boekingspunt Nederland B.V. acquired Net47 Holdings  B.V. Afterwards, Boekingspunt Nederland B.V. changed its name to Bookings B.V.

Summary of principal accounting policies for the Company
 
Basis of presentation
 
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the Netherlands (Dutch GAAP).
 
Consolidation
 
The Company owns the following subsidiaries:
 
 
The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of all the above companies, except for the subsidiaries Bookings America's S.A. (Santiago, Chile), Bookings Asia Private Ltd. (Singapore) and Global Bookings Connection B.V., which are accounted for using the equity method.
 
The subsidiaries Bookings America's S.A. (Santiago, Chile) and Bookings Asia Private Ltd. (Singapore) are not consolidated because of the immateriality of the figures.
 
Bookings B.V. has 100% control of the subsidiary Bookings America's S.A. (Santiago, Chile). However, because of legal regulations Bookings B.V. owns only 60% of the shares.
Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.
 
Foreign currencies
 
Assets and liabilities expressed in foreign currencies are converted into euros at rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Transactions in foreign currencies are converted at the rates approximating those in effect at the dates of the transactions. The resulting exchange differences are recognised in the profit and loss account. All consolidated subsidiaries use the EUR as their functional currency.
 
Intangible fixed assets
 
Intangible fixed assets in the consolidated financial statements comprise goodwill arising on the acquisition of Bookings Europe B.V. and business operations, licenses (comprising purchased hotel contracts and intellectual proprietary rights) and software. Goodwill, licenses and software are amortised on a straight-line basis over a period of 3-5 years.
 
Tangible fixed assets
 
Tangible fixed assets are valued at historical cost less depreciation.
 
Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over its expected useful lives as follows:
 
 
Financial fixed assets
 
The item financial fixed assets entails investments in foreign companies which are stated at net equity value and long-term receivables from group companies which are stated at nominal value, less provisions where appropriate. Non consolidated companies are valued against net equity value. Both investments in foreign companies and non consolidated companies are valued against fair values in case of impairment.
 
Trade receivables
 
Trade receivables are stated at nominal value less a bad-debt provision where appropriate.
 
Other assets and liabilities
 
All items are stated at nominal value, except where a different basis of valuation has been indicated in these financial statements.
Sales and expense recognition
 
Sales are net of value added taxes. Sales represent commissions earned from hotels and are recognized upon the moment the hotel reservations have been fulfilled. All costs are recognised on the basis of accrual accounting. Cost of sales represent fees for realized sales through portals of third parties.
 
Corporate income tax
 
Taxes on result are calculated at current income tax rates on the current result. Tax credits and permanent differences between fiscal accounting policies and the Company's accounting policies are taken into account.
 
3
                                        
Intangible fixed assets
 
 
The goodwill has arisen from the acquisition of Bookings Europe B.V.
 
Licenses concern hotel contracts and intellectual property rights for Germany, Belgium and Luxemburg acquired from the seller Internet Bookings Organisation V.O.F., for an amount of EUR 1,150,000. Until 2004, these licenses were amortised on a straight-line basis over a period of 10 years. In 2004, the Company has estimated the remaining useful life of these licenses as less than 1 year. Therefore, the remaining net book value as at 1 January 2004 has been amortised in 2004.

Tangible fixed assets
 
 
5
                                        
Financial fixed assets
 
The subsidiaries Bookings Americas S.A. (Santiago, Chile), Bookings Asia Private Ltd. (Singapore) and Global Bookings Connection B.V. are accounted for using the equity method. Because of continuing negative results and poor expectations, all investments in the mentioned companies including intercompany loans have been revaluated to nil in the past. The Company does not have any commitments or guarantees on the obligations of these entities.

Receivables and other
 
 
The receivable from parent company as at 31 December 2004 includes 5% interest on the average outstanding balance.

Cash
 
 
All cash is available on demand, except for an amount of EUR 65,681 that is restricted with a bank guarantee provided by Rabobank.
 
The balance of the ABN AMRO Bank represents the netted balance with of all consolidated companies. Bookings B.V. and all its Dutch subsidiaries have obtained joint credit facilities from ABN AMRO Bank for an amount of EUR 1,000,000. Nothing is outstanding at the end of 31 December 2004. Tangible fixed assets and receivables are pledged as collateral. Interest rate is based on ABN AMRO Euro Basis Interest (3.25% minimum) plus 175 basis points.

Current liabilities
 
 
License IBO relates to the purchase of intangible fixed assets as referred to in note 3. The payment terms are based on consolidated turnover and solvency of the Company. Annual payments consist of 3% of the consolidated turnover with minimum payments of EUR 84,400 per annum. Connected with this transaction, a bank guarantee for the amount of EUR 90,000 was provided. The Company and its current and potential future subsidiaries have the obligation to pay the total acquisition price of IBO as well as potential buyers of the Company that succeed to the activities of the Bookings concept. The balance as per 31 December 2004 represents the original liability of EUR 1,150,000 less actual payments in 2003 and 2004. In 2005, the remaining part of this liability amounting to EUR 385,107 will be redeemed. Accordingly, this liability has been transferred to the current liabilities.

Commitments
 
The rental commitment of office premises amounts to EUR 0.3 million annually. This rental agreement expires in January 2012. The total rental commitment until January 2012 amounts to approximately EUR 2.1 million
 
In December 2004, Bookings B.V. entered into an agreement with respect to the acquisition of the domain name Booking.com. The transfer of the domain name will take place after the payment of the purchase price of EUR 500,000. Bookings B.V. paid this amount in the beginning of 2005.
 
The Dutch companies are part of the fiscal unity for the corporate income tax of the parent company Blue Sky Investments B.V. Bookings B.V. is therefore jointly and severally liable for the corporate income tax liability of the fiscal entity as a whole.
The Dutch companies are part of the fiscal unity for VAT of the parent company Blue Sky Investments B.V. Bookings B.V. is therefore jointly and severally liable for the VAT liability of the fiscal unity as a whole.

Personnel expenses

13
                                 
Corporate income tax
 
 
Management has the expectation, that the change in accounting policies regarding the amortisation of licences will be accepted by the tax authorities. Therefore, no deferred tax position has been taken into account. No provisions have been made for discussions with the tax authorities as management is confident about the outcome.
 
The discussed items concern the write-off of licenses for the Australian/African areas in 2001 amounting to EUR 213,159 and the write-off of loans to consolidated (foreign) companies amounting to EUR 279,246 (up to and including 2001).
 
14
                                 
Summary of differences between the accounting principles generally accepted in the Netherlands and the United States of America as they affect the Company's financial statements
 
The consolidated financial statements of Bookings B.V. and subsidiaries were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the Netherlands (Dutch GAAP), which differs in certain respects from generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (US GAAP).
 
The following is a summary of the adjustments to shareholders' equity and net income which would have been required if US GAAP had been applied instead of Dutch GAAP.
 
Net income for the year ended 31 December 2004 under US GAAP would be as follows versus that reported under Dutch GAAP.
 
 
(a) Keyword Marketing Costs
 
Under Dutch GAAP, a portion of keyword marketing costs have been capitalized and then expensed in future periods to match the costs with sales.Under US GAAP, these expenditures are considered period costs and are expensed as incurred. The adjustment recognizes the impact under US GAAP of not capitalizing the keyword marketing costs at the balance sheet date as well as the effect on net profit (loss) of expensing such costs as incurred.
 
(b) Consolidate subsidiary
 
The consolidated financial statements do not include the Company's wholly owned subsidiary, Bookings Asia Private Ltd. (Singapore), because of the immateriality of the figures. The subsidiary is accounted for using the equity method. However, because of continuing negative results and poor expectations, the company has been revaluated to nil prior to 2004. Under US GAAP, majority owned or controlled subsidiaries are consolidated. The adjustment recognizes the impact under US GAAP of consolidating Bookings Asia Private Ltd. (Singapore) at the balance sheet date as well as the effect on net profit (loss) of recording a provision under Dutch GAAP in 2003, which represented the estimated costs of liquidating Bookings Asia Private Ltd. (Singapore). The decision to liquidate Bookings Asia Private Ltd. (Singapore) was taken in 2004 at which point, the costs of liquidating are recorded for US GAAP purposes. The net adjustment to equity at 31 December 2004 amounting to EUR 14,252 represents the remaining net realizable assets of Bookings Asia Private Ltd. (Singapore).
 
Push-down accounting of Bookings B.V.
(c) 
 
In 2003 Blue Sky Investments B.V. acquired Bookings B.V., whereby Bookings B.V. became a wholly owned subsidiary of Blue Sky Investments B.V. As permitted under Dutch GAAP, Bookings B.V. did not apply pushdown accounting on its separate financial statements. Under US Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin 54 "," Bookings B.V. is required to apply pushdown accounting as a result of the acquisition.
Application of "Pushdown" Basis of Accounting in Financial Statements of Subsidiaries Acquired by Purchase
The purchase price of the acquisition was approximately EUR 10.1 million, paid by cash of EUR 8,1 million and stock. Based on an independent valuation, the Company allocated EUR 0.4 million to net assets, EUR 4.3 million as Goodwill and EUR 7.8 million as identified intangibles, including supply and distribution relationships, customer lists, tradenames and internal use software. The acquired intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of three months to thirteen years. The deferred tax regarding the identified intangibles amounts to EUR 2.4 million.
 
This adjustment recognizes the impact under US GAAP of applying push down accounting at the balance sheet date as well as the effect on net profit (loss) of the incremental amortization of the intangibles therein compared to the amortization as historically recorded for the respective periods.
 
(d) Capitalization of internal use software costs
 
Dutch GAAP permits internal use software development costs to be expensed as incurred. Under US GAAP, Statement of Position 98-1 Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use provides guidance on accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use. This adjustment recognizes under US GAAP, the impact of capitalizing the costs of computer software developed for internal use at the balance sheet date as well as the effect on net income (loss) of such capitalization and the related amortization therein for the year.
 
(e) Receivable from parent company
 
The parent company Blue Sky Investments B.V. is a holding company, whose principal asset is the investment in Bookings B.V. Accordingly this receivable from parent company is classified as a reduction of shareholders' equity for US GAAP purposes.
 
(f) Cumulative tax effect of US GAAP differences
 
The adjustment recognizes the tax impact of the various identified adjustments to reconcile between Dutch GAAP and US GAAP at the balance sheet date as well as the effect on net profit (loss). The tax effect is recorded at the statutory tax rate in effect for the Netherlands of 31.5%. The adjustment related to Bookings Asia Private Ltd. (Singapore) is not tax effected as the resulting benefit is not likely to be realized. Goodwill related to the push-down accounting of Bookings B.V. is also not tax effected.
 
Presentation and classification differences
 
Consolidated balance sheet
 
The format of a consolidated balance sheet prepared in accordance with Dutch GAAP differs in certain respects from US GAAP. Dutch GAAP requires assets to be presented in ascending order of liquidity, whereas under US GAAP such assets are presented in descending order of liquidity.
Consolidated cash flow statement
 
The format of a consolidated cash flow statement prepared in accordance with Dutch GAAP differs in certain respects from US GAAP. Under Dutch GAAP movements in restricted cash is shown as change in the cash and bank position, whereas under US GAAP such change is shown as investing activity.

Subsequent events
 
On 14 July 14 2005, priceline.com ACME Limited (the "Acquirer"), a newly formed, wholly (indirectly) owned English subsidiary of priceline.com Incorporated, entered into a Share Sale and Purchase Agreement with shareholders and option holders of Bookings B.V. On 14 July 2005, pursuant to the Share Sale and Purchase Agreement, the Acquirer acquired 100% of the total issued share capital of Bookings B.V.
 
In March 2005 a dividend amounting to EUR 1,500,000 has been distributed to the shareholder of Bookings B.V. This dividend has been adjusted against the receivable from parent company.
Independent auditors' report
 
To Board of Directors of Bookings B.V.
 
 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Bookings B.V. (formerly known as Boekingspunt Nederland B.V.) and subsidiaries as at 31 December 2004 and the related consolidated profit and loss account and cash flows for the year then ended. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit.
 
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall consolidated financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
 
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Bookings B.V. and subsidiaries as at 31 December 2004 and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the year then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the Netherlands.
 
Accounting principles generally accepted in the Netherlands vary in certain significant respects from accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Information relating to the nature and effect of such differences is presented in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.

Intangible fixed assets
 
The goodwill has arisen from the acquisition of Bookings Europe B.V.  Bookings B.V. acquired the domain name Booking.com in the beginning of 2005 for EUR 502,500.
 
Licenses concern acquired hotel contracts and intellectual property rights for the areas Germany, Belgium and Luxemburg from the seller Internet Bookings Organisation V.O.F., for an amount of EUR 1,150,000. Until 2004, these licenses were amortised on a straight-line basis over a period of 10 years. During 2004 management elected to change its method of accounting to amortisation based on the sales in the areas related to these licenses. As a consequence, the amortisation of the licenses for the six months ended 30 June 2005, amounts to EUR 0.

Corporate income tax
 
 
The Company is part of a fiscal unity with its parent, Blue Sky Investments B.V. for corporation income tax purposes.

Therefore, no deferred tax position has been taken into account. No provisions have been made for discussions with the tax authorities as management is confident about the outcome.
 
The discussed items concern the write-off of licenses for the Australian/African areas in 2001 amounting to EUR 213,159 and the write-off of loans to consolidated (foreign) companies amounting to EUR 279,246 (up to and including 2001).

Summary of the differences between the accounting principles generally accepted in the Netherlands and the United States of America as they affect the Company's financial statements
 
The consolidated financial statements of Bookings B.V. and subsidiaries were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the Netherlands (Dutch GAAP), which differs in certain respects from generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (US GAAP).
The following is a summary of the adjustments to shareholders' equity and net income which would have been required if US GAAP had been applied instead of Dutch GAAP.
 
 
Net profit (loss) for the six-month periods ended 30 June 2005 and 2004 under US GAAP would be as follows versus that reported under Dutch GAAP:
 
 
(a) Keyword Marketing Costs
 
Under Dutch GAAP, a portion of keyword marketing costs have been capitalized and then expensed in future periods to match the costs with sales.Under US GAAP, these expenditures are considered period costs and are expensed as incurred.  The adjustment recognizes the impact under US GAAP of not capitalizing the keyword marketing costs at the balance sheet date as well as the effect on net profit (loss) of expensing such costs as incurred.
 
 
(b) Consolidate subsidiary
 
The consolidated financial statements do not include the Company's wholly owned subsidiary, Bookings Asia Private Ltd. (Singapore), because of the immateriality of the figures. The subsidiary is accounted for using the equity method. However, because of continuing negative results and poor expectations, the company has been revaluated to nil prior to 2004. Under US GAAP, majority owned or controlled subsidiaries are consolidated. The adjustment recognizes the impact under US GAAP of consolidating Bookings Asia Private Ltd. (Singapore) at the balance sheet date, as well as the effect on net profit (loss) of recording a provision under Dutch GAAP in 2003, which represented the estimated costs of liquidating Bookings Asia Private Ltd. (Singapore).  The decision to liquidate Bookings Asia Private Ltd. (Singapore) was taken in 2004 at which point, the costs of liquidating are recorded for US GAAP purposes. The net adjustment to equity at 30 June 2005 amounting to EUR 14,252 represents the remaining net realizable assets of Bookings Asia Private Ltd. (Singapore).
(c) Pushdown accounting of Bookings B.V.
 
In 2003 Blue Sky Investments B.V. acquired Bookings B.V., whereby Bookings B.V. became a wholly owned subsidiary of Blue Sky Investments B.V. As permitted under Dutch GAAP, Bookings B.V. did not apply pushdown accounting on its separate financial statements. Under US Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin 54 "," Bookings B.V. is required to apply pushdown accounting as a result of the acquisition.
Application of "Pushdown" Basis of Accounting in Financial Statements of Subsidiaries Acquired by Purchase
 
The purchase price of the acquisition was approximately EUR 10.1 million, paid by cash of EUR 8.1 million and stock. Based on an independent valuation, the Company allocated EUR 0.4 million to net assets, EUR 4.3 million as Goodwill and EUR 7.8 million as identified intangibles, including supply and distribution relationships, customer lists, tradenames and internal use software. The acquired intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of three months to thirteen years. The deferred tax regarding the identified intangibles amounts to EUR 2.4 million.
 
This adjustment recognizes the impact under US GAAP of applying push down accounting at the balance sheet date as well as the effect on net profit (loss) of the incremental amortization of the intangibles therein compared to the amortization as historically recorded for the respective periods.
 
(d) Capitalization of internal use software costs
 
Dutch GAAP permits internal use software development costs to be expensed as incurred. Under US GAAP, Statement of Position 98-1 provides guidance on accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use.  This adjustment recognizes under US GAAP, the impact of capitalizing the costs of computer software developed for internal use at the balance sheet date as well as the effect on net income (loss) of such capitalization and the related amortization therein for the period.
Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use
 
(e) Cumulative tax effect of US GAAP differences
 
The adjustment recognizes the tax impact of the various identified adjustments to reconcile between Dutch GAAP and US GAAP at the balance sheet date as well as the effect on net profit (loss).  The tax effect is recorded at the statutory tax rate in effect for the Netherlands of 31.5%.  The adjustment related to the Company's Asian subsidiary is not tax effected as the resulting benefit is not likely to be realized.  Goodwill related to the push-down accounting of Bookings B.V. is also not tax effected.
Presentation and classification differences
 
Consolidated balance sheet
 
The format of a consolidated balance sheet prepared in accordance with Dutch GAAP differs in certain respects from US GAAP. Dutch GAAP requires assets to be presented in ascending order of liquidity, whereas under US GAAP such assets are presented in descending order of liquidity.
 
Consolidated cash flow statement
 
The format of a consolidated cash flow statement prepared in accordance with Dutch GAAP differs in certain respects from US GAAP. Under Dutch GAAP movements in restricted cash is shown as change in the cash and bank position, whereas under US GAAP such change is shown as investing activity.

Subsequent events
 
On 14 July 2005, priceline.com ACME Limited (the "Acquirer"), a newly formed, wholly (indirectly) owned English subsidiary of priceline.com Incorporated, entered into a Share Sale and Purchase Agreement with shareholders and option holders of Bookings B.V. On 14 July 2005, pursuant to the Share Sale and Purchase Agreement, the Acquirer acquired 100% of the total issued share capital of Bookings B.V.
 
Introduction
 
On July 14, 2005, priceline.com ACME Limited (the "Acquirer"), a newly formed, wholly (indirectly) owned English subsidiary of priceline.com Incorporated (the "Company"), entered into a Share Sale and Purchase Agreement with shareholders and option holders of Bookings B.V. ("Bookings"), one of Europe's leading providers of online services for booking hotel reservations.
 
Pursuant to the Share Sale and Purchase Agreement, the Acquirer acquired 100% of the total issued share capital of Bookings.  The total consideration for all of the Bookings shares was approximately $135 million, including direct acquisition costs and certain post-closing adjustments.  Substantially all of the total consideration for the Bookings shares was paid in available cash.
 
As part of the transaction, the Company, priceline.com International Limited ("New UK Holding"), a newly formed, wholly (indirectly) owned English subsidiary of the Company and direct owner of the Acquirer, and the Acquirer entered into arrangements with 6 key members of the management of Bookings.  Under these arrangements, the key managers purchased securities in the form of Series C ordinary shares of New UK Holding, representing approximately 6% of the share capital of New UK Holding for a total consideration of approximately 10.6 million (approximately $18.7 million).  In addition, the key managers of Bookings were granted restricted stock units that are payable in Series C ordinary shares of New UK Holding with an aggregate fair market value of approximately $1,000,000.  Subject to certain exceptions, these granted restricted stock units will vest on February 1, 2008.  The restricted stock units will not vest if the manager is not a "good leaver" or no longer a "group" employee at the vesting date.  The definition of "good leaver" includes managers who are dismissed, other than for cause, following a change in control of the Company.
 
As provided in the Articles of Association of New UK Holding, the holders of the Series C ordinary shares have the right to put their shares to the Company (through a wholly (indirectly) owned subsidiary) and the Company (through a wholly (indirectly) owned subsidiary) has the right to call the Series C ordinary shares, in each case at a purchase price reflecting the fair market value of the shares at the time of exercise.  Subject to certain exceptions, one-third of the granted Series C ordinary shares will be subject to the put and call options in each of 2006, 2007 and 2008, respectively, during the relevant annual option exercise period.  Moreover, subject to certain exceptions, all of the Series C ordinary shares issuable under the granted restricted stock units will be subject to put and call options in August 2008.
 
Certain employees of Bookings were also granted an aggregate of 150,000 non-qualified stock options to acquire shares of the common stock of the Company under the priceline.com Incorporated 1999 Omnibus Plan, as amended (the "Plan"). In addition, certain managers of Bookings were granted an aggregate of approximately 54,000 restricted stock units that are payable in common shares of the Company under the Plan.  The grant of these restricted stock units payable in common shares of the Company was in lieu of cash consideration that those managers of Bookings were to be paid under the existing Bookings employee retention plan.  Subject to certain exceptions, including accelerated vesting upon certain events constituting a change of control, the restricted stock units granted pursuant to the Plan will vest ratably over a three-year period, with one-third of the restricted stock units to vest on the first, second and third anniversaries of the date of the grant of such restricted stock units.
 
The restricted stock units of New UK Holding, and the restricted stock units and non-qualified stock options of the Company, were issued to Bookings management as employee compensation arrangements in the ordinary course of business and were not part of the purchase price consideration.
The Company accounted for the acquisition using the purchase method of accounting.  The Company's cost to acquire Bookings has been allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed according to their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition.  The accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of June 30, 2005, combines the historical consolidated balance sheets of the Company and Bookings, giving effect to the acquisition as though it occurred on June 30, 2005.  The accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2004 and for the six months ended June 30, 2005, combines the historical consolidated statements of operations of the Company and Bookings, giving effect to the acquisition of Bookings as if the transaction had occurred on January 1, 2004.  The Company made pro forma adjustments to the historical consolidated financial information to give effect to events that are (i) directly attributable to the acquisition, (ii) expected to have a continuing impact on the combined results, and (iii) factually supportable.  The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Statement of Operations excludes amortization expense attributed to the estimated fair value of sales backlog acquired since the adjustment is non-recurring in nature.  The Company will amortize the estimated fair value of sales backlog acquired amounting to $0.6 million over three months from the acquisition date in its consolidated financial statements.
 
The pro forma financial information should be read in conjunction with the:

7.1
          
exempt from the provisions of this Article 7.  The Company's lien on a share shall extend to any amount payable in respect of it.
 
The Company may sell in such manner as the directors determine any shares on which the Company has a lien if a sum in respect of which the lien exists is presently payable and is not paid within fourteen clear days after notice has been given to the holder of the share or to the person entitled to it in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of the holder, demanding payment and stating that if the notice is not complied with the shares may be sold.
7.2
          
 
To give effect to a sale the directors may authorise some person to execute an instrument of transfer of the shares sold to, or in accordance with the directions of, the purchaser.

7.3
          
 
The net proceeds of the sale, after payment of the costs, shall be applied in payment of so much of the sum for which the lien exists as is presently payable, and any residue shall (upon surrender to the Company for cancellation of the certificate for the shares sold and subject to a like lien for any moneys not presently payable as existed upon the shares before the sale) be paid to the person entitled to the shares at the date of the sale.
7.4
          
 
8.
            
CALLS ON SHARES AND FORFEITURE
 
Subject to the terms of allotment, the directors may make calls upon the members in respect of any moneys unpaid on their shares (whether in respect of nominal value or premium) and each member shall (subject to receiving at least fourteen clear days' notice specifying when and where payment is to be made) pay to the Company as required by the notice the amount called on his shares.  A call may be required to be paid by instalments.  A call may, before receipt by the Company of any sum due thereunder, be revoked in whole or part and payment of a call may be postponed in whole or part.  A person upon whom a call is made shall remain liable for calls made upon him notwithstanding the subsequent transfer of the shares in respect whereof the call was made.
8.1
          
 
A call shall be deemed to have been made at the time when the resolution of the directors authorising the call was passed.
8.2
          
 
The joint holders of a share shall be jointly and severally liable to pay all calls in respect thereof.
8.3
          
 
If a call remains unpaid after it has become due and payable, the person from whom it is due and payable shall pay interest on the amount unpaid from the day it became due and payable until it is paid and shall also pay all costs and expenses incurred by the Company as determined by the directors in order to procure payment of the sums due or in consequence of the non-payment of such sums.  The rate of interest shall be the rate fixed by the terms of allotment of the share or in the notice of the call or, if no rate is fixed, at the appropriate rate (as defined by the Act) but the directors may waive payment of the interest, costs and expenses wholly or in part.
8.4
          
 
An amount payable in respect of a share on allotment or at any fixed date, whether in respect of nominal value or premium or as an instalment of a call, shall be deemed to be a call and if it is not paid the provisions of the Articles shall apply as if that amount had become due and payable by virtue of a call.
8.5
          
 
Subject to the terms of allotment, the directors may make arrangements on the issue of shares for a difference between the holders in the amounts and times of payment of calls on their shares.
8.6
          
 
The directors may, if they think fit, receive from any member willing to advance the same all or any part of the moneys uncalled and unpaid upon any shares held by him, and upon all or any of the moneys so advanced may (until the same would, but for such advance, become payable) pay
8.7
          
interest at such rate as may be agreed upon between the directors and the member paying such sum in advance.
 
If a call remains unpaid after it has become due and payable, the directors may give to the person from whom it is due not less than fourteen clear days' notice requiring payment of the amount unpaid together with any interest which may have accrued plus expenses or costs determined in accordance with Article 8.7.  The notice shall name the place where payment is to be made and shall state that if the notice is not complied with the shares in respect of which the call was made will be liable to be forfeited.
8.8
          
 
If the notice is not complied with any share in respect of which it was given may, before the payment required by the notice has been made, be forfeited by a resolution of the directors and the forfeiture shall include all dividends or other moneys payable in respect of the forfeited shares and not paid before the forfeiture.
8.9
          
 
Subject to the provisions of the Act, a forfeited share may be sold, re-allotted or otherwise disposed of on such terms and in such manner as the directors determine either to the person who was before the forfeiture the holder or to any other person and at any time before sale, re-allotment or other disposition, the forfeiture may be cancelled on such terms as the directors think fit.  Where for the purposes of its disposal a forfeited share is to be transferred to any person the directors may authorise some person to execute an instrument of transfer of the share to that person.
8.10
        
 
A person any of whose shares have been forfeited shall cease to be a member in respect of them and shall surrender to the Company for cancellation the certificate for the shares forfeited but shall remain liable to the Company for all moneys which at the date of forfeiture were presently payable by him to the Company in respect of those shares with interest at the rate at which interest was payable on those moneys before the forfeiture or, if no interest was so payable, at the appropriate rate (as defined in the Act) plus costs and expenses from the date of forfeiture until payment but the directors may waive payment wholly or in part or enforce payment without any allowance for the value of the shares at the time of forfeiture or for any consideration received on their disposal.
8.11
        
 
A statutory declaration by a director or the secretary that a share has been forfeited on a specified date shall be conclusive evidence of the facts stated in it as against all persons claiming to be entitled to the share and the declaration shall (subject to the execution of an instrument of transfer if necessary) constitute a good title to the share and the person to whom the share is disposed of shall not be bound to see to the application of the consideration, if any, nor shall his title to the share be affected by any irregularity in or invalidity of the proceedings in reference to the forfeiture or disposal of the share.
8.12
        
 
9.

PROCEDURE FOR EXERCISE OF PUT AND CALL OPTION
 
An Exercise Notice shall constitute a legally binding contract between the relevant B Ordinary Shareholder or C Ordinary Shareholder and the A Ordinary Shareholder for the sale and purchase of the entire legal and beneficial interest in the number of shares specified in the
13.1
        
Exercise Notice free from any claim, charge, lien or encumbrance, and with all rights attached thereto at the Completion Date (as defined in Article 13.9).
 
Subject to Article 13.3 below, where the Option Price is to be the Fair Market Value, such Fair Market Value shall be the price per share as at the date of the most recent Valuation Report as being in the directors' opinion the fair value of a share as between a willing seller and a willing buyer (with no discount to reflect the unquoted status of the shares) provided that the directors, in determining the fair value of such shares shall:
13.2
        
 
determine the sum which a willing buyer would offer to a willing seller for the whole of the issued share capital of the Company;
(a)
          
 
divide the resultant figure by the number of issued shares (assuming that all outstanding options or rights to acquire shares have been exercised in full (whether or not yet exercisable) and assuming that any shares in respect of which the Company has granted acquisition rights to employees or directors of the Company pursuant to any employees' share scheme have been allotted and assuming that any Granted Securities in the Company have Vested);
(b)
          
 
base their valuation on the latest Accounts of the Company and any projections or forecasts prepared by the directors, and for the avoidance of doubt the directors shall not base their valuation on any financial statements, projections or forecasts prepared by any other person which have not been first approved by a simple majority of the directors of the Company,
(c)
          
 
but so that there shall be no addition or subtracting of any premium or discount arising in relation to the size of the holding the subject of the relevant transfer, or in relation to any restrictions on the transferability of the shares arising only out of the provisions of the Articles and provided further that the directors shall take into account in relation to determining the appropriate figure for Article 13.2 above any offer from any third party to purchase the entire issued share capital the subject of an Exercise Notice.
bona fide
 
If (i) any B Ordinary Shareholder ceases to be an employee of a Group Company for whatever reason and (ii) the A Ordinary Shareholder elects to exercise the Call Option pursuant to Article 11.1(b) above, the Option Price shall be the Option Price of the shares referred to in the relevant Exercise Notice as at the date of the most recent Valuation Report, provided that if:
13.3
        
 
the most recent Valuation Report was delivered to the parties on or before the date which is four months prior to the service of the Call Exercise Notice on the relevant B Ordinary Shareholder, the A Ordinary Shareholder shall arrange for the directors to prepare an updated Valuation Report and serve it on the parties and the Option Price as set out in such updated Valuation Report shall be the relevant Option Price for the purposes of this Article 13.3; or
(a)
          
 
the Call Exercise Notice is exercised within four months of the service of the most recent Valuation Report on the relevant B Ordinary Shareholder and (ii) an event or circumstance has occurred since the most recent Valuation Report such that the Fair Market Value of the Shares as set out in the most recent Valuation Report does not correspond to the Fair Market Value of the Shares as at the date of service of the relevant Call Exercise Notice, the A Ordinary Shareholder or the holders of a majority of the B Ordinary Shares may arrange for the directors to prepare an updated Valuation Report and serve it on the parties and the Option Price as set out in such updated Valuation Report shall be the relevant Option Price for the purposes of this Article 13.3.
(b)
          
The directors shall prepare the Valuation Report, which shall set out the Fair Market Value of the Shares as at the date of the Valuation Report and shall serve the Valuation Report on:
13.4
        
 
the A Ordinary Shareholder and the B Ordinary Shareholders, on or about 20 March 2006, 20 March 2007, and 20 March 2008 respectively; and
(a)
          
 
the A Ordinary Shareholder and the C Ordinary Shareholders on or shortly after 3 August 2006, 3 August 2007, and 3 August 2008 respectively.
(b)
          
 
The Fair Market Value of the shares as set out in the Valuation Report shall be final and binding on the parties, save that if:
13.5
        
 
the holders of a majority of the B Ordinary Shares (with respect to a Valuation Report relating to the B Ordinary Shares); or
(a)
          
 
the holders of a majority of the C Ordinary Shares (with respect to a Valuation Report relating to the C Ordinary Shares),
(b)
          
 
but excluding for purposes of calculating the said majorities any B or C Ordinary Shares which have been previously acquired pursuant to the exercise of Put or Call Options, serve notice on the A Ordinary Shareholder that the Fair Market Value as set out in the relevant Valuation Report does not, in their opinion reflect the true Fair Market Value of the shares, either party may within 10 Business Days of the date of such notice refer the matter to the Arbitrator.
 
Within 20 Business Days of referral of the matter to the Arbitrator pursuant to Article 13.5 above, each of the A Ordinary Shareholder and the relevant B Ordinary Shareholder or C Ordinary Shareholder shall submit to the Arbitrator its own determination of the Fair Market Value of the shares specified in the Exercise Notice, including an explanation of the basis of its valuation, the methodology applied and key assumptions used.  As soon as reasonably practicable thereafter, the Arbitrator will determine and notify the parties in writing which of the two parties' valuation (the "Closer Valuation") more closely reflects in the opinion of the Arbitrator the Fair Market Value of the shares specified in the Exercise Notice and the Closer Valuation shall be deemed to be Fair Market Value for the purposes of determining the Option Price for such shares.
13.6
        
 
The decision of the Arbitrator shall, save in the case of manifest error, be final and binding on the A Ordinary Shareholder and the relevant B Ordinary Shareholder or C Ordinary Shareholder.  The costs incurred by the Arbitrator shall be borne by the party whose valuation is not adopted by the Arbitrator as reflecting the Fair Market Value of the shares specified in the Exercise Notice.
13.7
        
 
The parties shall use all reasonable endeavours to appoint PwC as the Arbitrator within 14 days of the service of any notice pursuant to Articles 13.5 and 13.17 or such later date as the parties may agree.  If PwC shall not agree to accept such appointment, the Arbitrator shall be appointed by agreement between the parties or, if they do not so agree within 7 days of the service of such notice, the appointment shall be made by the President, for the time being, of the Institute of Chartered Accountants on the application of either party.
13.8
        
 
Completion of the sale and purchase of the shares (or, in the case of the partial exercise of an Option, the number of the shares referred to in the relevant Exercise Notice) ("Completion") shall take place at the offices of the Company on either (i) the date specified in the relevant Exercise Notice being no less than 10 and no more than 12 Business Days after service of the relevant Exercise Notice or (ii) in the event that the matter is referred to the Arbitrator in accordance with Article 13.6, the date being 10 Business Days after the date upon which the Arbitrator publishes its decision (the "Completion Date").
13.9
        
At Completion, the relevant B Ordinary Shareholder or C Ordinary Shareholder shall deliver or procure the delivery to the A Ordinary Shareholder of:
13.10
      
 
a duly executed transfer or transfers in respect of the number of the shares referred to in the relevant Exercise Notice in favour of the A Ordinary Shareholder or such person(s) as the A Ordinary Shareholder may direct;
(a)
          
 
the share certificate(s) representing the shares referred to in the relevant Exercise Notice (or an express indemnity in a form reasonably satisfactory to the A Ordinary Shareholder in the case of any share certificate(s) found to be missing); and
(b)
          
 
such other documents as may be necessary to enable the A Ordinary Shareholder or its nominee(s) to obtain a good title to the shares referred to in the relevant Exercise Notice.
(c)
          
 
Subject to compliance by the relevant B Ordinary Shareholder or C Ordinary Shareholder with its obligations set out in Article 13.10, on Completion the A Ordinary Shareholder will pay to the relevant B Ordinary Shareholder or C Ordinary Shareholder the Option Price.  The Option Price shall be satisfied in cash.
13.11
      
 
Until the Completion Date, the relevant B Ordinary Shareholder or C Ordinary Shareholder shall be entitled to exercise all voting and other rights attached to the shares referred to in the relevant Exercise Notice and shall be entitled to receive and retain all dividends and other distributions in respect of the shares.
13.12
      
 
If any of the events in Article 13.14 occurs, such adjustments (if any) shall be made as may be required to the number and/or description of the shares and/or to the Option Price so as to preserve as far as possible the equivalent economic value of the rights of the parties immediately prior to the relevant event having regard to any diluting or concentrating effect of the relevant event and the redesignation of, or replacement with any other securities of, the shares.
13.13
      
 
The events referred to in Article 13.13 are the occurrence of any of the following in relation to the shares:
13.14

the consolidation, amalgamation or merger of the Company with or into another entity (other than a consolidation, amalgamation or merger following which the Company is the surviving entity and which does not result in any reclassification of, or change in, the shares); or
(d)
          
 
any event in respect of the shares analogous to any of the foregoing events or otherwise having a diluting or concentrating effect on the market value of the shares.
(e)
          
 
Any adjustment made in accordance with Article 13.13 shall have effect from the date of the relevant event in Article 13.14.
13.15
      
The nature of any adjustment required to be made in accordance with Article 13.13 shall be determined by the directors of the Company within 10 Business Days of the occurrence of any of the events referred to in Article 13.13 above, save that if the holders of a majority of the B Ordinary Shares serve notice on the A Ordinary Shareholder that the adjustment determined by the directors pursuant to this Article 13.16 does not, in their opinion reflect the true adjustment that is required, either party may within 10 Business Days of the date of such notice refer the matter to the Arbitrator.
13.16
      
 
Articles 10 to 13 shall only be amended with the consent of the holders of a majority of each of the B Ordinary Shares and the C Ordinary Shares.

15.1

The Seller shall give notice to the Company of:

PRE-EMPTION TRANSFERS
 
No member (or person entitled by transmission) shall transfer or dispose of or agree to transfer or dispose of or grant any interest or right in any B Ordinary Share or C Ordinary Share (hereinafter a "transferor") without first offering the same for transfer to the A Ordinary Shareholder and A1 Ordinary Shareholder.  Such offer may be in respect of all or part only of the B Ordinary Shares or C Ordinary Shares held by the proposing transferor and shall be made by the proposing transferor by the giving in writing of a notice to the Company (a "Transfer Notice").
16.1
        
 
Each Transfer Notice shall specify the number and class of shares offered (the "Sale Shares") and (unless the Transfer Notice is deemed given as provided by these Articles) the price per share at which the Sale Shares are offered (the "Specified Price") and the identity(ies) of the proposed transferee(s) (if any) and it shall constitute the directors as the agent of the proposed transferor for the sale of the Sale Shares to the A Ordinary Shareholder and/or A1 Ordinary Shareholder.
16.2
        
 
Upon receipt by the Company of the Transfer Notice the directors shall forthwith give written notice to the A Ordinary Shareholder and A1 Ordinary Shareholder of the number and description of the Sale Shares and the Specified Price and the identity(ies) of the proposed transferee(s) (if any) inviting each of such holders to state by notice in writing to the
16.3
        
Company within 60 days whether he is willing to purchase any of the Sale Shares and, if so, what maximum number of the Sale Shares ("Maximum") he is willing to purchase, and shall also forthwith give a copy of such notice to the proposing transferor.
 
Within 30 days of the expiration of the said period of 60 days the directors shall allocate to the A Ordinary Shareholder and/or A1 Ordinary Shareholder the Maximum, provided that if the Maximum stated in all notices served pursuant to Article 16.3 exceeds the aggregate number of Sale Shares, the number of shares to be allocated to each A Ordinary Shareholder and/or A1 Ordinary Shareholder shall be scaled down pro rata to the size of the Maximum set forth in the notice.
16.4
        
 
Forthwith upon such allocation being made, the A Ordinary Shareholder and/or A1 Ordinary Shareholder shall be bound to pay to the Company (as agent for the proposing transferor) the total sale proceeds for the transfer of the number of shares allocated to the A Ordinary Shareholder and/or A1 Ordinary Shareholder pursuant to Article 16.4 at the price per share equal to the Specified Price (the "Proceeds") and each A Ordinary Shareholder and/or A1 Ordinary Shareholder shall accept a transfer of such number of shares and the proposing transferor shall be bound forthwith upon payment of the Proceeds to deliver to the Company (as agent for the A Ordinary Shareholder and/or A1 Ordinary Shareholder) such documents as are required to transfer such shares to the A Ordinary Shareholder and/or A1 Ordinary Shareholder.
16.5
        
 
If in any case the proposing transferor, after having become bound to transfer Sale Shares as aforesaid makes default in so doing the Company may receive the Proceeds and the directors may appoint some person to execute instruments of transfer of such Sale Shares in favour of the A Ordinary Shareholder and/or A1 Ordinary Shareholder and shall thereupon, subject to such transfers being properly stamped, cause the name of the A Ordinary Shareholder and/or A1 Ordinary Shareholder to be entered in the Register of Members as the holder of those Sale Shares allocated to him as aforesaid and shall hold the Proceeds in trust for the proposing transferor.  The issue of a receipt by the Company therefore shall be a good discharge to the A Ordinary Shareholder and/or A1 Ordinary Shareholder and after its name shall have been entered in the Register of Members in exercise of the aforesaid power the validity of the transactions shall not be questioned by any person.
16.6
        
 
If, at the expiration of the period of 30 days referred to in Article 16.4 above, any of the Sale Shares have not been allocated in accordance with the provisions of Article 16.6, the proposing transferor may at any time within a period of 60 days after the expiration of the said period of 30 days referred to in Article 16.4 above transfer such unallocated Sale Shares to the proposed transferee(s) (if any) specified in the Transfer Notice, or to any other person at any price per Share not being less than the Specified Price provided that the Board may require to be satisfied on reasonable grounds that such unallocated Sale Shares are being transferred in pursuance of a bona fide sale for the consideration stated in the transfer without any deduction, rebate or allowance whatsoever to the transferee and if not so satisfied may refuse to register the instrument of transfer.

TRANSMISSION OF SHARES
 
If a member dies the survivor or survivors where he was a joint holder, and his personal representatives where he was a sole holder or the only survivor of joint holders, shall be the only persons recognised by the Company as having any title to his interest; but nothing herein contained shall release the estate of a deceased member from any liability in respect of any share which had been jointly held by him.
17.1
        
 
A person becoming entitled to a share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of a member may, upon such evidence being produced as the directors may properly require, elect either to become the holder of the share or to have some person nominated by him registered as the
17.2
        
transferee.  If the person so becoming entitled shall elect to become registered as the holder he shall give notice to the Company to that effect.  If he elects to have another person registered he shall execute an instrument of transfer of the share to that person.  All the Articles relating to the transfer of shares shall apply to the notice or instrument of transfer as if it were an instrument of transfer executed by the member and the death or bankruptcy of the member had not occurred.  The provisions of this Article shall apply to any person becoming entitled to a share in consequence of the merger or consolidation of any member being a corporation as they apply to any person becoming entitled to a share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of a member.
 
A person becoming entitled to a share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of a member shall have the rights to which he would be entitled if he were the holder of the share, except that he shall not, before being registered as the holder of the share, be entitled in respect of it to attend or vote at any meeting of the Company or at any separate meeting of the holders of any class of shares in the Company.

ALTERATION OF SHARE CAPITAL
 
The Company may by ordinary resolution:
18.1
        
 
increase its share capital by new shares of such amount as the resolution prescribes;
(a)
          
 
consolidate and divide all or any of its share capital into shares of larger amount than its existing shares;
(b)
          
 
subject to the provisions of the Act, sub-divide its shares, or any of them, into shares of smaller amount and the resolution may determine that, as between the shares resulting from the sub-division, any of them may have any preference or advantage as compared with the others; and
(c)
          
 
cancel shares which, at the date of the passing of the resolution, have not been taken or agreed to be taken by any person and diminish the amount of its share capital by the amount of the shares so cancelled.
(d)
          
 
Whenever as a result of a consolidation of shares any members would become entitled to fractions of a share, the directors may, on behalf of those members, sell the shares representing the fractions for the best price reasonably obtainable to any person (including, subject to the provisions of the Act, the Company) and distribute the net proceeds of sale in due proportion among those members, and the directors may authorise some person to execute an instrument of transfer of the shares to, or in accordance with the directions of, the purchaser.  The transferee shall not be bound to see to the application of the purchase money nor shall his title to the shares be affected by any irregularity in or invalidity of the proceedings in reference to the sale.
18.2
        
 
Subject to the provisions of the Act, the Company may by special resolution reduce its share capital, any capital redemption reserve and any share premium account in any way.

Subject to the provisions of the Act, the Company may purchase its own shares (including any redeemable shares) and, if it is a private company, make a payment in respect of the redemption or purchase of its own shares otherwise than out of distributable profits of the Company or the proceeds of a fresh issue of shares.
20.
         
GENERAL MEETINGS
 
All general meetings other than annual general meetings shall be called extraordinary general meetings.
20.1
        
 
The directors may call general meetings and, on the requisition of members pursuant to the provisions of the Act, shall forthwith proceed to convene an extraordinary general meeting for a date not later than eight weeks after receipt of a requisition.  If there are not within the United Kingdom sufficient directors to call a general meeting, any director or any member of the Company may call a general meeting.

21.
         
NOTICE OF GENERAL MEETINGS
 
An annual general meeting and an extraordinary general meeting called for the passing of a special resolution shall be called by at least twenty-one clear days' notice.  All other extraordinary general meetings shall be called by at least fourteen clear days' notice but a general meeting may be called by shorter notice if it is so agreed:
21.1
        
 
in the case of an annual general meeting, by all the members entitled to attend and vote thereat; and
(a)
          
 
in the case of any other meeting, by a majority in number of the members having a right to attend and vote being a majority together holding not less than ninety-five per cent in nominal value of the shares giving that right or such other majority as has been decided on by elective resolution of the members under the Act.
(b)
          
 
The notice shall specify the time and place of the meeting and the general nature of the business to be transacted and, in the case of an annual general meeting, shall specify the meeting as such.
21.2
        
 
Subject to the provisions of these Articles and to any restrictions imposed on any shares, the notice shall be given to all members to all persons entitled to a share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of a member and to the auditors.
21.3
        
 
The accidental omission to give notice of a meeting to, or the non-receipt of notice of a meeting by, any person entitled to receive notice shall not invalidate the proceedings at that meeting.
21.4
        
 
Where for any purpose an ordinary resolution of the Company is required, a special or extraordinary resolution shall also be effective.  Where for any purpose an extraordinary resolution is required, a special resolution shall also be effective.
21.5
        
 
22.
         
PROCEEDINGS AT GENERAL MEETINGS
 
No business shall be transacted at any meeting unless a quorum is present.  One A1 Ordinary Shareholder entitled to vote upon the business to be transacted, being a member or a proxy for a member or a duly authorised representative of a corporation, shall be a quorum.
22.1
        
 
If such a quorum is not present within half an hour from the time appointed for the meeting, or if during the meeting such a quorum ceases to be present, the meeting shall stand adjourned to the same day in the next week at the same time and place or to such time and place as the directors may determine.
22.2
        
 
The chairman, if any, of the board of directors or in his absence some other director nominated by the directors shall preside as chairman of the meeting, but if neither the chairman nor such other director (if any) be present within fifteen minutes after the time appointed for holding the meeting and willing to act, the directors present shall elect one of
22.3
        
their number to be chairman and, if there is only one director present and willing to act, he shall be chairman.
 
If no director is willing to act as chairman, or if no director is present within fifteen minutes after the time appointed for holding the meeting, the members present and entitled to vote shall choose one of their number to be chairman.
22.4
        
 
A director shall, notwithstanding that he is not a member, be entitled to attend and speak at any general meeting and at any separate meeting of the holders of any class of shares in the Company.
22.5
        
 
The chairman may, with the consent of a meeting at which a quorum is present (and shall if so directed by the meeting), adjourn the meeting from time to time and from place to place, but no business shall be transacted at an adjourned meeting other than business which might properly have been transacted at the meeting had the adjournment not taken place.  Where a meeting is adjourned for fourteen days or more, at least seven clear days' notice shall be given specifying the time and place of the adjourned meeting and the general nature of the business to be transacted.  Otherwise it shall not be necessary to give any such notice.
22.6
        
 
A resolution put to the vote of a meeting shall be decided on a show of hands unless before, or on the declaration of the result of, the show of hands a poll is duly demanded by the chairman or any member present in person or by proxy or duly authorised representative and entitled to vote.
22.7
        
 
Unless a poll is duly demanded a declaration by the chairman that a resolution has been carried or carried unanimously, or by a particular majority, or lost, or not carried by a particular majority and an entry to that effect in the minutes of the meeting shall be conclusive evidence of the fact without proof of the number or proportion of the votes recorded in favour of or against the resolution.
22.8
        
 
The demand for a poll may, before the poll is taken, be withdrawn but only with the consent of the chairman and a demand so withdrawn shall not be taken to have invalidated the result of a show of hands declared before the demand was made.
22.9
        
 
A poll shall be taken as the chairman directs and he may appoint scrutineers (who need not be members) and fix a time and place for declaring the result of the poll.  The result of the poll shall be deemed to be the resolution of the meeting at which the poll was demanded.
22.10
      
 
In the case of an equality of votes, whether on a show of hands or on a poll, the chairman shall be entitled to a casting vote in addition to any other vote he may have.
22.11
      
 
A poll demanded on the election of a chairman or on a question of adjournment shall be taken forthwith.  A poll demanded on any other question shall be taken either forthwith or at such time and place as the chairman directs not being more than thirty days after the poll is demanded.  The demand for a poll shall not prevent the continuance of a meeting for the transaction of any business other than the question on which the poll was demanded.  If a poll is demanded before the declaration of the result of a show of hands and the demand is duly withdrawn, the meeting shall continue as if the demand had not been made.
22.12
      
 
No notice need be given of a poll not taken forthwith if the time and place at which it is to be taken are announced at the meeting at which it is demanded.  In any other case at least seven clear days' notice shall be given specifying the time and place at which the poll is to be taken.
22.13
      
 
A resolution in writing executed by or on behalf of each member who would have been entitled to vote upon it if it had been proposed at a general meeting at which he was present shall be as effectual as if it had been passed at a general meeting duly convened and held and
22.14
      
may consist of several instruments in the like form each executed by or on behalf of one or more members.
 
23.
         
VOTES OF MEMBERS
 
Subject to any rights or restrictions attached to any shares, on a show of hands every member who (being an individual) is present in person or (being a corporation) is present by a duly authorised representative, not being himself a member entitled to vote, shall have one vote and on a poll every member shall have one vote for every share of which he is the holder.
23.1
        
 
In the case of joint holders the vote of the senior who tenders a vote, whether in person or by proxy, shall be accepted to the exclusion of the votes of the other joint holders; and seniority shall be determined by the order in which the names of the holders stand in the register of members.
23.2
        
 
A member in respect of whom an order has been made by any court having jurisdiction (whether in the United Kingdom or elsewhere) in matters concerning mental disorder may vote, whether on a show of hands or on a poll, by his receiver, curator bonis or other person authorised in that behalf appointed by that court, and any such receiver, curator bonis or other person may, on a poll, vote by proxy.  Evidence to the satisfaction of the directors of the authority of the person claiming to exercise the right to vote shall be deposited at the Office, or at such other place as is specified in accordance with the Articles for the deposit of instruments of proxy, not less than 48 hours before the time appointed for holding the meeting or adjourned meeting at which the right to vote is to be exercised and in default the right to vote shall not be exercisable.
23.3
        
 
No member shall vote at any general meeting or at any separate meeting of the holders of any class of shares in the Company, either in person or by proxy, in respect of any share held by him unless all moneys presently payable by him in respect of that share have been paid.
23.4
        
 
No objection shall be raised to the qualification of any voter except at the meeting or adjourned meeting at which the vote objected to is tendered, and every vote not disallowed at the meeting shall be valid.  Any objection made in due time shall be referred to the chairman whose decision shall be final and conclusive.
23.5
        
 
On a poll votes may be given either personally or by proxy.  A member may appoint more than one proxy to attend on the same occasion.  A member entitled to more than one vote need not, if he votes, use all his votes or cast all the votes he uses the same way.
23.6
        
 
The appointment of a proxy shall be executed by or on behalf of the appointor and shall be in any form which is usual or which the directors may approve.
23.7
        
 
The appointment of a proxy shall be deemed to include the right to demand, or join in demanding, a poll.  The appointment of a proxy shall also be deemed to confer authority to vote on any amendment of a resolution put to the meeting for which it is given as the proxy thinks fit.  The appointment of a proxy shall, unless it provides to the contrary, be valid for any adjournment of the meeting as well as for the meeting to which it relates.  Deposit of an appointment of a proxy shall not preclude a member from attending and voting at the meeting or at any adjournment thereof.
23.8
        
 
The appointment of a proxy and any authority under which it is executed or a copy of such authority certified notarially or in some other way approved by the directors may:
23.9
        
 
in the case of an instrument in writing, be deposited at the Office or at such other place within the United Kingdom as is specified in the notice convening the meeting or in any instrument of proxy sent out by the Company in relation to the meeting not
(a)
          
less than 48 hours before the time for holding the meeting or adjourned meeting at which the person named in the instrument proposes to vote; or
 
in the case of an appointment contained in an electronic communication, where an address has been specified for the purpose of receiving electronic communications:
(b)
          
 
in the notice convening the meeting, or
(i)
           
 
in any instrument of proxy sent out by the Company in relation to the meeting, or
(ii)
          
 
in any invitation contained in an electronic communication to appoint a proxy issued by the Company in relation to the meeting,
(iii)
         
 
be received at such address not less than 48 hours before the time for holding the meeting or adjourned meeting at which the person named in the appointment proposes to vote;
 
in the case of a poll taken more than 48 hours after it is demanded, be deposited or received as aforesaid after the poll has been demanded and not less than 24 hours before the time appointed for the taking of the poll; or
(c)
          
 
where the poll is not taken forthwith but is taken not more than 48 hours after it was demanded, be delivered at the meeting at which the poll was demanded to the chairman or to the secretary or to any director;
(d)
          
 
in a manner so permitted shall be invalid.
and an appointment of proxy which is not deposited, delivered or received
 
A vote given or poll demanded by proxy or by the duly authorised representative of a corporation shall be valid notwithstanding the previous determination of the authority of the person voting or demanding a poll unless notice of the determination was received by the Company at the Office or at such other place at which the instrument of proxy was duly deposited or, where the appointment of the proxy was contained in an electronic communication, at the address at which such appointment was duly received before the commencement of the meeting or adjourned meeting at which the vote is given or the poll demanded or (in the case of a poll taken otherwise than on the same day as the meeting or adjourned meeting) the time appointed for taking the poll.
23.10
      
 
24.
         
NUMBER OF DIRECTORS
 
Unless otherwise determined by ordinary resolution, the number of directors (other than alternate directors) shall not be subject to any maximum but shall not be less than two.  A sole director may exercise all the powers and discretions expressed by the Articles to be vested in the directors generally.
24.1
        
 
25.
         
ALTERNATE DIRECTORS
 
Any director (other than an alternate director) may appoint any other director, or any other person approved by resolution of the directors and willing to act, to be an alternate director and may remove from office an alternate director so appointed by him.  Any appointment or removal of an alternate director shall be by notice to the Company signed by the director making or revoking the appointment or in any other manner approved by the directors.  The notice may be:
25.1
        
delivered personally to the secretary or to a director other than the director making or revoking the appointment; or
(a)
          
 
sent by post in a prepaid envelope addressed to the Office or to another address designated by the directors for that purpose or by leaving it at the Office or such other address; or
(b)
          
 
sent by electronic communication to an address designated by the directors for that purpose.
(c)
          
 
The appointment or removal of an alternate director shall take effect when the notice is deemed delivered in accordance with Articles 42.1 or 4.24 (as the case may be) or on such later date (if any) specified in the notice.
25.2
        
 
An alternate director shall be entitled to receive notice of all meetings of directors and of all meetings of committees of directors of which his appointor is a member, to attend and vote at any such meeting at which the director appointing him is not personally present, and generally to perform all the functions of his appointor as a director in his absence but shall not be entitled to receive any remuneration from the Company for his services as an alternate director.
25.3
        
 
an alternate director shall cease to be an alternate director:
(a)
          
 
if his appointor ceases to be a director; or
(b)
          
 
if his appointor revokes his appointment pursuant to Article 28; or
(c)
          
 
on the happening of any event which, if he were a director, would cause him to vacate his office as director; or
(d)
          
 
if he resigns his office by notice to the Company.
(e)
          
 
Save as otherwise provided in the Articles, an alternate director shall be deemed for all purposes to be a director and shall alone be responsible for his own acts and defaults and he shall not be deemed to be the agent of the director appointing him.
25.4
        
 
26.
         
POWERS OF DIRECTORS
 
Subject to the provisions of the Act, the memorandum and the Articles and to any directions given by special resolution, the business of the Company shall be managed by the directors who may exercise all the powers of the Company.  No alteration of the memorandum or Articles and no such direction shall invalidate any prior act of the directors which would have been valid if that alteration had not been made or that direction had not been given.  The powers given by this Article 26 shall not be limited by any special power given to the directors by the Articles and a meeting of directors at which a quorum is present may exercise all powers exercisable by the directors.
26.1
        
 
The directors may, by power of attorney or otherwise, appoint any person to be the agent of the Company for such purposes and on such conditions as they determine, including authority for the agent to delegate all or any of his powers.
26.2
        
 
The directors may exercise the voting power conferred by the shares in any body corporate held or owned by the Company in such manner in all respects as they think fit (including without limitation the exercise of that power in favour of any resolution appointing its members or any of them directors of such body corporate, or voting or providing for the payment of remuneration to the directors of such body corporate).
26.3
        
27.
         
DELEGATION OF DIRECTORS' POWERS
 
The directors may delegate any of their powers to any committee consisting of one or more directors.  The directors may also delegate to any managing director or any director holding any other executive office such of their powers as the directors consider desirable to be exercised by him.  Any such delegation shall, in the absence of express provision to the contrary in the terms of delegation, be deemed to include authority to sub-delegate all or any of the powers delegated to one or more directors (whether or not acting as a committee) or to any employee or agent of the company.  Any such delegation may be made subject to such conditions as the directors may specify, and may be revoked or altered.  Subject to any conditions imposed by the directors, the proceedings of a committee with two or more members shall be governed by the Articles regulating the proceedings of directors so far as they are capable of applying.
27.1
        
 
The directors may appoint any person to any office or employment having a designation or title including the word "director" and/or may attach such a designation or title to any existing office or employment with the Company and may terminate any such appointment or the use of any such designation or title.  The inclusion of the word "director" in the designation or title of any such office or employment shall in no way imply that the holder is a director of the Company, and the holder shall not thereby be empowered in any respect to act as, or be deemed to be, a director of the Company for any of the purposes of the Articles.
27.2
        
 
28.
         
APPOINTMENT AND REMOVAL OF DIRECTORS
 
Without prejudice to the powers of the Company under section 303 of the Act to remove a director by ordinary resolution, the holder or holders for the time being of more than one half in nominal value of the shares giving the right to attend and vote at a general meeting of the Company may at any time and from time to time appoint any person who is willing to act to be a director, either to fill a vacancy or as an additional director, and may remove any director from office. Without prejudice to the foregoing, for so long as Priceline or any of its holding companies or any of its subsidiaries is a holder of shares in the Company, Priceline may from time to time appoint up to four people to be directors (each a "Priceline Director").  Any appointment or removal of a director under this Article 28 shall be by notice to the Company signed by or on behalf of the appointor or appointors (which may consist of several documents in the like form each signed by or on behalf of one or more appointors).  The notice may be:
28.1
        
 
delivered personally to the secretary or to a director other than the director being appointed or removed; or
(a)
          
 
sent by post in a prepaid envelope addressed to the Office or to another address designated by the directors for that purpose or by leaving it at the Office or such other address; or
(b)
          
 
sent by electronic communication to an address designated by the directors for that purpose.
(c)
          
 
The appointment or removal shall take effect when the notice is deemed delivered in accordance with Article 42.1 or Article 42.4 (as the case may be) or on such later date (if any) specified in the notice.
 
The directors shall also have the power to appoint any person who is willing to act to be a director, either to fill a vacancy or as an addition to the existing directors, subject to any maximum for the time being in force.
28.2
        
29.
         
DISQUALIFICATION OF DIRECTORS
 
The office of a director shall be vacated if:
29.1
        
 
he ceases to be a director by virtue of any provision of the Act or he becomes prohibited by law from being a director; or
(a)
          
 
he becomes bankrupt or makes any arrangement or composition with his creditors generally; or
(b)
          
 
he is, or may be, suffering from mental disorder and either:
(c)
          
 
he is admitted to hospital in pursuance of an application for admission for treatment under the Mental Health Act 1983, or in Scotland, an application for admission under the Mental Health (Scotland) Act 1984; or
(i)
           
 
an order is made by a court having jurisdiction (whether in the United Kingdom or elsewhere) in matters concerning mental disorder for his detention or for the appointment of a receiver, curator bonis or other person to exercise powers with respect to his property or affairs;
(ii)
          
 
he resigns his office by notice to the Company; or
(d)
          
 
he shall for more than six consecutive months have been absent without permission of the directors from meetings of the directors held during that period and the directors resolve that his office be vacated; or
(e)
          
 
he is convicted of a criminal offence involving fraud or dishonesty and the directors resolve that he shall for that reason cease to be a director; or
(f)
           
 
he is removed as a director in accordance with the provisions of Article 28; or
(g)
          
 
he is requested to resign in writing by all of the other directors.  In calculating the number of directors who are required to make such a request to the director:
(h)
          
 
an alternate director appointed by him acting in his capacity as such shall be excluded; and
(i)
           
 
a director and any alternate director appointed by him and acting in his capacity as such shall constitute a single director for this purpose, so that the signature of either shall be sufficient.
(ii)
          
 
30.
         
REMUNERATION OF DIRECTORS
 
The directors shall be entitled to such remuneration as the Company may by ordinary resolution determine and, unless the resolution provides otherwise, the remuneration shall be deemed to accrue from day to day.
 
31.
         
DIRECTORS' EXPENSES
 
The directors may be paid all travelling, hotel, and other expenses properly incurred by them in connection with their attendance at meetings of directors or committees of directors or general meetings or separate meetings of the holders of any class of shares or of debentures of the Company or otherwise in connection with the discharge of their duties.
32.
         
DIRECTORS' APPOINTMENTS AND INTERESTS
 
Subject to the provisions of the Act the directors may appoint one or more of their number to the office of managing director or to any other executive office under the Company and may enter into an agreement or arrangement with any director for his employment by the Company or for the provision by him of any services outside the scope of the ordinary duties of a director.  Any such appointment, agreement or arrangement may be made upon such terms as the directors determine and they may remunerate any such director for his services as they think fit.  Any appointment of a director to an executive office shall terminate if he ceases to be a director but without prejudice to any claim to damages for breach of the contract of service between the director and the Company.
32.1

may be a party to, or otherwise interested in, any transaction or arrangement with the Company or in which the Company is otherwise interested;
(a)
          
 
may be a director or other officer of, or employed by, or a party to any transaction or arrangement with, or otherwise interested in, any body corporate promoted by the Company or in which the Company is otherwise interested; and
(b)
          
 
shall not, by reason of his office, be accountable to the Company for any benefit which he derives from any such office or employment or from any such transaction or arrangement or from any interest in any such body corporate and no such transaction or arrangement shall be liable to be avoided on the ground of any such interest or benefit.
(c)
          
 
For the purposes of Article 32.2:
32.3
        
 
a general notice given to the directors that a director is to be regarded as having an interest of the nature and extent specified in the notice in any transaction or arrangement in which a specified person or class of persons is interested shall be deemed to be a disclosure that the director has an interest in any such transaction of the nature and extent so specified; and
(a)
          
 
an interest of which a director has no knowledge and of which it is unreasonable to expect him to have knowledge shall not be treated as an interest of his.
(b)
          
 
33.
         
DIRECTORS' BENEFITS, PENSIONS AND INSURANCE
 
The directors may provide benefits, whether by the payment of gratuities or pensions or by insurance or otherwise, for any director who has held but no longer holds any executive office or employment with the Company or with any body corporate which is or has been a subsidiary of the Company or a predecessor in business of the Company or of any such subsidiary, and for any member of his family (including a spouse and a former spouse) or any person who is or was dependent on him, and may (as well before as after he ceases to hold such office or employment) contribute to any fund and pay premiums for the purchase or provision of any such benefit.
33.1
        
 
Without prejudice to the provisions of Article 44, the directors may exercise all the powers of the Company to purchase and maintain insurance for or for the benefit of any person who is or was:
33.2
        
 
a director, other officer, employee or auditor of the Company, or any body which is or was the holding company or subsidiary undertaking of the Company, or in which
(a)
          
the Company or such holding company or subsidiary undertaking has or had any interest (whether direct or indirect) or with which the Company or such holding company or subsidiary undertaking is or was in any way allied or associated; or

Without prejudice to the generality of Article 33.1, no director or former director shall be accountable to the Company or the members for any benefit provided pursuant to Articles 33.1 or 33.2.  The receipt of any such benefit shall not disqualify any person from being or becoming a director of the Company.

Pursuant to section 719 of the Act, the directors are hereby authorised to make such provision as may seem appropriate for the benefit of any persons employed or formerly employed by the Company or any of its subsidiary undertakings in connection with the cessation or the transfer of the whole or part of the undertaking of the Company or any subsidiary undertaking.  Any such provision shall be made by a resolution of the directors in accordance with section 719.

PROCEEDINGS OF DIRECTORS
 
Subject to the provisions of the Articles, the directors may regulate their proceedings as they think fit.  A director may, and the secretary at the request of a director shall, call a meeting of the directors.  Notice of a meeting of the directors shall be deemed to be properly given to a director if it is given to him personally or by word of mouth or sent in writing or by electronic communication to him at his last known address or any other address given by him to the Company for this purpose.  A director absent or intending to be absent from the United Kingdom may request that notices of directors' meetings shall during his absence be sent in writing or by electronic communication to him at an address given by him to the Company for this purpose, but such notices need not be given any earlier than notices given to directors not so absent and, if no such request is made to the directors, any director may waive notice of a meeting and any such waiver may be retrospective.
34.1
        
 
Questions arising at a meeting shall be decided by a majority of votes.  In the case of an equality of votes, the chairman shall be entitled to a casting vote in addition to any other vote he may have.  A director who is also an alternate director shall be entitled in the absence of his appointor to a separate vote on behalf of his appointor in addition to his own vote.
34.2
        
 
The quorum for the transaction of the business of the directors may be fixed by the directors and unless so fixed at any other number shall be two, except when there is only one director, provided that, in the event that one or more Priceline Directors holds office, at least one Priceline Director is present.  If there is only one director, he may exercise all the powers and discretions conferred on directors by the Articles.  A person who holds office only as an alternate director shall, if his appointor is not present, be counted in the quorum.
34.3
        
 
The directors may appoint one of their number to be the chairman of the board of directors and may at any time remove him from that office.  Unless he is unwilling to do so, the director so appointed shall preside at every meeting of directors at which he is present.  But if there is no director holding that office, or if the director holding it is unwilling to preside or is not present within five minutes after the time appointed for the meeting, the directors present may appoint one of their number to be chairman of the meeting.
34.4
        
All acts done by a meeting of directors, or of a committee of directors, or by a person acting as a director shall, notwithstanding that it be afterwards discovered that there was a defect in the appointment of any director or that any of them were disqualified from holding office, or had vacated office, or were not entitled to vote, be as valid as if every such person had been duly appointed and was qualified and had continued to be a director and had been entitled to vote.
34.5
        
 
A resolution in writing signed by all the directors entitled to receive notice of a meeting of directors or of a committee of directors shall be as valid and effectual as if it had been passed at a meeting of directors or (as the case may be) a committee of directors duly convened and held and may consist of several documents in the like form each signed by one or more directors; but a resolution signed by an alternate director need not also be signed by his appointor and, if it is signed by a director who has appointed an alternate director, it need not be signed by the alternate director in that capacity.
34.6
        
 
The contemporaneous connection of a number of the directors not less than the quorum, regardless of physical location, by any means of electronic communication, shall be deemed to constitute a properly held meeting of the directors so long as the following conditions are met:
34.7
        
 
throughout the meeting each of the directors taking part must be able to:
(a)
          
 
hear each of the other directors taking part; and
(i)
           
 
subject as mentioned below, send and receive communications simultaneously to and from all of the other directors taking part;
(ii)
          
 
at the beginning and at the conclusion of the meeting the chairman shall ask all of those who have been a party to the proceedings to acknowledge their presence and to confirm that they have attended throughout the meeting.  Such a meeting shall be deemed to take place where it is convened to be held or (if no director is present in that place) where the largest group of those participating is assembled, or, if there is no such group, where the chairman of the meeting is.  The word "meeting" in the Articles shall be construed accordingly.
34.8
        
 
The meeting shall have been validly conducted notwithstanding that a director may have been accidentally disconnected during the meeting, so long as a quorum of directors were connected at all times.  A minute of the proceedings shall be sufficient evidence of the observance of the necessary formalities if certified by a director who was party to them.
 
Subject to such disclosure as is required by the Act and the Articles, a director shall be entitled to vote at any meeting of directors or of a committee of directors on, and be counted in the quorum present at a meeting in relation to, any resolution concerning a matter in which he has, directly or indirectly, an interest or duty which is material and which conflicts or may conflict with the interests of the Company.
34.9
        
 
35.
         
SECRETARY
 
Subject to the provisions of the Act, the secretary shall be appointed by the holder or holders for the time being of more than one half in nominal value of the shares giving the right to attend and vote at a general meeting of the Company or the directors for such term, at such remuneration and upon such conditions as they may think fit and any secretary so appointed may be removed by such appointor(s).  Any appointment or removal of a secretary under this Article 35 shall be by notice to the Company signed by or on behalf of the appointor or appointors (which may consist of several documents in the like form each signed by or on behalf of one or more appointors).
35.1
        
Two or more joint secretaries, each of whom shall have full authority to act alone and independently of each other, may be appointed pursuant to the provisions of Article 35.1.
35.2
        
 
36.
         
MINUTES
 
The directors shall cause minutes to be made in books kept for the purpose:
36.1
        
 
of all appointments of officers made by the directors; and
(a)
          
 
of all proceedings at meetings of the Company, of the holders of any class of shares in the Company, and of the directors, and of committees of directors, including the names of the directors present at each such meeting.
(b)
          
 
37.
         
THE SEAL, EXECUTION OF DEEDS
 
If the Company has a Seal, it shall only be used by the authority of a resolution of the directors, or a committee of directors authorised by the directors.  The directors (or the committee of directors, as the case may be) shall determine who may sign any instrument to which the Seal is affixed and unless otherwise so determined it shall be signed by a director and by the secretary or by at least two directors.  Any document may be executed under the Seal by impressing the Seal by mechanical means or by printing the Seal or a facsimile of it on the document or by applying the Seal or a facsimile of it by any other means to the document.
37.1
        
 
A document signed, with the authority of a resolution of the directors, by a director and the secretary or by two directors and expressed (in whatever form of words) to be executed by the Company has the same effect as if executed under the Seal.  For the purpose of the preceding sentence only, "secretary" shall have the same meaning as in the Act and not the meaning given to it by Article 2.
37.2
        
 
The Company may exercise the powers conferred by section 39 of the Act with regard to having an official seal for use abroad.
37.3
        
 
38.
         
RECORD DATES
 
Notwithstanding any other provision of the Articles, the Company or the directors may fix any date as the record date for any dividend, distribution, allotment or issue, which may be on or at any time before or after any date on which the dividend, distribution, allotment or issue is declared, paid or made.
38.1
        
 
39.
         
DIVIDENDS
 
Subject to the provisions of the Act, the Company may by ordinary resolution declare dividends in accordance with the respective rights of the members, but no dividend shall exceed the amount recommended by the directors.
39.1
        
 
Subject to the provisions of the Act the directors may pay interim dividends in accordance with the respective rights of the members if it appears to them that they are justified by the profits of the Company available for distribution.  Such interim dividends may be paid in cash or wholly or partly by the distribution of assets.  If the share capital is divided into different classes, the directors may pay interim dividends on shares which confer deferred or non-preferred rights with regard to dividend as well as on shares which confer preferential rights with regard to dividend, but no interim dividend shall be paid on shares carrying deferred or non-preferred rights if, at the time of payment, any preferential dividend is in arrear.  The directors may also pay at intervals settled by them any dividend payable at a fixed rate if it appears to them that the profits available for distribution justify the payment.  Provided the
39.2
        
directors act in good faith they shall not incur any liability to the holders of shares conferring preferred rights for any loss they may suffer by the lawful payment of an interim dividend on any shares having deferred or non-preferred rights.
 
Except as otherwise provided by the rights attached to shares, all dividends shall be declared and paid according to the amounts paid up on the shares on which the dividend is paid.  All dividends shall be apportioned and paid proportionately to the amounts paid up on the shares during any portion or portions of the period in respect of which the dividend is paid; but, if any share is issued on terms providing that it shall rank for dividend as from a particular date, that share shall rank for dividend accordingly.
39.3
        
 
A general meeting declaring a dividend may, upon the recommendation of the directors, direct that it shall be satisfied wholly or partly by the distribution of assets.
39.4
        
 
Where any difficulty arises in regard to the distribution of assets pursuant to the payment or declaration of any dividend, the directors may settle the same and in particular may issue fractional certificates and fix the value for distribution of any assets and may determine that cash shall be paid to any member upon the footing of the value so fixed in order to adjust the rights of members and may vest any assets in trustees.
39.5
        
 
Any dividend or other moneys payable in respect of a share may be paid by cheque sent by post to the registered address of the person entitled or, if two or more persons are the holders of the share or are jointly entitled to it by reason of the death or bankruptcy of the holder, to the registered address of that one of those persons who is first named in the register of members or to such person and to such address as the person or persons entitled may in writing direct.  Every cheque shall be made payable to the order of the person or persons entitled or to such other person as the person or persons entitled may in writing direct and payment of the cheque shall be a good discharge to the Company.  Any joint holder or other person jointly entitled to a share as aforesaid may give receipts for any dividend or other moneys payable in respect of the share.
39.6
        
 
No dividend or other moneys payable in respect of a share shall bear interest against the Company unless otherwise provided by the rights attached to the share.
39.7
        
 
Any dividend which has remained unclaimed for twelve years from the date when it became due for payment shall, if the directors so resolve, be forfeited and cease to remain owing by the Company.
39.8
        
 
40.
         
ACCOUNTS
 
No member shall (as such) have any right of inspecting any accounting records or other book or document of the Company except as conferred by statute or authorised by the directors or by ordinary resolution of the Company.
40.1
        
 
41.
         
CAPITALISATION OF PROFITS
 
The directors may with the authority of an ordinary resolution of the Company:
 
subject as hereinafter provided, resolve to capitalise any undivided profits of the Company not required for paying any preferential dividend (whether or not they are available for distribution) or any sum standing to the credit of the Company's share premium account or capital redemption reserve;
(a)
          
 
appropriate the sum resolved to be capitalised to the members who would have been entitled to it if it were distributed by way of dividend and in the same proportions and apply such sum on their behalf either in or towards paying up the amounts, if any, for
(b)
          
the time being unpaid on any shares held by them respectively, or in paying up in full unissued shares or debentures of the Company of a nominal amount equal to that sum, and allot the shares or debentures credited as fully paid to those members, or as they may direct, in those proportions, or partly in one way and partly in the other; but the share premium account, the capital redemption reserve, and any profits which are not available for distribution may, for the purposes of this Article 41(b), only be applied in paying up unissued shares to be allotted to members credited as fully paid;
 
make such provision by the issue of fractional certificates or by payment in cash or otherwise as they determine in the case of shares or debentures becoming distributable under this Article 41.1in fractions; and
(c)
          
 
authorise any person to enter on behalf of all the members concerned into an agreement with the Company providing for the allotment to them respectively, credited as fully paid, of any shares or debentures to which they are entitled upon such capitalisation, any agreement made under such authority being binding on all such members.
(d)
          
 
42.
         
NOTICES
 
Any notice to be given to or by any person pursuant to the Articles (other than a notice calling a meeting of the directors or a committee of the directors) shall be in writing or shall be given using electronic communications to an address for the time being notified for that purpose to the person giving the notice.  The Company may give any notice to a member:
42.1
        
 
personally; or
(a)
          
 
by sending it by post in a prepaid envelope addressed to the member at his registered address or by leaving it at that address; or
(b)
          
 
by giving it using an electronic communication to an address for the time being notified to the company by the member.
(c)
          
 
In the case of joint holders of a share, all notices shall be given to the joint holder whose name stands first in the register of members in respect of the joint holding and notice so given shall be sufficient notice to all the joint holders.
 
A member present, either in person or by proxy, at any meeting of the Company or of the holders of any class of shares in the Company shall be deemed to have received notice of the meeting and, where requisite, of the purposes for which it was called.
42.2
        
 
Every person who becomes entitled to a share shall be bound by any notice in respect of that share which, before his name is entered in the register of members, has been duly given to a person from whom he derives his title.
42.3
        
 
Proof that an envelope containing a notice was properly addressed, prepaid and posted shall be conclusive evidence that the notice was given.  Proof that a notice contained in an electronic communication was sent in accordance with guidance issued by the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators shall be conclusive evidence that the notice was given.  A notice shall be deemed to be given at the expiration of 48 hours after the envelope containing it was posted or, in the case of a notice contained in an electronic communication, at the expiration of 48 hours after the time it was sent.
42.4
        
 
A notice may be given by the company to the persons entitled to a share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of a member by sending or delivering it, in any manner authorised by the Articles for the giving of notice to a member, addressed to them by name, or by the title of
42.5
        
representatives of the deceased, or trustee of the bankrupt or by any like description at the address, if any, within the United Kingdom supplied for that purpose by the persons claiming to be so entitled. Until such an address has been supplied, a notice may be given in any manner in which it might have been given if the death or bankruptcy had not occurred.
 
43.
         
WINDING UP
 
If the Company is wound up, the liquidator may, with the sanction of an extraordinary resolution of the Company and any other sanction required by the Act, divide among the members in specie the whole or any part of the assets of the Company and may, for that purpose, value any assets and determine how the division shall be carried out as between the members or different classes of members. The liquidator may, with the like sanction, vest the whole or any part of the assets in trustees upon such trusts for the benefit of the members as he with the like sanction determines, but no member shall be compelled to accept any assets upon which there is a liability.
43.1
        
 
44.
         
INDEMNITY
 
Subject to the provisions of the Act but without prejudice to any indemnity to which a director may otherwise be entitled, every director or other officer or auditor of the Company shall be indemnified out of the assets of the Company against any liability incurred by him in defending any proceedings, whether civil or criminal, in which judgment is given in his favour or in which he is acquitted or in connection with any application in which relief is granted to him by the court from liability for negligence, default, breach of duty or breach of trust in relation to the affairs of the Company.
