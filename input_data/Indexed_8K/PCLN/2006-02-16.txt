Regulation FD Disclosure
 
On February 16, 2006, priceline.com announced its financial results for the fiscal quarter and year ended December 31, 2005.  A copy of priceline.com's press release announcing these financial results and certain other information is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
 
During its earnings conference call, priceline.com announced that its gross travel bookings (which refers to the total dollar value, inclusive of all taxes and fees, of all travel services purchased by consumers) increased 29% to $536.8 million in the 4 quarter 2005 compared to the 4 quarter 2004.  Priceline.com noted that its "organic" gross travel bookings increased approximately 21% in the 4th quarter 2005 when compared to the 4th quarter 2004, assuming that priceline.com owned Bookings B.V., which was acquired in July 2005, during the entire 4th quarter of 2004 and excluding the sale of hotels rooms by Travelweb through Orbitz (the agreement governing the sale of Travelweb hotel rooms through Orbitz was restructured by the companies at the end of the 2nd quarter 2005).  Priceline.com noted that, with respect to its domestic business, gross travel bookings from its "opaque" airline business and gross travel bookings from its restructured hotel affiliate agreement with Orbitz declined in the 4 quarter 2005 by approximately $16 million compared to the 4 quarter 2004, a decline that was offset by gross travel bookings from the company's domestic retail services and domestic rental car service.  Priceline.com stated that revenues from its European operations in the 4th quarter 2005 were approximately $22.6 million.  Priceline.com stated that its total capital expenditures in the 4 quarter 2005 were approximately $3.0 million.

With respect to 2006 guidance, priceline.com stated that it expected gross travel bookings from its European operations to be between $180 million and $200 million in the 1 quarter 2006 and between $800 million and $900 million for the full-year 2006.  During the call, priceline.com announced that it expected consolidated advertising expenses of approximately $30 to $32 million in the 1 quarter 2006 and expected approximately two-thirds of that amount to be spent "on-line."  Priceline.com estimated that sales and marketing expenses in the 1 quarter 2006 would be between $9 and $10 million.  Priceline.com stated that it expected personnel costs to be approximately $12.5 to $13.0 million in the 1 quarter 2006.  With respect to 1 quarter 2006, priceline.com stated it expected general and administrative expenses of approximately $6.0 to $6.3 million, information technology expenses of approximately $2.6 to $2.8 million, and depreciation and amortization expenses, excluding acquisition related amortization, of approximately $2.6 million.  Priceline.com estimated that it would have cash income tax expense of approximately $400,000 in the 1 quarter 2006 comprised of alternative minimum tax in the United States and additional income taxes in Europe.

With respect to GAAP financial results, the company said it expected to report a GAAP loss of approximately $0.02 to $0.05 per diluted share in the 1 quarter 2006 and expected GAAP net income for the full-year 2006 to be approximately $0.55 to $0.65 per diluted share.  The company estimated that as a result of the required adoption of SFAS 123(R) its stock based compensation expense would increase approximately $1.5 million and approximately $6.0 million, respectively, in the 1 quarter 2006 and full-year 2006 compared to the same periods in 2005.

The company explained that, given the rapid growth in its retail hotel business, it anticipated a shift in its historical earnings seasonality, with higher seasonal earnings in the 2 and 3 quarters of 2006.  The company noted that it expected that the percentage of its gross travel bookings in the 1 quarter 2006 that were subject to deferred revenue accounting would increase from approximately 19% in the 1 quarter 2005 to approximately 35% in the 1 quarter 2006.  However, the company noted that all advertising expense associated with those booking were required to be expensed in the period in which the gross travel booking was generated.  The company explained that it expected to generate approximately 36% to 40% of its full year pro forma net income in the 3 quarter 2006.

 quarter 2005 was a solid quarter for priceline.com," said priceline.com President and Chief Executive Officer Jeffery H. Boyd.  "We were particularly pleased with results from Priceline Europe, where 4 quarter gross travel bookings of $158 million represented an organic growth rate of 88% compared to the same quarter in the prior year (which assumes ownership of Bookings B.V. during the

Mr. Boyd continued, "Domestically, priceline.com continues to focus on the integration of opaque and published-price travel offerings.   We believe that adding published-price services gives priceline.com the ability to satisfy a much broader spectrum of customers."

Today, priceline.com customers are greeted with an easy-to-compare, searchable grid of priceline.com's best published-prices, services and itineraries, along with the option to  for a travel service, or save money by purchasing a package.  In addition, priceline.com recommends money-saving travel alternatives, such as traveling on different dates or using a different airport.  Priceline's new website is being supported by a major advertising campaign and a new  best-price and quality guarantee. "Since opening our doors in 1998, priceline.com has saved customers more than $5 billion on their travel purchases," said Mr. Boyd. "Our goal in 2006 is to build on those savings by offering leisure travelers the number one destination for travel value."

 quarter.  Further, we believe that priceline can increase our full-year 2006 financial performance by driving this trend with marketing investments and further product enhancements in the 1 quarter.  We intend to continue to build out Priceline Europe, which we believe is one of the largest and fastest growing online hotel reservation services in Europe.  We also intend to explore ways to make priceline.com's global collection of travel services available to customers on both sides of the Atlantic. We expect that the first quarter of 2006 will include an increase of over $10 million compared to the first quarter 2005 in global online marketing expense in support of our retail hotel business.  Relative to our historical trends, we expect that a much higher percentage of the revenue generated from our online marketing expenditures will be recognized in future quarters at the time of the hotel stay.  Given the rapid growth in the retail hotel business, we anticipate a shift in our earnings seasonality, with higher seasonal earnings in the second and third quarters of 2006. With the investments we are making in this business, a supplier- and consumer-friendly service lineup and the efforts of our teams in the United States and Europe, we believe priceline.com is building a leadership position in worldwide online hotel sales."

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
Pro forma gross profit, pro forma net income and pro forma net income per share are "non-GAAP financial measures," as such term is defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and may differ from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.  Priceline.com believes that pro forma gross profit, pro forma net income and pro forma net income per share that exclude certain non-cash or non-recurring revenues or expenses are useful for investors to evaluate priceline.com's future on-going performance because they enable a more meaningful comparison of priceline.com's projected cash earnings and performance with its historical results from prior periods.  Pro forma financial information is adjusted for the following items:
 
 - 
                 
Amortization expense of acquisition-related intangibles is excluded from pro forma gross profit and pro forma net income because it does not impact cash earnings.
 - 
                 
Stock-based compensation expense and the non-cash expense associated with the payment of preferred stock dividends are excluded from pro forma net income because they do not impact cash earnings and are reflected in earnings per share through increased share counts.
 - 
                 
Option payroll tax expense often shows volatility unrelated to operating results since the expense is driven primarily by option exercise activity and the market price of priceline.com's common stock.
 - 
                 
The restructuring charge (reversal) is excluded because it can impact comparability of earnings with historical results from prior periods.
 - 
                 
Income tax (expense) benefit is adjusted for the tax impact of certain of the pro forma adjustments described above and to exclude tax expense recorded where no actual tax payments are owed because of available net operating loss carryforwards.
 - 
                 
Minority interest is adjusted for the impact of certain of the pro forma adjustments described above.
 - 
                 
Finally, for calculating pro forma net income per share:
 - 
                 
net income is adjusted for the impact of the pro forma adjustments described above
 - 
                 
the impact of EITF 04-08 (""), which requires that priceline.com use the "if-converted" method of accounting for convertible debt instruments when calculating earnings per share, has been excluded because the common stock that underlie priceline.com's 1% Convertible Senior Notes and priceline.com's 2.25% Convertible Senior Notes are generally not issuable unless our common stock trades at prices of $44.00 per share and $45.54 per share, respectively.
Effect of Contingently Convertible Debt on Diluted Earnings per Share
 - 
                 
All shares of restricted common stock are included in the calculation of pro forma net income per share because pro forma net income has been adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation expense.
 
The presentation of this financial information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.  The attached financial and statistical supplement reconciles pro forma financial information with priceline.com's financial results under GAAP.
