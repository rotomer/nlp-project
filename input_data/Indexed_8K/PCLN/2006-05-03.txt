Exhibit 99.1
 quarter 2006. Gross travel bookings for the quarter, which refers to the total dollar value, inclusive of all taxes and fees, of all travel services purchased by consumers, rose 47% year-over-year to $746.8 million. Revenues in the 1 quarter were $241.9 million, a 3.7% increase over a year ago. 2006 results include the operating results of Bookings B.V., which was acquired in July 2005.
     NORWALK, Conn., May 3, 2006 . . . Priceline.com Incorporated (Nasdaq: PCLN) today reported its financial results for the 1
st
st
 quarter 2006 was $72.2 million, up 25% from the prior year. Pro forma gross profit for the 1 quarter 2006 was $72.6 million, up 25% from the same period in the prior year. Priceline.com had a GAAP 1 quarter 2006 net loss of $1.0 million, or $0.02 per diluted share due primarily to increased non-cash expenses related to stock based compensation and amortization of intangibles. Stock based compensation increased by $2.3 million due mainly to the adoption of FAS 123R on January 1, 2006 which requires companies to record non-cash compensation expense related to stock options granted to employees. Amortization of intangibles increased by $2.4 million primarily due to intangible assets recorded in connection with the acquisition of Bookings B.V. in July 2005.

 quarter of 2005, and European organic bookings growth increased to over 100% in the quarter, up from approximately 88% last quarter," said priceline.com President and CEO, Jeffery Boyd. "As expected, most of this growth came from sales of retail hotel rooms supported by an increase of almost $12 million in online marketing spending in the first quarter. The revenue associated with these hotel bookings will be recognized at the time of stay, with a substantial portion of stays
"Priceline.com saw accelerating bookings growth in the U.S. and in Europe in the first quarter of 2006. Domestic organic bookings growth increased to approximately 10%, up from approximately 5% in the 4

occurring in subsequent quarters and contributing to future growth in gross profit dollars and operating income."  Organic gross travel bookings growth rates assume that acquired businesses were owned during all of 2005 and exclude the sale of Travelweb hotel rooms through Orbitz.
Mr. Boyd continued, "Earlier this year, priceline.com launched an enhanced U.S. website that gives customers More Ways to Save than any other major online travel service. Visitors to priceline.com now can browse an easy-to-compare searchable grid of published prices and itineraries. If they choose, they can also use priceline.com's Name Your Own Price service for greater savings. Priceline.com also will make suggestions if a change in travel plans will yield additional savings. These service enhancements are being supported by a new More Ways To Save-themed online and offline advertising campaign. Customers have reacted positively to the enhancements and to the campaign and priceline.com has experienced positive bookings trends for its domestic services this year, as evidenced by increased organic growth."
 quarter, Mr. Boyd said, "We feel that priceline.com's services and marketing message are well positioned for the upcoming summer travel season. Fuel prices could sharply increase the cost of a typical vacation, prompting many Americans to look for money saving travel options. This is when consumers think of priceline.com. Our comprehensive assortment of published prices will assist them in quickly locating the best available retail deals. Meanwhile, our Name Your Own Price hotel, air and rental car services will continue to deliver deep savings for budget-conscious travelers. In Europe, our team is continuing to build a leadership position in continental Europe and we are starting to see benefits from inventory integration and cross-Atlantic marketing initiatives. We believe that the outstanding top-line results achieved in Europe in the first quarter set the stage for strong earnings performance in the second and third quarters."

Pro forma net income is also adjusted for the impact on minority interests of the pro forma adjustments described above.  When aggregated the foregoing expenses are expected to total approximately $11 million for the 2
nd
 quarter 2006 and $40 million for full-year 2006. In addition, pro forma net income per diluted share guidance for 2006 excludes the impact of EITF 04-08 (""), which revises the method for calculating diluted shares outstanding for purposes of computing GAAP net income per diluted share.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Pro forma gross profit, pro forma net income and pro forma net income per share are "non-GAAP financial measures," as such term is defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and may differ from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Priceline.com believes that pro forma gross profit, pro forma net income and pro forma net income per share that exclude certain non-cash or non-recurring income or expense items are useful for investors to evaluate priceline.com's future on-going performance because they enable a more meaningful comparison of priceline.com's projected cash earnings and performance with its historical results from prior periods. Pro forma financial information is adjusted for the following items:
                 
Amortization expense of acquisition-related intangibles is excluded from pro forma gross profit and pro forma net income because it does not impact cash earnings.
                 
Stock-based compensation expense and the non-cash expense associated with the payment of preferred stock dividends are excluded from pro forma net income because they do not impact cash earnings and are reflected in earnings per share through increased share counts.
                 
Option payroll tax expense often shows volatility unrelated to operating results since the expense is driven primarily by option exercise activity and the market price of priceline.com's common stock.
                 
The restructuring charge (reversal) is excluded because it can impact comparability of earnings with historical results from prior periods.
                 
Income tax (expense) benefit is adjusted for the tax impact of certain of the pro forma adjustments described above and to exclude tax expense recorded where no actual tax payments are owed because of available net operating loss carryforwards.
                 
Minority interest is adjusted for the impact of certain of the pro forma adjustments described above.
                 
Finally, for calculating pro forma net income per share:
                 
net income is adjusted for the impact of the pro forma adjustments described above
                 
the impact of EITF 04-08 (""), which requires that priceline.com use the "if-converted" method of accounting for convertible debt instruments when calculating earnings per share, has been excluded because the common stock that underlie priceline.com's 1% Convertible Senior Notes and priceline.com's 2.25% Convertible Senior Notes are generally not issuable unless our common stock trades at prices of $44.00 per share and $45.54 per share, respectively.
Effect of Contingently Convertible Debt on Diluted Earnings per Share
                 
All shares of restricted common stock are included in the calculation of pro forma net income per share because pro forma net income has been adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation expense.
The presentation of this financial information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The attached financial and statistical supplement reconciles pro forma financial information with priceline.com's financial results under GAAP.
