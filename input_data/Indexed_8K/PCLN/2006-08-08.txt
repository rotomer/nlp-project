Item 7.01.              Regulation FD Disclosure
On August 7, 2006, priceline.com announced its financial results for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2006.  A copy of priceline.com's press release announcing these financial results and certain other information is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
 quarter 2006 when compared to the 2 quarter 2005.  Gross travel bookings refer to the total dollar value, inclusive of all taxes and fees, of all travel services purchased by consumers.  "Organic" gross travel bookings exclude the sale of Travelweb hotel rooms through Orbitz and assumes that priceline.com owned Bookings B.V., which was acquired in July 2005, during all of 2005.  Priceline.com stated that domestic "merchant" gross travel bookings increased approximately 5% in the 2 quarter 2006 compared to the same period in the prior year.  Priceline.com also noted that its general and administrative expenses in the 2 quarter 2006 were higher than previous guidance primarily as a result of approximately $900,000 of professional fees that were incurred for advisory services associated with acquisition activity that was pursued during the quarter.  The company noted that none of the activity came to fruition.
During its earnings conference call, priceline.com announced its "organic" gross travel bookings increased approximately 42.8% in the 2
nd
nd
nd
nd
 quarter 2006 was lower than the same period a year ago, which was primarily attributable to margin pressure on the sale of retail airline tickets and reduced GDS incentive income.  Priceline.com stated that in the 2 quarter 2006 it had approximately $25.1 million in net cash from operating activities and total capital expenditures of approximately $4.2 million.
Priceline.com announced that it continued to experience a year-over-year decrease in "opaque" airline ticket sales.  The company noted that the contribution to gross profit from the sale of airline tickets in the 2

With respect to 2006 guidance, priceline.com announced that it expected consolidated advertising expenses of approximately $40 to $44 million in the 3
rd
 quarter 2006 and expected approximately 80 to 85% of that amount to be spent "on-line."  Priceline.com estimated that sales and marketing expenses in the 3
rd
 quarter 2006 would be between $12 and $13 million.  Priceline.com stated that it expected personnel costs to be approximately $15.5 to $16.0 million in the 3

 quarter 2006.  With respect to 3
rd
 quarter 2006, priceline.com stated it expected general and administrative expenses of approximately $6.5 to $7.0 million, information technology expenses of approximately $2.6 to $2.8 million, and depreciation and amortization expenses, excluding acquisition related amortization, of approximately $2.7 million.  Priceline.com estimated that it would have cash income tax expense of approximately $7.0 million in the 3

 quarter 2006 comprised of alternative minimum tax in the United States and additional income taxes in Europe.

Priceline.com noted that it expected Priceline Europe to account for more than two-thirds of priceline.com's operating income for the second-half of 2006.  The company also emphasized that, while Priceline Europe had delivered to date substantially ahead of the company's expectations, it was likely that Priceline Europe's growth rates would slow as its performance was compared to 2
nd
 half 2005 results.
With respect to GAAP financial results, the company said it expected to report GAAP net income of approximately $0.29 to $0.34 per diluted share in the 3
rd
 quarter 2006 and expected GAAP net income for the full-year 2006 to be approximately $0.70 to $0.80 per diluted share.
The company also noted that it was in the midst of multi-party discussions and negotiations regarding airline "distribution costs" and "GDS incentives."  The company emphasized that those discussions and negotiations were on-going and that the outcome was uncertain.  The company noted that the forecasted amounts provided during the call assumed that approximately 2.5% to 3.5% of the company's total second half 2006 gross profit would come from GDS incentive fees.  The company emphasized, however, that because gross profit from GDS fees flowed directly to the company's bottom line, any performance above or below that range of guidance would directly impact forecasted bottom line guidance.

EXHIBIT INDEX
 

Exhibit 99.1
 quarter 2006.  Gross travel bookings for the quarter, which refers to the total dollar value, inclusive of all taxes and fees, of all travel services purchased by consumers, rose 62.8% year-over-year to $927 million.  Revenues in the 2 quarter were $307.7 million, a 15.4% increase over a year ago.  2006 results include the operating results of Bookings B.V., which was acquired in July 2005.
NORWALK, Conn., August 7, 2006 . . . Priceline.com Incorporated (Nasdaq: PCLN) today reported its financial results for the 2
nd
nd
 quarter 2006 was $105.8 million, up 62.2% from the prior year.  Pro forma gross profit for the 2 quarter 2006 was $106.1 million, up 61.9% from the same period in the prior year.  Priceline.com had 2 quarter 2006 GAAP net income of $12.5 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, compared to $0.29 in the prior year.  GAAP results include the effects of increased non-cash expenses related to stock based compensation and amortization of intangibles.  Stock based compensation increased by $2.7 million, due mainly to FAS 123R, which requires companies to record non-cash compensation expense related to stock options granted to employees. Amortization of intangibles increased by $2.7 million, primarily due to intangible assets recorded in connection with the acquisition of Bookings B.V. in July 2005.

Pro forma net income for the quarter, excluding these non-cash items and other pro forma adjustments discussed below, was $23.0 million, or $0.55 per diluted share, which exceeds First Call analyst consensus of $0.51 per diluted share.

 quarter in both the U.S. and in Europe.  "In the 2 quarter 2006, priceline.com experienced domestic organic bookings growth of 17.2%, compared to 10.2% growth the previous quarter, and 5.0% growth in the fourth quarter of 2005," said priceline.com President and Chief Executive Officer Jeffery H. Boyd.  "We had accelerating year-over-year growth trends in all our domestic unit metrics, with airline tickets growing 4.1% in the quarter, compared to a decrease of 2.6% in Q1, and rental car days up 30.3%, compared to an increase of 26.8% in Q1.  Hotel room night sales increased 82.5%, versus 62.5% in Q1, on the strength of growing sales from Priceline Europe.  As in the first quarter, we believe improving domestic top line performance resulted from the website upgrade and associated advertising campaign and investments in online marketing, including our partnership with Orbitz.com."  Organic gross travel bookings growth rates assume that acquired businesses were owned during all of 2005 and exclude the sale of Travelweb hotel rooms through Orbitz.
Priceline.com said that organic growth in gross travel bookings accelerated in the 2

 quarter year-over-year growth was even more pronounced.  Priceline Europe, comprised of Bookings, B.V., Active Hotels Ltd., and priceline.co.uk, had gross travel bookings of $356.6 million in the 2 quarter 2006, which represents an organic growth rate of 116.9%.  "Priceline Europe has shown strong growth in the last few quarters as the fast growing markets in Western Europe become a larger part of the overall business," said Mr. Boyd.  "Over 24,000 participating hotels, solid pan-European distribution and early success in our integration efforts are all contributing to this momentum.  Worldwide, priceline.com customers booked 5 million room nights in the 2 quarter.  We believe priceline.com is now number one in Europe and number two globally in online hotel room night sales."

 quarter, Mr. Boyd said, "Priceline.com is in a unique position to help leisure travelers squeezed this year by record energy prices, rising interest rates and increasing air fares.  Our Name Your Own Price hotel and rental car services deliver some of the best deals available on or off the Web.    Priceline.com's vacation packages service routinely offers pricing meaningfully below our major online competitors.  Our new comprehensive assortment of published prices for airline tickets, hotel rooms and rental cars provides customers with an easy, one-stop way to quickly find the best available retail deals.  And overseas, Priceline Europe enables customers to book hotels and deals they simply cannot find through any other major online hotel reservation service.  As economic conditions continue to put a focus on budget travel through the summer and into the holiday season, we believe priceline.com is well positioned to serve our customers and build on our solid growth trends."

Forward Guidance

Priceline.com issued the following guidance for 3
rd
Year-over-year increases in overall gross travel bookings of approximately 44% to 48%.
                 
Gross travel bookings from Priceline Europe of approximately $360 to $390 million.
                 
Year-over-year increase in revenue of approximately 13% to 17%.

Total gross travel bookings of approximately $3.2 to $3.3 billion.

A reconciliation of pro forma financial results to GAAP results is included in the attached financial and statistical supplement. Pro forma gross profit guidance for the 3
rd
 quarter 2006 and full-year 2006 excludes non-cash amortization expense of acquisition-related intangibles associated with the acquisition of Travelweb LLC.
Pro forma net income per diluted share guidance for the 3
rd
  quarter 2006 and full-year 2006 excludes non-cash amortization expense of acquisition-related intangibles, stock-based compensation expense (including compensation expense related to stock options upon the adoption of SFAS 123(R)), option payroll tax expense, non-cash income tax expense and non-cash preferred stock dividends.  Pro forma net income is also adjusted for the impact on minority interests of the pro forma adjustments described above.   When aggregated, the foregoing expenses are expected to total approximately $11 million for the 3
rd
 quarter 2006 and $40 million for full-year 2006.  In addition, pro forma net income per diluted share guidance for 2006 excludes the impact of EITF 04-08 (""), which revises the method for calculating diluted shares outstanding for purposes of computing GAAP net income per diluted share.

The following factors, among others, could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements:
      
adverse changes in general market conditions for leisure and  other travel services as the result of, among other things, terrorist attacks, natural disasters, or the outbreak of an epidemic or pandemic disease;
      
adverse changes in the Company's relationships with airlines and other product and  service providers which could include, without limitation, the withdrawal of suppliers from the priceline.com system (either priceline.com's retail or "opaque" services, or both);
      
the loss or reduction of global distribution fees;
      
the bankruptcy or insolvency of another major domestic airline;
      
the effects of increased competition;
      
systems-related failures and/or security breaches, including without limitation, any security breach that results in the theft, transfer or unauthorized disclosure of customer information, or the failure to comply with various state laws applicable to the company's obligations in the event of such a breach;
      
difficulties integrating recent acquisitions, such as Active Hotels Ltd. and Bookings B.V., including, ensuring the effectiveness of the design and operation of internal controls and disclosure controls of acquired businesse s;
      
a change by a major search engine to its search engine algorithms that negatively affects the search engine ranking of the company or its 3
rd
 party distribution partners;
      
legal and regulatory risks; and
      
the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel.
For a detailed discussion of these and other factors that could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements, please refer to the Company's most recent Form 10-Q, Form 10-K and Form 8-K filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Unless required by law, the Company undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Pro forma gross profit, pro forma net income and pro forma net income per share are "non-GAAP financial measures," as such term is defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and may differ from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.  Priceline.com believes that pro forma gross profit, pro forma net income and pro forma net income per share that exclude certain non-cash or non-recurring income or expense items are useful for investors to evaluate

priceline.com's future on-going performance because they enable a more meaningful comparison of priceline.com's projected cash earnings and performance with its historical results from prior periods.  Pro forma financial information is adjusted for the following items:
                 
Amortization expense of acquisition-related intangibles is excluded from pro forma gross profit and pro forma net income because it does not impact cash earnings.
                 
Stock-based compensation expense and the non-cash expense associated with the payment of preferred stock dividends are excluded from pro forma net income because they do not impact cash earnings and are reflected in earnings per share through increased share counts.
                 
Option payroll tax expense often shows volatility unrelated to operating results since the expense is driven primarily by option exercise activity and the market price of priceline.com's common stock.
                 
The restructuring charge (reversal) is excluded because it can impact comparability of earnings with historical results from prior periods.
                 
Income tax (expense) benefit is adjusted for the tax impact of certain of the pro forma adjustments described above and to exclude tax expense recorded where no actual tax payments are owed because of available net operating loss carryforwards.
                 
Minority interest is adjusted for the impact of certain of the pro forma adjustments described above.
                 
Finally, for calculating pro forma net income per share:
                 
net income is adjusted for the impact of the pro forma adjustments described above
                 
the impact of EITF 04-08 (""), which requires that priceline.com use the "if-converted" method of accounting for convertible debt instruments when calculating earnings per share, has been excluded because the common stock that underlie priceline.com's 1% Convertible Senior Notes and priceline.com's 2.25% Convertible Senior Notes are generally not issuable unless our common stock trades at prices of $44.00 per share and $45.54 per share, respectively.
Effect of Contingently Convertible Debt on Diluted Earnings per Share
                 
All shares of restricted common stock are included in the calculation of pro forma net income per share because pro forma net income has been adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation expense.
The presentation of this financial information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.  The attached financial and statistical supplement reconciles pro forma financial information with priceline.com's financial results under GAAP.
