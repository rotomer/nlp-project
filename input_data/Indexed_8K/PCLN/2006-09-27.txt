Item 1.01.
        
On September 21, 2006, priceline.com Incorporated (the "Company") entered into a purchase agreement (the "Purchase Agreement") with Goldman Sachs & Co., as representative of itself and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, as the initial purchasers (collectively, the "Initial Purchasers"), under which the Company agreed to sell $150 million principal amount of 0.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2011 (plus up to an additional $22.5 million aggregate principal amount at the option of the Initial Purchasers) (the "2011 Notes"), and $150 million principal amount of 0.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2013 (plus up to an additional $22.5 million aggregate principal amount at the option of the Initial Purchasers) (the "2013 Notes," and along with the 2011 Notes, the "Notes") in a private placement in reliance on Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"). Under the Purchase Agreement, the Initial Purchasers may resell the Notes to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the Act, at a price equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount. The Purchase Agreement is attached hereto at Exhibit 10.1, and is incorporated herein by reference.
The sale of $300 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes to the Initial Purchasers was completed on September 27, 2006. The Company's net proceeds from the sale of the notes are estimated to be approximately $291.8 million after deducting the discount to the Initial Purchasers and estimated offering expenses.
On September 21, 2006, the Company entered into hedge transactions with respect to the Notes and the Company's common stock, par value $0.008 per share (the "purchased call options") with affiliates of the Initial Purchasers (the "dealers"). The Company will use a portion of the net proceeds from the sale of the Notes to pay the net cost of the purchased call options. The purchased call options increase the effective conversion price of the Notes from the Company's perspective and are expected to reduce the potential dilution upon conversion of the Notes if the market price of the Company's common stock is greater than $50.47 per share. If the market value per share of the Company's common stock at the time of any exercise under the purchased call options is above such strike price, the purchased call options will entitle the Company to receive from the dealers net shares of the Company's common stock based on the excess of the then current market price of the Company's common stock over the strike price of the purchased call options.
The purchased call options are separate transactions entered into by the Company with the dealers, are not part of the terms of the Notes and will not affect the holders' rights under the Notes. Holders of the Notes will not have any rights with respect to the purchased call options. Confirmations of each of the call option transactions are attached hereto as Exhibits 10.2, 10.3, 10.4 and 10.5, and are incorporated herein by reference.

(ix)
      
Neither the Company nor any of the Scheduled Subsidiaries is in violation of its Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws or in default in the performance or observance of any obligation, covenant or condition contained in any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement, lease or other agreement or instrument to which it is a party or by which it or any of its properties may be bound except for such defaults which would not individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on the current or future consolidated financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole;
(x)        The issue and sale of the Securities and the compliance by the Company with all of the provisions of the Securities, the Indenture and this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions herein and therein contemplated will not (1) conflict with or result in a breach or violation of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under, any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement or other agreement or instrument known to such counsel to which the Company or any of the Scheduled Subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company or any of the Scheduled Subsidiaries is bound or to which any of the property or assets of the Company or any of the Scheduled Subsidiaries is subject, (2) result in any violation of the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws of the Company or (3) result in any violation of the provisions of any statute or any order, rule or regulation of any court or governmental agency or body having jurisdiction over the Company or any of the Scheduled Subsidiaries or any of their properties except in the case of clauses (1) and (3) above which would not individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on the current or future consolidated financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole;
(xi)
      
The documents incorporated by reference in the Offering Circular or any further amendment or supplement thereto, made by the Company prior to such Time of Delivery (other than the financial statements and related schedules therein, as to which such counsel need express no opinion), when they were filed with the Commission, as the case may be, complied as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Act or the Exchange Act, as applicable, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder; and they have no reason to believe that any of such documents, when they were so filed, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;

(f)        On or after the Applicable Time (i) no downgrading shall have occurred in the rating accorded the Company's debt securities or preferred stock by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization", as that term is defined by the Commission for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Act, and (ii) no such organization shall have publicly announced that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, its rating of any of the Company's debt securities or preferred stock;

9.         (a)  The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Purchaser against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Purchaser may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Offering Circular, the Pricing Circular, the Offering Circular, or any amendment or supplement thereto, any Company Supplemental Disclosure Document, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse each Purchaser for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Purchaser in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; , , that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in any Preliminary Offering Circular, the Pricing Circular, the Offering Circular or any such amendment or supplement, or any Company Supplemental Disclosure Document, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Purchaser through Goldman, Sachs & Co. expressly for use therein.
provided
however
(b)       Each Purchaser will indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Offering Circular, the Pricing Circular, the Offering Circular, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Company Supplemental Disclosure Document, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue
16
 
statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in any Preliminary Offering Circular, the Pricing Circular, or the Offering Circular or any such amendment or supplement, or any Company Supplemental Disclosure Document in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Purchaser through Goldman, Sachs & Co. expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred.
(c)       Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection.  In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation.  No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
(d)       If the indemnification provided for in this Section 9 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Purchasers on the other from the offering of the Securities.  If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Purchasers on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Purchasers on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Purchasers, in each case as set forth in the Offering Circular.  The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged
17
 
untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or the Purchasers on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.  The Company and the Purchasers agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Purchasers were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d).  The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Purchaser shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to investors were offered to investors exceeds the amount of any damages which such Purchaser has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.  The Purchasers' obligations in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.
(e)       The obligations of the Company under this Section 8 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to any affiliate of each Purchaser and each person, if any, who controls any Purchaser within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of the Purchasers under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Purchasers may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act.
10.       (a)  If any Purchaser shall default in its obligation to purchase the Securities which it has agreed to purchase hereunder, you may in your discretion arrange for you or another party or other parties to purchase such Securities on the terms contained herein.  If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Purchaser you do not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to you to purchase such Securities on such terms.  In the event that, within the respective prescribed periods, you notify the Company that you have so arranged for the purchase of such Securities or the Company notifies you that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, you or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Time of Delivery for a period of not more than  seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Offering Circular, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to prepare promptly any amendments to the Offering Circular which in your opinion may thereby be made necessary.

Dealer may divide any Component into additional Components and designate the Expiration Date and the Number of Options for each such Component if Dealer determines, in its reasonable discretion, that such further division is necessary or advisable to preserve Dealer's hedging activity hereunder in light of existing liquidity conditions or to enable Dealer to effect purchases of Shares in connection with its hedging activity hereunder in a manner that would, if Dealer were Counterparty or an affiliated purchaser of Counterparty, be compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements.

If any obligation is unascertained, Y may in good faith estimate that obligation and set-off in respect of the estimate, subject to the relevant party accounting to the other when the obligation is ascertained.
Nothing in this Section 6(f) shall be effective to create a charge or other security interest.  This Section 6(f) shall be without prejudice and in addition to any right of set-off, combination of accounts, lien or other right to which any party is at any time otherwise entitled (whether by operation of law, contract or otherwise)."

If any delivery owed to Dealer hereunder is not made, in whole or in part, as a result of this provision, Counterparty's obligation to make such delivery shall not be extinguished and Counterparty shall make such delivery as promptly as practicable after, but in no event later than one Exchange Business Day after, Dealer gives notice to Counterparty that such delivery would not result in Dealer Group directly or indirectly so beneficially owning in excess of 9.5% of the outstanding Shares.

10.   .   Dealer may divide any Component into additional Components and designate the Expiration Date and the Number of Options for each such Component if Dealer determines, in its reasonable discretion, that such further division is necessary or advisable to preserve Dealer's hedging activity hereunder in light of existing liquidity conditions or to enable Dealer to effect purchases of Shares in connection with its hedging activity hereunder in a manner that would, if Dealer were Counterparty or an affiliated purchaser of Counterparty, be compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements.

In the event that Dealer so designates an Early Termination Date with respect to a portion of this Transaction, a payment shall be made pursuant to Section 6 of the Agreement as if (i) an Early Termination Date had been designated in respect of a Transaction having terms identical to this Transaction and a Number of Options equal to the Terminated Portion, (ii) Counterparty shall be the Affected Party with respect to such partial termination and (iii) such portion of this Transaction shall be the only Terminated Transaction.

If any delivery owed to Dealer hereunder is not made, in whole or in part, as a result of this provision, Counterparty's obligation to make such delivery shall not be extinguished and Counterparty shall make such delivery as promptly as practicable after, but in no event later than one Exchange Business Day after, Dealer gives notice to Counterparty that such delivery would not result in Dealer Group directly or indirectly so beneficially owning in excess of 9.5% of the outstanding Shares.

10.   .   Dealer may divide any Component into additional Components and designate the Expiration Date and the Number of Options for each such Component if Dealer determines, in its reasonable discretion, that such further division is necessary or advisable to preserve Dealer's hedging activity hereunder in light of existing liquidity conditions or to enable Dealer to effect purchases of Shares in connection with its hedging activity hereunder in a manner that would, if Dealer were Counterparty or an affiliated purchaser of Counterparty, be compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements.
