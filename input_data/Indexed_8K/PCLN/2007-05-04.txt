Except for their obligation to pay the Settlement Amount, and to cooperate in the production of information with respect to the identification of Class Members from Priceline.com's shareholder transfer records, as provided herein, Settling Defendants shall have no liability, obligation or responsibility for the administration of the Settlement or disbursement of the Net Settlement Fund.  Class Plaintiffs' Counsel shall have the right, but not the obligation, to advise the Claims Administrator to waive what Class Plaintiffs' Counsel deem to be formal or technical defects in any Proofs of Claim submitted in the interests of achieving substantial justice.

(b)           All Proofs of Claim must be submitted by the date specified in the Notice, unless such period is extended by Order of the Court.  Any Class Member who fails to submit a Proof of Claim by such date shall be forever barred from receiving any payment pursuant to this Stipulation (unless, by Order of the Court, a later submitted Proof of Claim by such Class Member is approved), but shall in all other respects be bound by all of the terms of this Stipulation and the Settlement including the terms of the Judgment to be entered in the Action and the releases provided for herein, and will be barred from bringing any action against the Released Parties concerning the Settled Claims.

first-class mail and addressed in accordance with the instructions thereon.  In all other cases, the Proof of Claim shall be deemed to have been submitted when actually received by the Claims Administrator;
(c)           Each Proof of Claim shall be submitted to and reviewed by the Claims Administrator, who shall determine in accordance with this Stipulation and the approved Plan of Allocation the extent, if any, to which each claim shall be allowed, subject to review by the Court pursuant to subparagraph (e) below;
(d)           Proofs of Claim that do not meet the submission requirements may be rejected.  Prior to rejection of a Proof of Claim, the Claims Administrator shall communicate with the Claimant in order to remedy the curable deficiencies in the Proofs of Claim submitted.

If a dispute concerning a claim cannot be otherwise resolved, Class Plaintiffs' Counsel shall thereafter present the request for review to the Court; and
(f)            The administrative determinations of the Claims Administrator accepting and rejecting claims shall be presented to the Court, on notice to Settling Defendants' Counsel, for approval by the Court in the Class Distribution Order.
16.           Each Claimant shall be deemed to have submitted to the jurisdiction of the Court with respect to the Claimant's claim, and the claim will be subject to investigation and discovery under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, provided that such investigation and discovery shall be limited to that Claimant's status as a Class Member and the validity and amount of the Claimant's claim.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 quarter of 2007, representing the settlement amount and estimated legal expenses relating to the settlement.
NORWALK, Conn., May 4, 2007  Priceline.com Incorporated (Nasdaq: PCLN) (the "Company") announced today that it had agreed to settle the securities class action litigation that was filed against the Company in 2000.  Under the terms of the settlement agreement, the class will receive $80 million in return for a release, with prejudice, of all claims against the Company and the individual defendants that are related to the purchase of the Company's securities by class members during the class period.  The Company's insurance carriers will fund $30 million of the settlement.  The settlement is subject to approval by the Court after notice to the class.  In connection with the settlement announced today, the Company expects to incur a net charge of approximately $55 million in the 1
st
 
 quarter.  The Company said that it expects to report 1 quarter 2007 year-over-year gross travel bookings growth of approximately 34%, which was driven primarily by an approximately 91% year-over-year increase in gross travel bookings from its European operations.  The consolidated year-over-year gross travel bookings growth compares to the Company's prior guidance of between 25% and 30%.  Gross travel bookings refer to the total dollar value, inclusive of all taxes and fees, of all travel services purchased by consumers.  The Company said that pro forma net income per share was favorably impacted by the strong gross travel bookings performance in Europe, continued growth in domestic merchant gross travel bookings and good expense management.  The Company now expects to report pro forma net income (which excludes, among other things, the impact of the litigation settlement expenses and the excise tax refund referred to below) of $0.43 per diluted share in the 1 quarter 2007.  This compares to the Company's prior range of pro forma net income guidance of between $0.22 and $0.28 per diluted share.  The Company expects to report a GAAP net loss (which includes, among other things, the impact of the litigation settlement expenses and the excise tax refund referred to below) of $0.44 per diluted share in the 1 quarter 2007.
The Company also provided an estimate of operating results for its recently completed 1
st
st
st
st
 quarter 2007 financial results and full-year 2007 financial guidance when it announces its 1 quarter 2007 results on May 8.  The section below entitled "" provides information about the use of pro forma financial measures used in this press release and a reconciliation of pro forma and GAAP results is attached to this press release.
In addition, the company announced that it was increasing full-year 2007 pro forma financial guidance and is now targeting full-year 2007 pro forma net income of approximately $2.90 to $3.10 per diluted share. This compares to the Company's prior range of full-year 2007 pro forma net income guidance of between $2.60 and $2.90 per diluted share. The revised full-year 2007 pro forma net income per share estimate is based upon an estimated pro forma fully diluted share count of approximately 42.2 million shares. The estimate of pro forma fully diluted share count uses actual year-to-date stock price data as well as future stock prices based on the closing price of the Company's stock as of May 3, 2007 to calculate the potential dilutive impact of stock options and convertible debt.  Any material increases or decreases in priceline.com's stock price will impact the number of fully diluted shares outstanding, which in turn would impact the company's net income per diluted share results. The Company intends to provide more details on its 1

th
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 quarter 2007 related to the March notice and approximately $3 million of income in the 2 quarter 2007 related to the April notice associated with the tax refund, including estimated accrued interest.  The Company expects the refund to positively impact 1 and 2 quarter 2007 GAAP results but intends to exclude the amounts from pro forma results because of its non-recurring nature.
The Company also announced that in March and April it had received definitive notice from the Internal Revenue Service that the Company's previously disclosed refund request for excise taxes paid on merchant airline tickets had been approved for payment.  As a result, the Company expects to record approximately $18.7 million of income in the 1
st
nd
st
nd
 quarter 2007 pro forma net income per diluted share:
The estimate of 1
st
                 
excludes cash expenses associated with the settlement of the 2000 securities litigation,
                 
excludes the cash benefit associated with the refund of excise taxes (and related accrued interest) paid on merchant airline tickets,
                 
excludes non-cash amortization expense of acquisition-related intangibles,
 
                 
excludes non-cash stock-based compensation expense,
                 
excludes option payroll tax expense,
                 
excludes non-cash income tax expense and reflects the impact on income taxes of the pro forma adjustments,
                 
excludes non-cash preferred stock dividends,
                 
includes the additional impact on minority interest expense of the pro forma adjustments described above,
                 
includes the anti-dilutive impact of the "Conversion Spread Hedges" (see below) on outstanding diluted common shares outstanding, and
                 
includes the dilutive impact of additional warrants and shares of unvested restricted stock and restricted stock units.
When aggregated, the foregoing adjustments are expected to increase pro forma net income over GAAP net income by approximately $34 million in the 1st quarter 2007.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Pro forma net income and pro forma net income per share are "non-GAAP financial measures," as such term is defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and may differ from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Priceline.com believes that pro forma net income per share that exclude certain non-cash or non-recurring income or expense items are useful for investors to evaluate priceline.com's future on-going performance because they enable a more meaningful comparison of priceline.com's projected cash earnings and performance with its historical results from prior periods. Pro forma financial information is adjusted for the following items:
                 
Cash expenses associated with the settlement of the 2000 securities litigation are excluded because of the non-recurring nature of the settlement.
                 
Cash benefit associated with the refund of excise taxes paid on merchant airline tickets that was approved for payment by the Internal Revenue Service is excluded because of its non-recurring nature.
                 
Amortization expense of acquisition-related intangibles is excluded from pro forma net income because it does not impact cash earnings.
                 
Stock-based compensation expense and the non-cash expense associated with the payment of preferred stock dividends are excluded from pro forma net income because they do not impact cash earnings and are reflected in earnings per share through increased share counts.
                 
Option payroll tax expense is excluded because the expense is driven primarily by stock option exercise activity and the market price of priceline.com's common stock and often shows volatility unrelated to operating results.
                 
The restructuring charge, net is excluded because it can impact comparability of earnings with historical results from prior periods.
                 
Income tax (expense) benefit is adjusted for the tax impact of certain of the pro forma adjustments described above and to exclude tax expense recorded where no actual tax payments are owed because of available net operating loss carryforwards.
                 
Minority interest is adjusted for the impact of certain of the pro forma adjustments described above.
                 
Finally, for calculating pro forma net income per share:
net income is adjusted for the impact of the pro forma adjustments described above.
o
                                        
The Company entered into hedge transactions (the "Conversion Spread Hedges") that increase the effective conversion price of the Convertible Senior Notes due September 30, 2011 and the Convertible Senior Notes due September 30, 2013 from their stated $40.38 conversion price to an effective conversion price of $50.47 per share.  Under GAAP, the anti-dilutive impact of the Conversion Spread Hedges is not reflected on the outstanding diluted share count until the end of the hedge when shares are delivered. The Company uses the effective conversion price of $50.47 per share in its calculation of pro forma net income per share because, as a result of the Conversion Spread Hedges, the Convertible Senior Notes will not cause any actual economic dilution to either the Company's outstanding diluted shares or its net income per share unless and until the Company's average common stock price for the period in question is above the effective conversion price of $50.47 per share.
o
                                        
All common stock warrants and shares of restricted common stock are included in the calculation of pro forma net income per share because pro forma net
