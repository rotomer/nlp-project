Priceline.com explained that current accrued liabilities in the 3 quarter 2007 increased due primarily to a $61 million payable associated with the buyback of minority interests in Priceline.com International Limited which was paid in October 2007.

With respect to 4 quarter 2007 guidance, the company noted that it expected domestic gross travel bookings to grow approximately 15% to 20% over the same period in the prior year. Priceline.com announced that it expected consolidated advertising expenses of approximately $51 to $54 million in the 4 quarter 2007 and expected approximately 85% to 90% of that amount to be spent "on-line."  Priceline.com estimated that sales and marketing expenses in the 4 quarter 2007 would be between $12.5 and $13.5 million. Priceline.com stated that it estimated that personnel costs, excluding stock-based compensation expense, would be approximately $23 to $24 million in the 4 quarter 2007. With respect to 4 quarter 2007, priceline.com stated it estimated that general and administrative expenses would be approximately $10.0 to $10.5 million, information technology expenses would be approximately $4.2 to $4.5 million, and depreciation and amortization expenses, excluding acquisition related amortization, would be approximately $3.6 million. Priceline.com said it expected an aggregate benefit of approximately $1.0 to $1.5 million in the 4 quarter 2007 associated with "net" interest income, foreign exchange expense, equity in income of Priceline Mortgage and minority interest expense. Priceline.com estimated that it would have cash income tax expense of approximately $8.0 million in the 4 quarter 2007 comprised of alternative minimum tax in the United States and additional income taxes in Europe.

The company noted that its 4 quarter 2007 "pro forma" financial guidance was based upon a "pro forma" diluted share count of approximately 47 million shares (which includes a calculation of the assumed economic dilutive impact of all of the company's outstanding convertible notes and stock options, net of the favorable economic impact of the hedges associated with the company's outstanding convertible notes), which is based on the company's November 7, 2007 closing stock price of $90.31. The company emphasized, as it had on its prior earnings conference call, that the calculation of diluted shares outstanding  and, as a result, the calculation of "pro forma" net income per diluted share  could be materially affected by the trading levels of its stock and that the "pro forma" share count represented a substantial increase
th
on both an annual and quarterly sequential basis as a result of the increase in the company's stock price.

Date:  November 9, 2007

Exhibit 99.1
 
NORWALK, Conn., November 8, 2007 . . . Priceline.com Incorporated (Nasdaq: PCLN) today reported its financial results for the 3 quarter 2007. Gross travel bookings for the 3 quarter, which refers to the total dollar value, inclusive of all taxes and fees, of all travel services purchased by consumers, rose 54.0% year-over-year to $1.39 billion.
rd
rd
 
Priceline.com had GAAP revenues in the 3 quarter of $417.3 million, a 33.1% increase over a year ago. Priceline.com's GAAP gross profit for the 3 quarter was $202.3 million, a 63.8% increase from the prior year. Priceline.com had GAAP net income for the 3 quarter 2007 of $104.4 million or $2.27 per diluted share, which compares to $47.8 million or $1.05 per diluted share in the same period a year ago. GAAP net income for the 3 quarter 2007 was positively affected by a $47.9 million non-cash tax benefit from reversing a portion of priceline.com's deferred tax asset valuation allowance in the period. GAAP net income for the 3 quarter 2006 was positively affected by a similar $28.1 million non-cash tax benefit.

rd
rd
rd
 
Priceline.com reported pro forma revenues in the 3 quarter of $416.9 million, a 33.7% increase over a year ago. Pro forma gross profit for the 3 quarter 2007 was $201.9 million, an increase of 65.1% over the same period in the prior year. Pro forma net income for the quarter was $71.5 million or $1.58 per diluted share, which compares to $30.2 million, or $0.72 per diluted share in the same period a year ago. First Call analyst consensus for the 3 quarter 2007 was $1.28 per diluted share. The section below entitled "" provides a definition and information about the use of pro forma financial measures in this press release and the attached financial and statistical supplement reconciles pro forma financial information with priceline.com's financial results under GAAP.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
The non-cash income tax benefit in the 3rd quarter of 2007 was recorded pursuant to the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, which requires a company to release a portion of its deferred tax asset valuation allowance when it becomes more likely than not that it will realize all or some portion of its deferred tax asset. The
company released a portion of its valuation allowance in the 3rd quarter 2007 after taking into consideration current operating results and future prospects. While priceline.com does not expect to pay cash U.S. federal income taxes on its income for the foreseeable future, priceline.com records a mostly non-cash provision for U.S. income tax expense in its consolidated financial statements. Priceline.com makes cash tax payments for U.S. alternative minimum taxes and for certain international taxes.
"Priceline.com's over-performance in the 3 quarter was driven by a combination of what we believe to be continued market-leading growth in our Booking.com international business and strong quarterly results from our domestic product lines," said priceline.com President and Chief Executive Officer Jeffery H. Boyd. "Despite increasingly challenging quarterly comparables, Booking.com recorded a 97.9% increase in gross travel bookings compared to a year ago. Booking.com's team has been very effective in growing its business throughout Europe and in the U.S. and other international markets."
rd
 
Mr. Boyd continued, "During the 3 quarter, priceline.com's domestic gross travel bookings increased by 19% on increasing merchant hotel and rental car sales and a 23% increase in airline ticket sales principally tied to our no-booking-fee promotion. Despite the loss of margin on retail ticket sales, year-over-year domestic operating margins were up substantially."
rd
 
Looking forward, Mr. Boyd said, "Priceline is directing its key assets and resources to building the leading worldwide online hotel business. Our results this year reflect the strength of our products and operations. They also reflect the benefits of our businesses supporting each other by sharing regional demand and hotel supply, technology and business know-how. With good momentum in Europe and the U.S., we believe the Agoda transaction, also announced today, represents a positive step in developing the same supportive dynamics in Asia, which we believe will help us build a meaningful presence in that important market."
 
Forward Guidance
 
Priceline.com said it was targeting the following for 4 quarter 2007:
th
 
Year-over-year increases in overall gross travel bookings of approximately 50%.
 - 
                
Year-over-year increases in gross travel bookings from Booking.com of approximately 90% to 95%.
 - 
                
Year-over-year increase in pro forma revenue of approximately 22% to 26%.
 - 
                
Year-over-year increase in pro forma gross profit of approximately 50%.
 - 
                
Pro forma net income of between $0.77 and $0.85 per diluted share.
 - 
                
 
Pro forma guidance for the 4 quarter 2007:
th
 
 - 
                
excludes non-cash amortization expense of acquisition-related intangibles,
 
 - 
&# 160;               
excludes non-cash stock-based compensation expense,
 
 - 
                
excludes option payroll tax expense,
 
2
 
 - 
                
excludes non-cash income tax expense and reflects the impact on income taxes of the pro forma adjustments,
 
 - 
                
includes the additional impact on minority interest expense of the pro forma adjustments described above,
 
 - 
        & #160;       
includes the anti-dilutive impact of the "Conversion Spread Hedges" (see below) on outstanding diluted common shares outstanding, and
 
 - 
                
includes the dilutive impact of additional shares of unvested restricted stock and restricted stock units (including performance share units) because pro forma net income has been adjusted to exclude preferred stock dividend and stock-based compensation.
 
When aggregated, the foregoing adjustments are expected to increase pro forma net income over GAAP net income by approximately $12 million for the 4 quarter 2007. On a per share basis, the Company estimates GAAP net income of approximately $0.51 to $0.59 per diluted share for the 4th quarter 2007.
th
 
The Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") is expected to adopt a FASB Staff Position ("FSP") that would significantly impact the accounting for convertible debt. The FSP would require cash settled convertible debt to be separated into debt and equity components at issuance and a value to be assigned to each. The value assigned to the debt component would be the estimated fair value, as of the issuance date, of a similar bond without the conversion feature. The difference between the bond cash proceeds and this estimated fair value would be recorded as a debt discount and amortized to interest expense over the life of the bond.
 
Although the FSP would have no impact on priceline.com's actual past or future cash flows, it would require priceline.com to record a significant amount of non-cash interest expense as the debt discount is amortized.
 
As a result, there would be a material adverse impact on priceline's reported GAAP results of operations and earnings per share. The FSP, if adopted, will become effective January 1, 2008 for priceline and require retrospective application.

Unless required by law, the Company undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
 
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
Pro forma revenue, Pro forma gross profit, pro forma net income and pro forma net income per share are "non-GAAP financial measures," as such term is defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and may differ from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Priceline.com believes that pro forma revenue, pro forma gross profit, pro forma net income and pro forma net income per share that exclude certain non-cash or non-recurring income or expense items are useful for investors to evaluate priceline.com's future on-going performance because they enable a more meaningful comparison of priceline.com's projected cash earnings and performance with its historical results from prior periods. Pro forma financial information is adjusted for the following items:
 
 - 
                
Cash expenses associated with the settlement of the 2000 securities litigation are excluded because of the non-recurring nature of the settlement.
 
 - 
                
Cash benefit associated with the refund of excise taxes paid on merchant airline tickets that was approved for payment by the Internal Revenue Service is excluded because of its non-recurring nature.
 
 - 
                
Amortization expense of acquisition-related intangibles is excluded from pro forma gross profit and pro forma net income because it does not impact cash earnings.
 
 - 
                
Stock-based compensation expense and the non-cash expense associated with the payment of preferred stock dividends are excluded from pro forma net income because they do not impact cash earnings and are reflected in earnings per share through increased share counts.
 
 - 
                
Option payroll tax expense is excluded because the expense is driven primarily by stock option exercise activity and the market price of priceline.com's common stock and often shows volatility unrelated to operating results.
 
 - 
                
The restructuring charge, net is excluded because it can impact comparability of earnings with historical results from prior periods.
Income tax expense is adjusted for the tax impact of certain of the pro forma adjustments described above and to exclude tax expense recorded where no actual tax payments are owed because of available net operating loss carry forwards. In addition, pro forma income tax expense is adjusted to exclude the non-cash tax benefit from reversing a portion of priceline.com's deferred tax asset valuation allowance. This benefit amounted to $47.9 million in 3rd quarter 2007 and $28.1 million in 3rd quarter 2006.
 - 
                
 
 - 
                
Minority interest is adjusted for the impact of certain of the pro forma adjustments described above.
 
 - 
                
Finally, for calculating pro forma net income per share:
 
 - 
                
net income is adjusted for the impact of the pro forma adjustments described above
 
fully diluted share count is adjusted to include the anti-dilutive impact of  priceline.com's  "Conversion Spread Hedges" related to priceline.com's convertibles securities that increase the effective conversion price of the 0.50% convertible notes due 2011 and 0.75% convertible notes due 2013 from their stated $40.38 conversion price to an effective conversion price of $50.47 per share.  Under GAAP, the anti-dilutive impact of the Conversion Spread Hedges is not reflected on the outstanding diluted share count until the end of the hedge when shares are delivered.
 - 
                
 
fully diluted share count in 2006 is adjusted to exclude the impact of EITF 04-08 ("Effect of Contingently Convertible Debt on Diluted Earnings per Share"), because the common stock that underlie priceline.com's 1.0% convertible notes due 2011 and priceline.com's 2.25% convertible notes due 2025 were not issuable because our common stock did not trade above the respective contingent conversion prices.
 - 
                
 
 - 
                
All common stock warrants and unvested shares of restricted common stock, restricted stock units and performance share units are included in the calculation of pro forma net income per share because pro forma net income has been adjusted to exclude our preferred stock dividend and stock-based compensation expense.
 
The presentation of this financial information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The attached financial and statistical supplement reconciles pro forma financial information with priceline.com's financial results under GAAP.

The following table is intended to demonstrate the estimated potential impact of share price movements on the number of equivalent shares included in the fully diluted share count used to calculate diluted earnings per share. Actual results are likely to differ due to the impact of option exercises, equity repurchases, issuances and forfeitures and any conversions of our convertible bonds. The table below is for illustrative purposes only; the company is unable to predict its future stock price and the company's stock could trade below or above the per share prices in the table below.
