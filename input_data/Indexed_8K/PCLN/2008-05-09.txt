1 quarter earnings announcement
st
 
On May 8, 2008, priceline.com announced its financial results for the 1 quarter ended March 31, 2008.  A copy of priceline.com's press release announcing these financial results and certain other information is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
st
 
The company noted that its 1 quarter 2008 over-performance versus the company's prior gross travel bookings and pro forma net income forecast in February 2008 was primarily attributable to the favorable impact of currency exchange rates, better than expected on-line marketing efficiencies and better than expected performance from the company's domestic services.
st
 
With respect to 2 quarter 2008 guidance, the company noted that it expected domestic gross travel bookings to grow approximately 50% over the same period in the prior year.  Priceline.com announced that it expected consolidated advertising expenses of approximately $90   to $95 million in the 2 quarter 2008 and expected approximately 90% of that amount to be spent "on-line."  Priceline.com estimated that sales and marketing expenses in the 2 quarter 2008 would be between $18 and $19 million.  Priceline.com stated that it estimated that personnel costs, excluding stock-based compensation expense, would be approximately $30 to $32 million in the 2 quarter 2008.  With respect to 2 quarter 2008, priceline.com stated it estimated that general and administrative expenses would be approximately $12 to $13 million, information technology expenses would be approximately $5.5 to $6.0 million, and depreciation and amortization expenses, excluding acquisition related amortization, would be approximately $4.1 million.  Priceline.com said it expected an aggregate benefit of approximately $1.0 million in the 2 quarter 2008 associated with "net" interest income, foreign exchange hedging income, equity in income of Priceline Mortgage and minority interest expense.  Priceline.com estimated that it would have cash income tax expense of approximately $16 million in the 2 quarter 2008 comprised of additional income taxes in Europe and alternative minimum tax in the United States.
nd
nd
nd
nd
nd
nd
nd
 
With respect to its 2008 guidance, the company noted that its guidance was based on current observed trends in the business and not on an assumption that these trends will deteriorate in future months due to any economic downturn.  The company cautioned, however, that it was possible that the on-line travel category and the company could suffer beyond effects observed to date if economic conditions worsened.  The company noted that it was forecasting for the remainder of the 2 quarter 2008 and full-year 2008 a diminishment in the company's on-line advertising efficiencies on a year-over-year basis.  The company also noted that its forecasts assumed, among other things, that gross travel bookings growth rates would decrease on a quarterly sequential basis in the 3 and 4 quarters of 2008, that the Euro/U.S. Dollar exchange
nd
rd
th
rate would be 1.54 U.S. dollars per Euro, that the average daily rates for the company's domestic hotel service would continue to grow at approximately two to three percent year-over-year and that the average daily rates for the company's international hotel service would be roughly equivalent with 2007.  The company cautioned that if economic pressures impacted, among other things, hotel unit sales, hotel average daily rates or the value of the Euro relative to the U.S. Dollar, the company's forecasts could be at significant risk.
 
The company noted that its "pro forma" financial guidance was based upon a "pro forma" diluted share count of approximately 50.2 million shares (which includes a calculation of the assumed economic dilutive impact of all of the company's outstanding convertible notes and stock options, net of the favorable economic impact of the hedges associated with the company's outstanding convertible notes), which is based on the company's May 7, 2008 closing stock price of $122.03.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
"Priceline.com showed strong international and domestic growth in the 1 quarter," said Jeffery H. Boyd, priceline.com's President and Chief Executive Officer.  "Our international business, comprised of Booking.com and Agoda.com, achieved $1 billion in gross travel bookings for the quarter, an increase of 100% over the prior year (75.0% excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates).  Booking.com continues to add to its list of international hotels, with over 45,000 partners worldwide now, and is increasing its geographic reach in Europe and globally.  Agoda.com, the Asian online hotel reservation service acquired by priceline.com in 2007, while still small relative to our international gross travel bookings, made a positive contribution with solid bookings growth in the first quarter."
st
 
Mr. Boyd continued, "Domestically, priceline.com had its highest growth quarter in over three years, with gross travel bookings growth of 51%.  Our U.S. business was propelled principally by 83% growth in airline ticket unit sales, due primarily to accelerating year-over-year growth in retail ticket sales, and year-over-year growth in domestic merchant gross bookings, which accelerated to 26% in the first quarter, compared to 11% in the fourth quarter of 2007.  With economic pressures mounting as we entered 2008, we believe that our money-saving services and our value brand positioning made priceline.com attractive to budget-conscious travelers."
Name Your Own Price
 
Looking forward, Mr. Boyd said: "Priceline's goal is to build the leading worldwide online hotel reservation service by growing our major brands and tapping our global hotel supply and
customer flows to expand our presence in international travel.  Despite an uncertain economic environment, priceline's businesses have continued to perform well worldwide.  While we are concerned about the health of the economy and the impact of high oil prices on the financial health of the airline industry, we believe that consumers value our low price services and broad selection in times of economic uncertainty and suppliers value our opaque channel and broad international hotel distribution when business slows."
 
Forward Guidance
 
For full year 2008, priceline said that it expects to generate approximately $7.5 billion to $7.9 billion in gross travel bookings.  Priceline expects pro forma EBITDA of $340 million to $365 million and to earn approximately $5.25 to $5.65 of pro forma net income per diluted share for full year 2008.
 
Priceline.com said it was targeting the following for 2 quarter 2008:
nd
 
                 
Year-over-year increase in gross travel bookings of approximately 65 - 75%.
 
                 
Year-over-year increase in international gross travel bookings of approximately 80 - 90%.
 
                 
Year-over-year increase in revenue of approximately 35 - 40%.
 
                 
Year-over-year increase in pro forma gross profit of approximately 55 - 60%.
 
                 
Pro forma EBITDA of approximately $80 million to $90 million.
 
                 
Pro forma net income of between $1.25 and $1.40 per diluted share.
 
Pro forma guidance for the 2 quarter 2008:
nd
 
                 
excludes non-cash amortization expense of acquisition-related intangibles,
 
                 
excludes non-cash s tock-based compensation expense,
 
                 
excludes option payroll tax expense,
 
     & #160;           
excludes non-cash income tax expense and reflects the impact on income taxes of the pro forma adjustments,
 
                 
includes the additional impact on minority interest expense of the pro forma adjustments described above,
 
                 
includes the anti-dilutive impact of the "Conversion Spread Hedges" (see "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" below) on outstanding diluted common shares outstanding, and
 
                  
includes the dilutive impact of additional shares of unvested restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance share units because pro forma net income has been adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation.
 
In addition, pro forma EBITDA excludes depreciation and amortization expense and includes the impact of foreign currency transactions and other expenses.
 
When aggregated, the foregoing adjustments are expected to increase pro forma EBITDA over GAAP operating income by approximately $22 million and $90 million for 2nd quarter 2008 and full year 2008, respectively.
 
 
In addition, the foregoing adjustments are expected to increase pro forma net income over GAAP net income by approximately $23 million for the 2 quarter 2008 and by approximately $90 million for full year 2008.  On a per share basis, the Company estimates GAAP net income of approximately $0.80 to $0.95 per diluted share for the 2 quarter 2008 and approximately $3.50 to $3.90 per diluted share for full year 2008.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
Pro forma EBITDA represents GAAP operating income excluding depreciation and amortization expense, plus foreign currency transactions and other expense and the applicable pro forma adjustments described below.
 
Pro forma revenue, pro forma gross profit, pro forma EBITDA, pro forma net income and pro forma net income per share are "non-GAAP financial measures," as such term is defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and may differ from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.  Priceline.com believes that pro forma revenue, pro forma gross profit, pro forma EBITDA, pro forma net income and pro forma net income per share that exclude certain non-cash or non-recurring income or expense items are useful for analysts and investors to evaluate priceline.com's future on-going performance because they enable a more meaningful comparison of priceline.com's projected cash earnings and performance with its historical results from prior periods. These pro forma metrics, in particular pro forma EBITDA and pro forma net income, are not intended to represent funds available for priceline.com's discretionary use and are not intended to represent or to be used as a substitute for operating income, net income or cash flows from operations data as measured under GAAP.  The items excluded from these pro forma metrics, but included in the calculation of their closest GAAP equivalent, are significant components of consolidated statements of income and must be considered in performing a comprehensive assessment of overall financial performance. Pro forma financial information is adjusted for the following items:
 
                 
Cash expenses incurred in 1 quarter 2007 associated with the settlement of the 2000 securities litigation is excluded because of the non-recurring nature of the settlement.
st
 
                 
Cash benefit recorded in 1 quarter 2007 associated with the refund by the Internal Revenue Service of excise taxes paid on merchant airline tickets is excluded because of its non-recurring nature.
st
 
                 
Amortization expense of acquisition-related intangibles is excluded because it does not impact cash earnings.
 
                 
Stock-based compensation expense and the non-cash expense associated with the payment of preferred stock dividends are excluded because they do not impact cash earnings and are reflected in earnings per share through increased share count.
 
                 
Option payroll tax expense is excluded because the expense is driven primarily by stock option exercise activity and the market price of priceline.com's common stock and often shows volatility unrelated to operating results.
 
                 
Income tax expense is adjusted for the tax impact of certain of the pro forma adjustments described above and to exclude tax expense or benefit recorded where no actual tax payments are owed because of available net operating loss carry forwards.
                 
Minority interest is adjusted for the impact of certain of the pro forma adjustments described above.
 
                 
Finally, for calculating pro forma net income per share:
 
                 
net income is adjusted for the impact of the pro forma adjustments described above
 
                 
fully diluted share count is adjusted to include the anti-dilutive impact of "Conversion Spread Hedges" related to priceline.com's convertible securities that increase the effective conversion price of the 0.50% convertible notes due 2011 and 0.75% convertible notes due 2013 from their stated $40.38 conversion price to an effective conversion price of $50.47 per share.  Under GAAP, the anti-dilutive impact of the Conversion Spread Hedges is not reflected on the outstanding diluted share count until the end of the hedge when shares are delivered.
 
                 
All common stock warrants and unvested shares of restricted common stock, restricted stock units and performance share units are included in the calculation of pro forma net income per share because pro forma net income has been adjusted to exclude our preferred stock dividend and stock-based compensation expense.
 
The presentation of this financial information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.  The attached financial and statistical supplement reconciles pro forma financial information with priceline.com's financial results under GAAP.

Estimated Impact of Share Price Movements on Weighted Average GAAP and Pro Forma Diluted Shares Outstanding
In millions
(Unaudited)
 
The following table is intended to demonstrate the estimated potential impact of share price movements on the number of equivalent shares included in the fully diluted share count used to calculate diluted earnings per share.  Actual results are likely to differ due to the impact of option exercises, equity repurchases, issuances and forfeitures of restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance share units and any conversions of our convertible bonds.  The table below is for illustrative purposes only; the Company is unable to predict its future stock price and the Company's stock could trade below or above the per share prices in the table below.
 
 
(1) Reflects the anti-dilutive impact of the "Conversion Spread Hedges" and the dilutive impact of shares of unvested restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance share units because pro forma net income has been adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation.
 
(2) Estimated weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding is estimated as follows:
2Q08: Uses actual daily share prices from April 1, 2008 through May 7, 2008, and the closing share price assumption from May 8, 2008 through June  30, 2008.
2008:  Uses actual daily share prices from Jan. 1, 2008 through May 7, 2008, and the closing share price assumption from May 8, 2008 through Dec. 31, 2008.
 
Exhibit 99.2
 
   
 NORWALK, Conn., May 8, 2008 . . . Priceline.com (Nasdaq: PCLN) today announced the promotion of Kees Koolen, 42, to Chief Executive Officer of Booking.com B.V., which is priceline.com's principal international business unit.  Mr. Koolen will report to priceline.com's President and Chief Executive Officer, Jeffery H. Boyd.  The promotion will be effective September 1, 2008.
 
Mr. Koolen is Booking.com's Chief Operating Officer.  He will succeed Stef Norden, 39, who is retiring to pursue other personal interests, but will continue as a member of the Board of Directors of priceline.com International Limited.  Mr. Norden has served as Booking.com's Chief Executive Officer for five years.  Booking.com was acquired by priceline.com in July 2005.
 
"Through Stef Norden's leadership, Booking.com has become Europe's fastest growing internet hotel service, operating in over 60 countries and 17 languages with an expanding base of more than 45,000 hotel partners," said Mr. Boyd.  "In the 1 quarter 2008, which we reported today, our international operations, led by Booking.com, achieved $1 billion in gross bookings, which represents an increase of 99.7% over a year ago.  Stef has worked tirelessly to expand our business across Europe and now into Asia, and he has been instrumental in the business integration that has made Booking.com a worldwide leader in online hotel reservations."
st
