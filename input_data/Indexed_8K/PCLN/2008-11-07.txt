Item 7.01.              Regulation FD Disclosure
 
On November 6, 2008, priceline.com announced its financial results for the 3 quarter ended September 30, 2008.  A copy of priceline.com's press release announcing these financial results and certain other information is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

With respect to its 3 quarter 2008 financial results, the company said that its net income benefited from approximately $5.0 million of foreign exchange hedging gains that were recognized during the quarter.  The company noted, among other things, that in September the global financial crisis struck Europe and that consumer demand for the company's international travel services perceptibly weakened during that period and that weakness carried into the 4 quarter.  The company said that, as a result, it has seen deterioration in the key drivers of its international business, namely the Euro/Dollar/Pound exchange rate, transaction growth rates, average daily rates of hotel room nights and cancellation rates.  Specifically, the company explained that it had observed 3 quarter average daily rates for hotel room nights decrease year-over-year approximately 1% domestically and approximately 3.5% internationally, with significantly worse trends in September that have carried into the 4 quarter.

The company discussed its outstanding convertible senior notes and explained that most of the company's notes were held by convertible bond hedge funds, many of which were facing redemptions as the result of the recent financial market turmoil.  As a result, the company noted that it had received notices of conversion over the past several weeks from approximately $50 million principal amount of its outstanding notes.  The company said that as long as the convertible bond market remained in turmoil, it expected to see more conversions and that its debt balance at the end of the 4 quarter 2008 would be at least $75 million lower as a result of conversions that the company had received during the 4 quarter to date.  The company noted that as a result of the early conversion activity, there was a timing mismatch between the time when the company delivered shares of priceline.com stock to the convertible bond holder (at the time of conversion) and when it would potentially receive shares of priceline.com stock from the counterparties to the company's conversion spread hedges (at the stated maturity dates of the convertible senior notes), which were designed to reduce potential dilution upon conversion of the notes.

With respect to 4 quarter 2008 guidance, the company noted that given the outlook for the general economy and the deterioration in the key drivers of its international business, it was forecasting a significant reduction in U.S. dollar denominated international gross booking rates.  The company noted that it expected domestic gross travel bookings to grow approximately 22% during the 4 quarter 2008 over the same period in the prior year.  Priceline.com announced that it expected consolidated advertising expenses of approximately $58 to $62 million in the 4
th
th
th
 
quarter 2008 and expected approximately 90% of that amount to be spent "on-line."  Priceline.com estimated that sales and marketing expenses in the 4 quarter 2008 would be between $16.5 and $17.5 million.  Priceline.com stated that it estimated that personnel costs, excluding stock-based compensation expense, would be approximately $28 to $29 million in the 4 quarter 2008.  With respect to 4 quarter 2008, priceline.com stated it estimated that general and administrative expenses would be approximately $13 to $13.5 million, information technology expenses would be approximately $5 to $5.5 million, and depreciation and amortization expenses, excluding acquisition related amortization, would be approximately $4.3 million.  Priceline.com said it expected a positive gain of approximately $2.5 million in the 4 quarter 2008 primarily associated with foreign exchange hedging income.  Priceline.com estimated that it would have cash income tax expense of approximately $11.5 million to $12 million in the 4 quarter 2008 comprised of additional income taxes in Europe and alternative minimum tax in the United States.

With respect to its 4 quarter financial guidance, the company noted that its guidance was based on an assumption that the company continued to operate in similar economic conditions.   The company noted that its forecast for the remainder of the 4th quarter 2008 assumed, among other things, that the Euro/U.S. Dollar exchange rate would be 1.29  U.S. dollars per Euro, that there was no material change in the foreign exchange relationship between the British Pound and the Euro, that the average daily rates for the company's domestic hotel service would be down approximately 3% to 4% year-over-year and that the average daily rates for the company's international hotel service would decline approximately 5% to 6% year-over-year. The company noted that its "pro forma" financial guidance was based upon a "pro forma" diluted share count of approximately 44.6 million shares (which includes a calculation of the assumed economic dilutive impact of the company's outstanding convertible notes and stock options, net of the favorable economic impact of the hedges associated with the company's outstanding convertible notes), which is based on the company's November 5, 2008 closing stock price of $52.60 per share.
th
 
With respect to its 4 quarter guidance, the company noted that further negative economic developments, such as a fresh wave of instability in financial markets or high profile financial or industrial company bankruptcies or bailouts which depress consumer sentiment, would likely lead to below-forecast results.  The company emphasized that the economic uncertainty affecting the worldwide consumer and marketplace had added a great deal of uncertainty to the company's 4 quarter 2008 forecast and that this macro economic volatility meant that there was a significantly greater standard deviation in the company's forecast with respect to possible upside and possible downside as compared to previous quarters.

Priceline.com reported pro forma revenues in the 3 quarter of $561.6 million, a 34.7% increase over a year ago.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
"Priceline delivered strong growth in the United States and in our international business despite deteriorating global economic conditions towards the end of the quarter," said Jeffery H. Boyd, priceline.com's President and Chief Executive Officer.  "Our domestic gross bookings grew at what we believe is a market-leading 32.8% as our value brand and low prices appealed to cost-conscious consumers and suppliers used our opaque distribution to move unsold inventory in the face of slowing demand.  Our international operations generated gross bookings growth of 58.6% (approximately 45% growth on a local currency basis) in the 3 quarter, with Booking.com growing its supplier base by 50% year-over-year to approximately 57,000 hotels and Booking.com and Agoda.com continuing to build the business in Asia."
rd
 
Mr. Boyd continued, "While we are proud of the results achieved in the third quarter, evidence of global economic weakness became more pronounced in our international business in late September and October, particularly the substantial decline in the value of the Euro and decreasing transaction growth rates and hotel average daily rates tied to softening hotel demand and occupancy.  The velocity of economic change in this environment makes it difficult to precisely predict the future trajectory of any business.  However, we believe priceline.com's brands are well-positioned to compete in economic down-cycles and we intend to continue building our business around the world to maximize our participation in the global secular movement of travel planning and purchase to the internet."
 
Forward Guidance
 
Priceline.com said it was targeting the following for 4 quarter 2008:
th
 
                 
Year-over-year increase in gross travel bookings of approximately 7.5 - 17.5%.
                 
Year-over-year increase in international gross travel bookings of approximately 0 - 10% (approximately 10 - 20% on a local currency basis).
                 
Year-over-year increase in revenue of approximately 12 - 14%.
                 
Year-over-year increase in pro forma gross profit of approximately 12.5 - 17.5%.
                 
Pro forma EBITDA of approximately $60 million to $66 million.
                 
Pro forma net income of between $1.00 and $1.10 per diluted share.
 
Given the current macro-economic conditions, the Company noted that its actual performance during the 4 quarter 2008 against the guidance above would be subject to greater variability than it had been in the past.
th
 
Pro forma guidance for the 4 quarter 2008:
th
 
                 
excludes non-cash amortization expense of acquisition-related intangibles,
 
  &# 160;              
excludes non-cash stock-based compensation expense,
 
                 
excludes payroll tax expense related to stock-based compensation,
 
                 
excludes non-cash income tax expense and reflects the impact on income taxes of the pro forma adjustments,
 
                 
includes the anti-dilutive impact of the "Conversion Spread Hedges" (see "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" below) on outstanding diluted common shares, and
 
            &# 160;    
includes the dilutive impact of additional shares of unvested restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance share units because pro forma net income has been adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation.
In addition, pro forma EBITDA excludes depreciation and amortization expense and includes the impact of foreign currency transactions and other expenses.
 
When aggregated, the foregoing adjustments are expected to increase pro forma EBITDA over GAAP operating income by approximately $24 million in 4th quarter.
 
In addition, the foregoing adjustments are expected to increase pro forma net income over GAAP net income by approximately $20 million in the 4th quarter 2008.  On a per share basis, the Company estimates GAAP net income of approximately $0.55 to $0.65 per diluted share for the 4th quarter 2008.
 
In May 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. APB 14-1, "Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments that May be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement)" ("FSP APB 14-1").  FSP APB 14-1 requires cash settled convertible debt, such as our convertible senior notes, to be separated into debt and equity components at issuance and a value to be assigned to each.
 
The value assigned to the debt component is the estimated fair value, as of the issuance date, of a similar bond without the conversion feature.  The difference between the bond cash proceeds and this estimated fair value, representing the value assigned to the equity component, is recorded as a debt discount and amortized to interest expense over the life of the bond.  Although FSP APB 14-1 will have no impact on our actual past or future cash flows, it will require us to restate our previously issued financial statements and record a significant amount of non-cash interest expense as the debt discount is amortized and may result in losses on extinguishment that would not have occurred under previous GAAP.  FSP APB 14-1 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008.  The Company expects that it will have a material adverse impact on our GAAP
results of operations and earnings per share.

 fluctuations i n foreign exchange rates;
 
 the effects of increased competition;

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
Pro forma EBITDA represents GAAP operating income excluding depreciation and amortization expense, plus foreign currency transactions and other expense and the applicable pro forma adjustments described below.
 
4
 
Pro forma revenue, pro forma gross profit, pro forma EBITDA, pro forma net income and pro forma net income per share are "non-GAAP financial measures," as such term is defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and may differ from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.  Priceline.com believes that pro forma revenue, pro forma gross profit, pro forma EBITDA, pro forma net income and pro forma net income per share that exclude certain non-cash or non-recurring income or expense items are useful for analysts and investors to evaluate priceline.com's future on-going performance because they enable a more meaningful comparison of priceline.com's projected cash earnings and performance with its historical results from prior periods. These pro forma metrics, in particular pro forma EBITDA and pro forma net income, are not intended to represent funds available for priceline.com's discretionary use and are not intended to represent or to be used as a substitute for operating income, net income or cash flows from operations data as measured under GAAP.  The items excluded from these pro forma metrics, but included in the calculation of their closest GAAP equivalent, are significant components of consolidated statements of income and must be considered in performing a comprehensive assessment of overall financial performance. Pro forma financial information is adjusted for the following items:
 
                 
Cash expenses incurred in 2007 associated with the settlement of the 2000 securities litigation is excluded because of the non-recurring nature of the settlement.
 
                 
Cash benefit recorded in 2007 associated with the refund by the Internal Revenue Service of excise taxes paid on merchant airline tickets is excluded because of its non-recurring nature.
 
                 
Amortization expense of acquisition-related intangibles is excluded because it does not impact cash earnings.
 
                 
Stock-based compensation expense and the non-cash expense associated with the payment of preferred stock dividends are excluded because they do not impact cash earnings and are reflected in earnings per share through increased share count.
 
                 
Payroll tax expense related to stock-based compensation is excluded because the expense is driven primarily by stock option exercise and share award vesting activity and the market price of priceline.com's common stock and often shows volatility unrelated to operating results.
 
                 
Income tax benefit (expense) is adjusted for the tax impact of certain of the pro forma adjustments described above and to exclude tax expense recorded where no actual tax payments are owed because of available net operating loss carry forwards. In addition, pro forma income tax expense is adjusted to exclude the non-cash tax benefit from reversing $47.9 million of priceline.com's deferred tax asset valuation allowance in 3 quarter 2007.
rd
                 
Minority interest is adjusted for the impact of certain of the pro forma adjustments described above.
 
                 
Finally, for calculating pro forma net income per share:
 
                 
net income is adjusted for the impact of the pro forma adjustments described above
 
                 
fully diluted share count is adjusted to include the anti-dilutive impact of "Conversion Spread Hedges" related to priceline.com's convertible securities that increase the effective conversion price of the currently outstanding 0.50% convertible notes due 2011 and 0.75% convertible notes due 2013 from their stated $40.38 conversion price to an effective conversion price of $50.47 per share.  Under GAAP, the anti-dilutive impact of the Conversion Spread Hedges is not reflected on the outstanding diluted share count until the end of the hedge in 2011 and 2013 if and when shares are delivered.
 
                 
All common stock warrants and unvested shares of restricted common stock, restricted stock units and performance share units are included in the calculation of pro forma net income per share because pro forma net income has been adjusted to exclude our preferred stock dividend and stock-based compensation expense.

Estimated Impact of Share Price Movements on Weighted Average GAAP and Pro Forma Diluted Shares Outstanding
In millions
(Unaudited)
 
The following table is intended to demonstrate the estimated potential impact of share price movements on the number of equivalent shares included in the fully diluted share count used to calculate diluted earnings per share.  Actual results are likely to differ due to the impact of option exercises, equity repurchases, issuances and forfeitures of restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance share units, any conversions of our convertible notes and the elimination of the anti-dilutive impact of our conversion spread hedges associated with the convertible notes converted prior to maturity. The table below is for illustrative purposes only; the Company is unable to predict its future stock price and the Company's stock could trade below or above the per share prices in the table below.
