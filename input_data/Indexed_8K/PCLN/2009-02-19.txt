On
th
 
 
 
 quarter 2008 approximately 7% internationally and approximately 5% domestically.  The company noted that it had increased its bad debt reserve in the 4 quarter 2008 as a result of slower payment of hotel "agency" commissions by international hotels and concern over the potential impact that the worldwide recession and lack of available credit could have on the financial health of the company's hotel suppliers and their ability to pay commissions.
The company noted that average daily rates for hotel room nights had decreased year-over-year during the 4
th
th
 
With respect to 1
st
 quarter 2009 guidance, the company noted that it expected domestic gross travel bookings to grow approximately 14.5% during the 1
st
 quarter 2009 over the same period in the prior year.  Priceline.com announced that it expected consolidated advertising expenses of approximately $74 to $78 million in the 1
st
 quarter 2009 and expected approximately 85% of that amount to be spent "on-line."  Priceline.com estimated that sales and marketing expenses in the 1
st
 quarter 2009 would be between $18.5 and $19.5 million.  Priceline.com stated that it estimated that personnel costs, excluding stock-based compensation expense, would be approximately $30 to $31 million in the 1
st
 quarter 2009.  With respect to 1
st
 quarter 2009, priceline.com stated it estimated that general and administrative expenses would be approximately $14.5 to $15.5 million, information technology expenses would be approximately $5 million, and depreciation and amortization expenses, excluding acquisition related amortization, would be approximately $4 million.  Priceline.com said it expected a positive gain of approximately $1.3 million in the 1
st
 quarter 2009 primarily associated with foreign exchange hedging income.  Priceline.com estimated that it would have cash income tax expense of approximately $6.5 million to $7 million in the 1
st
 quarter 2009 comprised of additional income taxes in Europe and alternative minimum tax in the United States.
 
The company noted that its forecast for the remainder of the 1
st
 quarter 2009 assumed, among other things, that the Euro/U.S. Dollar exchange rate would be 1.26  U.S. dollars per Euro, that there was no material change in the foreign exchange relationship between the British Pound and the Euro, that the average daily rates for the company's domestic hotel service would be down approximately 7% to 9% year-over-year and that the average daily rates for the company's international hotel service would decline approximately 9% to 11% year-over-year.  The company noted that its "pro forma" financial guidance was based upon a "pro forma" diluted share count of approximately 46.7 million shares (which includes a calculation of the assumed
 
economic dilutive impact of the company's outstanding convertible notes and stock options, net of the favorable economic impact of the hedges associated with the company's outstanding convertible notes), which is based on the company's February 17, 2009 closing stock price of $68.87 per share.
 
The company noted that the worldwide recession had added a great deal of uncertainty to the company's 1
st
 quarter 2009 forecast and that, as a result, there was greater potential variability that there had been in the past.

For full-year 2008, priceline.com's gross travel bookings were approximately $7.4 billion, a 53.2% increase over 2007.  Full-year 2008 revenues were $1.9 billion, a 33.7% increase over a year ago.

"Priceline continued to grow and take market share in the United States and internationally despite very challenging global economic conditions", said priceline.com President and Chief Executive Officer Jeffery H. Boyd. "Worldwide recessionary conditions have resulted in lower overall travel demand and we have seen hotels significantly reduce their average daily rates in response to declining hotel occupancy rates."
 
 quarter gross travel bookings by 27.6% excluding foreign exchange impact." Mr. Boyd continued, "Booking.com continued to strengthen its position as the largest and fastest-growing online hotel reservations service in Europe, growing its supplier base by 47% year-over-year.  With over 60,000 properties in over 70 countries around the world, Booking.com offers an extensive and growing collection of attractively priced hotels in leading destinations around the world.  By being available in 21 different languages, Booking.com provides an unmatched level of consumer accessibility.  We believe that this breadth of offerings and services was a major factor in Ryanair's recent choice of Booking.com to power its hotel booking engine. In the 4 quarter, Agoda.com had its one year anniversary under the priceline.com umbrella.  Despite significant external challenges in its local markets, Agoda achieved organic gross bookings growth of over 100% in 2008."
"Our international operations grew its 4
th
th
 
 quarter by what we believe is a market-leading 31.1% year over year as our value brand and low prices appealed to cost-conscious consumers and suppliers used our Name Your Own Price  distribution to sell their services in the face of slowing demand.  For more than a decade, priceline.com has built a travel brand that is synonymous with delivering the lowest price, supported by a robust collection of published-price and Name Your Own Price travel services.  We believe that our brand identity and an effective marketing campaign featuring The Priceline Negotiator, is resonating with customers in this difficult economic climate."
"In the U.S., priceline.com's gross travel bookings grew in the 4

Looking forward, Mr. Boyd said, "We are in the midst of a period of unprecedented economic turbulence that is significantly impacting travel demand, pricing and currency exchange rates.  Our goals are to continue building our global brands and deliver value to customers looking for the best travel value and suppliers looking to drive demand in a challenging market."
 
Forward Guidance

st
 
Year-over-year increase in gross travel bookings of approximately 0.0%  7.5%.
                 
Year-over-year change in international gross travel bookings of approximately (7.5%)  0.0% (an increase of approximately 8.0%  16.0% on a local currency basis).

Pro forma EBITDA of approximately $50 million to $55 million.
                 
Pro forma net income of between $0.85 and $0.95 per diluted share.
                 
 
 quarter 2009 against the guidance above is subject to greater variability than it had been in the past.
Given the current macro-economic conditions, the Company stated that it would not provide earnings guidance beyond the first quarter and noted that its actual performance during the 1
st
 
 quarter 2009:
Pro forma guidance for the 1
st
 
                 
excludes non-cash amortization expense of acquisition-related intangibles,
 
                 
excludes non-cash stock-based compensation expense,
 
                 
excludes option payroll tax expense,
 
           &# 160;     
excludes non-cash interest expense and gains or losses on debt extinguishment, if any, recorded pursuant to the provisions of FSP APB 14-1,
 
                 
excludes non-cash income tax expense and reflects the impact on income taxes of the pro forma adjustments,
 
                 
includes the anti-dilutive impact of the "Conversion Spread Hedges" (see "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" below) on outstanding diluted common shares outstanding, and
 
                60; 
includes the dilutive impact of additional shares of unvested restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance share units because pro forma net income has been adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation.
 
In addition, pro forma EBITDA excludes depreciation and amortization expense and includes the impact of foreign currency transactions and other expenses.
 
When aggregated, the foregoing adjustments are expected to increase pro forma EBITDA over GAAP operating income by approximately $21 million in 1
st
 quarter 2009.
 
In addition, the foregoing adjustments are expected to increase pro forma net income over GAAP net income by approximately $27 million in the 1
st
 quarter 2009.  On a per share basis, the Company estimates GAAP net income of approximately $0.28 to $0.38 per diluted share for the 1st quarter 2009.
 
In May 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. APB 14-a, "Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments that May be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement)" ("FSP APB 14-a").  FSP APB 14-a requires cash settled convertible debt, such as our convertible senior notes, to be separated into debt and equity components at issuance and a value to be assigned to each.
 
The value assigned to the debt component is the estimated fair value, as of the issuance date, of a similar bond without the conversion feature.  The difference between the bond cash proceeds and this estimated fair value, representing the value assigned to the equity component, is recorded as a debt discount and amortized to interest expense over the life of the bond.  Although FSP APB 14-a will have no impact on our actual past or future cash flows, it will require us to adjust our previously issued financial statements and record a significant amount of non-cash interest expense as the debt discount is amortized and may result in losses on extinguishment that would not have occurred under previous GAAP.  FSP APB 14-a is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008.  The Company estimates that the adoption of FSP APB 14-1 will increase non-cash interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 by approximately $26 million ($16 million net of tax), $28 million ($17 million net of tax),  and $6 million ($3.6 million net of tax), respectively.  The estimated impact to fiscal year 2009 non-cash interest expense is an increase of approximately $21 million ($13 million net of tax), excluding the impact of future debt conversions, if any.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
Pro forma EBITDA represents GAAP operating income excluding depreciation and amortization expense, plus foreign currency transactions and other expense and the applicable pro forma adjustments described below.
 
Pro forma EBITDA, pro forma net income and pro forma net income per share are "non-GAAP financial measures," as such term is defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and may differ from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.  Priceline.com believes that pro forma EBITDA, pro forma net income and pro forma net income per share that exclude certain non-cash or non-recurring income or expense items are useful for analysts and investors to evaluate priceline.com's future on-going performance because they enable a more meaningful comparison of priceline.com's projected cash earnings and performance with its historical results from prior periods. These pro forma metrics, in particular pro forma EBITDA and pro forma net income, are not intended to represent funds available for priceline.com's discretionary use and are not intended to represent or to be used as a substitute for operating income, net income or cash flows from operations data as measured under GAAP.  The items excluded from these pro forma
 
metrics, but included in the calculation of their closest GAAP equivalent, are significant components of consolidated statements of income and must be considered in performing a comprehensive assessment of overall financial performance. Pro forma financial information is adjusted for the following items:
 
                 
Cash expenses incurred in 2007 associated with the settlement of the 2000 securities litigation is excluded because of the non-recurring nature of the settlement.
 
                 
Cash benefit recorded in 2007 associated with the refund by the Internal Revenue Service of excise taxes paid on merchant airline tickets is excluded because of its non-recurring nature.
 
                 
Amortization expense of acquisition-related intangibles is excluded because it does not impact cash earnings.
 
                 
Stock-based compensation expense and the non-cash expense associated with the payment of preferred stock dividends are excluded because they do not impact cash earnings and are reflected in earnings per share through increased share count.
 
                 
Payroll tax expense related to stock-based compensation is excluded because the expense is driven primarily by stock option exercise and share award vesting activity and the market price of priceline.com's common stock and often shows volatility unrelated to operating results.
 
                 
Interest expense that will be recorded in 2009 upon the January 1, 2009 adoption of FASB Staff Position No. APB 14-a, "Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments that May be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement)" because it is non-cash in nature.
 
                 
Income tax expense is adjusted for the tax impact of certain of the pro forma adjustments described above and to exclude tax expense recorded where no actual tax payments are owed because of available net operating loss carry forwards.
 
In addition, pro forma income tax expense in 3
rd
 quarter 2007 is adjusted to exclude the non-cash tax benefit from reversing $47.9 million of valuation allowance on priceline.com's deferred tax asset and to exclude the $1.2 million non-recurring income tax benefit related to the impact on deferred taxes of an enacted reduction in certain international statutory tax rates.  Further, pro forma net income for 4th quarter 2007 excludes the $3.6 million non-recurring income tax benefit resulting from the recognition of foreign capital allowance carry forwards.
 
                 
Minority interest is adjusted for the impact of certain of the pro forma adjustments described above.
 
                 
Finally, for calculating pro forma net income per share:
 
                 
net income is adjusted for the impact of the pro forma adjustments described above
 
fully diluted share count is adjusted to include the anti-dilutive impact of "Conversion Spread Hedges" related to priceline.com's convertible securities that increase the effective conversion price of the currently outstanding 0.50% convertible notes due 2011 and 0.75% convertible notes due 2013 from their stated $40.38 conversion price to an effective conversion price of $50.47 per share.  Under GAAP, the anti-dilutive impact of the Conversion Spread Hedges is not reflected on the outstanding diluted share count until the end of the hedge in 2011 and 2013 if and when shares are delivered.
                 
 
All common stock warrants and unvested shares of restricted common stock, restricted stock units and performance share units are included in the calculation of pro forma net income per share because pro forma net income has been adjusted to exclude our preferred stock dividend and stock-based compensation expense.
                 
 
The presentation of this financial information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.

Estimated Impact of Share Price Movements on Weighted Average GAAP and Pro Forma Diluted Shares Outstanding
In millions
(Unaudited)
 
The following table is intended to demonstrate the estimated potential impact of share price movements on the number of equivalent shares included in the fully diluted share count used to calculate diluted earnings per share.  Actual results are likely to differ due to the impact of option exercises, equity repurchases, issuances and forfeitures of restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance share units, any conversions of our convertible notes and the elimination of the anti-dilutive impact of our conversion spread hedges associated with the convertible notes converted prior to maturity. The table below is for illustrative purposes only; the Company is unable to predict its future stock price and the Company's stock could trade below or above the per share prices in the table below.
 
 
(1)  Reflects the anti-dilutive impact of the "Conversion Spread Hedges" associated with convertible notes that remain outstanding to maturity and the dilutive impact of additional warrants and shares of unvested restricted stock and restricted stock units because pro forma net income has been adjusted to exclude preferred stock dividend and stock-based compensation.
 
(2)  Estimated weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding is estimated as follows:
1Q09: Uses actual daily share prices from January 1, 2009 through February 17, 2009, and the closing share price assumption from February 18, 2009 through December 31, 2009.
