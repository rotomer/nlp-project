Item 7.01.             Regulation FD Disclosure
 
On November 9, 2009, priceline.com announced its financial results for the 3
rd
 quarter ended September 30, 2009.  A copy of priceline.com's press release announcing these financial results is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
 
The company noted that average daily rates for hotel room night reservations had decreased year-over-year during the 3
rd
 quarter 2009 approximately 7% internationally and approximately 11% domestically.  The company noted that foreign currency exchange rates were a "net favorable" factor during the 3
rd
 quarter 2009 as compared to guidance given by the company in August 2009.  However, the company noted that year-over-year foreign currency exchange rates had a negative impact on the company's results.
 
With respect to 4
th
 quarter 2009 guidance, the company announced that it expected consolidated advertising expenses of approximately $94 to $97 million in the 4
th
 quarter 2009 and expected approximately 94% of that amount to be spent "on-line."  Priceline.com estimated that sales and marketing expenses in the 4
th
 quarter 2009 would be between $20 and $21 million.  Priceline.com stated that it estimated that personnel costs, excluding stock-based compensation expense, would be approximately $40 to $41 million in the 4
th
 quarter 2009.  With respect to 4
th
 quarter 2009, priceline.com stated it estimated that general and administrative expenses would be approximately $23 to $24 million, information technology expenses would be approximately $5.5 million, and depreciation and amortization expenses, excluding acquisition related amortization, would be approximately $4.5 million.  Priceline.com said it expected expenses of approximately $1.9 million in the 4
th
 quarter 2009 primarily associated with foreign exchange hedging expense and net interest expense.  Priceline.com estimated that it would have cash income tax expense of approximately $19 to $22 million in the 4
th
 quarter 2009 comprised of additional income taxes in Europe and alternative minimum tax in the United States.
 
The company noted that its forecast for the remainder of the 4
th
 quarter 2009 assumed, among other things, that the Euro/U.S. Dollar exchange rate would be 1.48 U.S. dollars per Euro, that the British Pound/U.S. Dollar exchange rate would be 1.66 U.S. Dollars per British Pound and assumed that the year-over-year rate of decline in hotel average daily rates would improve (which would yield average rates for the 4
th
 quarter that appreciate on a Euro and British Pound basis year-over-year by approximately 13% and 5%, respectively).  The company noted that its "pro forma" financial guidance was based upon a "pro forma" diluted share count of approximately 50.7 million shares (which includes a calculation of the assumed economic dilutive impact of the company's outstanding convertible notes and stock options, net of the favorable economic impact
of the hedges associated with the company's outstanding convertible notes), which is based on the company's November 6, 2009 closing stock price of $172 per share.
 
The company emphasized that its 3
rd
 quarter 2009 year-over-year growth rates were driven in part by "easier comps" that began in the second half of the 3
rd
 quarter 2008 and carried into the 4
th
 quarter of 2008.  The company noted, however that, as it discussed on its 4
th
 quarter 2008 earnings conference call, it saw a marked improvement in its business fundamentals in the beginning of November 2008.  The company emphasized that, as a result of this trend, its annualized "growth rate comparables" would be increasingly more challenging in November and December 2009 than the company had experienced in recent months.  The company explained, that while it was not giving guidance for periods beyond the 4
th
 quarter of 2009, it expected that its growth rates in units sold would resume the pattern of deceleration the company had began to experience before the onset of the worldwide recession.
 
The company noted that Agoda reported improved gross bookings year-over-year growth in excess of 100% in the 3
rd
 quarter, reflecting weakness in the prior period due to economic conditions and civil unrest in Thailand as well as signs of economic improvement in Asian markets.
 
The company noted that its guidance assumes that macro-economic conditions in general and conditions in the consumer travel market in particular, remain relatively unchanged.

Exhibit 99.1
 
NORWALK, Conn., November 9, 2009 . . . Priceline.com Incorporated (Nasdaq: PCLN) today reported its financial results for the 3
rd
 quarter 2009. Gross travel bookings for the 3
rd
 quarter, which refers to the total dollar value, inclusive of all taxes and fees, of all travel services purchased by consumers, were $2.7 billion, an increase of 32.8% over a year ago.
 
Priceline.com had revenues in the 3
rd
 quarter of $730.7 million, a 30.1% increase over a year ago. The Company's international operations contributed revenues in the 3
rd
 quarter of $316.9 million, a 41.7% increase versus a year ago (approximately 50% on a local currency basis).  Priceline.com's gross profit for the 3
rd
 quarter was $434.0 million, a 37.3% increase from the prior year.  The Company's international operations contributed gross profit in the 3
rd
 quarter of $316.0 million, a 42.0% increase versus a year ago (approximately 50% growth on a local currency basis).  The Company's operating income in 3
rd
 quarter 2009 was $200.8 million, a 56.9% increase from the prior year.  Priceline.com had GAAP net income for the 3
rd
 quarter of $319.0 million or $6.42 per diluted share, which compares to $84.5 million or $1.74 per diluted share in the same period a year ago. GAAP net income for the 3
rd
 quarter 2009 was positively affected by a $181.9 million non-cash tax benefit from reversing a portion of the valuation allowance related to the Company's net operating loss carry forwards.  The valuation allowance was reversed to reflect the amount of deferred tax asset that is estimated to be more likely than not to be realized after taking into consideration current operating results and future estimated domestic taxable income
.
 
Pro forma EBITDA for the 3
rd
 quarter 2009 was $224.6 million, an increase of 47.3% over a year ago.  Pro forma net income in the 3
rd
 quarter was $173.3 million or $3.45 per diluted share, compared to $2.39 per share a year ago.  First Call analyst consensus for the 3
rd
 quarter 2009 was $2.90 per diluted share.  The section below entitled "" provides a definition and information about the use of pro forma financial measures in this press release and the attached financial and statistical supplement reconciles pro forma financial information with priceline.com's financial results under GAAP.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
"Despite a difficult economic environment, the summer travel season turned out to be an exceptionally strong one for priceline.com, as 3
rd
 quarter growth rates accelerated sequentially for our international and domestic businesses," said priceline.com President and Chief Executive Officer Jeffery H. Boyd.  "On a global basis, priceline.com continued to increase its market share as hotel room night reservations grew by 56% in the 3
rd
 quarter, propelled by strong performance in the U.S., Europe and Asia.  Internationally, our hotel business experienced gross travel bookings growth of 38%, or approximately 49% on a local currency basis, as we reaped the benefits of outstanding hotel supply, geographic expansion in high-opportunity markets and continued shift by consumers to on-line booking of hotel reservations.   Our U.S. business grew gross travel bookings by 25% as consumers continue to respond positively to our money-saving travel services.  Airline ticket sales were up 30.2%, despite the fact that competitors' matching fee eliminations were in place for the entire quarter.  Rental car days booked increased 11.6%."
 
 
"The online travel industry achieved improved year-over-year growth in the third quarter as we comped against weakening demand in the prior-year period and received a boost from industry-wide fee reductions and supplier discounting and promotions." Mr. Boyd continued, "Priceline.com intends to continue to focus on building out our global brands and hotel platform, adding additional supply, integration initiatives and innovation to support the long-term growth of the business."
 
Priceline.com said it was targeting the following for 4
th
 quarter 2009:
 
                 
Year-over-year increase in total gross travel bookings of approximately 30% - 40%.
 
                 
Year-over-year increase in international gross travel bookings of approximately 50% - 60% (an increase of approximately 37% - 46% on a local currency basis).
 
                 
Year-over-year increase in domestic gross travel bookings of approximately 15%.
 
                 
Year-over-year increase in revenue of approximately 24% to 28%.
 
                 
Year-over-year increase in gross profit of approximately 40% to 45%.
 
                 
Pro forma EBITDA of approximately $98 million to $108 million.
 
                 
Pro forma net income of between $1.52 and $1.62 per diluted share.
 
Pro forma guidance for the 4
th
 quarter 2009:
 
                 
excludes non-cash amortization expense of acquisition-related intangibles,
 
                 
excludes non-cash stock-based compensation expense,
 
                 
excludes non-cash interest expense and gains or losses on debt extinguishment, if any, recorded pursuant to the provisions of FSP APB 14-1,
 
                 
excludes non-cash income tax expense and reflects the impact on income taxes of certain of the pro forma adjustments,
 
                 
excludes the impact, if any, of charges associated with judgments, rulings and/or settlements related to hotel occupancy tax proceedings,
 
                 
includes the anti-dilutive impact of the "Conversion Spread Hedges" (see "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" below) on diluted common shares outstanding  related to outstanding convertible notes, and
 
                 
includes the dilutive impact of additional shares of unvested restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance share units because pro forma net income has been adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation.
In addition, pro forma EBITDA excludes depreciation and amortization expense and includes the impact of foreign currency transactions and other expenses.
 
When aggregated, the foregoing adjustments are expected to increase pro forma EBITDA over GAAP operating income by approximately $20 million in 4
th
 quarter 2009.
 
In addition, the foregoing adjustments are expected to increase pro forma net income over GAAP net income by approximately $24 million in the 4
th
 quarter 2009. On a per share basis, the Company estimates GAAP net income of approximately $1.06 to $1.16 per diluted share for the 4
th
 quarter 2009.
 
Effective January 1, 2009, we adopted FASB Staff Position No. APB 14-1, "Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments that May be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement)" ("FSP APB 14-1"). FSP APB 14-1 requires cash settled convertible debt, such as our convertible senior notes, to be separated into debt and equity components at issuance and a value to be assigned to each.
 
The value assigned to the debt component is the estimated fair value, as of the issuance date, of a similar bond without the conversion feature. The difference between the bond cash proceeds and this estimated fair value, representing the value assigned to the equity component, is recorded as a debt discount and amortized to interest expense over the life of the bond. Although FSP APB 14-1 has no impact on our actual past or future cash flows, it requires us to adjust our previously issued financial statements and to record a significant amount of non-cash interest expense as the debt discount is amortized and may result in gains or losses on extinguishment that would not have occurred under previous GAAP.
 
The adoption of FSP APB 14-1 increased non-cash interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 by approximately $26.1 million ($15.5 million net of tax), $28.2 million ($16.6 million net of tax), and $5.4 million ($3.2 million net of tax), respectively, and is estimated to increase fiscal year 2009 non-cash interest expense by approximately $17.8 million ($10.7 million net of tax), excluding the impact of future debt conversions, if any. The adoption of FSP APB 14-1 increased non-cash interest expense in the three months ended September 30, 2009 and 2008 by $4.3 million ($2.6 million net of tax) and $6.0 million ($3.6 million net of tax), respectively.
 
Information About Forward-Looking Statements
 
This press release contains forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements reflect the views of the Company's management regarding current expectations and projections about future events and are based on currently available information and current foreign currency exchange rates. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict; therefore, actual results may differ materially from those expressed, implied or forecasted in any such forward-looking statements. Expressions of future goals and similar expressions including, without limitation, "may," "will," "should," "could," "expects," "does not currently expect," "plans," "anticipates," "intends," "believes," "estimates," "predicts," "potential," "targets," or "continue," reflecting something other than historical fact are intended to identify forward-looking statements. The following factors, among others, could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements:
 
adverse changes in general market conditions for leisure and other travel services as a result of, among other things, decreased consumer spending, general economic downturn, terrorist attacks, natural disasters or adverse weather, the bankruptcy or insolvency of a major airline, or the outbreak of an epidemic or pandemic disease, such as the recent swine flu outbreak;
 
adverse changes in the Company's relationships with airlines and other product and service providers and vendors which could include, without limitation, the withdrawal of suppliers from the priceline.com system (either priceline.com's "retail" or "opaque" services, or both) and/or the loss or reduction of global distribution fees;
 
fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and other risks associated with doing business in multiple currencies;
 
the effects of increased competition, including the potential impact of increased pricing competition initiated by other on-line travel agents toward the end of 1
st
 quarter 2009 in the form of reduced booking fees and/or the launch by competitors of an "opaque" travel offering;
 
an adverse outcome in one or more of the hotel occupancy and other tax proceedings in which the Company is involved;
 
a change by a major search engine to its search engine algorithms that negatively affects the search engine ranking of the company or its 3
rd
 party distribution partners;
our ability to expand successfully in international markets;
 
the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel;
 
difficulties integrating recent or future acquisitions, such as the 4
th
 quarter 2007 acquisition of Agoda, including ensuring the effectiveness of the design and operation of internal controls and disclosure controls of acquired businesses;
 
the occurrence of an external or internal security breach of our systems or other Internet based systems involving personal customer information, credit card information or other sensitive data;
 
systems-related failures and/or security breaches, including without limitation, "denial-of-service" type attacks on our system, any security breach that results in the theft, transfer or unauthorized disclosure of customer information, or the failure to comply with various state laws applicable to the company's obligations in the event of such a breach; and
 
legal and regulatory risks.
 
For a detailed discussion of these and other factors that could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements, please refer to the Company's most recent Form 10-Q, Form 10-K and Form 8-K filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Unless required by law, the Company undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
 
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
Pro forma EBITDA represents GAAP operating income excluding depreciation and amortization expense, plus foreign currency transactions and other expense and the pro forma adjustments relating to stock-based compensation expense and payroll taxes related to stock-based compensation described below.
 
Pro forma EBITDA, pro forma net income and pro forma net income per share are "non-GAAP financial measures," as such term is defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and may differ from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Priceline.com believes that pro forma EBITDA, pro forma net income and pro forma net income per share that exclude certain non-cash or non-recurring income or expense items are useful for analysts and investors to evaluate priceline.com's future on-going performance because they enable a more meaningful comparison of priceline.com's projected cash earnings and performance with its historical results from prior periods. These pro forma metrics, in particular pro forma EBITDA and pro forma net income, are not intended to represent funds available for priceline.com's discretionary use and
are not intended to represent or to be used as a substitute for operating income, net income or cash flows from operations data as measured under GAAP. The items excluded from these pro forma metrics, but included in the calculation of their closest GAAP equivalent, are significant components of consolidated statements of income and must be considered in performing a comprehensive assessment of overall financial performance.
 
Pro forma financial information is adjusted for the following items:
 
                 
Amortization expense of acquisition-related intangibles is excluded because it does not impact cash earnings.
 
                 
The charge related to the judgment in the Texas hotel occupancy tax litigation is excluded because it impacts comparability with historical operating results from prior periods.
 
                 
Stock-based compensation expense is excluded because it does not impact cash earnings and is reflected in earnings per share through increased share count.
 
                 
Payroll tax expense related to stock-based compensation is excluded for 2008 because the expense is driven primarily by stock option exercise and share award vesting activity and the market price of priceline.com's common stock and often shows volatility unrelated to operating results.  As of January 1, 2009, we no longer exclude payroll tax expense related to stock-based compensation due to its relative insignificance to our consolidated financial statements.
 
                 
Interest expense related to the amortization of debt discount and gains or losses on debt extinguishment recorded in 2009, and in 2008 on a retrospective basis, pursuant to the provisions of FASB Staff Position No. APB 14-1, "Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments that May be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement)" are excluded because they are non-cash in nature. Pursuant to the provisions of FSP APB 14-1, certain debt issuance costs were reclassified to equity and are therefore no longer amortized in GAAP or pro forma earnings (as of January 1, 2009).
 
                 
Income tax expense is adjusted for the tax impact of certain of the pro forma adjustments described above and to exclude tax expense recorded where no actual tax payments are owed because of available net operating loss carry forwards.  Income tax expense is also adjusted to exclude the $181.9 million non-cash tax benefit from reversing a portion of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance in 3
rd
 quarter 2009.
 
                 
Net income attributable to non-controlling interests is adjusted for the impact of certain of the pro forma adjustments described above.
 
                 
For calculating pro forma net income per share:
 
                 
net income is adjusted for the impact of the pro forma adjustments described above.
                 
fully diluted share count is adjusted to include the anti-dilutive impact of "Conversion Spread Hedges" related to priceline.com's convertible securities that increase the effective conversion price of the currently outstanding 0.50% convertible notes due 2011 and 0.75% convertible notes due 2013 from their stated $40.38 conversion price to an effective conversion price of $50.47 per share.
 
Under GAAP, the anti-dilutive impact of the Conversion Spread Hedges is not reflected on the outstanding diluted share count until the end of the hedge in 2011 and 2013 if and when shares are delivered.
 
                 
all unvested shares of restricted common stock, restricted stock units and performance share units are included in the calculation of pro forma net income per share because pro forma net income has been adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation expense.
 
The presentation of this financial information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The attached financial and statistical supplement reconciles pro forma financial information with priceline.com's financial results under GAAP.
