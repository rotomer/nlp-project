Item 8.01.  Other Events
 
On March 5, 2010, the initial purchasers in priceline.com Incorporated's previously announced private offering of 1.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2015 (the "Notes") exercised in full their option to purchase an additional $75 million of Notes, solely to cover over-allotments. Priceline.com announced on March 4, 2010 the pricing of $500 million principal amount of Notes to be issued in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and priceline.com's intention to grant the initial purchasers of the Notes an option to purchase up to an additional $75 million of Notes.  Priceline.com expects the closing of the purchase of the $500 million aggregate principal amount of Notes and the additional $75 million aggregate principal amount of Notes to occur on March 10, 2010.
 
This notice does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy securities. Any offers of the securities will be made only by means of a private offering memorandum. The Notes and any priceline.com common stock issuable upon the conversion of the Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act, or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction and may not be offered or sold absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
