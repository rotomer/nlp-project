Regulation FD Disclosure
 
On August 3, 2010, priceline.com announced its financial results for the 2
nd
 quarter ended June 30, 2010.  A copy of priceline.com's press release announcing these results is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
 
The company noted that average daily rates for hotel room night reservations had increased year-over-year during the 2
nd
 quarter 2010 for the company's international and domestic businesses by approximately 2% to 3%.  The company also stated that Agoda grew gross travel bookings year-over-year during the 2
nd
 quarter 2010 at triple digit rates for the fourth consecutive quarter; the company emphasized that Agoda continued to represent a relatively small part of the company's business.
 
The company explained that it had spent approximately $6 million during the 2
nd
 quarter 2010 to repurchase shares of priceline.com common stock.  The company also explained that it had spent approximately $75 million in cash during the 2
nd
 quarter 2010 in connection with conversions of its outstanding convertible debt (approximately $47 million of which was used to repay the principal amount of outstanding debt and approximately $28 million of which was paid to satisfy the conversion value in excess of the principle amount).  The company also noted that in the 3
rd
 quarter 2010 it had settled conversion notices with cash of approximately $19 million to repay the principal amount of outstanding debt and approximately $72 million to satisfy the conversion value in excess of the principal amount.  The company also noted that it had recently received conversion notices during the 3
rd
 quarter 2010 from holders of approximately $30.9 million of principal amount of its outstanding convertible debt.
 
With respect to 3
rd
 quarter 2010 guidance, the company announced that it expected consolidated advertising expenses of approximately $174 to $179 million in the 3
rd
 quarter 2010 and expected approximately $8 million of that amount to be spent "off-line."  Priceline.com estimated that sales and marketing expenses in the 3
rd
 quarter 2010 would be between $31 and $34 million. Priceline.com stated that it estimated that personnel costs, excluding stock-based compensation expense, would be approximately $56 to $59 million in the 3
rd
 quarter 2010. With respect to 3
rd
 quarter 2010, priceline.com stated that it estimated that general and administrative expenses would be approximately $21 to $24 million, information technology expenses would be approximately $6 million, and depreciation and amortization expenses, excluding acquisition related amortization, would be approximately $4.5 million.  Priceline.com said it expected below-the-line net expenses of approximately $10.5 million in the 3
rd
 quarter 2010 primarily associated with net
 
interest expense, foreign exchange hedging losses and the charge for pro forma net income allocated to non-controlling interests associated with TravelJigsaw.  Priceline.com estimated that it would have cash income tax expense of approximately $74 million in the 3
rd
 quarter 2010 comprised of international income taxes and alternative minimum tax in the United States.
 
The company noted that its forecast for the 3
rd
 quarter 2010 assumed, among other things, that the Euro/U.S. Dollar exchange rate would be 1.32 U.S. dollars per Euro for the remainder of the 3
rd
 quarter and that the British Pound/U.S. Dollar exchange rate would be 1.59 U.S. Dollars per British Pound for the remainder of the 3
rd
 quarter.  The company also assumed that average daily rates for hotel room night reservations would experience the same approximate year-over-year growth rate in the 3
rd
 quarter 2010 that they experienced in the 2
nd
 quarter 2010 for its international business and that domestic ADR trends would continue to improve.  The company noted that its "pro forma" financial guidance was based upon a "pro forma" diluted share count of approximately 50.9 million shares (which includes a calculation of the assumed economic dilutive impact of the company's outstanding convertible notes and share-based awards, net of the favorable economic impact of the hedges associated with some of the company's outstanding convertible notes), which is based on the company's August 2, 2010 closing stock price of $227.38 per share.
 
The company emphasized, as it had in its 1
st
 quarter 2010 earnings conference call, that its 2
nd
 quarter 2010 year-over-year growth rates reflected favorable year-over-year comparisons with the 2
nd
 quarter 2009, a quarter that was significantly impacted by the economic downturn.  The company explained that its year-over-year "comps" would be increasingly more challenging throughout each quarter of 2010.  The company noted that, as a result of the more challenging "comps" and the overall size of the company's business, it expected the recent quarterly pattern of sequential decelerating unit growth rates to continue in the 3
rd
 and 4
th
 quarter of 2010.
 
The company noted that its guidance assumes that macro-economic conditions in general and conditions in the consumer travel market in particular, remain relatively unchanged.

Exhibit 99.1
NORWALK, Conn., August 3, 2010 . . . Priceline.com Incorporated (Nasdaq: PCLN) today reported its financial results for the 2
nd
 quarter 2010. Gross travel bookings for the 2
nd
 quarter, which refers to the total dollar value, generally inclusive of all taxes and fees, of all travel services purchased by consumers, were $3.4 billion, an increase of 43.3% over a year ago.
 
Priceline.com had revenues in the 2
nd
 quarter of $767.4 million, a 27.1% increase over a year ago. The Company's international operations contributed revenues in the 2
nd
 quarter of $322.6 million, a 63.3% increase versus a year ago (approximately 68% on a local currency basis). Priceline.com's gross profit for the 2
nd
 quarter was $445.3 million, a 45.9% increase from the prior year. The Company's international operations contributed gross profit in the 2
nd
 quarter of $321.8 million, a 63.6% increase versus a year ago (approximately 68% growth on a local currency basis). The Company's operating income in the 2
nd
 quarter 2010 was $173.2 million, a 58.3% increase from the prior year. Priceline.com had GAAP net income for the 2
nd
 quarter of $115.0 million or $2.26 per diluted share, which compares to $67.0 million or $1.38 per diluted share in the same period a year ago.
 
Pro forma EBITDA for the 2
nd
 quarter was $204.2 million, an increase of 61.8% over the prior year.  Pro forma net income in the 2
nd
 quarter was $158.2 million or $3.09 per diluted share, compared to $2.02 per share a year ago.  First Call analyst consensus for the 2
nd
 quarter 2010 was $2.65 per diluted share. The section below entitled "" provides a definition and information about the use of pro forma financial measures in this press release and the attached financial and statistical supplement reconciles pro forma financial information with priceline.com's financial results under GAAP.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
"Second quarter performance by the Priceline group of companies was once again driven by strong growth in our global hotel reservations, where we believe we gained market share for another quarter," said Jeffery H. Boyd, Priceline's President and CEO.  "The group achieved a combined 48% year-over-year growth in hotel room nights booked.  International gross travel bookings increased by 59% compared to prior year, or 67% on a local currency basis, due to increasing travel demand and an improvement in room rates.  Domestic gross travel bookings grew by 20% driven by strong growth in hotel reservations.  Growth in airline tickets and domestic rental car days was modest as our Name Your Own Price airline and rental car services were hampered by reductions in capacity by suppliers."
 
"In May 2010, we acquired TravelJigsaw, a growing international car hire service, which has contributed $43.9 million of gross travel bookings in the 2
nd
 quarter since acquisition.  The TravelJigsaw business showed continued growth in the second quarter and we look forward to working with the team to build the business."
 
 
Looking forward, Mr. Boyd said, "We are pleased with the hotel transaction growth we are seeing worldwide, which we believe is being driven by geographic expansion, solid execution in promoting improved conversion on our websites and benefits of group-wide cooperation on integration initiatives.  These factors, combined with growing Internet commerce and travel in some of our newer markets, resulted in resilience in the face of economic volatility and periodic travel disruptions, and we believe provide a foundation for growth over the long-term."
 
The Company also reiterated its expectation that gross travel bookings growth rates would progressively decline in the second half of 2010 as it compares to periods of relatively stronger business performance in the 2
nd
 half of 2009.
 
Priceline.com said it was targeting the following for 3
rd
 quarter 2010:
 
                 
Year-over-year increase in total gross travel bookings of approximately 33% - 38%.
 
                 
Year-over-year increase in international gross travel bookings of approximately 46% - 51% (an increase of approximately 57.5% - 62.5% on a local currency basis).
 
                 
Year-over-year increase in domestic gross travel bookings of approximately 13%.
 
                 
Year-over-year increase in revenue of approximately 29% - 34%.
 
                 
Year-over-year increase in gross profit of approximately 43% - 48%.
 
                 
Pro forma EBITDA of approximately $327 million to $337 million.
 
                 
Pro forma net income of between $4.78 and $4.98 per diluted share.
 
Pro forma guidance for the 3
rd
 quarter 2010:
 
                 
excludes non-cash amortization expense of acquisition-related intangibles,
 
                 
excludes non-cash stock-based compensation expense,
 
                 
excludes non-cash interest expense and gains or losses on early debt extinguishment, if any, related to cash settled convertible debt,
 
                 
excludes the impact, if any, of charges or benefits associated with judgments, rulings and/or settlements related to hotel occupancy tax proceedings,
 
                 
excludes non-cash income tax expense and reflects the impact on income taxes of certain of the pro forma adjustments,
 
                 
includes the additional impact of the pro forma adjustments described above on net income and loss attributable to noncontrolling interests,
 
                 
includes the anti-dilutive impact of the "Conversion Spread Hedges" (see "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" below) on diluted common shares outstanding related to outstanding convertible notes, and
                 
includes the dilutive impact of additional shares of unvested restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance share units because pro forma net income has been adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation.
 
In addition, pro forma EBITDA excludes depreciation and amortization expense, interest income, interest expense, equity in income and loss of investees, net income and loss attributable to noncontrolling interests, income taxes and includes the impact of foreign currency transactions and other expenses.
 
When aggregated, the foregoing adjustments are expected to increase pro forma EBITDA over GAAP net income by approximately $121 million in the 3
rd
 quarter 2010.  In addition, the foregoing adjustments are expected to increase pro forma net income over GAAP net income by approximately $38 million in the 3
rd
 quarter 2010. On a per share basis, the Company estimates GAAP net income of approximately $4.06 to $4.26 per diluted share for the 3
rd
 quarter 2010.
 
Information About Forward-Looking Statements
 
This press release contains forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements reflect the views of the Company's management regarding current expectations and projections about future events and are based on currently available information and current foreign currency exchange rates. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict; therefore, actual results may differ materially from those expressed, implied or forecasted in any such forward-looking statements. Expressions of future goals and similar expressions including, without limitation, "may," "will," "should," "could," "expects," "does not currently expect," "plans," "anticipates," "intends," "believes," "estimates," "predicts," "potential," "targets," or "continue," reflecting something other than historical fact are intended to identify forward-looking statements.
 
The following factors, among others, could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements:
 
adverse changes in general market conditions for leisure and other travel services as a result of, among other things, decreased consumer spending, general economic downturn, terrorist attacks, natural disasters or adverse weather, the bankruptcy or insolvency of a major airline, or the outbreak of an epidemic or pandemic disease, such as the recent swine flu outbreak;
 
adverse changes in the Company's relationships with airlines and other product and service providers and vendors which could include, without limitation, the withdrawal of suppliers from the priceline.com system (either priceline.com's "retail" or "opaque" services, or both) and/or the loss or reduction of global distribution fees;
fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and other risks associated with doing business in multiple currencies;
 
the effects of increased competition, including the potential impact of increased pricing competition initiated by other on-line travel agents in the form of reduced booking fees and/or the launch by competitors of an "opaque" travel offering;
 
an adverse outcome in one or more of the hotel occupancy and other tax proceedings in which the Company is involved;
 
a change by a major search engine to its search engine algorithms that negatively affects the search engine ranking of the company or its 3
rd
 party distribution partners;
 
our ability to expand successfully in international markets;
 
the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel;
 
difficulties integrating recent or future acquisitions, such as the 2
nd
 quarter 2010 acquisition of TravelJigsaw, including ensuring the effectiveness of the design and operation of internal controls and disclosure controls of acquired businesses;
 
the occurrence of an external or internal security breach of our systems or other Internet based systems involving personal customer information, credit card information or other sensitive data;
 
systems-related failures and/or security breaches, including without limitation, "denial-of-service" type attacks on our system, any security breach that results in the theft, transfer or unauthorized disclosure of customer information, or the failure to comply with various state laws applicable to the company's obligations in the event of such a breach; and
 
legal and regulatory risks.
 
For a detailed discussion of these and other factors that could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements, please refer to the Company's most recent Form 10-Q, Form 10-K and Form 8-K filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Unless required by law, the Company undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
Pro forma EBITDA represents GAAP net income excluding depreciation and amortization expense, interest income, interest expense, equity in income and loss of investees, net income and loss attributable to noncontrolling interests, income taxes and the pro forma adjustments relating to stock-based compensation expense, gains and losses on early debt extinguishment and charges or benefits related to judgments, rulings, or settlements of hotel occupancy tax proceedings.
 
Pro forma EBITDA, pro forma net income and pro forma net income per share are "non-GAAP financial measures," as such term is defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and may differ from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Priceline.com believes that pro forma EBITDA, pro forma net income and pro forma net income per share that exclude certain non-cash or non-recurring income or expense items are useful for analysts and investors to evaluate priceline.com's future on-going performance because they enable a more meaningful comparison of priceline.com's projected cash earnings and performance with its historical results from prior periods. These pro forma metrics, in particular pro forma EBITDA and pro forma net income, are not intended to represent funds available for priceline.com's discretionary use and are not intended to represent or to be used as a substitute for operating income, net income or cash flows from operations data as measured under GAAP. The items excluded from these pro forma metrics, but included in the calculation of their closest GAAP equivalent, are significant components of consolidated statements of income and must be considered in performing a comprehensive assessment of overall financial performance.
 
Pro forma financial information is adjusted for the following items:
 
                 
Amortization expense of acquisition-related intangibles is excluded because it does not impact cash earnings.
 
                 
Charges or benefits related to judgments, rulings, or settlements of hotel occupancy tax proceedings are excluded because the amount and timing of these items are unpredictable, not driven by core operating results and render comparisons with prior periods less meaningful.
 
                 
Stock-based compensation expense is excluded because it does not impact cash earnings and is reflected in earnings per share through increased share count.
 
                 
Interest expense related to the amortization of debt discount and gains or losses on early debt extinguishment related to convertible debt are excluded because they are non-cash in nature.
 
                 
Income tax expense is adjusted for the tax impact of certain of the pro forma adjustments described above and to exclude tax expense recorded where no actual tax payments are owed because of available net operating loss carry forwards.
                 
Net income and loss attributable to noncontrolling interests is adjusted for the impact of certain of the pro forma adjustments described above.
 
                 
For calculating pro forma net income per share:
 
                 
net income is adjusted for the impact of the pro forma adjustments described above.
 
                 
fully diluted share count is adjusted to include the anti-dilutive impact of "Conversion Spread Hedges" which increases the effective conversion price of the currently outstanding 0.50% convertible notes due 2011 and 0.75% convertible notes due 2013 from their stated $40.38 conversion price to an effective conversion price of $50.47 per share.  Under GAAP, the anti-dilutive impact of the Conversion Spread Hedges is not reflected on the outstanding diluted share count until the end of the hedge in 2011 and 2013 if and when shares are delivered.
 
                 
all unvested shares of restricted common stock, restricted stock units and performance share units are included in the calculation of pro forma net income per share because pro forma net income has been adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation expense.
 
The presentation of this financial information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The attached financial and statistical supplement reconciles pro forma financial information with priceline.com's financial results under GAAP.
