Regulation FD Disclosure
 
On November 8, 2010, priceline.com announced its financial results for the 3
rd
 quarter ended September 30, 2010.  A copy of priceline.com's press release announcing these results is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
 
The company noted that average daily rates for hotel room night reservations had increased year-over-year during the 3
rd
 quarter 2010 by about 4% for the company's international business and by over 5% for its domestic business.
 
The company stated that the combined gross travel bookings of Agoda plus Booking.com's business for Asia Pacific destinations was approximately $780 million for the 12 months ended September 30, 2010 and the year-over-year growth rate during the 3
rd
 quarter 2010 was "just shy" of 150%.  The company also stated that Booking.com had gross travel bookings for South American destinations of $96 million for the 12 months ended September 30, 2010 and the year-over-year growth rate during the 3
rd
 quarter 2010 was in excess of 300%.  The company's brands are building point-of-sale businesses which are of a comparable size and growing at impressive rates as well. The company also noted that Booking.com's "point-of-sale" business in South America generated $265 million in gross travel bookings for the 12 months ended September 30, 2010 and the year-over-year growth rate during the 3
rd
 quarter 2010 was approximately 133%. The company stated that Agoda gross bookings grew year-over-year in excess of 100%.
 
The company also explained that it had spent approximately $122 million in cash during the 3
rd
 quarter 2010 in connection with conversions of its outstanding convertible debt (approximately $50 million of which was used to repay the principal amount of outstanding debt
and approximately $72 million of which was paid to satisfy the conversion value in excess of the principal amount).
 
With respect to 4
th
 quarter 2010 guidance, the company announced that it expected consolidated advertising expenses of approximately $141 to $146 million in the 4
th
 quarter 2010 and expected approximately $6 million of that amount to be spent "off-line."  Priceline.com estimated that sales and marketing expenses in the 4
th
 quarter 2010 would be between $29 and $32 million. Priceline.com stated that it estimated that personnel costs, excluding stock-based compensation expense, would be approximately $60.5 to $63.5 million in the 4
th
 quarter 2010. With respect to 4
th
 quarter 2010, priceline.com stated that it estimated that general and administrative expenses would be approximately $21 to $24 million, information technology expenses would be approximately $7 million, and depreciation and amortization expenses, excluding acquisition related amortization, would be approximately $5 million.  Priceline.com said it expected below-the-line net expenses of approximately $6.5 million in the 4
th
 quarter 2010 primarily associated with net interest expense, foreign exchange hedging losses and the charge for non-GAAP net income allocated to non-controlling interests.  Priceline.com estimated that it would have cash income tax expense of approximately $43.5 million in the 4
th
 quarter 2010 comprised of international income taxes and alternative minimum tax and state income taxes in the United States.
 
The company noted that its forecast for the 4
th
 quarter 2010 assumed, among other things, that the Euro/U.S. Dollar exchange rate would be 1.40 U.S. dollars per Euro for the remainder of the 4
th
 quarter and that the British Pound/U.S. Dollar exchange rate would be 1.62 U.S. Dollars per British Pound for the remainder of the 4
th
 quarter.  The company's 4
th
 quarter financial guidance also assumed that the rate of year-over-year increase for international and domestic average daily rates for hotel room night reservations would improve further in the 4
th
 quarter 2010 compared to the year-over-year growth rates in the 3
rd
 quarter 2010.  The company noted that its non-GAAP financial guidance was based upon a diluted share count of approximately 51.4 million shares (which includes a calculation of the assumed economic dilutive impact of the company's outstanding convertible notes and share-based awards, net of the favorable economic impact of the hedges associated with some of the company's outstanding convertible notes), which is based on the company's November 5, 2010 closing stock price of $388.87 per share.  The company noted that it expected TravelJigsaw to be "very slightly" accretive to non-GAAP financial results in the 4
th
 quarter 2010.
 
The company explained that its year-over-year "comps" would be increasingly more challenging in future quarters and noted that the company had seen a year-over-year deceleration in unit growth rates quarter-to-date in the 4
th
 quarter 2010.  The company noted that, as a result of the more challenging "comps" and the "sheer" size of the company's business, it expected to see a pattern of sequential decelerating quarterly year-over-year unit growth rates in future quarters.
 
The company noted that its guidance assumes that macro-economic conditions in general and conditions in the consumer travel market in particular, remain relatively unchanged.

Exhibit 99.1
NORWALK, Conn., November 8, 2010 . . . Priceline.com Incorporated (Nasdaq: PCLN) today reported 3
rd
 quarter 2010 financial results for the Priceline Group of Companies. Third quarter gross travel bookings for the Group, which refers to the total dollar value, generally inclusive of all taxes and fees, of all travel services purchased by consumers, were $4.0 billion, an increase of 47.1% over a year ago.
 
The Group had revenues in the 3
rd
 quarter of $1.0 billion, a 37.1% increase over a year ago. International operations contributed revenues in the 3
rd
 quarter of $531.0 million, a 67.6% increase versus a year ago (approximately 80% on a local currency basis). The Group's gross profit for the 3
rd
 quarter was $666.2 million, a 53.5% increase from the prior year.  International operations contributed gross profit in the 3
rd
 quarter of $529.8 million, a 67.6% increase versus a year ago (approximately 80% growth on a local currency basis). The Group's operating income in the 3
rd
 quarter 2010 was $336.8 million, a 67.8% increase from the prior year. The Group had GAAP net income for the 3
rd
 quarter of $223.0 million or $4.41 per diluted share, which compares to $319.0 million or $6.42 per diluted share in the same period a year ago.  Net income for the 3
rd
 quarter 2009 was positively affected by a $181.9 million non-cash tax benefit from reversing a portion of the valuation allowance related to the Group's net operating loss carry forwards.
 
Non-GAAP net income in the 3
rd
 quarter was $272.3 million, a 57.1% increase versus the similar period in the prior year.  Non-GAAP net income per diluted share was $5.33, compared to $3.45 per diluted share a year ago.  First Call analyst consensus for the 3
rd
 quarter 2010 was $4.97 per diluted share. Non-GAAP EBITDA for the 3
rd
 quarter was $362.5 million, an increase of 61.4% over the prior year.  The section below entitled "" provides a definition and information about the use of non-GAAP financial measures in this press release and the attached financial and statistical supplement reconciles non-GAAP financial information with the Group's financial results under GAAP.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
"We are pleased by the Group's strong performance in the 3
rd
 quarter" said Jeffery H. Boyd, President and CEO.  "Increased gross travel bookings were driven primarily by our worldwide hotel business, which had a 54% increase in room nights booked.  Transaction growth in core Western European and North American markets, ADR improvement and an increasing contribution from high growth new markets led to a sequential increase in the Group's gross travel bookings growth."
 
Mr. Boyd continued, "Rental car unit sales also contributed to bookings growth with 97% growth in days booked, driven by the strong performance of TravelJigsaw, our recently acquired international rental car business, and a 23% increase in domestic unit sales.  Airline ticket sales were down 5% in the quarter as demand was impacted by reduced capacity and higher airfares."
 
Looking forward, Mr. Boyd said, "We believe the Group is benefiting from cyclical improvements in the travel economy, including an easing of immediate fears relating to Eurozone sovereign debt, an increasing contribution from fast-growing new markets, particularly non-core Europe and Asia/Pacific, and continued innovation and execution by our teams around the world to build hotel supply, content, distribution and improve the customer experience.  We believe the scale of our international hotel business and the talent and commitment of our people position the Group well to continue building share and navigate changes in our markets in the future."
 
Priceline.com said the Group was targeting the following for 4
th
 quarter 2010:
 
                 
Year-over-year increase in total gross travel bookings of approximately 36% - 41%.
                 
Year-over-year increase in international gross travel bookings of approximately 54% - 59% (an increase of approximately 58% - 63% on a local currency basis).
                 
Year-over-year increase in domestic gross travel bookings of approximately 5% - 10%.
                 
Year-over-year increase in revenue of approximately 31% - 36%.
                 
Year-over-year increase in gross profit of approximately 49% - 54%.
                 
Non-GAAP EBITDA of approximately $200 million to $210 million.
                 
Non-GAAP net income of between $2.91 and $3.06 per diluted share.
 
Non-GAAP guidance for the 4
th
 quarter 2010:
 
                 
excludes non-cash amortization expense of acquisition-related intangibles,
                 
excludes non-cash stock-based compensation expense,
                 
excludes non-cash interest expense and gains or losses on early debt extinguishment, if any, related to cash settled convertible debt,
                 
excludes the impact, if any, of charges or benefits associated with judgments, rulings and/or settlements related to hotel occupancy tax proceedings,
                 
excludes non-cash income tax expense and reflects the impact on income taxes of certain of the non-GAAP adjustments,
                 
includes the additional impact of the non-GAAP adjustments described above on net income attributable to noncontrolling interests,
                 
includes the anti-dilutive impact of the "Conversion Spread Hedges" (see "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" below) on diluted common shares outstanding related to outstanding convertible notes, and
                 
includes the dilutive impact of additional shares of unvested restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance share units because non-GAAP net income has been adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation.
 
In addition, non-GAAP EBITDA excludes depreciation and amortization expense, interest income, interest expense, equity in income and loss of investees, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, income taxes and includes the impact of foreign currency transactions and other expenses.
 
When aggregated, the foregoing adjustments are expected to increase non-GAAP EBITDA over GAAP net income by approximately $84 million in the 4
th
 quarter 2010.  In addition, the foregoing adjustments are expected to increase non-GAAP net income over GAAP net income by approximately $33 million in the 4
th
 quarter 2010. On a per share basis, the Group estimates GAAP net income of approximately $2.29 to $2.44 per diluted share for the 4
th
 quarter 2010.
 
Information About Forward-Looking Statements
 
This press release contains forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements reflect the views of the Group's management regarding current expectations and projections about future events and are based on currently available information and current foreign currency exchange rates. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict; therefore, actual results may differ materially from those expressed, implied or forecasted in any such forward-looking statements. Expressions of future goals and similar expressions including, without limitation, "may," "will," "should," "could," "expects," "does not currently expect," "plans," "anticipates," "intends," "believes," "estimates," "predicts," "potential," "targets," or "continue," reflecting something other than historical fact are intended to identify forward-looking statements.
 
The following factors, among others, could cause the Group's actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements:
 
    adverse changes in general market conditions for leisure and other travel services as a result of, among other things, decreased consumer spending, general economic downturn, terrorist attacks, natural disasters or adverse weather, the bankruptcy or insolvency of a major airline, or the outbreak of an epidemic or pandemic disease, such as the recent swine flu outbreak;
 
    adverse changes in the Group's relationships with airlines and other product and service providers and vendors which could include, without limitation, the withdrawal of suppliers from the Group's systems (either "retail" or "opaque" services, or both) and/or the loss or reduction of global distribution fees;
 
   
fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and other risks associated with doing business in multiple currencies;
 
   
the effects of increased competition, including the potential impact of increased pricing competition initiated by other on-line travel agents in the form of reduced booking fees and/or the launch by competitors of an "opaque" travel offering and the potential impact of "metasearch" initiatives by Google and other search engines upon which we rely for a significant amount of traffic;
 
   
an adverse outcome in one or more of the hotel occupancy and other tax proceedings in which the Company is involved;
 
   
a change by a major search engine to its search engine algorithms that negatively affects the search engine ranking of the company or its 3
rd
 party distribution partners;
 
   
our ability to expand successfully in international markets;
 
   
the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel;
 
   
difficulties integrating recent or future acquisitions, such as the 2
nd
 quarter 2010 acquisition of TravelJigsaw, including ensuring the effectiveness of the design and operation of internal controls and disclosure controls of acquired businesses;
 
   
the occurrence of an external or internal security breach of our systems or other Internet based systems involving personal customer information, credit card information or other sensitive data;
 
   
systems-related failures and/or security breaches, including without limitation, "denial-of-service" type attacks on our system, any security breach that results in the theft, transfer or unauthorized disclosure of customer information, or the failure to comply with various state laws applicable to the company's obligations in the event of such a breach; and
 
    legal and regulatory risks.
 
For a detailed discussion of these and other factors that could cause the Group's actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements, please refer to the Group's most recent Form 10-Q, Form 10-K and Form 8-K filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Unless required by law, the Group undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
 
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
Non-GAAP EBITDA represents GAAP net income excluding depreciation and amortization expense, interest income, interest expense, equity in income and loss of investees, net income and loss attributable to noncontrolling interests, income taxes and the non-GAAP adjustments relating to stock-based compensation expense, gains and losses on early debt extinguishment and charges or benefits related to judgments, rulings, or settlements of hotel occupancy tax proceedings. Additionally, favorable adjustments related to franchise tax and sales and use tax recorded in GAAP net income have been excluded from non-GAAP EBITDA and non-GAAP net income.
 
Non-GAAP EBITDA, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share are "non-GAAP financial measures," as such term is defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and may differ from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. The Group believes that non-GAAP EBITDA, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share that exclude certain non-cash or non-recurring income or expense items are useful for analysts and investors to evaluate the Group's future on-going performance because they enable a more meaningful comparison of the Group's projected cash earnings and performance with its historical results from prior periods. These non-GAAP metrics, in particular non-GAAP EBITDA and non-GAAP net income, are not intended to represent funds available for priceline.com's discretionary use and are not intended to represent or to be used as a substitute for operating income, net income or cash flows from operations data as measured under GAAP. The items excluded from these non-GAAP metrics, but included in the calculation of their closest GAAP equivalent, are significant components of consolidated statements of income and must be considered in performing a comprehensive assessment of overall financial performance.
 
Non-GAAP financial information is adjusted for the following items:
 
                 
Amortization expense of acquisition-related intangibles is excluded because it does not impact cash earnings.
 
                 
Charges or benefits related to judgments, rulings, or settlements of hotel occupancy tax proceedings and favorable adjustments related to certain franchise and sales tax issues for our headquarters location are excluded because the amount and timing of these items are unpredictable, not driven by core operating results and render comparisons with prior periods less meaningful.
 
                 
Stock-based compensation expense is excluded because it does not impact cash earnings and is reflected in earnings per share through increased share count.
 
                 
Interest expense related to the amortization of debt discount and gains or losses on early debt extinguishment related to convertible debt are excluded because they are non-cash in nature.
 
                 
Income tax expense is adjusted for the tax impact of certain of the non-GAAP adjustments described above and to exclude tax expense recorded where no actual tax payments are owed because of available net operating loss carry forwards.  Income tax expense for the 3
rd
 quarter 2009 was adjusted to exclude a $181.9 million non-cash tax benefit from reversing a portion of the valuation allowance related to the Group's net operating loss carry forwards.
 
                 
Net income and loss attributable to non-controlling interest is adjusted for the impact of certain of the non-GAAP adjustments described above
 
                 
For calculating non-GAAP net income per share:
 
                 
net income is adjusted for the impact of the non-GAAP adjustments described above.
 
                 
fully diluted share count is adjusted to include the anti-dilutive impact of "Conversion Spread Hedges" which increases the effective conversion price of the currently outstanding 0.50% convertible notes due 2011 and 0.75% convertible notes due 2013 from their stated $40.38 conversion price to an effective conversion price of $50.47 per share.  Under GAAP, the anti-dilutive impact of the Conversion Spread Hedges is not reflected on the outstanding diluted share count until the end of the hedge in 2011 and 2013 if and when shares are delivered.
 
                 
all unvested shares of restricted common stock, restricted stock units and performance share units are included in the calculation of non-GAAP net income per share because non-GAAP net income has been adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation expense.
 
The presentation of this financial information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The attached financial and statistical supplement reconciles non-GAAP financial information with priceline.com's financial results under GAAP.
