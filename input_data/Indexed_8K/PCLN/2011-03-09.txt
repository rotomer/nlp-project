On March 4, 2011, priceline.com Incorporated (the "Company") granted performance-based equity awards to certain Company employees, including the Company's "named executive officers." The grants were made under the priceline.com Incorporated 1999 Omnibus Plan and will only be payable if the Company achieves a specified threshold level of cumulative consolidated non-GAAP EBITDA for the three-year period from January 1, 2011 through December 31, 2013 (the "Performance Period"). Above such specified target, the awards are subject to a multiplier of 1x to 2x, dependent upon the Company achieving specified target levels of cumulative consolidated non-GAAP EBITDA for the Performance Period. The awards will be subject to forfeiture if (1) the Company terminates the executive's employment for cause prior to March 4, 2014, (2) the executive terminates his employment for any reason other than death, disability or other specified reasons prior to March 4, 2014, or (3) if a minimum threshold of consolidated non-GAAP EBITDA for the Performance Period is not achieved.
 
Also on March 4, 2011, the Company granted awards of restricted stock units ("RSUs") to non-employee directors of the Company. These RSUs vest on March 5, 2012, at which time the Company will issue one share of common stock, par value $0.008 per share, of the Company to each director for each vested RSU. In addition, such RSUs will accelerate if there is a "change in control" of the Company prior to that date. The awards will be subject to forfeiture if the non-employee director's service terminates prior to March 5, 2012, for reasons other than death or disability. Under these awards, 366 RSUs were issued to each non-employee director, other than the Chairman of the Board, on March 4, 2010, and 602 RSUs were issued to the Chairman of the Board.
 
This summary of the terms of the grants is qualified in its entirety by the forms of performance share unit agreement attached hereto as Exhibits 10.1, 10.2 and 10.3, each of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.

Definitions
 
(a)           "Company" shall mean priceline.com Incorporated, any of its subsidiaries or affiliates.
 
(b)           "Consolidated Non-GAAP EBITDA" shall mean the Company's operating income, excluding depreciation and amortization expense and including the impact of foreign currency transactions and other expense, all determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, adjusted to exclude the impact of those items excluded from the non-GAAP financial metric "non-GAAP EBITDA," as publicly disclosed annually or quarterly, as applicable, by the Company in connection with the Company's annual and quarterly earnings announcements.  Consolidated Non-GAAP EBITDA as publicly disclosed typically excludes and/or includes items that are, among other things, non-cash in nature, or related to unusual or non-recurring events, or in response to changes in laws or regulations, or to account for gains, losses or expenses determined to be extraordinary or unusual in nature or infrequent in occurrence, or are unpredictable as to amount or timing, not driven by core operating results and render comparisons with prior periods less meaningful, or related to the acquisition of a business or the disposition of a business or a segment of a business, or related to a change in accounting principles.  Consolidated Non-GAAP EBITDA shall also be adjusted (i) to exclude the financial results from any acquisition or to include the prospective forecasted results for any disposition of a business or a segment of a business made during the Performance Period and (ii) to exclude the on-going impact of change in accounting principles.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in determining Consolidated Non-GAAP EBITDA, the Committee shall have the authority to make additional adjustments that it considers, in its good faith judgment, necessary to maintain the intent and principles consistent with the foregoing adjustments.
 
(c)           "Continuous Service" shall mean the Participant's service with the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate whether as an employee, director or consultant, which is not interrupted or terminated.
 
(d)           "Cumulative Consolidated Non-GAAP EBITDA" shall mean the Consolidated Non-GAAP EBITDA during the Performance Period, calculated on a cumulative basis, net of any losses.
 
(e)           "Determination Date" shall mean March 4, 2014.
 
(f)            "Disability" shall mean that (i) the Participant is unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment that can be expected to result in death or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than twelve (12) months or (ii) the Participant is, by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment that can be expected to result in death or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than twelve (12) months, receiving income replacement benefits for a period of not less than three (3) months under an accident and health plan covering employees of the Company.
 
(g)           "Good Reason" shall mean (i) a material diminution in the Participant's authority, duties or responsibilities, (ii) relocation of the Company's executive office in Connecticut to a location more than thirty-five (35) miles from its current location or more than thirty-five (35) miles further from the Participant's residence at the time of relocation, or (iii) any material breach of an employment agreement, if any, that is in effect at any time between the Participant and the Company.
 
Before a termination by a Participant will constitute termination for Good Reason, the Participant must give the Company a Notice of Good Reason within ninety (90) calendar days following the occurrence of the event that constitutes Good Reason.  Failure to provide such Notice of Good Reason within such 90-day period shall be conclusive proof that the Participant shall not have Good Reason to terminate employment.
 
Good Reason shall exist only if (A) the Employer fails to remedy the event or events constituting Good Reason within thirty (30) calendar days after receipt of the Notice of Good Reason from the Participant and (B) the Participant terminates his or her employment within sixty (60) days after the end of the period set forth in clause (A) above.

(h)          
"Notice of Good Reason" means a written notice by the Participant to the Company which sets forth in reasonable detail the specific reason for a termination of employment for Good Reason and the facts and circumstances claimed to provide a basis for such termination and is provided to the Company in accordance with the terms set forth in Section 1(g) hereof.
 
(i)            "Performance Period" shall mean the period commencing on January 1, 2011 and ending on December 31, 2013.
 
(j)            "Plan Year" shall mean the calendar year.

(l)            "Target Amount" shall have the meaning given such term under Section 2.

Subject to Section 3(f), all shares of Stock to be issued to the Participant under this Section 3(c), if any, shall be issued to the Participant (or the Participant's designated beneficiary in the event of the Participant's death) as soon as practicable after the Participant's Continuous Service is terminated but in no event later than March 15 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the Participant's Continuous Service is terminated (or, if the Participant's Continuous Service is terminated on or after January 1, 2014, March 15, 2014).

The Performance Share Unit number shall be determined in accordance with this if, prior to the Determination Date, a Change in Control occurs and/or the Participant's Continuous Service terminates.  If no Change in Control occurs or the Participant's Continuous Service does not terminate prior to the Determination Date, the Performance Share Unit number shall be determined in accordance with the table in Section 1(m) hereof.  Upon any date of determination before the Determination Date as set forth in the Agreement or in connection with a determination pursuant to Section 3(d) hereof, the Participant's Performance Share Unit number shall be determined as of the most recently completed fiscal quarter for the period commencing January 1, 2011.  Such Performance Share Unit number shall be equal to the product of (1) the Target Amount, multiplied by either (2)(a) the sole Mid-Period Vesting Factor under the column with the heading "Mid-Period Vesting Factor Ranges" in the chart below corresponding to the actual Cumulative Consolidated Non-GAAP EBITDA per applicable quarter for which the determination is made or (b) the sum of (i) the lowest Mid-Period Vesting Factor in the applicable Mid-Period Vesting Factor Range corresponding to the actual Cumulative Consolidated Non-GAAP EBITDA per applicable quarter for which the determination is made, plus (ii) the ProRata Mid-Period Vesting Factor Increase.
Exhibit 1

(b)           "Consolidated Non-GAAP EBITDA" shall mean the Company's operating income, excluding depreciation and amortization expense and including the impact of foreign currency transactions and other expense, all determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, adjusted to exclude the impact of those items excluded from the non-GAAP financial metric "non-GAAP EBITDA," as publicly disclosed annually or quarterly, as applicable, by the Company in connection with the Company's annual and quarterly earnings announcements.  Consolidated Non-GAAP EBITDA as publicly disclosed typically excludes and/or includes items that are, among other things, non-cash in nature, or related to unusual or non-recurring events, or in response to changes in laws or regulations, or to account for gains, losses or expenses determined to be extraordinary or unusual in nature or infrequent in occurrence, or are unpredictable as to amount or timing, not driven by core operating results and render comparisons with prior periods less meaningful, or related to the acquisition of a business or the disposition of a business or a segment of a business, or related to a change in accounting principles.  Consolidated Non-GAAP EBITDA shall also be adjusted (i) to exclude the financial results from any acquisition or to include the prospective forecasted results for any disposition of a business or a segment of a business made during the Performance Period and (ii) to exclude the on-going impact of change in accounting principles.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in determining Consolidated Non-GAAP EBITDA, the Committee shall have the authority to make additional adjustments that it considers, in its good faith judgment, necessary to maintain the intent and principles consistent with the foregoing adjustments.
 
(c)           "Continuous Service" shall mean the Participant's service with the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate whether as an employee, director or consultant, which is not interrupted or terminated.

Before a termination by a Participant will constitute termination for Good Reason, the Participant must give the Company a Notice of Good Reason within ninety (90) calendar days following the occurrence of the event that constitutes Good Reason.  Failure to provide such Notice of Good Reason within such 90-day period shall be conclusive proof that the Participant shall not have Good Reason to terminate employment.
 
Good Reason shall exist only if (A) the Employer fails to remedy the event or events constituting Good Reason within thirty (30) calendar days after receipt of the Notice of Good Reason from the Participant and (B) the Participant terminates his or her employment within sixty (60) days after the end of the period set forth in clause (A) above.

Such Performance Share Unit number shall be equal to the product of (1) the Target Amount, multiplied by either (2)(a) the sole Mid-Period Vesting Factor under the column with the heading "Mid-Period Vesting Factor Ranges" in the chart below corresponding to the actual Cumulative Consolidated Non-GAAP EBITDA per applicable quarter for which the determination is made or (b) the sum of (i) the lowest Mid-Period Vesting Factor in the applicable Mid-Period Vesting Factor Range corresponding to the actual Cumulative Consolidated Non-GAAP EBITDA per applicable quarter for which the determination is made, plus (ii) the ProRata Mid-Period Vesting Factor Increase.
Exhibit 1
 
The "ProRata Mid-Period VestingFactor Increase" means the quotient of (1) the excess of the actual Cumulative Consolidated Non-GAAP EBITDA over the lowest Cumulative Consolidated Non-GAAP EBITDA within the specified range per the applicable quarter for which the determination is made, divided by (2) the result of a fraction, the numerator of which is the difference between the lowest and highest Cumulative Consolidated Non-GAAP EBITDA within such specified range per the applicable quarter for which the determination is made, and the denominator of which is the difference between the lowest and highest specified Mid-Period Vesting Factor for such quarter.
