Regulation FD Disclosure
 
On May 5, 2011, priceline.com announced its financial results for the 1
st
 quarter ended March 31, 2011.  A copy of priceline.com's press release announcing these financial results is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
 
The company noted that average daily rates for hotel room night reservations had increased year-over-year during the 1
st
 quarter 2011 approximately 4% internationally and by approximately 7% domestically.
 
With respect to 2
nd
 quarter 2011 guidance, the company announced that it expected consolidated advertising expenses of approximately $233 to $243 million in the 2
nd
 quarter 2011 and expected approximately $10 million of that amount to be spent "off-line."  Priceline.com estimated that sales and marketing expenses in the 2
nd
 quarter 2011 would be between $36 and $41 million.  Priceline.com stated that it estimated that personnel costs, excluding stock-based compensation expense, would be approximately $75 to $80 million in the 2
nd
 quarter 2011.  With respect to 2
nd
 quarter 2011, priceline.com stated it estimated that general and administrative expenses would be approximately $26 to $31 million, information technology expenses would be approximately $8 million, and depreciation and amortization expenses, excluding acquisition related amortization, would be approximately $5 million.  Priceline.com said it expected other/income and expense, excluding non-cash interest expense and gains or losses on early debt extinguishment, if any, related to cash settled convertible debt and expense associated with non-
 
GAAP net income allocated to non-controlling interests, to be an expense of approximately $9 million in the 2
nd
 quarter 2011.
 
The company explained that its guidance assumed that the company would experience non-GAAP EBITDA "deleverage" during the 2
nd
 quarter 2011 caused by, among other things, expenses associated with the year over year variance in other income/expense.
 
The company noted that its forecast for the remainder of the 2
nd
 quarter 2011 assumed, among other things, that the Euro/U.S. Dollar exchange rate would be 1.48 U.S. dollars per Euro and that the British Pound/U.S. Dollar exchange rate would be 1.65 U.S. Dollars per British Pound.  The company noted that these assumed exchange rates for the 2
nd
 quarter 2011 would be stronger by approximately 16% for the Euro and 10% for the British Pound as compared to actual exchange rates in effect during the 2
nd
 quarter 2010.
 
The company also explained that its forecast for the remainder of the 2
nd
 quarter 2011 assumed that the year-over-year rate of increase in hotel average daily rates would be less than the year-over-year increases experienced in the 1
st
 quarter 2011.  The company noted that its Non-GAAP financial guidance was based upon a Non-GAAP diluted share count of approximately 51.7 million shares (which includes a calculation of the assumed economic dilutive impact of the company's outstanding convertible notes and share-based awards, net of the favorable economic impact of the hedges associated with the company's outstanding convertible notes), which is based on the company's May 4, 2011 closing stock price of $537.56 per share.
 
The company emphasized that it was highly likely that its year-over-year unit growth rates would sequentially decelerate in future quarters due to the "sheer size of the business" and progressively more difficult "comps" as economic conditions continue to gradually improve.  In particular, the company noted that its 2
nd
 quarter 2011 guidance reflected deceleration in the unit growth rate for hotel room night reservations based upon actual results to date and assumed deceleration as the company proceeded through the rest of the 2
nd
 quarter.
 
The company noted that its guidance assumes that macro-economic conditions in general and conditions in the consumer travel market in particular, remain relatively unchanged.

NORWALK, Conn., May 5, 2011. . . Priceline.com Incorporated (Nasdaq: PCLN) today reported 1
st
 quarter 2011 financial results for the Priceline Group of Companies. First quarter gross travel bookings for the group, which refers to the total dollar value, generally inclusive of all taxes and fees, of all travel services purchased by consumers, were $4.7 billion, an increase of 57.3% over a year ago.
 
The Group had revenues in the 1
st
 quarter of $809.3 million, a 38.5% increase over a year ago. The Group's international operations contributed revenues in the 1
st
 quarter of $389.1 million, an 80% increase versus a year ago (approximately 79% on a local currency basis). The Group's gross profit for the 1
st
 quarter was $505.8 million, a 58.5% increase from the prior year. International operations contributed gross profit in the 1
st
 quarter of $388.2 million, an 81% increase versus a year ago (approximately 79% growth on a local currency basis). The Group's operating income in the 1
st
 quarter was $154.1 million, a 75.2% increase from the prior year. The Group had GAAP net income applicable to common shareholders for the 1
st
 quarter of $104.8 million, or $2.05 per diluted share, which compares to $53.9 million or $1.06 per diluted share, in the same period a year ago.
 
Non-GAAP net income in the 1
st
 quarter was $137.0 million, a 57.1% increase versus the prior year.  Non-GAAP net income was $2.66 per diluted share, compared to $1.70 per diluted share a year ago. First Call analyst consensus for the 1
st
 quarter 2011 was $2.44 per diluted share.  Non-GAAP EBITDA for the 1
st
 quarter 2011 was $173.5 million, an increase of 55.3% over a year ago. The section below entitled "" provides a definition and information about the use of non-GAAP financial measures in this press release and the attached financial and statistical supplement reconciles non-GAAP financial information with the Group's financial results under GAAP.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
"In the 1
st
 quarter, the Group benefitted from strong growth in our global hotel business, particularly at Booking.com and Agoda," said Jeffery H. Boyd, Priceline President and Chief Executive Officer.  "Room nights booked grew by 55.8% and our international gross bookings grew by 79% compared to prior year first quarter.  The Group's hotel business continues to benefit from improving ADRs, a continuing shift from offline to online bookings, increased penetration of core European and North American markets and outstanding growth in new markets throughout the Asia-Pacific region and South America."
 
Mr. Boyd continued, "The Group's global rental car operations grew rental car days booked by 64.7% in the 1
st
 quarter 2011 as compared to the prior year.  A significant portion of this growth can be attributed to the Group's acquisition of TravelJigsaw and its international car hire operations, which continues to grow at impressive rates.  Priceline.com's airline ticketing business returned to positive growth in the 1
st
 quarter, with a 2.1% gain in ticket sales and improving growth in opaque ticket sales."
 
 
Looking forward, Mr. Boyd said, "Globally, we intend to retain our focus on extending our reach in established and new geographic markets and providing an outstanding consumer experience to build the strength of our brands."
 
The Priceline Group said it was targeting the following for 2
nd
 quarter 2011:
 
    
Year-over-year increase in total gross travel bookings of approximately 53% - 58%.
    
Year-over-year increase in international gross travel bookings of approximately 76% - 81% (an increase of approximately 53% - 58% on a local currency basis).
    
Year-over-year increase in domestic gross travel bookings of approximately 8% to 13%.
    
Year-over-year increase in revenue of approximately 36% to 41%.
    
Year-over-year increase in gross profit of approximately 57% to 62%.
    
Non-GAAP EBITDA of approximately $310 million to $320 million.
    
Non-GAAP net income of between $4.70 and $4.90 per diluted share.
 
Non-GAAP guidance for the 2
nd
 quarter 2011:
 
    
excludes non-cash amortization expense of acquisition-related intangibles,
    
excludes non-cash stock-based compensation expense,
    
excludes non-cash interest expense and gains or losses on early debt extinguishment, if any, related to cash settled convertible debt,
    
excludes the impact, if any, of charges or benefits associated with judgments, rulings and/or settlements related to hotel occupancy tax proceedings,
    
excludes non-cash income tax expense and reflects the impact on income taxes of certain of the non-GAAP adjustments,
    
includes the additional impact of the non-GAAP adjustments described above on net income attributable to noncontrolling interests,
    
includes the anti-dilutive impact of the "Conversion Spread Hedges" (see "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" below) on diluted common shares outstanding related to outstanding convertible notes, and
    
includes the dilutive impact of additional shares of unvested restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance share units because non-GAAP net income has been adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation.
 
In addition, non-GAAP EBITDA excludes depreciation and amortization expense, interest income, interest expense, net income and loss attributable to noncontrolling interests, income taxes and includes the impact of foreign currency transactions and other expenses.
 
When aggregated, the non-GAAP adjustments are expected to increase non-GAAP EBITDA over GAAP net income by approximately $109 million in the 2
nd
 quarter 2011.  In addition, the non-GAAP adjustments are expected to increase non-GAAP net income over GAAP net income by approximately $37 million in the 2
nd
 quarter 2011. On a per share basis, the Group estimates GAAP net income of approximately $4.03 to $4.23 per diluted share for the 2
nd
 quarter 2011.
 
 
Information About Forward-Looking Statements
 
This press release contains forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements reflect the views of the Group's management regarding current expectations and projections about future events and are based on currently available information and current foreign currency exchange rates. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict; therefore, actual results may differ materially from those expressed, implied or forecasted in any such forward-looking statements. Expressions of future goals and similar expressions including, without limitation, "may," "will," "should," "could," "expects," "does not currently expect," "plans," "anticipates," "intends," "believes," "estimates," "predicts," "potential," "targets," or "continue," reflecting something other than historical fact are intended to identify forward-looking statements.
 
The following factors, among others, could cause the Group's actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements:
 
adverse changes in general market conditions for leisure and other travel services as a result of, among other things, decreased consumer spending, general economic downturn, terrorist attacks, natural disasters or adverse weather, the bankruptcy or insolvency of a major airline, or the outbreak of an epidemic or pandemic disease, such as the swine flu outbreak;
 
adverse changes in the Group's relationships with airlines and other product and service providers and vendors which could include, without limitation, the withdrawal of suppliers from the Group's systems (either "retail" or "opaque" services, or both) and/or the loss or reduction of global distribution fees;
 
fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and other risks associated with doing business in multiple currencies;
 
the effects of increased competition, including the potential impact of increased pricing competition initiated by other on-line travel agents in the form of reduced booking fees and/or the launch by competitors of an "opaque" travel offering and the potential impact of "metasearch" initiatives by Google and other search engines upon which we rely for a significant amount of traffic;
 
an adverse outcome in one or more of the hotel occupancy and other tax proceedings in which priceline.com is involved;
 
a change by a major search engine to its search engine algorithms that negatively affects the search engine ranking of the company or its 3rd party distribution partners;
 
our ability to expand successfully in international markets;
 
the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel;
 
 
difficulties integrating recent or future acquisitions, such as the 2nd quarter 2010 acquisition of TravelJigsaw, including ensuring the effectiveness of the design and operation of internal controls and disclosure controls of acquired businesses;
 
the occurrence of an external or internal security breach of our systems or other Internet based systems involving personal customer information, credit card information or other sensitive data;
 
systems-related failures and/or security breaches, including without limitation, "denial-of-service" type attacks on our system, any security breach that results in the theft, transfer or unauthorized disclosure of customer information, or the failure to comply with various state laws applicable to the company's obligations in the event of such a breach; and
 
legal and regulatory risks.
 
For a detailed discussion of these and other factors that could cause the Group's actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements, please refer to the Group's most recent Form 10-Q, Form 10-K and Form 8-K filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Unless required by law, the Group undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
 
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
Non-GAAP EBITDA represents GAAP net income excluding depreciation and amortization expense, interest income, interest expense, net income and loss attributable to noncontrolling interests, income taxes and is adjusted for the non-GAAP adjustments relating to stock-based compensation expense, gains and losses on early debt extinguishment and charges or benefits related to judgments, rulings, or settlements of hotel occupancy tax proceedings.
 
Non-GAAP EBITDA, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share are "non-GAAP financial measures," as such term is defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and may differ from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. The Group believes that non-GAAP EBITDA, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share that exclude certain non-cash or non-recurring income or expense items are useful for analysts and investors to evaluate the Group's future on-going performance because they enable a more meaningful comparison of the Group's projected cash earnings and performance with its historical results from prior periods and to those of its competitors. These non-GAAP metrics, in particular non-GAAP EBITDA and non-GAAP net income, are not intended to represent funds available for priceline.com's discretionary use and are not intended to represent or to be used as a substitute for operating income, net income or cash flows from operations data as measured under GAAP. The items excluded from these non-GAAP metrics, but included in the calculation of their closest GAAP equivalent, are significant components of consolidated statements of income and must be considered in performing a comprehensive assessment of overall financial performance.
 
 
Non-GAAP financial information is adjusted for the following items:
 
    
Amortization expense of acquisition-related intangibles is excluded because it does not impact cash earnings.
    
Stock-based compensation expense is excluded because it does not impact cash earnings and is reflected in earnings per share through increased share count.
    
Interest expense related to the amortization of debt discount and gains or losses on early debt extinguishment related to convertible debt are excluded because they are non-cash in nature.
    
Charges or benefits related to judgments, rulings, or settlements of hotel occupancy tax proceedings and favorable adjustments related to certain franchise and sales tax issues for our headquarters location are excluded because the amount and timing of these items are unpredictable, not driven by core operating results and render comparisons with prior periods less meaningful.
    
Income tax expense is adjusted for the tax impact of certain of the non-GAAP adjustments described above and to exclude tax expense recorded where no actual tax payments are owed because of available net operating loss carry forwards.
    
Net income and loss attributable to noncontrolling interest is adjusted for the impact of certain of the non-GAAP adjustments described above
    
For calculating non-GAAP net income per share:
    
net income is adjusted for the impact of the non-GAAP adjustments described above.
    
fully diluted share count is adjusted to include the anti-dilutive impact of "Conversion Spread Hedges" which increases the effective conversion price of the currently outstanding 0.50% convertible notes due 2011 and 0.75% convertible notes due 2013 from their stated $40.38 conversion price to an effective conversion price of $50.47 per share.  Under GAAP, the anti-dilutive impact of the Conversion Spread Hedges is not reflected on the outstanding diluted share count until if and when shares are delivered.
    
all unvested shares of restricted common stock, restricted stock units and performance share units are included in the calculation of non-GAAP  net income per share because non-GAAP net income has been adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation expense.
 
The presentation of this financial information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The attached financial and statistical supplement reconciles non-GAAP financial information with priceline.com's financial results under GAAP.
