Regulation FD Disclosure
 
On August 4, 2011, priceline.com announced its financial results for the 2
nd
 quarter ended June 30, 2011.  A copy of priceline.com's press release announcing these financial results is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
 
The company noted that average daily rates for hotel room night reservations had increased year-over-year during the 2
nd
 quarter 2011 on a local currency basis by approximately 4% internationally and by approximately 8% domestically.  The company noted that its 2
nd
 quarter 2011 financial results benefited from favorable currency exchange rates as compared to the same period last year  exchange rates for the 2
nd
 quarter 2011 for the Euro and Great British Pound were approximately 14% and 9% higher, respectively, than the average exchange rates for the 2
nd
 quarter 2010.  The company said that Name Your Own Price hotel room night growth decelerated during the 2
nd
 quarter 2011 likely as a result of competitor's initiatives in the opaque hotel arena.
 
The company stated that its merchant gross bookings growth of 45% continued to reflect growth in the domestic merchant businesses, but was primarily driven by growth from Agoda and TravelJigsaw, which now represents a significant share of the company's merchant bookings.  The company said that Agoda reported higher year-over-year growth in gross bookings as it "comped" last years' civil strife in Thailand, contributing to the company's overall international and merchant growth.  The company said that TravelJigsaw delivered better than anticipated growth in rental car unit sales in the 2
nd
 quarter 2011 through solid execution in building toward the high season.
 
The company noted that its international gross bookings forecast for the 3
rd
 quarter of 2011 represented a significant sequential decrease from 2
nd
 quarter 2011 results.  The company noted that the primary drivers of this decrease were a "softer" 2
nd
 quarter 2010 comparison and a "tougher" 3
rd
 quarter 2010 comparison, where local currency international gross bookings growth accelerated by almost 1,100 basis points sequentially.  The company also noted that the 3
rd
 quarter 2010, for the first time, included full period results for TravelJigsaw.
 
With respect to 3
rd
 quarter 2011 guidance, the company announced that it expected consolidated advertising expenses of approximately $273 to $283 million in the 3
rd
 quarter 2011 and expected approximately $8 million of that amount to be spent "off-line."  Priceline.com estimated that sales and marketing expenses in the 3
rd
 quarter 2011 would be between $40 and $45 million.  Priceline.com stated that it estimated that personnel costs, excluding stock-based compensation expense, would be approximately $78 to $83 million in the 3
rd
 quarter 2011.  With respect to 3
rd
 quarter 2011, priceline.com stated it estimated that general and administrative expenses would be approximately $27 to $32 million, information technology expenses would be approximately $10 million, and depreciation and amortization expenses, excluding acquisition related amortization, would be approximately $6 million.  Priceline.com said it expected other/income and expense, excluding non-cash interest expense and gains or losses on early debt extinguishment, if any, related to cash settled convertible debt and expense associated with non-GAAP net income allocated to non-controlling interests, to be an expense of approximately $6 million in the 3
rd
 quarter 2011.
 
The company said it estimated the "Innovation Box" tax benefit in The Netherlands could reduce the company's consolidated tax income tax rate by approximately 4% to 6% in 2012.
The company noted that its forecast for the remainder of the 3
rd
 quarter 2011 assumed, among other things, that the Euro/U.S. Dollar exchange rate would be 1.43 U.S. dollars per Euro and that the British Pound/U.S. Dollar exchange rate would be 1.64 U.S. Dollars per British Pound.  The company noted that these assumed exchange rates for the 3
rd
 quarter 2011 would be stronger by approximately 11% for the Euro and 5% for the British Pound as compared to actual exchange rates in effect during the 3
rd
 quarter 2010.  The company emphasized that volatility in the Euro Dollar exchange rate could materially impact the company's U.S. denominated earnings.
 
The company noted that its Non-GAAP financial guidance was based upon a Non-GAAP diluted share count of approximately 51.5 million shares (which includes a calculation of the assumed economic dilutive impact of the company's outstanding convertible notes and share-based awards, net of the favorable economic impact of the hedges associated with the company's outstanding convertible notes), which is based on the company's August 3, 2011 closing stock price of $521.97 per share.
 
The company emphasized that it was highly likely that its year-over-year unit growth rates would sequentially decelerate in future quarters due to the "sheer size of the business" and progressively more difficult "comps" as economic conditions continue to gradually improve.  In particular, the company noted that its 3
rd
 quarter 2011 guidance reflected deceleration in the unit growth rate for hotel room night reservations based upon actual results to date and assumed deceleration as the company proceeded through the rest of the 3
rd
 quarter.
 
The company noted that its guidance assumes that macro-economic conditions in general and conditions in the consumer travel market in particular, remain relatively unchanged.

Exhibit 99.1
NORWALK, Conn., August 4, 2011. . . Priceline.com Incorporated (Nasdaq: PCLN) today reported 2
nd
 quarter 2011 financial results for the Priceline Group. Second quarter gross travel bookings for the Group, which refers to the total dollar value, generally inclusive of all taxes and fees, of all travel services purchased by consumers, were $5.8 billion, an increase of 70% over a year ago.
 
The Group had revenues in the 2
nd
 quarter of $1.1 billion, a 44% increase over a year ago. The Group's international operations contributed revenues in the 2
nd
 quarter of $612.9 million, a 90% increase versus a year ago (approximately 71% on a local currency basis). The Group's gross profit for the 2
nd
 quarter was $749.2 million, a 68% increase from the prior year. International operations contributed gross profit in the 2
nd
 quarter of $612.1 million, a 90% increase versus a year ago (approximately 71% growth on a local currency basis). The Group's operating income in the 2
nd
 quarter was $324.7 million, an 88% increase from the prior year. The Group had GAAP net income applicable to common shareholders for the 2
nd
 quarter of $256.4 million, or $5.02 per diluted share, which compares to $115.0 million or $2.26 per diluted share, in the same period a year ago.
 
Non-GAAP net income in the 2
nd
 quarter was $282.6 million, a 79% increase versus the prior year.  Non-GAAP net income was $5.49 per diluted share, compared to $3.09 per diluted share a year ago. As of August 4, 2011, First Call analyst consensus of non-GAAP net income per diluted share for the 2
nd
 quarter 2011 was $4.91.  Adjusted EBITDA for the 2
nd
 quarter 2011 was $349.1 million, an increase of 71% over a year ago. The section below entitled "" provides a definition and information about the use of non-GAAP financial measures in this press release and the attached financial and statistical supplement reconciles non-GAAP financial information with the Group's financial results under GAAP.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
"The Group benefitted from strong 2
nd
 quarter performances by our global hotel and rental car businesses," said Jeffery H. Boyd, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Priceline Group.  "Global hotel room nights increased 56% compared to last year, while global rental car days were up 55% for the 2
nd
 quarter.  In general, our hotel booking business is benefitting from improving ADRs, continuing strength in our core markets, and high rates of growth in new markets, particularly Asia-Pacific, where both Booking.com and Agoda are performing well."
 
Mr. Boyd continued, "Priceline.com's airline ticketing business experienced its strongest quarterly growth in the last six quarters, with ticket sales up 7%, and opaque ticket sales well in excess of that.  Our airline partners participated more aggressively in our opaque service in the
 
quarter's high fare environment and priceline.com also benefitted competitively from having a larger complement of available airlines compared to other airline ticketing services."
 
Looking forward, Mr. Boyd said, "Economic pressures around the world are giving leisure and business travelers ample reasons to look for maximum value in their travel spending.  As we enter the height of the summer travel season, we believe that the brands represented in the Priceline Group offer superior value to our customers and we continue to work toward extending our services to new markets and consumers around the world."
 
The Priceline Group provided the following guidance for the 3
rd
 quarter 2011:
 
    
Year-over-year increase in total gross travel bookings of approximately 47% - 52%.
    
Year-over-year increase in international gross travel bookings of approximately 62% -67% (an increase of approximately 49% - 54% on a local currency basis).
    
Year-over-year increase in domestic gross travel bookings of approximately 8% to 13%.
    
Year-over-year increase in revenue of approximately 37% to 42%.
    
Year-over-year increase in gross profit of approximately 54% to 59%.
    
Adjusted EBITDA of approximately $595 million to $615 million.
    
Non-GAAP net income of between $9.10 and $9.30 per diluted share.
 
Non-GAAP guidance for the 3
rd
 quarter 2011:
 
    
excludes non-cash amortization expense of acquisition-related intangibles,
    
excludes non-cash stock-based compensation expense,
    
excludes non-cash interest expense and gains or losses on early debt extinguishment, if any, related to cash settled convertible debt,
    
excludes the impact, if any, of charges or benefits associated with judgments, rulings and/or settlements related to hotel occupancy tax proceedings,
    
excludes non-cash income tax expense and reflects the impact on income taxes of certain of the non-GAAP adjustments,
    
includes the additional impact of the non-GAAP adjustments described above on net income attributable to noncontrolling interests,
    
includes the anti-dilutive impact of the "Conversion Spread Hedges" (see "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" below) on diluted common shares outstanding related to outstanding convertible notes, and
    
includes the dilutive impact of additional shares of unvested restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance share units because non-GAAP net income has been adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation.
 
In addition to the adjustments above, adjusted EBITDA excludes depreciation and amortization expense, interest income, interest expense, net income and loss attributable to noncontrolling interests, income taxes and includes the impact of foreign currency transactions and other expenses.
 
When aggregated, the non-GAAP adjustments are expected to increase adjusted EBITDA over GAAP net income by approximately $173 million in the 3
rd
 quarter 2011.  In addition, the non-
 
GAAP adjustments are expected to increase non-GAAP net income over GAAP net income by approximately $41 million in the 3
rd
 quarter 2011. On a per share basis, the Group estimates GAAP net income of approximately $8.37 to $8.57 per diluted share for the 3
rd
 quarter 2011.
 
Information About Forward-Looking Statements
 
This press release contains forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements reflect the views of the Group's management regarding current expectations and projections about future events and are based on currently available information and current foreign currency exchange rates. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict; therefore, actual results may differ materially from those expressed, implied or forecasted in any such forward-looking statements. Expressions of future goals and similar expressions including, without limitation, "may," "will," "should," "could," "expects," "does not currently expect," "plans," "anticipates," "intends," "believes," "estimates," "predicts," "potential," "targets," or "continue," reflecting something other than historical fact are intended to identify forward-looking statements.
 
The following factors, among others, could cause the Group's actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements:
 
our ability to expand successfully in international markets;
 
adverse changes in general market conditions for leisure and other travel services as a result of, among other things, decreased consumer spending, general economic downturn, terrorist attacks, natural disasters or adverse weather, the bankruptcy or insolvency of a major supplier, or the outbreak of an epidemic or pandemic disease, such as the swine flu outbreak;
 
fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and other risks associated with doing business in multiple currencies;
 
the effects of increased competition, including the potential impact of increased pricing competition initiated by other on-line travel agents in the form of reduced booking fees and/or the launch by competitors of an "opaque" travel offering and the potential impact of "metasearch" initiatives by Google and other search engines upon which we rely for a significant amount of traffic;
 
adverse changes in the Group's relationships with suppliers, service providers and vendors which could include, without limitation, the withdrawal of suppliers from the Group's systems (either "retail" or "opaque" services, or both) and/or the loss or reduction of global distribution fees;
 
an adverse outcome in one or more of the hotel occupancy and other tax proceedings in which priceline.com is involved;
 
the occurrence of an external or internal security breach of our systems or other Internet based systems involving personal customer information, credit card information or other sensitive data;
 
systems-related failures and/or security breaches, including without limitation, "denial-of-service" type attacks on our system, any security breach that results in the theft, transfer or unauthorized disclosure of customer information, or the failure to comply with various state laws applicable to the company's obligations in the event of such a breach;
 
a change by a major search engine to its search engine algorithms that negatively affects the search engine ranking of the company or its 3rd party distribution partners;
 
the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel;
 
difficulties integrating recent or future acquisitions, such as the 2nd quarter 2010 acquisition of TravelJigsaw, including ensuring the effectiveness of the design and operation of internal controls and disclosure controls of acquired businesses; and
 
legal and regulatory risks.
 
For a detailed discussion of these and other factors that could cause the Group's actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements, please refer to the Group's most recent Form 10-Q, Form 10-K and Form 8-K filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Unless required by law, the Group undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
 
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
Adjusted EBITDA represents GAAP net income excluding depreciation and amortization expense, interest income, interest expense, net income and loss attributable to noncontrolling interests, income taxes and is adjusted for the non-GAAP adjustments relating to stock-based compensation expense, gains and losses on early debt extinguishment and charges or benefits related to judgments, rulings, or settlements of hotel occupancy tax proceedings.
 
Adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share are "non-GAAP financial measures," as such term is defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and may differ from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. These measures are among the primary metrics by which management evaluates the performance of the business, on which internal budgets are based and, with respect to adjusted EBITDA, by which management is compensated.  The Group believes that adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share that exclude certain non-cash or non-recurring income or expense items are useful for analysts and investors to evaluate the Group's future on-going performance because they enable a more meaningful comparison of the Group's projected cash earnings and performance with its historical results from prior periods and to those of its competitors. These non-GAAP metrics, in particular adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP operating income, and non-GAAP net income are not intended to represent funds available for the Group's discretionary use and are not intended to
 
represent or to be used as a substitute for operating income, net income or cash flows from operations data as measured under GAAP. The items excluded from these non-GAAP metrics, but included in the calculation of their closest GAAP equivalent, are significant components of consolidated statements of income and must be considered in performing a comprehensive assessment of overall financial performance.
 
Non-GAAP financial information is adjusted for the following items:
 
    
Amortization expense of acquisition-related intangibles is excluded because it does not impact cash earnings.
    
Stock-based compensation expense is excluded because it does not impact cash earnings and is reflected in earnings per share through increased share count.
    
Interest expense related to the amortization of debt discount and gains or losses on early debt extinguishment related to convertible debt are excluded because they are non-cash in nature.
    
Charges or benefits related to judgments, rulings, or settlements of hotel occupancy tax proceedings are excluded because the amount and timing of these items are unpredictable, not driven by core operating results and render comparisons with prior periods less meaningful.
    
Income tax expense is adjusted for the tax impact of certain of the non-GAAP adjustments described above and to exclude tax expense recorded where no actual tax payments are owed because of available net operating loss carry forwards.  In addition, the benefit in second quarter 2011 related to the reversal of a reserve for unrecognized tax benefits attributable to tax positions taken in 2010 is excluded because the amount and timing of this type of item is unpredictable, not driven by core operating results and render comparisons with prior periods less meaningful.
    
Net income and loss attributable to noncontrolling interest is adjusted for the impact of certain of the non-GAAP adjustments described above
    
For calculating non-GAAP net income per share:
    
net income is adjusted for the impact of the non-GAAP adjustments described above.
    
fully diluted share count is adjusted to include the anti-dilutive impact of "Conversion Spread Hedges" which increases the effective conversion price of the currently outstanding 0.50% convertible notes due 2011 and 0.75% convertible notes due 2013 from their stated $40.38 conversion price to an effective conversion price of $50.47 per share.  Under GAAP, the anti-dilutive impact of the Conversion Spread Hedges is not reflected on the outstanding diluted share count until shares are delivered, if ever.
    
additional unvested shares of restricted common stock, restricted stock units and performance share units are included in the calculation of non-GAAP net income per share because non-GAAP net income has been adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation expense.
 
The presentation of this financial information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The attached financial and statistical supplement reconciles non-GAAP financial information with priceline.com's financial results under GAAP.
