Administrative Agent
Lenders
 
Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Lenders will extend a revolving line of credit up to $1 billion. The revolving credit facility provides for the issuance of up to $100.0 million of letters of credit as well as borrowings on same-day notice, referred to as swingline loans, which are available in U.S. dollars, Euros, Pounds Sterling and any other foreign currency agreed to by the Administrative Agent and each of the Lenders. The Company may request that an additional $250.0 million be added to the revolving line of credit or to enter into one or more tranches of term loans.  The proceeds of loans made under the Credit Agreement will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes. As of November 1, 2011 the Company has no immediate plans to draw upon the revolving line of credit, but may do so in the future.
 
Borrowings under the Credit Agreement are unsecured and will bear interest, at the Company's option at a rate per annum equal to either:
 
                 
the greatest of (a) JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association's prime lending rate, (b) the federal funds rate plus  of 1%, and (c) an adjusted LIBOR for an interest period of one month plus 1.00%, plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.00% to 0.50%; or
 
                 
the adjusted LIBOR for the interest period in effect for such borrowing plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.00% to 1.50%.
 
The Credit Agreement includes, among other terms and conditions, limitations on the ability of the Company's subsidiaries to create, incur, assume or allow indebtedness (other than certain types of permitted indebtedness) and on  the Company and/or its subsidiaries to sell, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of any of its assets outside the ordinary course or any of the equity interests of its subsidiaries (subject to certain exceptions); acquire, merge, consolidate with or into another person or entity, liquidate or dissolve (other than certain types of permitted acquisitions and corporate reorganization); or create, incur, assume or allow any lien on any of its property or assets or assign any right to receive income (except for certain permitted liens).
 
The Credit Agreement also contains certain financial covenants requiring  that the Company maintain certain financial ratios.
 
The Credit Agreement terminates and any and all borrowings are due on October 28, 2016, but may be terminated earlier by the Company without penalty upon written notice and prompt repayment of all amounts borrowed.  Loans outstanding under the Credit Agreement may become immediately due and payable upon certain events of default set forth in the Credit Agreement and typical of a transaction of this nature.
 
Under the Credit Agreement, the Company is required to pay a commitment fee in respect of unutilized commitments, which shall accrue at a rate set forth in the Credit Agreement. The Company must also pay customary letter of credit fees and agency fees.
 
The Company may voluntarily reduce the unutilized portion of the commitment amount and repay outstanding loans at any time without premium or penalty other than customary "breakage" costs with respect to loans bearing interest at a rate determined by reference to the adjusted LIBO rate.  There is no scheduled amortization under the revolving credit facility.
 
This description of the Credit Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the provisions of the Credit Agreement, which the Company intends to file as an exhibit with its quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ending September 30, 2011.

Article II
.  Article II, "Meetings of Stockholders," was amended and restated.  The Company previously had advance notice Bylaw provisions governing the procedures which a stockholder must follow in connection with bringing a matter before an annual or special meeting of stockholders, other than a proposal made under Rule 14a-8 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.  Article II of the Bylaws was amended to, among other things:
 
                 
require stockholders who wish to bring certain matters before an annual or special meeting of stockholders to disclose additional information about their ownership of the Company's securities, including any short interest or synthetic equity interests;
 
                 
require additional disclosure about relationships between a stockholder and any nominee to the board of directors nominated by the stockholder;
 
                 
change the advance notice period for stockholder submissions of director nominations or proposals from between 60 and 90 days to between 90 and 120 days before the one-year anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting of stockholders;
 
                 
require a nominee for director submitted by a stockholder to submit a questionnaire, representation and agreement with the Company.
 
Article VIII
.  New Article VIII, "Forum For Adjudication of Disputes," was added to the Bylaws that provides that, unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Company, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employee of the Company to the Company or the Company's stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law or the Company's Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws, or (iv) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine.  The amendment further provides that any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of capital stock of the Company is deemed to have notice of and consented to the foregoing provision.
 
Article IX
.  Prior Article VIII, "Amendments," was redesignated as Article IX.
 
A copy of the Certificate of Amendment to the Bylaws of the Company is attached hereto as Exhibit 3.1 and incorporated herein by reference.  The foregoing description of the amendment to the Bylaws is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Bylaws.

Section 7
.               .  Any meeting of the stockholders may be adjourned from time to time to reconvene at the same or some other place, and notice need not be given of any such adjourned meeting if the time and place thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken.  At the adjourned meeting, the Corporation may transact any business which might have been transacted at the original meeting.  If the adjournment is for more than thirty days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting.

broken by the withdrawal of enough votes to leave less than a quorum.  If, however, such quorum shall not be present or represented at any meeting of the stockholders, the stockholders entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall have power to adjourn the meeting from time to time, in the manner provided in Section 7, until a quorum shall be present or represented.
 
Section 9
.               .

Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, and subject to Section 5 of Article V hereof, each stockholder represented at a meeting of stockholders shall be entitled to cast one vote for each share of the capital stock entitled to vote thereat held by such stockholder.  Such votes may be cast in person or by proxy but no proxy shall be voted on or after three years from its date, unless such proxy provides for a longer period.  The Board of Directors, in its discretion, or the officer of the Corporation presiding at a meeting of stockholders, in such officer's discretion, may require that any votes cast at such meeting shall be cast by written ballot.

Except to the extent inconsistent with such rules and regulations as adopted by the Board of Directors, the chairman of any meeting of the stockholders shall have the right and authority to prescribe such rules, regulations and procedures and to do all such acts as, in the judgment of such chairman, are appropriate for the proper conduct of the meeting.

These By-Laws may be altered, amended or repealed, in whole or in part, or new By-Laws may be adopted by the stockholders or by the Board of Directors, provided, however, that notice of such alteration, amendment, repeal or adoption of new By-Laws be contained in the notice of such meeting of stockholders or Board of Directors, as the case may be. All such amendments must be approved by either the holders of a majority of the outstanding capital stock entitled to vote thereon or by a majority of the entire Board of Directors then in office.
