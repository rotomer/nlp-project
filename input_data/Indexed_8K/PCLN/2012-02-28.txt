, priceline.com announced its financial results for the 4
th
 quarter and full-year ended
December 31, 2011
.  A copy of priceline.coms press release announcing these financial results is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
 
The company noted that its Booking.com brand now had approximately 195,000 hotels and other accommodations. The company emphasized that many of the newly added properties, especially in highly penetrated markets, are smaller, have fewer rooms and potentially lower average daily rates (ADRs) and may appeal to a smaller subset of customers (for example, hostels and B&Bs) and therefore may generate less commission revenue over time.
The company referenced a study published by Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union (EU), that reported 1.6 billion room nights stayed in 2011 in the 27 EU countries. The company noted that the Priceline Group-wide room nights booked in the EU 27 in 2011 represented a mid-single digit percentage of that total, though the company's share may be higher or lower in given destinations.
The company noted that ADRs for hotel room night reservations had increased year-over-year during the 4th quarter 2011 on a local currency basis by approximately 2% internationally and by approximately 6% domestically. The company also noted that online advertising expense as a percentage of gross profit in the 4
th
quarter 2011 was approximately 220 basis points higher than the same period in the prior year primarily as a result of business mix. The company explained that its international business, which relies more on online advertising spend, grew at a faster pace than the company's U.S. business driving the mix impact; the company also noted that its U.S. priceline.com business continues to see an increasing share of its business coming through paid channels. The company indicated that its 4
th
 quarter gross bookings growth was generally strong across all regions with newer markets for Booking.com, namely North America, Asia-Pacific and South America, growing well in excess of the company's consolidated growth rate. The company noted that the Priceline Group's business in Asia is profitable.
The company said that capital expenditures in the 4
th
 quarter and full year-ended December 31, 2011 were approximately $17 million and $47 million, respectively, which represents a meaningful increase from prior year periods.  The company noted that the increase in capital expenditures was principally for additional IT capacity and office build outs to support growth and geographic expansion and that it expected future capital expenditures to also be higher than historical prior year levels as the company continued to support business growth. 
 
The company noted that its forecast for the remainder of the 1
st
quarter 2012 assumed, among other things, that the Euro/U.S. Dollar exchange rate would be 1.34 U.S. dollars per Euro and that the British Pound/U.S. Dollar exchange rate would be 1.59 U.S. Dollars per British Pound; the company noted that those assumed exchange rates were lower by approximately 3% for the Euro and 2% for the British Pound than average exchange rates for the same period in the prior year.   The company emphasized that volatility in the Euro to U.S. Dollar exchange rate could materially impact the company's earnings expressed in U.S. dollars. 
The company explained that its 1
st
quarter 2012 guidance assumed that the rate of year-over-year increase in hotel ADRs for the 1
st
quarter would be flat to up slightly versus the 4
th
quarter 2011 for its international hotel service and up by about 5% to 6% for the company's U.S. hotel service.  The company noted that it expected non-GAAP operating income to grow at a slower pace than gross profit mainly due to deleverage in online advertising expense as the company expected to continue to see a trend of the company's business shifting to international and paid online advertising channels. In addition, the company expects margins to be impacted by continued investment in people, offices, IT expenses and increased depreciation expense related to capital expenditures to support business growth.
 
The company noted that its non-GAAP financial guidance was based upon a non-GAAP diluted share count of approximately 51.7 million shares (which includes a calculation of the assumed economic dilutive impact of the company's outstanding convertible notes and share-based awards), which is based on the company's February 24, 2012 closing stock price
2
of $590.41 per share.
 
The company emphasized that it expected its year-over-year growth rates to sequentially decelerate in future quarters due to the large scale of the business. The company noted that its guidance assumes that macro-economic conditions in general and conditions in the consumer travel market in particular, remain relatively unchanged.  However, the company highlighted that it had seen short-term volatility in its unit growth rates and higher cancellation rates for its international business, which makes it difficult to forecast trends.  The company also noted that it believed that austerity programs and recessionary conditions have had a negative effect on growth rates and ADR trends in southern Europe.
The company explained there were a number of factors that could put pressure on operating margins going forward, including: (a) continued growth in the mix of paid online business; (b) decreases in marketing return on ROIs tied to click costs, pressure on unit economics or conversion; (c) high growth in markets like Asia which are at an earlier stage of development and have lower operating margins compared to more mature markets; and (d) continued investment in geographic expansion and hotel additions, which may provide diminishing returns over time.

th

th
quarter was $304 million, a 60.8% increase from the prior year. The Group had GAAP net income applicable to common shareholders for the 4
th
quarter of $226.0 million, or $4.41 per diluted share, which compares to $135.7 million or $2.66 per diluted share, in the same period a year ago.
Non-GAAP net income in the 4
th
quarter was $276.8 million, a 58.1% increase versus the prior year.  Non-GAAP net income was $5.37 per diluted share, compared to $3.40 per diluted share a year ago. First Call analyst consensus for the 4
th
quarter 2011 was $5.05 per diluted share.  Adjusted EBITDA for the 4
th
quarter 2011 was $344 million, an increase of 54.3% over a year ago. The section below entitled "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" provides a definition and information about the use of non-GAAP financial measures in this press release and the attached financial and statistical supplement reconciles non-GAAP financial information with the Group's financial results under GAAP.
For full-year 2011, the Group had revenues of $4.36 billion, a 41.2% increase over 2010. International operations contributed full-year revenues of $2.56 billion, a 77.5% increase versus a year ago (approximately 70% on a local currency basis).

The Group's 2011 operating income was $1.40 billion, a 77.8% increase from the prior year. The Group had GAAP net income applicable to common shareholders for full-year 2011 of $1.06 billion, or $20.63 per diluted share, which compares to $527.5 million or $10.35 per diluted share in 2010.
Adjusted EBITDA for 2011 was $1.51 billion, an increase of 67.6% over a year ago. Non-GAAP net income for 2011 was $1.21 billion or $23.45 per diluted share, compared to $13.49 per diluted share a year ago.
The Priceline Group experienced a strong 4
th
quarter for our travel reservation services. said Jeffery H. Boyd, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Priceline Group. Globally, the Group grew room night reservations by 53% as compared to 47% in the 3
rd
quarter. We believe that each of our brands, Booking.com, Agoda and
1
of
12
priceline.com, gained share in the retail hotel room reservations market, while our Name Your Own Price hotel business in the United States continued to be impacted by increased competition in the discount market.
Mr. Boyd continued, I'm pleased to highlight that during the 4
th
quarter, we rebranded the TravelJigsaw business as rentalcars.com. Our worldwide rental car reservation service delivered 34% growth in rental car days in the 4
th
quarter compared to the prior year, with rentalcars.com growing well in excess of that rate. Rentalcars.com had an outstanding year and we are excited about the global online rental car opportunity.
Looking forward, Mr. Boyd said, The Priceline Group's global hotel business continues to build share and is experiencing strong growth in Asia and other newer markets. While macroeconomic concerns persist, we will continue investing in growing the number of hotels and other accommodations around the world available on our websites, providing great content, building distribution and providing superior service to our customers.
The Priceline Group noted that, consistent with prior disclosure, it expected future growth rates to decline quarter to quarter due to the sheer size of the business and that weak economic conditions in Europe have resulted in slowing growth in southern European countries and increasing cancellation rates. The Group said it was targeting the following for 1
st
quarter 2012:
Non-GAAP guidance for the 1
st
quarter 2012:
In addition to the adjustments above, adjusted EBITDA excludes depreciation and amortization expense, interest income, interest expense, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, income taxes and includes the impact of foreign currency transactions and other expenses.
When aggregated, the non-GAAP adjustments are expected to increase adjusted EBITDA over GAAP net income by approximately $84 million in the 1
st
quarter 2012.  In addition, the non-GAAP adjustments are expected to increase non-GAAP net income over GAAP net income by approximately $37 million the 1
st
quarter 2012. On a per share basis, the Group estimates GAAP net income of approximately $3.10 to $3.20 per diluted share for the 1
st
quarter 2012.

Information About Forward-Looking Statements
This press release contains forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements reflect the views of the Group's management regarding current expectations and projections about future events and are based on currently available information and current foreign currency exchange rates. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict; therefore, actual results may differ materially from those expressed, implied or forecasted in any such forward-looking statements.

The following factors, among others, could cause the Group's actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements:
-- adverse changes in general market conditions for leisure and other travel services as a result of, among other things, decreased consumer spending, general economic downturn, terrorist attacks, natural disasters or adverse weather, the bankruptcy or insolvency of a major supplier, or the outbreak of an epidemic or pandemic disease, such as the swine flu outbreak;
-- adverse changes in the Group's relationships with suppliers, service providers and vendors which could include, without limitation, the withdrawal of suppliers from the Group's systems (either "retail" or "opaque" services, or both) and/or the loss or reduction of global distribution fees;
-- fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and other risks associated with doing business in multiple currencies;
-- the effects of increased competition, including the potential impact of increased pricing competition initiated by other on-line travel agents in the form of reduced booking fees and/or the launch by competitors of an "opaque" travel offering and the potential impact of "metasearch" initiatives by Google and other search engines upon which we rely for a significant amount of traffic;
-- an adverse outcome in one or more of the hotel occupancy and other tax proceedings in which priceline.com is involved;
-- a change by a major search engine to its search engine algorithms that negatively affects the search engine ranking of the company or its 3rd party distribution partners;
-- our ability to expand successfully in international markets;
-- the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel;
-- difficulties integrating recent or future acquisitions, such as the 2nd quarter 2010 acquisition of TravelJigsaw, including ensuring the effectiveness of the design and operation of internal controls and disclosure controls of acquired businesses;
-- the occurrence of an external or internal security breach of our systems or other Internet based systems involving personal customer information, credit card information or other sensitive data;
-- systems-related failures and/or security breaches, including without limitation, "denial-of-service" type attacks on our system, any security breach that results in the theft, transfer or unauthorized disclosure of customer information, or the failure to comply with various state laws applicable to the company's obligations in the event of such a breach; and
-- legal and regulatory risks.
For a detailed discussion of these and other factors that could cause the Group's actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements, please refer to the Group's most recent Form 10-Q, Form

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Adjusted EBITDA represents GAAP net income excluding depreciation and amortization expense, interest income, interest expense, net income and loss attributable to noncontrolling interests, income taxes and is adjusted for the non-GAAP adjustments relating to stock-based employee compensation expense, gains and losses on early debt extinguishment and charges or benefits related to judgments, rulings, or settlements of hotel occupancy tax proceedings. Additionally, favorable adjustments to franchise tax and sales and use tax recorded in third quarter 2010 GAAP net income have been excluded from adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP net income.
Adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share are "non-GAAP financial measures," as such term is defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and may differ from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. The Group believes that adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share that exclude certain non-cash or non-recurring income or expense items are useful for analysts and investors to evaluate the Group's future on-going performance because they provide a useful comparison of the Group's projected cash earnings and performance with its historical results from prior periods and to those of its competitors. These non-GAAP metrics, in particular adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP operating income, and non-GAAP net income are not intended to represent funds available for the Group's discretionary use and are not intended to represent or to be used as a substitute for operating income, net income or cash flows from operations data as measured under GAAP. The items excluded from these non-GAAP metrics, but included in the calculation of their closest GAAP equivalent, are significant components of consolidated statements of income and must be considered in performing a comprehensive assessment of overall financial performance.
Non-GAAP financial information is adjusted for the following items:
4
of
12
dilutive impact of the Conversion Spread Hedges is not reflected on the outstanding diluted share count until if and when shares are delivered.
The presentation of this financial information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The attached financial and statistical supplement reconciles non-GAAP financial information with priceline.com's financial results under GAAP.
