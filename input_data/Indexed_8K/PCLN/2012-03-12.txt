Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
Purchase Agreement
 
On March 7, 2012, priceline.com Incorporated (the "Company") entered into a purchase agreement (the "Purchase Agreement") with Goldman, Sachs & Co., as representative of the initial purchasers named therein (collectively, the "Initial Purchasers"), under which the Company agreed to sell $875 million principal amount of 1.0% Convertible Senior Notes due 2018 (plus an additional $125 million aggregate principal amount solely to cover over-allotments) (the "Notes") in a private placement in reliance on Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"). Under the Purchase Agreement, the Initial Purchasers may resell the Notes to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the Act. The Purchase Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1, and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
The sale of $1 billion aggregate principal amount of the Notes to the Initial Purchasers was completed on March 12, 2012. The Company's net proceeds from the sale of the Notes are estimated to be approximately $979 million after deducting the discount to the Initial Purchasers and estimated offering expenses.  On March 12, 2012, following the completion of the sale of the Notes, the Company purchased 263,913 shares of its outstanding common stock in a privately negotiated, off-market transaction for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $166 million.
 
The foregoing description of the Purchase Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Purchase Agreement which is included as Exhibit 10.1 to this report.
 
Indenture
 
On March 12, 2012, the Company entered into an indenture (the "Indenture"), between the Company and American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, as trustee (the "Trustee"), in connection with the Notes.  The Notes mature on March 15, 2018, unless earlier converted or repurchased. The Notes are the Company's general unsecured senior obligations and rank equally with the Company's other senior unsecured obligations, including its outstanding 1.25% convertible senior notes due 2015.
 
The Company will pay interest on the Notes at an annual rate of 1.0% payable on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning September 15, 2012.  In certain circumstances set forth in the Indenture, the Notes may be converted into cash up to their principal amount, and into shares of the Company's common stock and/or cash at the Company's election for the conversion value above the principal amount based on an initial conversion rate of 1.0586 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the notes (which is equal to a conversion price of approximately $944.61 per share of common stock, representing a 50% conversion premium based on the closing price of $629.74 per share of common stock on March 6, 2012), subject to adjustment as provided in the Indenture.
The Notes will be convertible prior to the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding December 15, 2017, in multiples of $1,000 principal amount, at the option of the holder only under the following circumstances:
 
                             
during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period (the "measurement period") in which the trading price (as defined in the Indenture) per $1,000 principal amount of Notes for each day of such measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of the Company's common stock and the applicable conversion rate on each such day;
 
                             
during any calendar quarter commencing after June 30, 2012 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of the Company's common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter exceeds 150% of the applicable conversion price on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter;
 
                             
if the Company distributes to all or substantially all holders of its common stock any rights or warrants entitling them to purchase, for a period expiring within 60 days after the record date of the distribution, shares of the Company's common stock at less than the last reported sale price of the Company's common stock on the trading day immediately preceding the date of announcement of the distribution;
 
                             
if the Company distributes to all or substantially all holders of its common stock, assets (including cash), debt securities or certain rights to purchase the Company's securities, which distribution has a per share value as determined by the Company's board of directors exceeding 10% of the closing sale price of the Company's common stock on the day preceding the date of announcement of such distribution; or
 
                             
if the Company is a party to any transaction or event that constitutes (i) a "designated event" under the Indenture or (ii) a combination, merger, binding share exchange or sale or conveyance of all or substantially all of the Company's property and assets, in each case pursuant to which the Company's common stock would be converted into cash, securities and/or other property that does not also constitute a designated event.
 
On or after December 15, 2017 until the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert Notes, in multiples of $1,000 principal amount, at the option of the holder regardless of the foregoing circumstances.
 
The Company may not redeem the Notes prior to maturity.
 
The Indenture contains customary events of default with respect to the Notes, including failure to make required payments, failure to comply with certain agreements or covenants, acceleration of certain other indebtedness, and certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency. Events of default under the Indenture arising from certain events of
bankruptcy or insolvency will automatically cause the acceleration of the amounts due under the Notes. If any other event of default under the Indenture occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may declare the acceleration of the amounts due under the Notes.
 
The foregoing description of the Indenture is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Indenture which is included as Exhibit 10.2 to this report.

(ix)
      
Neither the Company nor any of the Scheduled Subsidiaries is in violation of its Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws or in default in the performance or observance of any obligation, covenant or condition contained in any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement, lease or other agreement or instrument to which it is a party or by which it or any of its properties may be bound except for such defaults which would not individually or in the

(x)        The issue and sale of the Securities and the compliance by the Company with all of the provisions of the Securities, the Indenture and this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions herein and therein contemplated will not (1) conflict with or result in a breach or violation of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under, any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement or other agreement or instrument known to such counsel to which the Company or any of the Scheduled Subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company or any of the Scheduled Subsidiaries is bound or to which any of the property or assets of the Company or any of the Scheduled Subsidiaries is subject, (2) result in any violation of the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws of the Company or (3) result in any violation of the provisions of any statute or any order, rule or regulation of any court or governmental agency or body having jurisdiction over the Company or any of the Scheduled Subsidiaries or any of their properties except in the case of clauses (1) and (3) above which would not individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on the current or future consolidated financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole;
 
(xi)

(f)        On or after the Applicable Time (i) no downgrading shall have occurred in the rating accorded the Company's debt securities or preferred stock by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization", as that term is defined by the Commission for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Act, and (ii) no such organization shall have publicly announced that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, its rating of any of the Company's debt securities or preferred stock;

(h)       The shares of Stock issuable upon conversion of the Securities shall have been duly listed, subject to notice of issuance, on The NASDAQ Global Select Market;

9.         (a)  The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Purchaser against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Purchaser may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Offering Circular, the Pricing Circular, the Offering Circular, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Company Supplemental Disclosure Document, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse each Purchaser for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Purchaser in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; , , that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in any Preliminary Offering Circular, the Pricing Circular, the Offering Circular or any such amendment or supplement, or any Company Supplemental Disclosure Document, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Purchaser through the Representatives expressly for use therein.
provided
however
 
(b)       Each Purchaser will indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Offering Circular, the Pricing Circular, the Offering Circular, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Company Supplemental Disclosure Document, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in any Preliminary Offering Circular, the Pricing Circular, or the Offering Circular or any such amendment or supplement, or any Company Supplemental Disclosure Document in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Purchaser through the Representatives expressly for use therein, it being understood and agreed that the only such information consists of (i) the third sentence in the second paragraph of text, (ii) the ninth, tenth and eleventh paragraphs of text and (iii) the second sentence of the twelfth paragraph of text, in each case under the caption "Plan of Distribution"; and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred.
 
(c)       Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection.  In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party
(who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation.  No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
 
(d)       If the indemnification provided for in this Section 9 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Purchasers on the other from the offering of the Securities.  If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Purchasers on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Purchasers on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Purchasers, in each case as set forth in the Offering Circular.  The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or the Purchasers on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.  The Company and the Purchasers agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Purchasers were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d).  The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Purchaser shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to investors were offered to investors exceeds the amount of any damages which such Purchaser has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.  The
Purchasers' obligations in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.
 
(e)       The obligations of the Company under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to any affiliate of each Purchaser and each person, if any, who controls any Purchaser within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of the Purchasers under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Purchasers may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act.
 
10.       (a)  If any Purchaser shall default in its obligation to purchase the Securities which it has agreed to purchase hereunder, you may in your discretion arrange for you or another party or other parties to purchase such Securities on the terms contained herein.  If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Purchaser you do not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to you to purchase such Securities on such terms.  In the event that, within the respective prescribed periods, you notify the Company that you have so arranged for the purchase of such Securities or the Company notifies you that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, you or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Time of Delivery for a period of not more than  seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Offering Circular, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to prepare promptly any amendments to the Offering Circular which in your opinion may thereby be made necessary.  The term "Purchaser" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to this Agreement with respect to such Securities.
 
(b)       If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Purchaser or Purchasers by you and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities which remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Purchaser to purchase the principal amount of Securities which such Purchaser agreed to purchase hereunder and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Purchaser to purchase its pro rata share (based on the principal amount of Securities which such Purchaser agreed to purchase hereunder) of the Securities of such defaulting Purchaser or Purchasers for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Purchaser from liability for its default.
 
(c)       If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Purchaser or Purchasers by you and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of Securities which remains unpurchased exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Purchasers to purchase Securities of a defaulting Purchaser or Purchasers, then this Agreement shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Purchaser or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Purchasers as provided in Section 6 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 9 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Purchaser from liability for its default.
11.       The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the several Purchasers, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Purchaser or any controlling person of any Purchaser, or the Company, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.
 
12.       If this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 10 hereof, the Company shall not then be under any liability to any Purchaser except as provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof; but, if for any other reason, the Securities are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein, the Company will reimburse the Purchasers for all out-of-pocket expenses approved in writing by you, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Purchasers in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of the Securities, but the Company shall then be under no further liability to any Purchaser except as provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof.
 
13.       In all dealings hereunder, the Representatives shall act on behalf of each of the Purchasers, and the parties hereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any Purchaser made or given by the Representatives.
 
All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing, and if to the Purchasers shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to you at as the representative in care of Goldman, Sachs & Co., 200 West Street, New York, New York 10282, Attention: Registration Department; and if to the Company shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the address of the Company set forth in the Offering Circular, Attention: Secretary; , , that any notice to a Purchaser pursuant to Section 9(c) hereof shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to such Purchaser at its address set forth in its Purchasers' Questionnaire, or telex constituting such Questionnaire, which address will be supplied to the Company by you upon request.  Any such statements, requests, notices or agreements shall take effect upon receipt thereof.
provided
however
 
14.       This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure solely to the benefit of, the Purchasers, the Company and, to the extent provided in Sections 9 and 11 hereof, the officers and directors of the Company and each person who controls the Company or any Purchaser, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Agreement. No purchaser of any of the Securities from any Purchaser shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase.
 
15.       Time shall be of the essence of this Agreement.
 
16.       The Company acknowledges and agrees that (i) the purchase and sale of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement is an arm's-length commercial transaction between the Company, on the one hand, and the several Purchasers, on the other, (ii) in connection therewith and with the process leading to such transaction each Purchaser is acting solely as a principal and not the agent or fiduciary of the Company, (iii) no Purchaser has assumed an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in favor of the Company with respect to the offering contemplated hereby or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether such Purchaser has advised or is currently advising the Company on other matters) or any other obligation to the Company except the obligations expressly set forth in this Agreement and (iv) the Company has consulted its own legal and financial advisors to the extent it deemed appropriate.  The Company agrees that it will not claim that the Purchasers, or any of them, has rendered advisory services of any nature or respect, or owes a fiduciary or similar duty to the Company, in connection with such transaction or the process leading thereto.
17.       This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings (whether written or oral) between the Company and the Purchasers, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof.
 
18.      This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.
 
19.       The Company and each of the Purchasers hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any and all right to trial by jury in any legal proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.
 
20.       This Agreement may be executed by any one or more of the parties hereto in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all such respective counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument.
 
21.          
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company (and the Company's employees, representatives, and other agents) are authorized to disclose to any and all persons, the tax treatment and tax structure of the potential transaction and all materials of any kind (including tax opinions and other tax analyses) provided to the Company relating to that treatment and structure, without the Purchasers' imposing any limitation of any kind. However, any information relating to the tax treatment and tax structure shall remain confidential (and the foregoing sentence shall not apply) to the extent necessary to enable any person to comply with securities laws. For this purpose, "tax treatment" means US federal and state income tax treatment, and "tax structure" is limited to any facts that may be relevant to that treatment.
 
If the foregoing is in accordance with your understanding, please sign and return to us five counterparts hereof, and upon the acceptance hereof by you, on behalf of each of the Purchasers, this letter and such acceptance hereof shall constitute a binding agreement between each of the Purchasers and the Company.  It is understood that your acceptance of this letter on behalf of each of the Purchasers is pursuant to the authority set forth in a form of Agreement among Purchasers, the form of which shall be submitted to the Company for examination upon request, but without warranty on your part as to the authority of the signers thereof.

PRICING TERM SHEET
Dated March 7, 2012
 
The information in this pricing term sheet supplements priceline.com Incorporated's preliminary offering circular, dated March 6, 2012 (the "Preliminary Offering Circular"), and supersedes the information in the Preliminary Offering Circular to the extent inconsistent with the information in the Preliminary Offering Circular.  In all other respects, this term sheet is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Preliminary Offering Circular.  Terms used herein but not defined herein shall have the respective meanings as set forth in the Preliminary Offering Circular.  All references to dollar amounts are references to U.S. dollars.
 
 
The exact stock prices and effective dates may not be set forth in the table above, in which case:
 
           
If the stock price is between two stock price amounts in the table or the effective date is between two effective dates in the table, the number of additional shares will be determined by a straight-line
                 
interpolation between the number of additional shares set forth for the higher and lower stock price amounts and the two dates, as applicable, based on a 365-day year.
 
           
If the stock price is greater than $2,500.00 per share, subject to adjustment, no additional shares will be issued upon conversion.
 
           
If the stock price is less than $629.74 per share, subject to adjustment, no additional shares will be issued upon conversion.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will the total number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion exceed 1.5879 per $1,000 in principal amount of Notes, subject to adjustments in the same manner as the conversion rate as set forth under "Description of Notes  Conversion Rights  Conversion Rate Adjustments" in the Preliminary Offering Circular.
The table below sets forth the following unaudited information:
 
                 
our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments and capitalization as of December 31, 2011, and
 
                 
our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments and capitalization as adjusted to give effect to the sale of the Notes (assuming that the initial purchasers' over-allotment option is not exercised), after deducting our estimated offering expenses.  Such adjustment also gives effect to the use of proceeds of the Notes offered hereby to purchase approximately $166 million of our common stock as described in "Use of Proceeds".
 
You should read this table in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes incorporated by reference in our Preliminary Offering Circular.
 
(1)  Amount represents total aggregate principal amount outstanding at December 31, 2011, which is classified in current liabilities and the mezzanine section of our balance sheet as of that date. No conversion notices have been received as of March 4, 2012.
 
(2)  Total principal amount offered for the Notes is $875 million. Pursuant to accounting guidance for convertible debt that may be cash settled, the value of the Notes will be separated into debt and equity components at issuance based upon their estimated fair values. In addition, a portion of the debt issuance costs are allocated to equity and will not be amortized through the income statement.
 
(3)  Treasury stock, as adjusted, reflects the impact of the purchase of approximately $166 million of our common stock using a portion of the proceeds from the offering. Treasury shares have not been adjusted.
Some of the initial purchasers or their affiliates are lenders or agents under our $1 billion five-year unsecured revolving credit facility. Goldman Sachs Bank USA, an affiliate of Goldman, Sachs & Co., is a lender, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., an affiliate of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, is the administrative agent and a lender, each of Bank of America, N.A., an affiliate of Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, an affiliate of Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, are co-syndication agents and lenders, Morgan Stanley Bank, N.A., an affiliate of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, is a senior managing agent and lender and affiilates of certain of the initial purchasers acted as joint bookrunners and joint lead arrangers.
 
This communication is intended for the sole use of the person to whom it is provided by the sender.
 
You should rely on the information contained or incorporated by reference in the Preliminary Offering Circular, as supplemented by this final pricing term sheet in making an investment decision with respect to the Notes.
 
This communication shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy securities nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state in which such solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification of these securities under the laws of any such state.
 
The Notes and the common stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), or any other state securities laws.  Unless they are registered, the Notes and the common stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes may be offered only in transactions exempt from or not subject to registration under the Securities Act or any other state securities laws.  Accordingly, the Notes are only being offered to "qualified institutional buyers" (as defined in Rule 144A under the Securities Act).

ANNEX I
 
March 7, 2012
 
Goldman, Sachs & Co.
200 West Street
New York, NY 10282
 
As representative of the initial purchasers
 
Dear Sirs:
 
We have audited the consolidated balance sheets of priceline.com Incorporated and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the consolidated statements of operations, stockholders, equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011, and the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011. The Company's financial statements and our report thereon and our report on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting are incorporated by reference in the Preliminary Offering Circular for the $875,000,000 1.0% Convertible Senior Notes due 2018 (the "Notes") to be issued by the Company. This Preliminary Offering Circular, dated March 6, 2012, is herein referred to as the Preliminary Offering Circular.
 
This letter is being furnished in reliance upon your representation to us that:
 
a.
              
You are knowledgeable with respect to the due diligence review process that would be performed if this placement of securities were being registered pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act").
 
b.
             
In connection with the Preliminary Offering Circular, the review process you have performed is substantially consistent with the due diligence review process that you would have performed if this placement of securities were being registered pursuant to the Act.
 
In connection with the Preliminary Offering Circular:
 
1.
                                      
We are an independent registered public accounting firm with respect to the Company within the meaning of the Act and the applicable rules and regulations thereunder adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB).
 
2.
                                      
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements audited by us and incorporated by reference in the Preliminary Offering Circular comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Act and the related rules and regulations adopted by the SEC.
 
3.
                                      
We have not audited any financial statements of the Company as of any date or for any period subsequent to December 31, 2011; although we have conducted an audit for the year ended December 31, 2011, the purpose (and therefore the scope) of the audit was to enable us to express our opinion on the financial statements as of December 31, 2011, and for the year then ended, but not on the financial statements for any interim period within that year. Therefore, we are unable to express and do not express any opinion on the financial position, results of operations, or cash flows as of any date or for any period subsequent to December 31, 2011, for the Company.
 
4.
                                      
For purposes of this letter, we have read the 2012 minutes of meetings of the board of directors and of the Company as set forth in the minute books at March 5, 2012, management of the Company having advised us that the minutes of all such meetings through that date were set forth therein; we have carried out other procedures to March 5, 2012, as follows (our work did not extend to the period from March 6, 2012 through March 7, 2012 inclusive).
 
a.
              
With respect to the period from January 1, 2012 to January 31, 2012, we have:
 
(i)
   
Read the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company for January of both 2012 and 2011 furnished to us by the Company, management of the Company have advised us that no such financial statements as of any date or period subsequent to January 31, 2012, were available. The financial information for January of both 2012 and 2011 is incomplete in that it omits the condensed consolidated statement of cash flows and other disclosures.
 
(ii)
  
Inquired of management of the Company who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters whether the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements referred to in 4 a(i) are stated on a basis substantially consistent with that of the audited consolidated financial statements incorporated by reference in the Preliminary Offering Circular.
 
The foregoing procedures do not constitute an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Also, they would not necessarily reveal matters of significance with respect to the comments in the following paragraph. Accordingly, we make no representations regarding the sufficiency of the foregoing procedures for your purposes.
 
5.
                                      
Nothing came to our attention as a result of the foregoing procedures, however, that caused us to believe that:
 
(i)
            
At January 31, 2012, there was any change in the capital stock, increase in total debt, or decrease in consolidated current assets or stockholders' equity of the Company as compared with amounts shown in the December 31, 2011, audited consolidated balance sheet, incorporated by reference in the Preliminary Offering Circular, except for:
Decrease in current assets:
 
 i.
              
December 31, 2011 - $3.067 million
 
ii.
              
January 31, 2012 - $3.042 million.
 
(ii)
  
For the period from January 1, 2012 to January 31, 2012, there were any decreases, as compared to the corresponding period in the preceding year, in consolidated revenues or pretax income before extraordinary items or net income, except in all instances for changes, increases, or decreases that the Preliminary Offering Circular discloses have occurred or may occur.
 
6.
                                      
As mentioned in 4a, management of the Company have advised us that no consolidated financial statements as of any date or for any period subsequent to January 31, 2012, are available; accordingly, the procedures carried out by us with respect to changes in financial statement items after January 31, 2012, have, of necessity, been even more limited than those with respect to the periods referred to in 4. We have inquired of management of the Company who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters whether (a) at March 5, 2012 there was any change in the capital stock, increase in total debt, or any decreases in consolidated current assets or stockholders' equity of the Company as compared with amounts shown on the December 31, 2011, audited consolidated balance sheet incorporated by reference in the Preliminary Offering Circular; or (b) for the period from January 1, 2012 to March 5, 2012, there were any decreases, as compared with the corresponding period in the preceding year, in consolidated revenues or pretax income before extraordinary items or net income. Management of the Company has advised us that complete information is not available as to the capital stock, total debt, or consolidated current assets or stockholders' equity as of March 5, 2012. Furthermore, management of the Company has advised us that no information is available as to the consolidated revenues or pretax income before extraordinary items or net income of the Company for the period from January 1, 2012 to March 5, 2012. On the basis of these inquiries and our reading of the minutes as described in 4, nothing came to our attention that caused us to believe that there was any such change, increase, or decrease, except in all instances for changes, increases, or decreases that the Preliminary Offering Circular discloses have occurred or may occur.
 
7.
                                      
For purposes of this letter, we have also read the items identified by you on the attached copy of the Preliminary Offering Circular or certain pages incorporated by reference therein, and have performed the following procedures, which were applied as indicated with respect to the symbols explained below:
 
a.
              
Compared the amount with the Company's audited consolidated financial statements for the period indicated and found them to be in agreement (except for rounding).
 
b.
             
Compared the amount with a schedule or report prepared by the Company and found them to be in agreement. Amounts appearing in such schedule or report were compared with the accounting records of the Company and found to be in agreement (except for rounding).
c.
              
Proved the amount by reference to the Company's audited consolidated financial statements incorporated by reference for the period indicated and (after giving effect to rounding) found them to be in agreement.
 
d.
             
Proved the arithmetic accuracy (after giving effect to rounding) of the amount or percentage based on amounts from a schedule or report prepared by the Company. Amounts appearing in such schedule or report were compared with the accounting records of the Company and found to be in agreement.
 
e.
              
Compared the amount with a schedule or report prepared by the Company and found them to be in agreement.
 
f.
                
Proved the arithmetic accuracy (after giving effect to rounding) of the amount or percentage based on amounts from a schedule or report prepared the Company.
 
8.
                                      
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements for the periods referred to in the introductory paragraph of this letter comprised audit tests and procedures deemed necessary for the purpose of expressing an opinion on such financial statements taken as a whole. For none of the periods referred to therein, or any other period, did we perform audit tests for the purpose of expressing an opinion on individual balances of accounts or summaries of selected transactions such as those enumerated above and, accordingly, we express no opinion thereon.
 
9.
                                      
It should be understood that we make no representations regarding questions of legal interpretation or regarding the sufficiency for your purposes of the procedures enumerated in the preceding paragraphs; also, such procedures would not necessarily reveal any material misstatement of the amounts or percentages listed above. Further, we have addressed ourselves solely to the foregoing data as set forth in the Preliminary Offering Circular and make no representations regarding the adequacy of disclosure or regarding whether any material facts have been omitted.
 
10.

Any such certificate or opinion of counsel may be based, insofar as it relates to factual matters, upon a certificate or opinion of, or representations by, an officer or officers of the Company or any other Person stating that the information with respect to such factual matters is in the possession of the Company or such other Person, unless such counsel knows, or in the exercise of reasonable care should know, that the certificate or opinion or representations with respect to such matters are erroneous.
 
Where any Person is required to make, give or execute two or more applications, requests, consents, certificates, statements, opinions or other instruments under this Indenture, they may, but need not, be consolidated and form one instrument.

Acts of Holders of Securities
 
(1)           Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action provided or permitted by this Indenture to be given or taken by Holders of Securities may be embodied in and evidenced by one or more instruments of substantially similar tenor signed by such Holders in person or by an agent or proxy duly appointed in writing; and, except as herein otherwise expressly provided, such action shall become effective when such instrument or instruments are delivered to the Trustee and, where it is hereby expressly required, to the Company. The Trustee shall promptly deliver to the Company copies of all such instruments and records delivered to the Trustee. Such instrument or instruments (and the action embodied therein and evidenced thereby) are
herein sometimes referred to as the "Act" of the Holders of Securities signing such instrument or instruments. Proof of execution of any such instrument or of a writing appointing any such agent or proxy, or of the holding by any Person of a Security, shall be sufficient for any purpose of this Indenture and (subject to Section 6.1) conclusive in favor of the Trustee and the Company if made in the manner provided in this Section.
 
(2)           The fact and date of the execution by any Person of any such instrument or writing may be proved by the affidavit of a witness of such execution or by a certificate of a notary public or other officer authorized by law to take acknowledgments of deeds, certifying that the individual signing such instrument or writing acknowledged to him the execution thereof. Where such execution is by a signer acting in a capacity other than his individual capacity, such certificate or affidavit shall also constitute sufficient proof of his authority.
 
(3)           The principal amount and serial number of any Security held by any Person, and the date of his holding the same, shall be proved by the Security Register.
 
(4)           The fact and date of execution of any such instrument or writing and the authority of the Person executing the same may also be proved in any other manner which the Trustee deems sufficient; and the Trustee may in any instance require further proof with respect to any of the matters referred to in this Section.
 
(5)           The Company may set any day as the record date for the purpose of determining the Holders entitled to give or take any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action, or to vote on any action, authorized or permitted by this Indenture to be given or taken by Holders. Promptly and in any case not later than ten days after setting a record date, the Company shall notify the Trustee and the Holders of such record date. If not set by the Company prior to the first solicitation of a Holder made by any Person in respect of any such action, or, in the case of any such vote, prior to such vote, the record date for any such action or vote shall be the 30th day (or, if later, the date of the most recent list of Holders required to be provided pursuant to Section 9.1) prior to such first solicitation or vote, as the case may be. With regard to any record date, the Holders on such date (or their duly appointed agents or proxies), and only such Persons, shall be entitled to give or take, or vote on, the relevant action, whether or not such Holders remain Holders after such record date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not set a record date for, and the provisions of this paragraph shall not apply with respect to, any notice, declaration or direction referred to in the next paragraph.
 
Upon receipt by the Trustee from any Holder of (i) any notice of default or breach referred to in Section 5.1(5), if such default or breach has occurred and is continuing and the Trustee shall not have given such a notice to the Company, (ii) any declaration of acceleration referred to in Section 5.2, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Trustee shall not have given such a declaration to the Company, or (iii) any direction referred to in Section 5.12, if the Trustee shall not have taken the action specified in such direction, then, with respect to clauses (ii) and (iii), a record date shall automatically and without any action by the Company or the Trustee be set for
determining the Holders entitled to join in such declaration or direction, which record date shall be the close of business on the tenth day (or, if such day is not a Business Day, the first Business Day thereafter) following the day on which the Trustee receives such declaration or direction, and, with respect to clause (i), the Trustee may set any day as a record date for the purpose of determining the Holders entitled to join in such notice of default. Promptly after such receipt by the Trustee of any such declaration or direction referred to in clause (ii) or (iii), and promptly after setting any record date with respect to clause (i), and as soon as practicable thereafter, the Trustee shall notify the Company and the Holders of any such record date so fixed. The Holders on such record date (or their duly appointed agents or proxies), and only such Persons, shall be entitled to join in such notice, declaration or direction, whether or not such Holders remain Holders after such record date; that, unless such notice, declaration or direction shall have become effective by virtue of Holders of the requisite principal amount of Securities on such record date (or their duly appointed agents or proxies) having joined therein on or prior to the 90th day after such record date, such notice, declaration or direction shall automatically and without any action by any Person be canceled and of no further effect. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to prevent a Holder (or a duly appointed agent or proxy thereof) from giving, before or after the expiration of such 90-day period, a notice, declaration or direction contrary to or different from, or, after the expiration of such period, identical to, the notice, declaration or direction to which such record date relates, in which event a new record date in respect thereof shall be set pursuant to this paragraph. In addition, nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to render ineffective any notice, declaration or direction of the type referred to in this paragraph given at any time to the Trustee and the Company by Holders (or their duly appointed agents or proxies) of the requisite principal amount of Securities on the date such notice, declaration or direction is so given.

Notice to Holders of Securities; Waiver
 
Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, where this Indenture provides for notice to Holders of Securities of any event, such notice shall be sufficiently given to Holders if in writing and mailed, first-class postage prepaid or delivered by an overnight delivery service, to each Holder of a Security affected by such event, at the address of such Holder as it appears in the Security Register, not earlier than the earliest date and not later than the latest date prescribed for the giving of such notice.
 
Neither the failure to mail such notice, nor any defect in any notice so mailed, to any particular Holder of a Security shall affect the sufficiency of such notice with respect to other Holders of Securities. In case by reason of the suspension of regular mail service or by reason of any other cause it shall be impracticable to give such notice by mail, then such notification to Holders of Securities as shall be made with the approval of the Trustee, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, shall constitute a sufficient notification to such Holders for every purpose hereunder.
 
Such notice shall be deemed to have been given when such notice is mailed.
 
Where this Indenture provides for notice in any manner, such notice may be waived in writing by the Person entitled to receive such notice, either before or after the event, and such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice. Waivers of notice by Holders of Securities shall be filed with the Trustee, but such filing shall not be a condition precedent to the validity of any action taken in reliance upon such waiver.

Additional Securities may be issued in an unlimited aggregate principal amount, subject to certain conditions specified in the Indenture.

Trustee
 
No sinking fund is provided for the Securities and the Securities are not subject to redemption at the option of the Company.
 
In any case where the due date for the payment of the principal of or interest or Special Interest on any Security or the last day on which a Holder of a Security has a right to convert his Security shall be, at any Place of Payment or Place of Conversion, as the case may be, a day on which banking institutions at such Place of Payment or Place of Conversion are authorized or obligated by law or executive order to close, then payment of principal, interest, or Special Interest, or delivery for conversion of such Security need not be made on or by such date at such place but may be made on or by the next succeeding day at such place which is not a day on which banking institutions are authorized or obligated by law or executive order to close, with the same force and effect as if made on the date for such payment or the date fixed for redemption or repurchase, or by such last day for conversion, and no interest shall accrue on the amount so payable for the period after such date.
 
The Indenture contains provisions permitting the Company and the Trustee in certain circumstances, without the consent of the Holders of the Securities, and in other circumstances, with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the time outstanding, evidenced as in the Indenture provided, to execute supplemental indentures adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of the Indenture or of any supplemental indenture or modifying in any manner the rights of the Holders of the Securities; that no such supplemental indenture shall make any of the changes set forth in Section 8.2 of the Indenture, without the consent of each Holder of an outstanding Security affected
provided, however,
thereby. It is also provided in the Indenture that, prior to any declaration accelerating the maturity of the Securities, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the time outstanding may on behalf of the Holders of all of the Securities waive any past default or Event of Default under the Indenture and its consequences except as provided in the Indenture. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security (unless revoked as provided in the Indenture) shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future holders and owners of this Security and any Securities which may be issued in exchange or substitution hereof, irrespective of whether or not any notation thereof is made upon this Security or such other Securities.
 
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of, and accrued and unpaid interest on, this Security, at the place, at the respective times, at the rate and in the lawful money herein prescribed.
 
Upon the occurrence of a Designated Event, the Holder has the right, at such Holder's option, to require the Company to repurchase all of such Holder's Securities or any portion thereof (in principal amounts of $1,000 or integral multiples thereof) on the Designated Event Repurchase Date at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Securities such Holder elects to require the Company to repurchase, together with accrued and unpaid interest to but excluding the Designated Event Repurchase Date. The Company or, at the written request of the Company, the Trustee shall mail to all Holders of record of the Securities a notice of the occurrence of a Designated Event and of the repurchase right arising as a result thereof on or before the twentieth day after the occurrence of any Designated Event.
 
Subject to the provisions of the Indenture, the Holder hereof has the right, at its option, on and after December 15, 2017, or earlier upon the occurrence of certain conditions specified in the Indenture and prior to the close of business on the Trading Day immediately preceding the Stated Maturity, to convert any Securities or portion thereof which is $1,000 or an integral multiple thereof, into cash and, if applicable, shares of Common Stock, in each case at the Conversion Rate specified in the Indenture, as adjusted from time to time as provided in the Indenture, upon surrender of this Security, together with a Notice of Conversion, a form of which is contained under Section 2.4 of the Indenture, as provided in the Indenture and this Security, to the Company at the office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose in The City of New York, or at the option of such Holder, the Corporate Trust Office, and, unless the shares issuable on conversion are to be issued in the same name as this Security, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by instruments of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company duly executed by, the Holder or by his duly authorized attorney.

Global Securities; Non-global Securities; Book-entry Provisions
(1)
 
(1)           Global Securities
 
(A)          Each Global Security authenticated under this Indenture shall be registered in the name of the Depositary designated by the Company for such Global Security or a nominee thereof and delivered to such Depositary or a nominee thereof or custodian therefor, and each such Global Security shall constitute a single Security for all purposes of this Indenture. The Company hereby appoints DTC as the Depositary.
 
(B)           Except for exchanges of Global Securities for definitive, Non-global Securities at the sole discretion of the Company, no Global Security may be exchanged in whole or in part for Securities registered, and no transfer of a Global Security in whole or in part may be registered, in the name of any Person other than the Depositary for such Global Security or a nominee thereof unless (A) such Depositary (i) has notified the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for such Global Security or (ii) has ceased to be a clearing agency registered as such under the Exchange Act or announces an intention permanently to cease business or does in fact do so or (B) there shall have occurred and be continuing an Event of Default with respect to such Global Security.  In such event, if a successor Depositary for such Global Security is not appointed by the Company within 90 days after the Company receives such notice or becomes aware of such ineligibility, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee, upon receipt of an Officers' Certificate directing the authentication and delivery of Securities, shall authenticate and deliver, Securities, in any authorized denominations in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of such Global Security in exchange for such Global Security.
(C)           If any Global Security is to be exchanged for other Securities or canceled in whole, it shall be surrendered by or on behalf of the Depositary or its nominee to the Trustee, as Security Registrar, for exchange or cancellation, as provided in this Article III. If any Global Security is to be exchanged for other Securities or canceled in part, or if another Security is to be exchanged in whole or in part for a beneficial interest in any Global Security, in each case, as provided in Section 3.5, then either (A) such Global Security shall be so surrendered for exchange or cancellation, as provided in this Article, or (B) the principal amount thereof shall be reduced or increased by an amount equal to the portion thereof to be so exchanged or canceled, or equal to the principal amount of such other Security to be so exchanged for a beneficial interest therein, as the case may be, by means of an appropriate adjustment made on the records of the Trustee, as Security Registrar, whereupon the Trustee, in accordance with the Applicable Procedures, shall instruct the Depositary or its authorized representative to make a corresponding adjustment to its records. Upon any such surrender or adjustment of a Global Security, the Trustee shall, subject to Section 3.5(3) and as otherwise provided in this Article III, authenticate and deliver any Securities issuable in exchange for such Global Security (or any portion thereof) to or upon the order of, and registered in such names as may be directed by, the Depositary or its authorized representative. Upon the request of the Trustee in connection with the occurrence of any of the events specified in the preceding paragraph, the Company shall promptly make available to the Trustee a reasonable supply of Securities that are not in the form of Global Securities. The Trustee shall be entitled to rely upon any order, direction or request of the Depositary or its authorized representative which is given or made pursuant to this Article if such order, direction or request is given or made in accordance with the Applicable Procedures.
 
(D)          Every Security authenticated and delivered upon registration of transfer of, or in exchange for or in lieu of, a Global Security or any portion thereof, whether pursuant to this Article or otherwise, shall be authenticated and delivered in the form of, and shall be, a registered Global Security, unless such Security is registered in the name of a Person other than the Depositary for such Global Security or a nominee thereof, in which case such Security shall be authenticated and delivered in definitive, fully registered form, without interest coupons.
 
(E)           The Depositary or its nominee, as registered owner of a Global Security, shall be the Holder of such Global Security for all purposes under this Indenture and the Securities, and owners of beneficial interests in a Global Security shall hold such interests pursuant to the Applicable Procedures.  Accordingly, any such owner's beneficial interest in a Global Security shall be shown only on, and the transfer of such interest shall be effected only through, records maintained by the Depositary or its nominee or its Agent Members and such owners of beneficial interests in a Global Security shall not be considered the owners or holders thereof.
 
(2)           Non-global Securities.  Securities issued upon the events described in Section 3.4(1)(B) shall be in definitive, fully registered form, without interest coupons, and shall bear the Restricted Securities Legend if and as required by this Indenture.
Section 3.5
                                                             
Registration; Registration of Transfer and Exchange; Restrictions on Transfer.
 
(1)           The Company shall cause to be kept at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee a register (the register maintained in such office referred to as the "") in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Company shall provide for the registration of Securities and of transfers of Securities. The Trustee is hereby appointed "Security Registrar" for the purpose of registering Securities and transfers and exchanges of Securities as herein provided.
Security Register
 
Upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Security at an office or agency of the Company designated pursuant to Section 10.2 for such purpose, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in the name of the designated transferee or transferees, one or more new Securities of any authorized denominations and of a like aggregate principal amount and bearing such restrictive legends as may be required by this Indenture.
 
At the option of the Holder, and subject to the other provisions of this Section 3.5, Securities may be exchanged for other Securities of any authorized denomination and of a like aggregate principal amount, upon surrender of the Securities to be exchanged at any such office or agency. Whenever any Securities are so surrendered for exchange, and subject to the other provisions of this Section 3.5, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the Securities that the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive. Every Security presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or for exchange shall (if so required by the Company or the Security Registrar) be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company, the Trustee and the Security Registrar duly executed, by the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing.
 
All Securities issued upon any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities shall be the valid obligations of the Company, evidencing the same debt and entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as the Securities surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange.
 
No service charge shall be made to a Holder for any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities except as provided in Section 3.6, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, other than exchanges pursuant to Section 3.4, Section 8.5, or Section 12.2 (other than where the shares of Common Stock are to be issued or delivered in a name other than that of the Holder of the Security) not involving any transfer and other than any stamp and other duties, if any, which may be imposed in connection with any such transfer or exchange by the United States or any political subdivision thereof or therein, which shall be paid by the Company.
 
(2)           . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture or the Securities, transfers and exchanges of Securities and beneficial interests in a Global Security of the kinds specified in this Section 3.5(2) shall be made only in accordance with this Section 3.5(2).
Certain Transfers and Exchanges
(A)          .  In the event that Non-global Securities are to be issued pursuant to Section 3.4(1)(B) in connection with any transfer of Securities, such transfer may be effected only in accordance with the provisions of this clause (2)(A) and subject to the Applicable Procedures.  Upon receipt by the Trustee, as Security Registrar, of (a) a Company Order from the Company directing the Trustee, as Security Registrar, to (i) authenticate and deliver one or more Securities of the same aggregate principal amount as the beneficial interest in the Restricted Global Security to be transferred, such instructions to contain the name or names of the designated transferee or transferees, the authorized denomination or denominations of the Securities to be so issued and appropriate delivery instructions and (ii) decrease the beneficial interest of a specified Agent Member's account in a Restricted Global Security by a specified principal amount not greater than the principal amount of such Restricted Global Security, and (b) such other certifications, legal opinions or other information as the Company or the Trustee may reasonably require to confirm that such transfer is being made pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act, then the Trustee, as Security Registrar, shall decrease the principal amount of the Restricted Global Security by the specified amount and authenticate and deliver Securities in accordance with such instructions from the Company as provided in Section 3.4(1)(C).
Restricted Global Security to Restricted Non-global Security
 
(B)           .  If the Holder of a Restricted Security (other than a Global Security) wishes at any time to transfer all or any portion of such Restricted Security to a Person who wishes to take delivery thereof in the form of a beneficial interest in the Restricted Global Security, such transfer may be effected only in accordance with the provisions of this clause (2)(B) and subject to the Applicable Procedures. Upon receipt by the Trustee, as Security Registrar, of such Restricted Security as provided in Section 3.5(1) and instructions from the Company directing that a beneficial interest in the Restricted Global Security in a specified principal amount not greater than the principal amount of such Security be credited to a specified Agent Member's account, then the Trustee, as Security Registrar, shall cancel such Restricted Security (and issue a new Restricted Security in respect of any untransferred portion thereof) as provided in Section 3.5(1) and increase the principal amount of the Restricted Global Security by the specified principal amount as provided in Section 3.4(1)(C).
Restricted Non-global Security to Restricted Global Security
 
(C)           .  A beneficial interest in a Global Security may be exchanged for a Security that is not a Global Security only as provided in Section 3.4 or only if such exchange occurs in connection with a transfer effected in accordance with clause 2(A) above, that, if such interest is a beneficial interest in the Restricted Global Security, then such interest shall be exchanged for a Restricted Security (subject in each case to Section 3.5(3)). A Security that is not a Global Security may be exchanged for a beneficial interest in a Global Security only if such exchange occurs in connection with a transfer effected in accordance with clause (2)(B) above.
Exchanges Between Global Security and Non-global Security
provided
 
(3)           . All Securities issued pursuant to this Indenture, and all Successor Securities, shall bear the Restricted Securities Legend and shall be subject to the restrictions on transfer specified therein, subject to the following:
Securities Act Legends
 
(A)
                             
subject to the following clauses of this Section 3.5(3), a Security or any portion thereof which is exchanged, upon transfer or otherwise, for a Global Security or any portion thereof shall bear the Restricted Securities Legend borne by such Global Security for which the Security was exchanged;
 
(B)
                               
subject to the following clauses of this Section 3.5(3), a new Security that is not a Global Security and is issued in exchange for another Security (including a Global Security) or any portion thereof, upon transfer or otherwise, shall bear the Restricted Securities Legend borne by the Security for which the new Security was exchanged;
 
(C)
                               
any Securities that are sold or otherwise disposed of pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act, together with their Successor Securities shall not bear a Restricted Securities Legend; the Company shall inform the Trustee in writing of the effective date of any such registration statement registering the Securities under the Securities Act and shall notify the Trustee at any time when prospectuses must be delivered with respect to Securities to be sold pursuant to such registration statement. The Trustee shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in accordance with the aforementioned registration statement;
 
(D)
                              
at any time after the Securities may be freely transferred without registration under the Securities Act or without being subject to transfer restrictions pursuant to the Securities Act, a new Security that does not bear a Restricted Securities Legend may be issued in exchange for or in lieu of a Security (other than a Global Security) or any portion thereof that bears such a legend if the Trustee has received evidence satisfactory to the Trustee that such securities may be safely transferred without registration under the Securities Act, and after such date and receipt of such evidence, the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver such new Security in exchange for or in lieu of such other Security as provided in this Article III;
 
(E)
                                
a new Security that does not bear a Restricted Securities Legend may be issued in exchange for or in lieu of a Security or any portion thereof that bears such a legend if, in the Company's judgment, placing such a legend upon such new Security is not necessary to ensure compliance with the registration requirements of the Securities Act, and the Trustee, at the direction of the Company, shall authenticate and deliver such a new Security as provided in this Article III;
 
(F)
                                
notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.5(3), a Successor Security of a Security that does not bear a Restricted Securities Legend shall not bear such legend unless the Company has reasonable cause to believe that such Successor Security is a "restricted security" within the meaning of Rule 144, in which case the Trustee, at the direction of the Company, shall authenticate and deliver a new Security bearing a Restricted Securities Legend in exchange for such Successor Security as provided in this Article; and
 
(G)
                               
as set forth in Section 10.8.
 
(4)
                                 
Any stock certificate representing shares of Common Stock issued upon conversion of the Securities shall bear the Restricted Securities Legend borne by such Securities, to the extent
required by this Indenture, unless such shares of Common Stock have been sold pursuant to a registration statement that has been declared effective under the Securities Act (and that continues to be effective at the time of such transfer) or sold pursuant to Rule 144 of the Securities Act, or unless otherwise agreed by the Company in writing with written notice thereof to the transfer agent for the Common Stock.  With respect to the transfer of shares of Common Stock issued upon conversion of the Securities that are restricted hereunder, any deliveries of certificates, legal opinions or other instruments that would be required to be made to the Security Registrar in the case of a transfer of Securities, as described above, shall instead be made to the transfer agent for the Common Stock.
 
(5)
                                 
Neither the Trustee, the Paying Agent nor any of their agents shall (i) have any duty to monitor compliance with or with respect to any federal or state or other securities or tax laws or (ii) have any duty to obtain documentation on any transfers or exchanges other than as specifically required hereunder.
 
Section 3.6
                                                             
Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost or Stolen Securities
 
If any mutilated Security is surrendered to the Trustee, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a new Security of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.
 
If there be delivered to the Company and to the Trustee:
 
(1)
                                 
evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Security, and
 
(2)
                                 
such security or indemnity as may be satisfactory to the Company and the Trustee to save each of them and any agent of either of them harmless, then, in the absence of actual notice to the Company or the Trustee that such Security has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in lieu of any such destroyed, lost or stolen Security, a new Security of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.
 
In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security has become or is about to become due and payable, the Company in its discretion, but subject to any conversion rights, may, instead of issuing a new Security, pay such Security, upon satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the preceding paragraph.
 
Upon the issuance of any new Security under this Section, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto (other than any stamp and other duties, if any, which may be imposed in connection therewith by the United States or any political subdivision thereof or therein, which shall be paid by the Company) and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected therewith.
Every new Security issued pursuant to this Section in lieu of any mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall constitute an original additional contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and such new Security shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Securities duly issued hereunder.
 
The provisions of this Section are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies of any Holder with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities.
 
Section 3.7
                                                             
Payment of Interest; Interest Rights Preserved
 
Subject to the last paragraph of this Section, interest or Special Interest on any Security that is payable, and is punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date shall be paid to the Person in whose name that Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest.
 
Any interest or Special Interest on any Security that is payable, but is not punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date (herein called "") shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on the relevant Regular Record Date by virtue of having been such Holder, and such Defaulted Interest may be paid by the Company, at its election in each case, as provided in clause (1) or (2) below:
Defaulted Interest
 
(1)
                                 
The Company may elect to make payment of any Defaulted Interest to the Persons in whose names the Securities (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest, which shall be fixed in the following manner.  The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of Defaulted Interest proposed to be paid on each Security, the date of the proposed payment and the Special Record Date, and at the same time the Company shall deposit with the Trustee an amount of money equal to the aggregate amount proposed to be paid in respect of such Defaulted Interest or shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for such deposit prior to the date of the proposed payment, such money when deposited to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such Defaulted Interest as in this clause provided.

default is made in the payment of any interest (including any Special Interest) on any Security when it becomes due and payable and such default continues for a period of 30 days, or
 
(2)
                                 
default is made in the payment of the principal of any Security at the Maturity thereof,

If the Company fails to pay such amounts forthwith upon such demand, the Trustee, in its own name and as trustee of an express trust, may institute a judicial proceeding for the collection of the sums so due and unpaid, may prosecute such proceeding to judgment or final decree and may enforce the same against the Company or any other obligor upon the Securities and collect the moneys adjudged or decreed to be payable in the manner provided by law out of the property of the Company or any other obligor upon the Securities, wherever situated.
 
If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may in its discretion proceed to protect and enforce its rights and the rights of the Holders of Securities by such appropriate judicial proceedings as the Trustee shall deem most effectual to protect and enforce any such rights, whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement in this Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any power granted herein, or to enforce any other proper remedy.

(2)
                                 
to collect and receive any moneys or other property payable or deliverable on any such claim and to distribute the same; and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder of Securities to make such payments to the Trustee and, in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders of Securities to pay to the Trustee any amount due to it for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 6.7.
 
Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder of a Security any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Securities or the rights of any Holder thereof or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder of a Security in any such proceeding;

No Notice of Conversion with respect to any Securities may be tendered by a Holder thereof if such Holder has also tendered a Designated Event Repurchase Notice and not validly withdrawn such Designated Event Repurchase Notice in accordance with the applicable provisions of Section 14.1.
 
If more than one Security shall be surrendered for conversion at one time by the same Holder, the Conversion Obligation with respect to such Securities, if any, that shall be payable upon conversion shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities (or specified portions thereof to the extent permitted thereby) so surrendered.

Delivery of the amounts owing in satisfaction of the Conversion Obligation shall be made by the Company in no event later than the date specified in subsection (a) of this Section, except to the extent specified in subsection (b) of this Section.

However, the Holder shall pay any such tax which is due because the Holder requests any shares of Common Stock to be issued in a name other than the Holder's name. The Conversion Agent may refuse to deliver the certificates representing the shares of Common Stock being issued in a name other than the Holder's name until the Trustee receives a sum sufficient to pay any tax which will be due because the shares are to be issued in a name other than the Holder's name.

In case the Company shall issue shares of Common Stock as a dividend or distribution to Holders of all or substantially all of the outstanding Common Stock, or shall effect a share split or share combination, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula:

Any adjustment made under this Section 12.4(a) shall become effective immediately after the open of business on the Ex-Date for such dividend or distribution, or immediately after the open of business on the effective date for such share split or share combination. If any dividend or distribution of the type described in this Section 12.4(a) is declared but not so paid or made, or any share split or combination of the type described in this Section 12.4(a) is announced but the outstanding shares of the Common Stock are not split or combined, as the case may be, the Conversion Rate shall be immediately readjusted, effective as of the date the Board of Directors determines not to pay such dividend or distribution, or not to split or combine the outstanding shares of the Common Stock, as the case may be, to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend, distribution, share split or share combination had not been declared or announced.
 
(b)           In case the Company shall issue to all or substantially all Holders of its outstanding shares of Common Stock rights, options or warrants entitling them (for a period of not more than sixty (60) calendar days after the record date of the distribution) to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock at a price per share less than the Last Reported Sale Price of the Common Stock on the Trading Day immediately preceding the date of announcement of such issuance, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula; provided that the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted to the extent that such rights or warrants are not exercised prior to their expiration:

Stock over the 10 consecutive Trading Day period ending on the Business Day immediately preceding the date of announcement of such distribution of such rights or warrants.
 
Any adjustment made under this Section 12.4(b) shall be successively made whenever any such rights, options or warrants are issued and shall become effective immediately after the open of business on the Ex-Date for such issuance. To the extent that shares of Common Stock are not delivered after the expiration of such rights, options or warrants, the Conversion Rate shall be decreased to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect had the increase with respect to the issuance of such rights, options or warrants been made on the basis of delivery of only the number of shares of Common Stock actually delivered.  If such rights, options or warrants are not so issued, the Conversion Rate shall be decreased to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such Ex-Date for such issuance had not occurred.
 
In determining whether any rights, options or warrants entitle the Holders to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock at less than such Last Reported Sale Prices for the 10 consecutive Trading Day period ending on the Trading Day immediately preceding the Ex-Date of such issuance, and in determining the aggregate offering price of such shares of Common Stock, there shall be taken into account any consideration received by the Company for such rights, options or warrants and any amount payable on exercise or conversion thereof, the value of such consideration, if other than cash, to be determined by the Board of Directors.

If such dividend or distribution is not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.
 
For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of this subsection (d), in the event of any reclassification of the Common Stock, as a result of which the Securities become convertible into more than one class of Common Stock, if an adjustment to the Conversion Rate is required pursuant to this subsection (d), references in this Section to one share of Common Stock or Last Reported Sale Price of one share of Common Stock shall be deemed to refer to a unit or to the price of a unit consisting of the number of shares of each class of Common Stock into which the Securities are then convertible equal to the numbers of shares of such class issued in respect of one share of Common Stock in such reclassification. The above provisions of this paragraph shall similarly apply to successive reclassifications.
 
(e)           In case the Company or any of its Subsidiaries makes a payment in respect of a tender offer or exchange offer for all or any portion of the Common Stock, to the extent that the cash and value of any other consideration included in the payment per share of Common Stock (taken together) exceeds the Last Reported Sale Price of the Common Stock on the Trading Day next succeeding the last date on which tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer (as it may be amended), the Conversion Rate shall be increased based on the following formula:
 
where,
 
CR
0
 = the Conversion Rate in effect on the date such tender or exchange offer expires;
 
CR
= the Conversion Rate in effect on the day next succeeding the date such tender or exchange offer expires;
 
AC = the aggregate value of all cash and any other consideration as determined by the Board of Directors paid or payable for shares purchased in such tender or exchange offer;
 
OS
0
 = the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the date such tender or exchange offer expires;
 
OS
= the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after the date such tender or exchange offer expires; and
SP
= the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices of Common Stock over the 10 consecutive Trading Day period commencing on the Trading Day next succeeding the date such tender or exchange offer expires.
 
Such adjustment shall occur at the close of business on the 10th Trading Day immediately following, and including, the Trading Day next succeeding the date such tender or exchange offer expires; that in respect of any conversion within the 10 Trading Days immediately following, and including, the expiration date of any tender or exchange offer, references with respect to 10 Trading Days shall be deemed replaced with such lesser number of Trading Days as have elapsed between the expiration date of such tender or exchange offer and the Conversion Date in determining the applicable Conversion Rate. In addition, if the expiration date of such tender or exchange offer occurs on any Trading Day of any Observation Period except the last Trading Day of such Observation Period, such Observation Period shall be suspended on the first Trading Day immediately following such expiration date and shall resume on the second Trading Day immediately following such expiration date, with references in the above definitions to 10 Trading Days deemed replaced with references to one (1) Trading Day. If the Company is obligated to purchase shares pursuant to any such tender or exchange offer, but the Company is permanently prevented by applicable law from effecting all or any such purchases or all or any portion of such purchases are rescinded, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such tender or exchange offer had not been made or had only been made in respect of the purchases that had been effected.
provided
 
For purposes of this Section the term "" shall mean, with respect to any dividend, distribution or other transaction or event in which the Holders of Common Stock have the right to receive any cash, securities or other property or in which the Common Stock (or other applicable security) is exchanged for or converted into any combination of cash, securities or other property, the date fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to receive such cash, securities or other property (whether such date is fixed by the Board of Directors or by statute, contract or otherwise).
Stockholder Record Date
 
(g)           In addition to those required by subsections (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) of this Section, and to the extent permitted by applicable law and subject to the shareholder approval rules or listing standards of The NASDAQ Global Select Market, the Company from time to time may increase the Conversion Rate of the Securities by any amount for a period of at least 20 calendar days if the Board of Directors determines that such increase would be in the Company's best interest. In addition, to the extent permitted by applicable law and subject to the shareholder approval rules or listing standards of The NASDAQ Global Select Market, the Company may also (but is not required to) increase the Conversion Rate to avoid or diminish any income tax to Holders of Common Stock or rights to purchase shares of Common Stock in connection with any dividend or distribution of shares (or rights to acquire shares) or similar event. Whenever the Conversion Rate is increased pursuant to the preceding sentence, the Company shall mail to the Holder of each Security at his last address appearing on the Security Register provided for in Section 1.6 a notice of the increase at least 15 days prior to the date the increased Conversion Rate takes effect, and such notice shall state the increased Conversion Rate and the period during which it shall be in effect.
(h)           All calculations and other determinations under this Article shall be made by the Company and shall be made to the nearest cent or to the nearest one-ten thousandth (1/10,000) of a share, as the case may be. No adjustment shall be made for the Company's issuance of Common Stock or convertible or exchangeable securities or rights to purchase Common Stock or convertible or exchangeable securities, other than as provided in this Section. No adjustment shall be made to the Conversion Rate unless such adjustment would require a change of at least 1% in the Conversion Rate then in effect at such time. The Company shall carry forward any adjustments that are less than 1% of the Conversion Rate and make such carried forward adjustments, regardless of whether the aggregate adjustment is less than 1% within one year of the first such adjustment carried forward, upon a Designated Event, Fundamental Change and upon each Trading Day during an Observation Period in connection with any conversion of the Securities.
 
(i)            Notwithstanding Section 12.4(a), (b), (c), (d) or (e), if a Conversion Rate adjustment becomes effective on any Ex-Date and a Holder that has converted Securities on or after such Ex-Date and on or prior to the related record date would be treated as the record holder of shares of Common Stock as of the related Conversion Date based on an adjusted Conversion Rate for such Ex-Date, then the Conversion Rate adjustment relating to such Ex-Date will not be made for such converting Holder.  Instead, such Holder will be treated as if such Holder were the record owner of the shares of the Common Stock on an unadjusted basis and participate in the related dividend, distribution or other event giving rise to such adjustment.
 
(j)            For purposes of this Section, the number of shares of Common Stock at any time outstanding shall not include shares held in the treasury of the Company but shall include shares issuable in respect of scrip certificates issued in lieu of fractions of shares of Common Stock.
 
(k)           For the avoidance of doubt, if a Holder converts Securities prior to the Effective Date of a Fundamental Change, and the Fundamental Change does not occur, the Holder shall not be entitled to an increased Conversion Rate in connection with such conversion.
 
(l)            If the application of Section 12.4(a), (b), (c), (d) or (e) (except in the case of an adjustment made in connection with a share combination pursuant to Section 12.4(a)) would result in a decrease in the Conversion Rate, no adjustment to the Conversion Rate will be made.
 
(m)          To the extent that the Company has a rights plan in effect at the time of conversion of Securities into Common Stock, the Holder will receive, in addition to any Common Stock, the rights under the rights plan, unless prior to any conversion, the rights have separated from the Common Stock, in which case the Conversion Rate will be adjusted at the time of separation as if the Company distributed to all holders of the Common Stock, shares Capital Stock, evidences of indebtedness or assets as described in Section 12.4(c), subject to readjustment in the event of the expiration, termination or redemption of such rights.

Notice of Adjustments of Conversion Rate
 
Whenever the Conversion Rate is adjusted as herein provided:
 
(1)           the Company shall compute the adjusted Conversion Rate in accordance with Section 12.4 and shall prepare a certificate signed by the Chief Financial Officer of the Company setting forth the adjusted Conversion Rate and showing in reasonable detail the facts upon which such adjustment is based, and such certificate shall promptly be filed with the Trustee and with each Conversion Agent; and
 
(2)           upon each such adjustment, a notice stating that the Conversion Rate has been adjusted and setting forth the adjusted Conversion Rate shall be required, and as soon as practicable after it is required, such notice shall be provided by the Company to all Holders in accordance with Section 1.6.
 
Neither the Trustee nor any Conversion Agent shall be under any duty or responsibility with respect to any such certificate or the information and calculations contained therein, except to exhibit the same to any Holder of Securities desiring inspection thereof at its office during normal business hours.

Certain Covenants
 
(a)         Before taking any action which would cause an adjustment reducing the Conversion Rate below the then par value, if any, of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Securities, the Company shall take all corporate action which may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary in order that the Company may validly and legally issue shares of such Common Stock at such adjusted Conversion Rate.
 
The Company covenants that all shares of Common Stock issued upon conversion of Securities shall be fully paid and non-assessable by the Company and free from all taxes, liens and changes with respect to the issue thereof.
 
(b)        The Company covenants that, if any shares of Common Stock to be provided for the purpose of conversion of Securities hereunder require registration with or approval of any governmental authority under any federal or state law before such shares may be validly issued upon conversion, the Company shall in good faith and as expeditiously as possible, to the extent then
permitted by the rules and interpretations of the SEC (or any successor thereto), endeavor to secure such registration or approval, as the case may be.
 
(c)         The Company further covenants that if at any time the Common Stock shall be listed on any other national securities exchange or automated quotation system the Company shall, if permitted and required by the rules of such exchange or automated quotation system, list and keep listed, so long as the Common Stock shall be so listed on such exchange or automated quotation system, all Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Securities.

If any of the following events occur, namely (i) any reclassification of Common Stock (other than a change in par value, or from par value to no par value, or from no par value to par value, or as a result of a split, subdivision or combination), (ii) any consolidation, merger or combination of the Company with another Person, or (iii) any sale or conveyance of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Company to any other Person, in each case as a result of which Holders of outstanding Common Stock shall be entitled to receive cash, securities or other property or assets (the "") with respect to or in exchange for such Common Stock (any such event a ""), then:
Reference Property
Merger Event
 
(a)           the Company or the successor or purchasing Person, as the case may be, shall execute with the Trustee a supplemental indenture (which shall comply with the Trust Indenture Act as in force at the date of execution of such supplemental indenture if such supplemental indenture is then required to so comply) permitted under Section 8.1(12) providing for the conversion and settlement of the Securities as set forth in this Indenture. Such supplemental indenture shall provide for adjustments which shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in this Article and the Trustee may conclusively rely on the determination by the Company of the equivalency of such adjustments. If, in the case of any Merger Event, the Reference Property includes shares of stock or other securities and assets of a corporation other than the successor or purchasing corporation, as the case may be, in such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, combination, sale or conveyance, then such supplemental indenture shall also be executed by such other corporation and shall contain such additional provisions to protect the interests of the Holders of the Securities as the Board of Directors shall reasonably consider necessary by reason of the foregoing, including to the extent required by the Board of Directors and practicable the provisions providing for the repurchase rights set forth in Article XIV.
 
In the event the Company shall execute a supplemental indenture pursuant to this Section, the Company shall promptly file with the Trustee an Officers' Certificate briefly stating the reasons
 
therefore, the kind or amount of cash, securities or property or asset that shall constitute the Reference Property after any such Merger Event, any adjustment to be made with respect thereto and that all conditions precedent have been complied with, and shall promptly mail notice thereof to all Holders.
 
(b)
                                
Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 12.2(a) and Section 12.2(b), and subject to the provisions of Section 12.1, at the effective time of such Merger Event, the right to convert each $1,000 principal amount of Securities shall be changed to a right to convert such Security by reference to the Reference Property; , , upon conversion, a Holder shall be entitled thereafter to convert its Securities into cash and the same type (and in the same proportion) of Reference Property, based on the Daily Settlement Amounts of Reference Property in an amount equal to the applicable Conversion Rate, as described under Section 12.2(b).
provided
however
 
For purposes of determining the constitution of Reference Property, the type and amount of consideration that a holder of Common Stock would have been entitled to in the case of reclassifications, consolidations, mergers, sales or conveyance of assets or other transactions that cause the Common Stock to be converted into the right to receive more than a single type of consideration (determined based in part upon any form of stockholder election) shall be deemed to be the weighted average of the types and amounts of consideration received by holders of Common Stock that affirmatively make such an election. The Company shall not become a party to any such transaction unless its terms are consistent with the preceding. None of the foregoing provisions shall affect the right of a Holder of Securities to convert its Securities in accordance with the provisions of this Article prior to the Effective Date.
 
(c)
                                 
The Company shall cause notice of the execution of such supplemental indenture to be mailed to each Holder, at his address appearing on the Security Register provided for in this Indenture, within 20 days after execution thereof.  Failure to deliver such notice shall not affect the legality or validity of such supplemental indenture.
 
(d)
                                
The above provisions of this Section shall similarly apply to successive Merger Events.

Responsibility of Trustee for Conversion Provisions
 
The Trustee, subject to the provisions of Section 6.1, and any Conversion Agent shall not at any time be under any duty or responsibility to any Holder of Securities to determine whether any facts exist which may require any adjustment of the Conversion Rate, or with respect to the nature or extent of any such adjustment when made, or with respect to the method employed, herein or in any supplemental indenture provided to be employed, in making the same, or whether a supplemental indenture need be entered into. Neither the Trustee, subject to the provisions of Section 6.1, nor any Conversion Agent shall be accountable with respect to the validity or value (or the kind or amount) of any Common Stock, or of any other securities or property or cash, which may at any time be issued or delivered upon the conversion of any Security; and it or they do not make any representation with respect thereto. Neither the Trustee, subject to the provisions of Section 6.1, nor any Conversion Agent shall be responsible for any failure of the Company to make or calculate any
cash payment or to issue, transfer or deliver any shares of Common Stock or share certificates or other securities or property or cash upon the surrender of any Security for the purpose of conversion; and the Trustee, subject to the provisions of Section 6.1, and any Conversion Agent shall not be responsible for any failure of the Company to comply with any of the covenants of the Company contained in this Article.
