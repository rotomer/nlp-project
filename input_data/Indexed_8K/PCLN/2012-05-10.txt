On
May 9, 2012
, priceline.com announced its financial results for the 1
st
 quarter ended
March 31, 2012
.  A copy of priceline.coms press release announcing these financial results is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
 
The company noted that average daily rates (ADRs) for hotel room night reservations had increased year-over-year during the 1
st
quarter 2012 on a local currency basis by approximately 2% internationally and by approximately 5% domestically.
     The company noted that its forecast for the remainder of the 2
nd
quarter 2012 assumed, among other things, that the Euro/U.S. Dollar exchange rate would be 1.30 U.S. Dollars per Euro and that the British Pound/U.S. Dollar exchange rate would be 1.62 U.S. Dollars per British Pound; the company noted that those assumed exchange rates were lower by approximately 9% for the Euro and 1% for the British Pound than average exchange rates for the same period in the prior year.   The company emphasized that volatility in the Euro to U.S. Dollar exchange rate could materially impact the company's earnings expressed in U.S. Dollars. 
The company explained that its 2
nd
quarter 2012 guidance assumed that the rate of year-over-year increase in hotel ADRs for the 2
nd
quarter would be flat to down slightly for its international hotel service and up by about 6% for the company's U.S. hotel service versus the prior year. The company said that it assumes margins in the 2
nd
quarter 2012 and beyond will be impacted by deleverage in online advertising expense due to business mix and potential reductions in ROIs and investment in people, new offices, IT expenses and increased depreciation expense to support business growth.
     The company noted that its non-GAAP financial guidance was based upon a non-GAAP diluted share count of approximately 51.6 million shares (which includes a calculation of the assumed economic dilutive impact of the company's outstanding convertible notes and share-based awards), which is based on the company's May 8, 2012 closing stock price of $716.20 per share.
     The company noted that it would have a difficult comp in the 2
nd
quarter 2012 because hotel unit growth in the second half of the 2
nd
quarter of 2011 accelerated. The company explained that the company's 2
nd
quarter 2012 forecast assumed fairly significant year-over-year deceleration in hotel unit growth rates in the second half of the 2
nd
quarter of 2012 in light of the difficult comp. The company noted that its guidance assumes that macro-economic conditions in general and conditions in the consumer travel market in particular, remain relatively unchanged.

Exhibit 99.1
 
Priceline.com Reports Financial Results for 1
st
Quarter 2012
NORWALK, Conn., May 9, 2012. . . Priceline.com Incorporated (Nasdaq: PCLN) today reported 1
st
quarter 2012 financial results for the Priceline Group. First quarter gross travel bookings for the Group, which refers to the total dollar value, generally inclusive of all taxes and fees, of all travel services purchased by consumers, were $6.7 billion, an increase of 43.9% over a year ago.
The Group had revenues in the 1
st
quarter of $1.0 billion, a 28.2% increase over a year ago. The Group's international operations contributed revenues in the 1
st
quarter of $617 million, a 58.5% increase versus a year ago (approximately 65% on a local currency basis). The Group's gross profit for the 1
st
quarter was $743 million, a 47.0% increase from the prior year. International operations contributed gross profit in the 1
st
quarter of $617 million, a 58.8% increase versus a year ago (approximately 65% growth on a local currency basis). The Group's operating income in the 1
st
quarter was $242 million, a 56.8% increase from the prior year. The Group had GAAP net income applicable to common shareholders for the 1
st
quarter of $182 million, or $3.54 per diluted share, which compares to $105 million or $2.05 per diluted share, in the same period a year ago.
Non-GAAP net income in the 1
st
quarter was $221 million, a 61.2% increase versus the prior year.  Non-GAAP net income was $4.28 per diluted share, compared to $2.66 per diluted share a year ago. FactSet consensus for the 1
st
quarter 2012 was $3.97 per diluted share.  Adjusted EBITDA for the 1
st
quarter 2012 was $272 million, an increase of 56.5% over a year ago. The section below entitled "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" provides a definition and information about the use of non-GAAP financial measures in this press release and the attached financial and statistical supplement reconciles non-GAAP financial information with the Group's financial results under GAAP.
"The Priceline Group's hotel business booked 46 million room nights in the 1
st
quarter, up 47% over last year," said Jeffery H. Boyd, President and Chief Executive Officer. "International gross bookings increased 54% (58% on a local currency basis), driven by strong hotel results at Booking.com and Agoda.com and continued growth at Rentalcars.com."
Looking forward, Mr. Boyd said, "We believe our international hotel businesses are well positioned for the peak travel season, with over 210,000 hotels at Booking.com and continuing website innovation and new product offerings, including a growing complement of mobile offerings. The Group continues its investment in building content for our customers and attractive new offerings to support future growth."
The Priceline Group said it was targeting the following for 2
nd
quarter 2012:
1
of
11
Non-GAAP guidance for the 2
nd
quarter 2012:
In addition to the adjustments above, adjusted EBITDA excludes depreciation and amortization expense, interest income, interest expense, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, income taxes and includes the impact of foreign currency transactions and other expenses.
When aggregated, the non-GAAP adjustments are expected to increase adjusted EBITDA over GAAP net income by approximately $135 million in the 2
nd
quarter 2012.  In addition, the non-GAAP adjustments are expected to increase non-GAAP net income over GAAP net income by approximately $46 million in the 2
nd
quarter 2012. The Group estimates GAAP net income per diluted share of approximately $6.34 to $6.54 for the 2
nd
quarter 2012.
Information About Forward-Looking Statements
This press release contains forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements reflect the views of the Group's management regarding current expectations and projections about future events and are based on currently available information and current foreign currency exchange rates. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict; therefore, actual results may differ materially from those expressed, implied or forecasted in any such forward-looking statements. Expressions of future goals and similar expressions including, without limitation, "may," "will," "should," "could," "expects," "does not currently expect," "plans," "anticipates," "intends," "believes," "estimates," "predicts," "potential," "targets," or "continue," reflecting something other than historical fact are intended to identify forward-looking statements.
The following factors, among others, could cause the Group's actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements:
-- adverse changes in general market conditions for leisure and other travel services as a result of, among other things, decreased consumer spending, general economic downturn, terrorist attacks, natural disasters or adverse weather, the bankruptcy or insolvency of a major supplier, or the outbreak of an epidemic or pandemic disease, such as the swine flu outbreak;
-- our ability to expand successfully in international markets;
-- fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and other risks associated with doing business in multiple currencies;
-- the effects of increased competition, including the potential impact of increased pricing competition initiated by other on-line travel agents in the form of reduced booking fees and/or the launch by competitors of an "opaque" travel offering and the potential impact of "metasearch" initiatives by Google and other search engines upon which we rely for a significant amount of traffic;
2
of
11
-- the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel;
-- adverse changes in the Group's relationships with suppliers, service providers and vendors which could include, without limitation, the withdrawal of suppliers from the Group's systems (either "retail" or "opaque" services, or both) and/or the loss or reduction of global distribution fees;
-- the occurrence of an external or internal security breach of our systems or other Internet based systems involving personal customer information, credit card information or other sensitive data;
-- a change by a major search engine to its search engine algorithms that negatively affects the search engine ranking of the company or its 3rd party distribution partners;
-- systems-related failures and/or security breaches, including without limitation, "denial-of-service" type attacks on our system, any security breach that results in the theft, transfer or unauthorized disclosure of customer information, or the failure to comply with various state laws applicable to the company's obligations in the event of such a breach;
-- an adverse outcome in one or more of the hotel occupancy and other tax proceedings in which priceline.com is involved; and
-- legal and regulatory risks.
For a detailed discussion of these and other factors that could cause the Group's actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements, please refer to the Group's most recent Form 10-Q, Form 10-K and Form 8-K filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Unless required by law, the Group undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Adjusted EBITDA represents GAAP net income excluding depreciation and amortization expense, interest income, interest expense, net income and loss attributable to noncontrolling interests, income taxes and is adjusted for the non-GAAP adjustments relating to stock-based employee compensation expense, gains and losses on early debt extinguishment and charges or benefits related to judgments, rulings, or settlements of hotel occupancy tax proceedings.
Adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share are "non-GAAP financial measures," as such term is defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and may differ from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. The Group believes that adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share that exclude certain non-cash or non-recurring income or expense items are useful for analysts and investors to evaluate the Group's future on-going performance because they provide a useful comparison of the Group's projected cash earnings and performance with its historical results from prior periods and to those of its competitors. These non-GAAP metrics, in particular adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP operating income, and non-GAAP net income are not intended to represent funds available for the Group's discretionary use and are not intended to represent or to be used as a substitute for operating income, net income or cash flows from operations data as measured under GAAP. The items excluded from these non-GAAP metrics, but included in the calculation of their closest GAAP equivalent, are significant components of consolidated statements of income and must be considered in performing a comprehensive assessment of overall financial performance.
Non-GAAP financial information is adjusted for the following items:
3
of
11
extinguishment related to convertible debt are excluded because they are non-cash in nature.
The presentation of this financial information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The attached financial and statistical supplement reconciles non-GAAP financial information with priceline.com's financial results under GAAP.
