Earnings.
On
August 7, 2012
, priceline.com announced its financial results for the 2
nd
 quarter ended
June 30, 2012
.  A copy of priceline.coms press release announcing these financial results is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
 
The company noted that weak economic conditions and sovereign debt concerns contributed to the 2
nd
quarter year-over-year deceleration in growth rate for hotel room nights booked, particularly in the company's key European market which represents about 60% of total hotel room nights booked. The company explained further that it saw softer demand and average daily rates (ADRs) trends continue in southern Europe and spread to certain other markets, including the U.K. in the 2
nd
quarter 2012. The company also noted that hotel room nights booked in the 2
nd
quarter 2012 grew year-over-year by over 30% in Europe and by over 50% for the rest of the world.
The company noted that ADRs for hotel room night reservations had decreased year-over-year during the 2
nd
quarter 2012 on a local currency basis by approximately 1% for its international hotel service and increased year-over-year during the 2
nd
quarter 2012 by approximately 4% for its U.S. hotel service.
 The company noted that its 3
rd
quarter 2012 forecast assumes that macro-economic conditions will deteriorate further as the company progresses throughout the quarter and that its unit growth rates will decelerate fairly significantly compared to their current levels as a result. The company explained that its 3
rd
quarter 2012 guidance assumes that ADRs for the company's international hotel service for the 3
rd
quarter 2012 would be down to a greater degree than in the 2
nd
quarter and ADRs for the company's U.S. hotel service would be up by approximately 4% year-over-year. The company noted that softer international ADRs and higher cancel rates assumed in the company's guidance negatively impact unit economics and operating leverage.
    The company noted that its forecast for the remainder of the 3
rd
quarter 2012 assumed, among other things, that the Euro/U.S. Dollar exchange rate would be 1.24 U.S. Dollars per Euro and that the British Pound/U.S. Dollar exchange rate would be 1.56 U.S. Dollars per British Pound; the company noted that those assumed exchange rates were lower by approximately 13% for the Euro and 3% for the British Pound than average exchange rates for the same period in the prior year. The company explained that it expected deleverage in non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of gross profit in the 3
rd
quarter 2012. The company assumes that margins in 3
rd
quarter will be impacted by deleverage in online advertising expense due to business mix and assumed deterioration in unit economics associated with worsening macroeconomic conditions. Despite economic challenges, the company intends to continue to invest in people, new offices, IT expenses and increased depreciation expense to support the growth of its business. The company also noted that its forecast for personnel expense in the 3
rd
quarter 2012 included a pretax charge of $13 million related to a one-time payroll tax that was imposed in the Netherlands in July 2012.
     The company noted that its non-GAAP financial guidance was based upon a non-GAAP diluted share count of approximately 51.5 million shares (which includes a calculation of the assumed economic dilutive impact of the company's outstanding convertible notes and share-based awards), which is based on the company's August 6, 2012 closing stock price of $665.12 per share.
     The company emphasized that given the uncertainty surrounding worldwide economic conditions, particularly in Europe where much of the company's business is concentrated, it believes that variability around the company's 3
rd
quarter 2012 guidance is greater than in prior periods.
Ctrip Agreement
. The company also announced that Ctrip.com (Nasdaq:CTRP), China's leading travel service enterprise, and Booking.com, the world's leading online hotel reservation service and part of the Priceline Group, had executed an agreement under which Ctrip is adding Booking.com's global portfolio of over 235,000 participating hotels to Ctrip's hotel reservation service. The company stated that it did not expect the agreement to be material to Booking.com's financial
2
performance. A copy of priceline.com's press release announcing this agreement is attached as Exhibit 99.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

Exhibit 99.1
 
Priceline.com Reports Financial Results for 2
nd
Quarter 2012
NORWALK, Conn., August 7, 2012. . . Priceline.com Incorporated (Nasdaq: PCLN) today reported 2
nd
quarter 2012 financial results for the Priceline Group. Second quarter gross travel bookings for the Group, which refers to the total dollar value, generally inclusive of all taxes and fees, of all travel services purchased by consumers, were $7.3 billion, an increase of 26.8% over a year ago (approximately 36% on a local currency basis).
The Group had revenues in the 2
nd
quarter of $1.3 billion, a 20.3% increase over a year ago. The Group's international operations contributed revenues in the 2
nd
quarter of $859 million, a 40.2% increase versus a year ago (approximately 53% on a local currency basis). The Group's gross profit for the 2
nd
quarter was $1.0 billion, a 34.0% increase from the prior year. International operations contributed gross profit in the 2
nd
quarter of $859 million, a 40.4% increase versus a year ago (approximately 53% growth on a local currency basis). The Group's operating income in the 2
nd
quarter was $458 million, a 41.2% increase from the prior year. The Group had GAAP net income applicable to common shareholders for the 2
nd
quarter of $352 million, or $6.88 per diluted share, which compares to $256 million or $5.02 per diluted share, in the same period a year ago.
Non-GAAP net income in the 2
nd
quarter was $405 million, a 43.2% increase versus the prior year.  Non-GAAP net income was $7.85 per diluted share, compared to $5.49 per diluted share a year ago. Analyst consensus for the 2
nd
quarter 2012 was $7.37 per diluted share.  Adjusted EBITDA for the 2
nd
quarter 2012 was $495 million, an increase of 41.8% over a year ago. The section below entitled "
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
" provides a definition and information about the use of non-GAAP financial measures in this press release and the attached financial and statistical supplement reconciles non-GAAP financial information with the Group's financial results under GAAP.
The Priceline Group achieved solid results for the 2
nd
quarter despite economic uncertainty across Europe, Asia and the U.S. that intensified as the quarter progressed, said Jeffery H. Boyd, President and Chief Executive Officer. We believe the Group delivered market leading growth from both a top line and profitability perspective. Globally, our hotel business booked over 50 million hotel room nights, up 39% over the same period last year. Our global rental car business grew rental car days by 29% over last year, led by continued strong growth for rentalcars.com.
Looking forward, Mr. Boyd said, The Group's international hotel business continues to perform well in the face of difficult macro-economic conditions and the strengthening dollar, which put pressure on top-line growth rates. We will continue to build our franchise by investing in geographic expansion and acquisition of hotels and accommodations, product and service innovation, and customer acquisition.
The Priceline Group said it was targeting the following for 3
rd
quarter 2012:

of
10
The Company noted that its guidance reflects current operating trends and an assumption that economic conditions in Europe will further deteriorate. The Company believes that concerns related to sovereign debt and the viability of the Euro have negatively impacted historical operating results and are likely to impact future results. Given the uncertainty surrounding worldwide economic conditions, particularly in Europe where much of the Company's business is concentrated, the Company believes the variability around its guidance is greater than is usually the case.
Non-GAAP guidance for the 3
rd
quarter 2012:
In addition to the adjustments above, adjusted EBITDA excludes depreciation and amortization expense, interest income, interest expense, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, income taxes and includes the impact of foreign currency transactions and other expenses.
When aggregated, the non-GAAP adjustments are expected to increase adjusted EBITDA over GAAP net income by approximately $188 million in the 3
rd
quarter 2012.  In addition, the non-GAAP adjustments are expected to increase non-GAAP net income over GAAP net income by approximately $49 million in the 3
rd
quarter 2012. The Group estimates GAAP net income per diluted share of approximately $10.21 to $11.21 for the 3
rd
quarter 2012.
Information About Forward-Looking Statements
This press release contains forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements reflect the views of the Group's management regarding current expectations and projections about future events and are based on currently available information and current foreign currency exchange rates. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict; therefore, actual results may differ materially from those expressed, implied or forecasted in any such forward-looking statements. Expressions of future goals and similar expressions including, without limitation, "may," "will," "should," "could," "expects," "does not currently expect," "plans," "anticipates," "intends," "believes," "estimates," "predicts," "potential," "targets," or "continue," reflecting something other than historical fact are intended to identify forward-looking statements.
The following factors, among others, could cause the Group's actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements:
-- adverse changes in general market conditions for leisure and other travel services as a result of, among other things, decreased consumer spending, general economic downturn, terrorist attacks, natural disasters or adverse weather, the bankruptcy or insolvency of a major supplier, or the outbreak of an epidemic or pandemic disease, such as the swine flu outbreak;
-- our ability to expand successfully in international markets;
-- fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and other risks associated with doing business in multiple currencies;
2
of

-- the effects of increased competition, including the potential impact of increased pricing competition initiated by other on-line travel agents in the form of reduced booking fees and/or the launch by competitors of an "opaque" travel offering and the potential impact of "metasearch" initiatives by Google and other search engines upon which we rely for a significant amount of traffic;
-- the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel;
-- adverse changes in the Group's relationships with suppliers, service providers and vendors which could include, without limitation, the withdrawal of suppliers from the Group's systems (either "retail" or "opaque" services, or both) and/or the loss or reduction of global distribution fees;
-- the occurrence of an external or internal security breach of our systems or other Internet based systems involving personal customer information, credit card information or other sensitive data;
-- a change by a major search engine to its search engine algorithms that negatively affects the search engine ranking of the company or its 3rd party distribution partners;
-- systems-related failures and/or security breaches, including without limitation, "denial-of-service" type attacks on our system, any security breach that results in the theft, transfer or unauthorized disclosure of customer information, or the failure to comply with various state laws applicable to the company's obligations in the event of such a breach;
-- an adverse outcome in one or more of the hotel occupancy and other tax proceedings in which priceline.com is involved; and
-- legal and regulatory risks.
For a detailed discussion of these and other factors that could cause the Group's actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements, please refer to the Group's most recent Form 10-Q, Form 10-K and Form 8-K filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Unless required by law, the Group undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Adjusted EBITDA represents GAAP net income excluding depreciation and amortization expense, interest income, interest expense, net income and loss attributable to noncontrolling interests, income taxes and is adjusted for the non-GAAP adjustments relating to stock-based employee compensation expense, gains and losses on early debt extinguishment and charges or benefits related to judgments, rulings, or settlements of hotel occupancy tax proceedings.
Adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share are "non-GAAP financial measures," as such term is defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and may differ from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. The Group believes that adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share that exclude certain non-cash or non-recurring income or expense items are useful for analysts and investors to evaluate the Group's future on-going performance because they provide a useful comparison of the Group's projected cash earnings and performance with its historical results from prior periods and to those of its competitors. These non-GAAP metrics, in particular adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP operating income, and non-GAAP net income are not intended to represent funds available for the Group's discretionary use and are not intended to represent or to be used as a substitute for operating income, net income or cash flows from operations data as measured under GAAP. The items excluded from these non-GAAP metrics, but included in the calculation of their closest GAAP equivalent, are significant components of consolidated statements of income and must be considered in performing a comprehensive assessment of overall financial performance.
Non-GAAP financial information is adjusted for the following items:

The presentation of this financial information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The attached financial and statistical supplement reconciles non-GAAP financial information with priceline.com's financial results under GAAP.
