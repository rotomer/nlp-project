Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
On November 8, 2012, priceline.com Incorporated, a Delaware corporation ("priceline.com," or the "Priceline Group"), KAYAK Software Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("KAYAK"), and Produce Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of priceline.com ("Merger Sub"), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement"), pursuant to which KAYAK will merge with and into Merger Sub (the "Merger"), on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement.  Merger Sub will survive the Merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of priceline.com and will be renamed as "KAYAK Software Corporation."  The Merger was unanimously approved by the respective Boards of Directors of priceline.com and KAYAK and the Board of Directors of KAYAK recommended that KAYAK's stockholders approve the proposed transaction.
 
Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger, each outstanding share of KAYAK's Class A common stock and KAYAK's Class B common stock (collectively, the "KAYAK Stock") (other than KAYAK Stock owned by (i) KAYAK, priceline.com or any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of KAYAK or priceline.com and (ii) stockholders who have perfected and not withdrawn a demand for appraisal rights under the Delaware General Corporation Law, or "DGCL")) will automatically be converted into the right to receive, at the holder's election and subject to proration as described below, either (i) $40.00 in cash (the "Cash Consideration"), or (ii) a portion of a share of priceline.com common stock, par value $0.008 per share ("priceline.com Stock"), equal to the quotient (the "Exchange Ratio") determined by dividing (A) $40.00 by (B) the priceline.com Trading Price, which is the thirty-day aggregate volume-weighted average price per share of priceline.com Stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, as reported by the Wall Street Journal, for the thirty consecutive trading days ending on the second-to-last full trading day prior to the Closing Date (the "Stock Consideration" and together with the Cash Consideration, are referred to herein as the "Merger Consideration"), without interest.
 
The Stock Consideration will be subject to a 10% collar pursuant to which the value of the priceline.com Stock delivered to the KAYAK stockholders receiving stock in connection with the Merger will be $40 per share of KAYAK Stock so long as the priceline.com Trading Price is between $571.31 and $698.27 per share of priceline.com Stock.  If such average price is above $698.27 or below $571.31, those receiving priceline.com Stock will receive a fixed exchange ratio as set forth in the Merger Agreement.
 
The Merger Agreement also contains a pro-ration mechanism that will ensure that, overall, one-third of the outstanding KAYAK shares will be paid the Cash Consideration and two-thirds of the outstanding KAYAK shares will be delivered Stock Consideration in connection with the Merger.
 
Consummation of the Merger is subject to certain mutual conditions of the parties, including, without limitation, (i) the approval by the holders of a majority of the total voting power of the outstanding shares of KAYAK Stock entitled to vote on adoption of the Merger Agreement, (ii) the expiration or termination of the waiting period applicable to the Merger under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and the approvals from certain other competition authorities shall have been obtained or the applicable waiting period shall have expired or been terminated, (iii) the absence of any law, order or injunction prohibiting the Merger, (iv) the approval for listing on the NASDAQ of the shares of priceline.com Stock to be issued in the Merger and (v) the effectiveness of the registration statement on Form S-4 to be filed by priceline.com for purposes of registering the shares of priceline.com Stock issuable in connection with the Merger.  In addition, each party's obligation to consummate the Merger is subject to certain other conditions, including, without limitation, (x) the accuracy of the other party's representations and warranties (subject to customary materiality qualifiers), (y) the other party's compliance with its covenants and agreements contained in the Merger Agreement (subject to customary materiality qualifiers), and (z) the receipt of an opinion regarding certain tax matters relating to the Merger.
 
From the date of the Merger Agreement until the earlier of (i) the effective time of the Merger and (ii) termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms, KAYAK became subject to "no-shop" restrictions on its ability to solicit alternative acquisition proposals from third parties and to provide information to and engage in discussions with third parties regarding alternative acquisition proposals. The no-shop provisions are subject to exceptions that allow KAYAK prior to receipt of KAYAK stockholder approval of the transaction under certain circumstances to provide information to and participate in discussions with third parties with respect to unsolicited alternative acquisition proposals
for more than 50% of the consolidated assets or voting power of KAYAK that the board of directors of KAYAK has determined in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) is or is reasonably likely to result in a transaction more favorable to KAYAK's stockholders from a financial point of view than the Merger and is reasonably likely to be consummated in accordance with its terms and that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary obligations under applicable Law.
 
Under certain limited circumstances before (but not after) the KAYAK stockholders approve the transaction, the board of directors of KAYAK may withdraw or qualify its recommendation in favor of the Merger or approve or recommend an alternative acquisition proposal for more than 50% of the consolidated assets or voting power of KAYAK if the proposal did not result from a breach of the "no-shop" provisions.  The Merger Agreement contains "match rights," which require KAYAK to negotiate with priceline.com and consider in good faith any amendment to the Merger Agreement proposed by priceline.com for a specified period before the board of directors of KAYAK takes any such action.  In addition, prior to changing its recommendation or proceeding with such an alternative acquisition proposal, the board of directors of KAYAK must have determined in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that the alternative acquisition proposal is reasonably likely to be consummated in accordance with its terms and, if consummated, would be more favorable to KAYAK's stockholders, from a financial point of view, than the Merger and further that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary obligations under applicable Law.
 
In connection with the termination of the Merger Agreement under certain circumstances specified in the Merger Agreement, KAYAK may be required to pay priceline.com a termination fee of $52.7 million in the event that (i) KAYAK's board of directors withdraws or qualifies its recommendation in favor of the Merger, (ii) KAYAK's board of directors fails to recommend against any publicly disclosed third party tender or exchange offer, (iii) KAYAK terminates the Merger Agreement prior to approval of the transaction by KAYAK's stockholders to accept a superior proposal or (iv) (A) an alternative acquisition proposal is made to KAYAK or otherwise becomes publicly known, (B) either party terminates the Merger Agreement because KAYAK's stockholders do not approve the Merger Agreement at the relevant stockholders meeting or the Merger is not completed by the outside date (as defined in the Merger Agreement) and (C) within one year after termination of the Merger Agreement KAYAK enters into a definitive agreement with respect to or consummates an alternative acquisition proposal, or KAYAK's board of directors approves, recommends or does not oppose an alternative acquisition proposal.
 
Completion of the Merger is anticipated to occur by the end of the first fiscal quarter of 2013, although there can be no assurance the Merger will occur within the expected timeframe or at all.
 
The Merger Agreement is filed as an exhibit to this Form 8-K to provide investors and security holders with information regarding its terms. It is not intended to provide any other factual or financial information about priceline.com, KAYAK or their respective affiliates. The representations, warranties and covenants contained in the Merger Agreement were made only for purposes of the Merger Agreement and as of the date of the Merger Agreement or such other date as is specified in the Merger Agreement; were solely for the benefit of the parties to the Merger Agreement; have been qualified by confidential disclosures made for the purposes of allocating contractual risk between the parties to the Merger Agreement instead of establishing these matters as facts; and are subject to materiality qualifications contained in the Merger Agreement that may differ from what may be viewed as material by investors. Investors should not rely on the representations, warranties and covenants or any description thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of priceline.com, KAYAK or any of their respective affiliates. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations, warranties and covenants may change after the date of the Merger Agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in public disclosures by priceline.com and KAYAK. The Merger Agreement should not be read alone, but should instead be read in conjunction with the other information regarding the companies and the Merger that will be contained in, or incorporated by reference into, the joint proxy statement/prospectus forming a part of the registration statement on Form S-4 (the "Registration Statement") that priceline.com will file in order to register the shares of priceline.com Stock issuable in connection with the Merger, as well as in the other filings that each of priceline.com and KAYAK make with the SEC.
The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, the full text of the Merger Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 2.1 to this Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference.
 
A special meeting of KAYAK's stockholders will be held as soon as practicable after the preparation and mailing of the joint proxy statement/prospectus to be included in the Registration Statement.  The joint proxy statement/prospectus is expected to be mailed as promptly as practicable after the effectiveness of the Registration Statement.

Neither priceline.com nor KAYAK gives any assurance that either priceline.com or KAYAK will achieve its expectations.

Exhibit 99.1
 
NORWALK, Conn., November 8, 2012 . . . Priceline.com Incorporated (NASDAQ: PCLN) announced today that it has signed a definitive agreement for the Priceline Group to acquire KAYAK in a stock and cash transaction.  Under the terms of the agreement, the transaction values KAYAK at $1.8 billion ($1.65 billion net of cash acquired) or $40 per share of KAYAK (subject to the collar described below), with the Group paying approximately $500 million of the consideration in cash and $1.3 billion in equity and assumed stock options.
 
The Boards of Directors of the Priceline Group and KAYAK have unanimously approved the transaction, which is subject to customary closing conditions, including a vote of KAYAK's shareholders and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close by late 1
st
 quarter 2013.  KAYAK's current management team will continue to manage KAYAK's operations independently as part of the Priceline Group of companies.  The Group expects that the impact of the KAYAK acquisition on Non-GAAP EPS in 2013 will be de minimis.
 
KAYAK is a leading travel research site that allows people to easily compare hundreds of travel sites at once when searching for flights, hotels, and rental cars, and gives travelers choices on where to book. The company processes over 100 million user queries each month through its global websites and best in class mobile applications.  "KAYAK has built a strong brand in online travel research and their track record of profitable growth is demonstrative of their popularity with consumers and value to advertisers," said Priceline Group President and Chief Executive Officer Jeffery H. Boyd.  "KAYAK also has world class technology and a tradition of innovation in building great user interfaces across multiple platforms and devices.  We believe we can be helpful with KAYAK's plans to build a global online travel brand."
 
"Paul English and I started KAYAK eight years ago to create the best place to plan and book travel," said Steve Hafner, KAYAK Chief Executive Officer and Cofounder.
 
"We're excited to join the world's premier online travel company. The Priceline Group's global reach and expertise will accelerate our growth and help us further develop as a company."
 
Transaction Summary
 
KAYAK shareholders will have the right to elect to receive cash or stock with a value of $40 per KAYAK share, (subject to (i) the collar mechanism described below and (ii) pro ration such that the overall consideration in the deal to KAYAK shareholders will consist of one-third cash and two-thirds stock).  The stock portion of the consideration will be subject to a 10% collar pursuant to which the value of the Priceline.com stock delivered to those receiving stock will be $40 per KAYAK share so long as the aggregate volume-weighted average Priceline.com trading price for the 30-day period ending 2 days prior to Closing (as set forth more fully in the Merger Agreement) is between $571.31 and $698.27 per Priceline.com share.  If such average price is above $698.27 or below $571.31, those receiving Priceline.com stock will receive a fixed exchange ratio as set forth in the Merger Agreement.  The final number of Priceline.com shares to be issued on a fully diluted basis will range between approximately 1.9 million and 2.3 million shares and options at closing.
 
Information About Forward-Looking Statements
 
Certain statements in this communication regarding the proposed transaction between Priceline and KAYAK, the expected timetable for completing the transaction, benefits of the transaction, future opportunities for the combined company and any other statements regarding Priceline's or KAYAK's future expectations, beliefs, goals, plans or prospects constitute forward-looking statements made within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (collectively, forward-looking statements).  Any statements that are not statements of historical fact (including statements containing the words "may," "can," "will," "should," "could," "expects," "plans," "anticipates," "intends," "believes," "estimates," "predicts," "potential," "targets," "goals," "projects," "outlook," "continue," "preliminary," "guidance," or variations of such words, similar expressions, or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology) should also be considered forward-looking statements.   No assurance can be given that any of the events anticipated by the forward-looking statements will transpire or occur, or if any of them do so, what impact they will have on Priceline's or KAYAK's results of operations or financial condition.  Accordingly, actual results may differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements.  A number of important factors could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements, many of which are beyond the parties' control, including the parties' ability to consummate the transaction; the conditions to the completion of the transaction, including the receipt of stockholder approval, the regulatory approvals required for the transaction may not be obtained on the terms expected or on the anticipated schedule; the parties' ability to meet expectations regarding the timing, completion and accounting and tax treatments of the transaction; the possibility that the parties may be unable to achieve expected synergies and operating efficiencies in the arrangement within the expected time-frames or at all and to successfully integrate KAYAK's operations into those of Priceline; such integration may be more difficult, time-consuming or costly than expected; operating costs,
 
customer loss and business disruption (including, without limitation, difficulties in maintaining relationships with employees, customers or clients) may be greater than expected following the transaction; the retention of certain key employees of KAYAK may be difficult; Priceline and KAYAK are subject to intense competition and increased competition is expected in the future; the volatility of the economy; and the other factors described in Priceline's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011 and in its most recent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2012 filed with the SEC, and KAYAK's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2012 filed with the SEC.  Priceline and KAYAK assume no obligation to update the information in this communication, except as otherwise required by law.  Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements that speak only as of the date hereof.
 
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
Adjusted EBITDA represents GAAP net income excluding depreciation and amortization expense, interest income, interest expense, net income and loss attributable to noncontrolling interests, income taxes and is adjusted for the non-GAAP adjustments relating to stock-based employee compensation expense, gains and losses on early debt extinguishment and charges or benefits related to judgments, rulings, or settlements of hotel occupancy tax proceedings.
 
Adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share are "non-GAAP financial measures," as such term is defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and may differ from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. The Priceline Group ("Group") believes that adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share that exclude certain non-cash or non-recurring income or expense items are useful for analysts and investors to evaluate the Group's future on-going performance because they provide a useful comparison of the Group's projected cash earnings and performance with its historical results from prior periods and to those of its competitors. These non-GAAP metrics, in particular adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP operating income, and non-GAAP net income are not intended to represent funds available for the Group's discretionary use and are not intended to represent or to be used as a substitute for operating income, net income or cash flows from operations data as measured under GAAP. The items excluded from these non-GAAP metrics, but included in the calculation of their closest GAAP equivalent, are significant components of consolidated statements of income and must be considered in performing a comprehensive assessment of overall financial performance.
 
Non-GAAP financial information is adjusted for the following items:
 
                 
Amortization expense of intangibles is excluded because it does not impact cash earnings.
                 
Stock-based employee compensation expense is excluded because it does not impact cash earnings and is reflected in earnings per share through increased share count.
                 
Interest expense related to the amortization of debt discount and gains or losses on early debt extinguishment related to convertible debt are excluded because they are non-cash in nature.
                 
Charges or benefits related to judgments, rulings, or settlements of hotel occupancy tax proceedings are excluded because the amount and timing of these items are unpredictable, not driven by core operating results and render comparisons with prior periods less meaningful.
                 
Income tax expense is adjusted for the tax impact of certain of the non-GAAP adjustments described above and to exclude tax expense recorded where no actual tax payments are owed because of available net operating loss carry forwards.  In addition,
 
the benefit in second quarter 2011 related to the reversal of a reserve for unrecognized tax benefits attributable to tax positions taken in 2010 is excluded because the amount and timing of this type of item is unpredictable, not driven by core operating results and render comparisons with prior periods less meaningful.
                 
Net income and loss attributable to noncontrolling interests is adjusted for the impact of certain of the non-GAAP adjustments described above
                 
For calculating non-GAAP net income per share:
                 
net income is adjusted for the impact of the non-GAAP adjustments described above.
                 
additional unvested shares of restricted common stock, restricted stock units and performance share units are included in the calculation of non-GAAP net income per share because non-GAAP net income has been adjusted to exclude stock-based employee compensation expense.
 
The presentation of this financial information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.
