On December 7, 2012, the Brothers Brook Foundation (the Foundation), a charitable foundation controlled by Jeffery H. Boyd, President and Chief Executive Officer of priceline.com Incorporated (priceline.com), entered into a stock trading plan implemented pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Plan).
The Plan provides for the sale of up to 15,000 shares of priceline.com common stock starting on the second business day following the first filing by priceline.com of an annual or quarterly report on Form 10-K or 10-Q that occurs after notification and approval by the Internal Revenue Service that the Foundation qualifies as a tax-exempt private foundation. Thereafter, subsequent sales will occur on the second business day following the filing by priceline.com of each annual or quarterly report on Form 10-K or 10-Q until all shares subject to the Plan are sold.
As of December 10, 2012, Mr. Boyd beneficially owned 192,080 shares of priceline.com common stock. Under the terms of the Plan, Mr. Boyd will have no discretion or control over the timing or effectuation of the sales.
A table summarizing the pre-arranged trading plans adopted by each of priceline.com's Section 16 Officers and Directors is available on the Investor Relations section of priceline.com's website (
www.priceline.com
) under the tab Corporate Governance. The Company intends to update the table following the closing of its trading window each quarter.
