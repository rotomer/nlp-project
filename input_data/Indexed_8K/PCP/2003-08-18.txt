No dividend or other distribution declared with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the date on which the Effective Time occurs shall be paid to holders of unsurrendered Certificates or holders who comply with the provisions of Section 1.10 (with regard to lost certificates) until such holders surrender such Certificates or submit an affidavit (and any reasonably required indemnity agreement) in accordance with Section 1.10.  Upon the surrender of such Certificates in accordance with Section 1.8 or submission of an affidavit (and any reasonably required indemnity agreement) in accordance with Section 1.10, there shall be paid to such holders, promptly after such surrender or submission, as the case may be, the amount of dividends or other distributions, without interest, declared with a record date after the date on which the Effective Time occurs and not paid because of the failure to surrender such Certificates for exchange.

Thereafter, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Entity to, provide the Company Employees with the types and levels of employee benefits no less favorable in the aggregate than those maintained from time to time by Parent or the Surviving Entity for similarly-situated employees of Parent or the Surviving Entity.

Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this Section 4.13(b), upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, demand, proceeding or investigation, shall promptly notify the Company and, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Entity and Parent; that the failure to so notify shall not affect the obligations of the Company, the Surviving Entity and Parent except to the extent such failure to notify materially prejudices such party.

In the event that $2,000,000 is insufficient for such coverage, the Company may spend up to that amount to purchase such lesser coverage as may be obtained with such amount.  Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Entity to, maintain such policies in full force and effect, and continue to honor the obligations thereunder.

Exhibit 99
 
 
 
 
 
 
Portland, OR
- August 18, 2003 - Precision Castparts Corp. (NYSE: PCP) has signed a definitive agreement to acquire SPS Technologies, Inc. (NYSE: ST), a supplier of fasteners and other metal products to the aerospace, automotive, and general industrial and other markets, in an accretive transaction valued at approximately $43.78 per SPS Technologies, Inc. (SPS) share as of the close of market on August 15, 2003, which represents a premium of 28% to SPS's closing price.  The total equity consideration including after-tax option payments is $575 million.
 
                "This acquisition will strengthen Precision Castparts Corp.'s (PCC) core business as a leading supplier of complex metal products for aerospace customers and provide significant cost-saving synergies, right away and well into the future," said Mark Donegan, PCC's chairman and chief executive officer. "SPS, like PCC, operates manufacturing businesses that are well suited to PCC's core competencies: enhancing efficiency and reducing costs in the manufacturing of complex metal components.
 
                "We plan to extend our relentless drive for operational excellence and cost reductions to SPS's operations," said Donegan. "The combination of the two companies provides significant opportunities to enhance efficiencies, cost savings and processes.  Consistent with PCC's proven track record of attacking costs and increasing its market reach, the combined company gives us an additional avenue for continued growth.
 
                "In addition, the acquisition will further diversify our business by enhancing exposure to new markets including automotive applications, which represented approximately one-quarter of SPS's 2002 sales," added Donegan.
 
                SPS shareholders may elect to receive either cash or PCC stock as follows: $43.00 in cash per share, with the total cash consideration fixed at approximately $278 million, or at a fixed exchange ratio of 1.36 shares of PCC common stock, with a total stock consideration of approximately 8.8 million shares of PCC common stock, subject to pro-ration to achieve an aggregate split of half cash and half stock.  It is expected that SPS shareholders electing to receive PCC stock would receive shares on a tax-deferred basis.  Based on the average closing price for PCC shares over the last month, the transaction implies a per share value of $43.06 per SPS share and a premium of 41% to SPS's average closing price over the same period.
 
Accretive Transaction
 
                PCC expects the acquisition to be immediately accretive on an EPS basis through reductions in duplicate corporate overhead, and it expects synergies and operational cost savings to generate additional EPS accretion in PCC's fiscal 2005, the first full fiscal year of combined operations after closing.
 
                PCC expects to achieve annual savings of approximately $20 to $25 million in the first 12 to 15 months following closing, with cost savings ultimately reaching $30 to $35 million annually.  Not included in these estimates are additional revenue opportunities resulting from the combination of these two leaders in their respective markets.
 
                PCC plans to fund the cash portion of the transaction and refinance most of SPS's debt through a combination of new bank credit facilities and new senior notes.  After the close of the acquisition, PCC will remain conservatively capitalized and committed to reducing debt and maintaining a strong credit profile.
 
                "This transaction allows SPS's shareholders to own, under favorable terms, a financially sound and operationally competitive company that is well positioned for long-term growth and for the inevitable upturn in the markets we both serve," said John S. Thompson, SPS's chief executive officer. "SPS has served aerospace for much of its 100-year history and is well positioned on the next generation of aircraft. The combination of PCC and SPS creates a company with the resources and commitment to ensure that all our operations will continue to serve our current and future customers well for many years to come."
 
Integration Plans
 
                PCC has a record of successfully integrating new businesses and is developing detailed integration plans to realize the benefit of expected cost reductions and synergies.  After acquiring Wyman-Gordon for cash in November 1999, PCC achieved cost savings and increased the cash flow in that business well ahead of the anticipated schedule, which
 
allowed it to rapidly reduce debt after the acquisition.  Under a PCC operating team led by Donegan, PCC significantly improved Wyman-Gordon's operating margins, despite difficult aerospace industry conditions and a deflationary pricing environment.
 
                The complementary nature of the two companies' aerospace products is expected to enhance integration efforts and accelerate synergies.
 
                The SPS acquisition, which has been approved by the boards of directors of both companies, is expected to close during the fourth quarter of calendar 2003, which is PCC's third quarter of fiscal 2004.  Closing is subject to various approvals, including the approval of regulatory authorities and 80% of SPS's shareholders.  Completion of the acquisition is not subject to financing contingencies or a vote of PCC shareholders.
 
                Goldman, Sachs & Co. served as financial advisor for PCC.  Credit Suisse First Boston served as SPS's financial advisor.  Commitments for acquisition financing were provided by Bank of America.
 
 
 
PCC's revenues for its fiscal year ended March 30, 2003 were $2,117.2 million.  SPS's revenues for its fiscal year ended December 31, 2002 were $830.3 million.
