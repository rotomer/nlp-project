EXHIBIT 99.1
 
 
PORTLAND OR, November 18, 2003  
Precision Castparts Corp. (NYSE:PCP) has received favorable decisions from the competition authorities in France, Germany, and Romania for the acquisition of SPS Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:ST). 
 Previously, the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act expired without further extension.  As a result, all U.S. and international governmental and regulatory reviews required for the completion of the acquisition have been received.
 
The proposed acquisition remains subject to the satisfaction of closing conditions, including SPS shareholder approval. As previously announced, a date of December 2, 2003, has been established for a meeting of SPS shareholders to vote upon the merger agreement. 
December 2, 2003, has also been designated as the election deadline for merger consideration elections in connection with the acquisition.  If shareholder approval is obtained and all other conditions are met, the parties anticipate that the closing will occur at the close of business on December 9, 2003.
A more complete description of the voting and election procedures and the adjustment and pro-ration mechanisms applicable to elections are contained in the SPS proxy statement/prospectus dated October 16, 2003, and the election materials mailed to SPS shareholders, both of which SPS shareholders are urged to read carefully.
Copies of the proxy statement/prospectus and any related documents filed with the SEC can be obtained free of charge at the website maintained by the SEC at www.sec.gov.  
SPS shareholders may obtain additional copies of the merger consideration election materials by contacting The Bank of New York at 1-800-507-9357.
