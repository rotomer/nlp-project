EXHIBIT 99.1
 
 
JENKINTOWN, PA, November 26, 2003  SPS TECHNOLOGIES, INC. (NYSE: ST) announced today that it had entered into a memorandum of understanding with counsel to the plaintiffs in a lawsuit related to its proposed merger with Precision Castparts Corp. (NYSE: PCP). The lawsuit was originally filed on October 3, 2003, as a class action complaint in the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County Pennsylvania, naming as defendants SPS, PCC and each member of the SPS Board of Directors. The lawsuit was subsequently re-filed as a shareholder derivative action on November 10, 2003.
 
Under the terms of the memorandum, the parties have agreed, subject to approval by the court, to enter into a settlement with respect to all claims raised by the plaintiffs in the lawsuit. If the court approves the settlement as contemplated in the memorandum, the lawsuit will be dismissed. The terms of the settlement require additional disclosure to be made concerning the proposed merger. This disclosure is contained in a current report on Form 8-K filed by SPS today with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This disclosure should be read in conjunction with the proxy statement/prospectus filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and mailed to SPS shareholders, including the documents incorporated by reference into the proxy statement/prospectus. You may obtain copies of the proxy statement/prospectus and other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, free of charge, at the SEC's website (www.sec.gov).
 
The parties also agreed that the plaintiffs will be paid attorneys' fees and costs in the amount of $300,000 to be paid by SPS, subject to approval by the court. There will be no other settlement payment by SPS. There can be no assurance, however, that the court will approve the proposed settlement or that the final settlement will be under the same terms as those contemplated in the memorandum.
 
The proposed merger remains subject to the satisfaction of closing conditions, including SPS shareholder approval. As previously announced, a meeting of SPS shareholders to vote upon the merger agreement is scheduled for December 2, 2003. If shareholder approval is obtained, and all other conditions are met, the parties anticipate that the closing of the merger will occur at the close of business on December 9, 2003.
 
Forward-Looking Statements
 
This document contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the "safe harbor" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements regarding the settlement of the shareholder litigation related to the pending merger and the subsequent completion of the merger. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. These risks include the ability to obtain court approval of the proposed settlement, the ability to obtain necessary shareholder approval of the merger, the ability to satisfy the
 
other conditions to closing of the merger, and the other risks that are described from time to time in SPS's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 

EXHIBIT 99.2
 
The following disclosure should be read in conjunction with the proxy statement/prospectus filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and mailed to SPS shareholders, including the documents incorporated by reference into the proxy statement/prospectus.  You may obtain copies of the proxy statement/prospectus and other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, free of charge, at the SEC's website (www.sec.gov).
 
Set forth below for each director and executive officer of SPS are the number of in-the-money option shares vested and the number of in-the-money option shares that will be accelerated in connection with the merger based on stock options outstanding as of September 26, 2003.  The amounts listed below should be read in conjunction with the stock option table and aggregate settlement amounts disclosed on pages 11 and 57 of the proxy statement/prospectus.
 - 
                 
 
 
As discussed on pages 11 and 58 of the proxy statement/prospectus, if certain severance payments are determined to be excess parachute payments under Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code, then the amount payable to the applicable executive will include an additional gross-up amount payment so that, after payment of the applicable excise tax and all income and excise taxes imposed on the reimbursement and gross-up payments, such executive will retain approximately the same net after-tax amounts that he or she would have retained if there were no excise tax.  The executives and non-corporate executives listed below may be entitled to receive gross-up payments depending on the occurrence of certain future events.  The estimated gross-up payments set forth below were calculated as of the date of the merger agreement and are subject to change depending on, among other factors, the timing of the completion of the merger, fluctuations in interest rates and the ultimate retention by PCC of any non-corporate executives.

EXHIBIT 99.4
 
 
PORTLAND OR, December 3, 2003  In connection with the proposed acquisition of SPS Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:ST) by Precision Castparts Corp. (NYSE:PCP), the preliminary results of merger consideration elections made by SPS shareholders are:
 
Elections for 13,443,821 shares, or approximately 98.6% of the outstanding SPS shares, were received by the exchange agent prior to the election deadline;
 - 
                 
105,299 shares elected to receive cash; and
 - 
                 
13,338,522 shares elected to receive PCC common stock.
 - 
                 
 
The deadline for submitting an election was 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on December 2, 2003.
 
All elections are subject to adjustment to ensure that 50% of the outstanding shares of SPS common stock will be converted into the right to receive cash and 50% of the outstanding shares of SPS common stock will be converted into the right to receive shares of PCC common stock if the acquisition is completed.  As a result, an SPS shareholder may not receive the exact form of consideration elected, and the ability of an SPS shareholder to receive the form of consideration elected will depend on the final results of the elections made by other SPS shareholders and the actual number of shares of SPS common stock outstanding immediately prior to the closing.
 
Copies of the proxy statement/prospectus and any related documents filed with the SEC can be obtained free of charge at the website maintained by the SEC at www.sec.gov.
A more complete description of the adjustment and pro-ration mechanisms applicable to elections is contained in the SPS proxy statement/prospectus dated October 16, 2003, and the election materials previously mailed to SPS shareholders, both of which SPS shareholders are urged to read carefully. 
 
The proposed acquisition remains subject to the satisfaction of closing conditions.  If all conditions to the closing are met, the parties anticipate that the closing will occur on December 9, 2003.

Exhibit 99.5
 
 
PORTLAND OR, December 4, 2003  As previously announced, in connection with the proposed acquisition of SPS Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:ST) by Precision Castparts Corp. (NYSE:PCP), the preliminary results of merger consideration elections made by SPS shareholders were:
 
Elections for 13,443,821 shares, or approximately 98.26% of the outstanding SPS shares, were received by the exchange agent prior to the election deadline;
 - 
                 
105,299 shares elected to receive cash; and
 - 
                 
13,338,522 shares elected to receive PCC common stock.
 - 
                 
 
Of the 13,443,821 shares for which elections were received by the exchange agent, 3,171,958 shares were delivered subject to notices of guaranteed delivery.  Accordingly, the final election results could change depending upon the timely delivery of those shares.
 
the approximate merger consideration to be received by SPS shareholders would be as follows:
Based on the preliminary election results and assuming confirmation of effectiveness of elections and receipt of guaranteed deliveries,
 
SPS shareholders making an effective election to receive cash would receive all of their merger consideration in cash;
 - 
                 
SPS shareholders making an effective election to receive stock would receive approximately 51% of their merger consideration in shares of PCC common stock and 49% of their merger consideration in cash, as a result of pro-ration; and
 - 
                 
Non-electing shareholders will be deemed to have elected cash for 50% of their SPS shares and stock for 50% of their SPS shares, which means that due to pro-ration, they would receive approximately 75% of their merger consideration in cash and 25% of their merger consideration in shares of PCC common stock.
 - 
                 
 
The actual merger consideration will be computed using the formula in the merger agreement and will be based on, among other things, the final results of the elections process and the actual number of shares of SPS common stock outstanding immediately prior to the closing.
 
Copies of the proxy statement/prospectus and any related documents filed with the SEC can be obtained free of charge at the website maintained by the SEC at www.sec.gov.
A more complete description of the adjustment and pro-ration mechanisms applicable to elections is contained in the SPS proxy statement/prospectus dated October 16, 2003, and the election materials previously mailed to SPS shareholders, both of which SPS shareholders are urged to read carefully. 
 
The proposed acquisition remains subject to the satisfaction of closing conditions.  If all conditions to the closing are met, the parties anticipate that the closing will occur on December 9, 2003.
