Item 2.
Acquisition or Disposition of Assets
                                  
 
On December 9, 2003, Precision Castparts Corp. ("PCC") completed the acquisition of SPS Technologies, Inc., a supplier of fasteners and other metal products to the aerospace, automotive and general industrial and other markets. Under the terms of the merger agreement signed on August 16, 2003, PCC issued an aggregate of 9,302,283 shares of PCC common stock and paid $294.1 million in cash (excluding cash in lieu of fractional shares of PCC common stock) for all outstanding shares of SPS. PCC also assumed approximately $181.0 million of SPS's existing indebtedness with a fair value of $206.6 million.
 
The aggregate purchase consideration for the acquisition was determined based upon several factors, including evaluations of SPS, the market price of SPS shares, and negotiations with management and directors of SPS. The financing for the cash portion of the purchase consideration was funded through borrowings under PCC's new unsecured, syndicated credit facility with Bank of America, N.A., as agent, borrowings under PCC's accounts receivable securitization, and proceeds from the issuance of $200.0 million principal amount of PCC's 5.60% Senior Notes due 2013.
 
Upon closing of the acquisition, SPS merged with and into PCC's wholly-owned subsidiary, Star Acquisition LLC. Star survived the merger and was renamed SPS Technologies, LLC. PCC intends that the surviving company will continue to operate the SPS business following the acquisition.

Pro Forma Combined Statements of Income and Balance Sheet
 
The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements and explanatory notes give effect to the merger with SPS and the completion of PCC's financing transactions related to the merger.  PCC acquired all of SPS's common stock in the merger and accounted for the transaction as a purchase business combination.
 
In accordance with Article 11 of Regulation S-X under the Securities Act of 1933, the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of income for the year ended March 30, 2003 and the six months ended September 28, 2003 and an unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of September 28, 2003 give effect to the merger (treated as an acquisition of SPS) and the completion of PCC's financing transactions related to the merger.  The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements were prepared based upon historical financial statements of PCC and SPS.  Additionally, the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements reflect certain statement of income and balance sheet reclassifications made to conform SPS's presentations to those of PCC.  The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements should be read in conjunction with:
 
PCC's reissued historical audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 30, 2003 included in PCC's current report on Form 8-K filed on December 2, 2003, PCC's Annual Report on Form 10-K, as amended, for the fiscal year ended March 30, 2003 and PCC's unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as of September 28, 2003 and for the six months ended September 28, 2003 included in PCC's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 28, 2003, as amended; and
 - 
                 
 
SPS's historical audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2002 included in its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, its unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the three months ended June 30, 2003 included in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2003, and its unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2003 and for the three months ended September 30, 2003 included in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2003.
 - 
                 
 
We prepared the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of income using the historical consolidated statements of income for both PCC and SPS assuming the merger and related transactions had each occurred on April 1, 2002.  We prepared the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of income for the year ended March 30, 2003 by combining the historical audited consolidated statement of income of PCC for the year ended March 30, 2003 and the historical audited statement of consolidated operations of SPS for the year ended December 30, 2002.  We prepared the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of income for the six months ended September 28, 2003 by combining the historical unaudited consolidated statement of income of PCC for the six-month period ended September 28, 2003, the historical unaudited statement of consolidated operations of SPS for the three-month period ended June 30, 2003 and the historical unaudited statement of consolidated operations of SPS for the three-month period ended September 30, 2003.  The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of income do not include the historical unaudited statement of consolidated operations of SPS for the three-month period ended March 31, 2003, which reflects net sales of $181.5 million and net income from continuing operations of $4.9 million.  Additionally, the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of income have been adjusted to remove from continuing operations the operating results of certain of SPS's former operations that were classified as held for sale upon completion of the merger.  The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of income give effect to the costs associated with financing the proposed merger, including interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs associated with PCC's financing transactions related to the proposed merger, and the impact of other purchase accounting adjustments.
We prepared the unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet by combining PCC's historical unaudited consolidated balance sheet as of September 28, 2003 and SPS's historical unaudited consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2003, adjusted to reflect the merger and the completion of PCC's financing transactions related to the merger, as if each had occurred at September 28, 2003.
 
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements are presented for illustrative purposes only. These financial statements are not necessarily indicative of the operating results or financial position that would have occurred if the merger had been completed at the beginning of the periods or the dates indicated, nor are they necessarily indicative of any future operating results or financial position.  The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements do not include any adjustments related to profit improvements, potential cost savings or one-time charges which may result from the merger.

Adjustments to reflect only the ongoing operating results of SPS:
(1)
         
 
 
Adjustments to eliminate SPS sales to PCC:
(2)
         
 
 
Adjustments to record amortization expense on acquired intangible assets and revise depreciation expense based on the fair market value of acquired fixed assets:
(3)
         
 
 
Reclassification to SPS's historical financial statements to conform to PCC's presentation:
(4)
         
 
 
Interest expense was adjusted to reflect the following:
(5)
         
 
 
Interest expense on new debt as follows:
 
 
The average interest rate on the senior bank credit facilities was computed using LIBOR of 1.19% plus a spread of 125 basis points.  The average interest rate on the new senior notes was computed using the coupon rate of 5.60%.  The average interest rate on the private notes represents fair market value at the date of the transaction.  The average interest rate on the receivables securitization was computed using LIBOR of 1.19% plus a spread of 31 basis points.  An increase in interest rates of 12.5 basis points with respect to the new debt would decrease pro forma net income by approximately $0.5 million for the fiscal year ended March 30, 2003.
 
The provision for income taxes was adjusted to reflect the income tax expense (benefit) associated with the pro forma adjustments to interest expense by applying a 35.0% rate to the SPS interest expense eliminations and a 35.0% rate to the interest and fees associated with the new debt issuance.

The purchase price adjustments reflect the issuance of 9,302,283 shares of PCC common stock to SPS shareholders on December 9, 2003.
