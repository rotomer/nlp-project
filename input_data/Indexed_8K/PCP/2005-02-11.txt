Amended Credit Agreement
 
On January 27, 2005 the Registrant amended its bank credit facility (Bank of America Credit Agreement dated as of December 9, 2003) to reduce the spread applicable to LIBOR borrowings.  The applicable spreads, as revised, range from 0.625% to 1.75%, depending upon credit ratings received from Moody's and S & P.  Based on current credit ratings, interest rates on borrowings under the amended bank credit facility will be reduced from LIBOR + 1.25% to LIBOR + 1.00%.  The amendment also revised the amortization schedule of principal repayments on the $300 million term loan included in the bank credit facility.  The following schedule provides the Registrant's aggregate long-term debt maturities in each of the next five fiscal years as previously reported and as revised to reflect this amendment:
