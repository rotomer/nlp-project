ITEM 1.01.  MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT
 
On October 14, 2005, the Company entered into an amended and restated bank credit facility with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, lender, swing line lender and letter of credit issuer, and the other lenders from time to time party thereto.  The amended facility consists of a five-year, $1.0 billion revolving loan (with a $250 million increase option) maturing in October 2010 and includes a swing line facility and a letter of credit facility.  The facility prior to amendment consisted of a $300.0 million term loan and a $400.0 million revolving loan which matured in December 2008.  At October 2, 2005, the term loan had outstanding borrowings of $288.8 million and there was no outstanding borrowings under the revolving loan.  On the effective date of the amended facility the outstanding principal balance of the term loan was converted to a revolving loan under the amended facility.  Borrowings under the amended facility bear interest at either LIBOR plus applicable spreads, which range from 0.30% to 1.00% depending on credit ratings received from Moody's and S&P, or the Base Rate (as defined in the amended facility) at the Company's option.  The amended facility also has a facility fee, which ranges from 0.10% to 0.325% of the aggregate commitments under the facility depending on the Company's credit ratings, and a utilization fee of 0.125% on all outstanding loans if the aggregate outstanding loans equal or exceed 50% of the aggregate commitments under the facility.  The amended facility contains various standard representations and warrantics, events of default and financial and other covenants which are substantially the same, but no less favorable to the Company, as the events of default and covenants contained in the Company's previous facility, including maintenance of minimum net worth, interest coverage ratio and leverage ratio.  The amended facility is guaranteed by the Company's material domestic subsidiaries.  A copy of the amended facility is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Lender's Lending Office.  All payments received by the Administrative Agent after 2:00 p.m. shall be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue.  If any payment to be made by the Borrower shall come due on a day other than a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next following Business Day, and such extension of time shall be reflected in computing interest or fees, as the case may be.

If any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Eurodollar Rate Loans, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurodollar Rate, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent, any obligation of such Lender to make or continue Eurodollar Rate Loans or to convert Base Rate Loans to Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be suspended until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist.  Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all Eurodollar Rate Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans, either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans.  Upon any such prepayment or
conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted.  Each Lender agrees to designate a different Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for such notice and will not, in the good faith judgment of such Lender, otherwise be materially disadvantageous to such Lender.
 
Inability to Determine Rates. 
3.03
                       
If the Required Lenders determine that for any reason adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the Eurodollar Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurodollar Rate Loan, or that the Eurodollar Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurodollar Rate Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and each Lender.  Thereafter, the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent (upon the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice.  Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein.
 
Increased Cost and Reduced Return; Capital Adequacy; Reserves on Eurodollar Rate Loans.
3.04
                       
 
(a)
                                 
If any Lender determines that as a result of the introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation of any Law, or such Lender's compliance therewith, there shall be any increase in the cost to such Lender of agreeing to make or making, funding or maintaining Eurodollar Rate Loans or (as the case may be) issuing or participating in Letters of Credit, or a reduction in the amount received or receivable by such Lender in connection with any of the foregoing (excluding for purposes of this subsection (a) any such increased costs or reduction in amount resulting from (i) Taxes or Other Taxes (as to which shall govern), (ii) changes in the basis of taxation of overall net income or overall gross income by the United States or any foreign jurisdiction or any political subdivision of either thereof under the Laws of which such Lender is organized or has its Lending Office, and (iii) reserve requirements contemplated by ), then from time to time upon demand of such Lender (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent), the Borrower shall pay to such Lender such additional amounts as will compensate such Lender for such increased cost or reduction.
Section 3.01
Section 3.04(c)
 
(b)
                                
If any Lender determines that the introduction of any Law regarding capital adequacy or any change therein or in the interpretation thereof, or compliance by such Lender (or its Lending Office) therewith, has the effect of reducing the rate of return on the capital of such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender as a consequence of such Lender's obligations hereunder (taking into consideration its policies with respect to capital adequacy and such Lender's desired return on capital), then from time to time upon demand of such Lender (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent), the Borrower shall pay to such Lender such additional amounts as will compensate such Lender for such reduction.
 
(c)
                                 
The Borrower shall pay to each Lender, as long as such Lender shall be required to maintain reserves with respect to liabilities or assets consisting of or including Eurocurrency funds or deposits (currently known as "Eurocurrency liabilities"), additional interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Eurodollar Rate Loan equal to the actual costs of such reserves
allocated to such Loan by such Lender (as determined by such Lender in good faith, which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error), which shall be due and payable on each date on which interest is payable on such Loan, the Borrower shall have received at least 15 days' prior notice (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of such additional interest from such Lender.  If a Lender fails to give notice 15 days prior to the relevant Interest Payment Date, such additional interest shall be due and payable 15 days from receipt of such notice.

Funding Losses. 
3.05
                       
Upon demand of any Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) from time to time, the Borrower shall promptly compensate such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense incurred by it as a result of:
 
(a)
                                 
any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise); or
 
(b)
                                
any failure by the Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to make a Loan) to prepay, borrow, continue or convert any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan on the date or in the amount notified by the Borrower;
 
including any loss of anticipated profits and any loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such Loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained.  The Borrower shall also pay any customary administrative fees charged by such Lender in connection with the foregoing.
 
For purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Borrower to the Lenders under this , each Lender shall be deemed to have funded each Eurodollar Rate Loan made by it at the Eurodollar Rate for such Loan by a matching deposit or other borrowing in the London interbank eurodollar market for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such Eurodollar Rate Loan was in fact so funded.

The Restricted Lender making such assignment will be entitled to compensation for any expenses or other amounts which would be owing to such Restricted Lender pursuant to any indemnification provision hereof (including, if applicable, ) as if the Borrower had prepaid the Loans of such Lender (and terminated its Revolving Credit Commitment, if applicable) rather than such Restricted Lender having assigned its interest hereunder.  Notwithstanding any foregoing provision of this , the provisions hereof will not apply to any event or occurrence that would otherwise give rise to its application if such event or occurrence, in the reasonable judgment of the Administrative Agent, is one of general application that affects all or a majority of the Lenders.
