MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT
 
On November 17, 2005, the Company entered into Amendment No. 1 to its Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of October 14, 2005 (the Credit Agreement').  The amendment revises Section 6.01 (b) of the Credit Agreement to extend the date for required delivery of the Company's financial statements for the quarter ended October 2, 2005 to December 15, 2005.  This extension is intended to accommodate the Company's delay in finalizing its financial statements and filing its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended October 2, 2005, as previously disclosed in the Company's Form 12b-25 filed on November 15, 2005.   The lenders also waived any potential default under the Credit Agreement resulting from the effect of the matters disclosed in the Form 12b-25 under certain other debt agreements to which the Company is a party.  A copy of the amendment is attached as Exhibit 10.1.
