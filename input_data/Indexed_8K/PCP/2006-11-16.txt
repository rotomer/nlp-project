On November 14, 2006, the Board of Directors of Precision Castparts Corp. (Company) approved a change to the Company's non-employee director compensation program. As compensation for service on the Board and its committees, non-employee directors will receive the following fees to the extent applicable to the individual director: (i) an annual cash retainer of $60,000 for board service; (ii) an annual cash retainer of $10,000 for service on the audit committee and an annual cash retainer of $5,000 for service on a committee other than the audit committee; and (iii) a $10,000 annual fee for service as chair of the audit committee and a $5,000 annual fee for service as chair of a committee other than the audit committee. The payment of meeting fees for board and committee members is discontinued. The cash fees are payable in four quarterly increments in arrears subject to deferral elections. These changes are effective for the Company's third quarter of fiscal 2007. In addition, the amount of deferred stock units awarded annually and payable on cessation of board service will be increased to a value of $100,000. This increase will be effective for the grant occurring after the Company's annual meeting of shareholders in 2007.
