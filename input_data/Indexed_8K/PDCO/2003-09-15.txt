ITEM 2. ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION OF ASSETS
 
On September 12, 2003, Patterson Dental Company ("Patterson" or " the Company") completed its acquisition of AbilityOne Products Corp.("AbilityOne"), the world's leading distributor of rehabilitative supplies and non-wheelchair assistive patient products to the physical and occupational therapy markets. The acquisition is valued at approximately $575 million and is debt financed. With forecasted sales of approximately $220 million for calendar year 2003, Chicago-based AbilityOne delivers the industry's largest and most comprehensive range of distributed and self-manufactured rehabilitation products to a global customer base serving acute care hospitals, nursing homes, rehabilitation clinics, dealers and schools. AbilityOne offers over 15,000 rehabilitation and assistive products from more than 1,500 suppliers. AbilityOne's catalog is recognized as the gold standard in its marketplace, and its direct sales force is the largest in the industry. The acquisition of AbilityOne represents a logical extension of Patterson's value-added, specialty distribution strategy into a large new market that is expected to grow due to favorable demographic trends. In addition, this market is highly fragmented, which provides an opportunity for consolidation, and it is characterized by a low cost of goods for the customer.
 
AbilityOne will be operated as a wholly owned subsidiary of Patterson. The current management team will remain with AbilityOne. This is the same management team that has successfully built AbilityOne to its current state. In connection with the acquisition, Howard A. Schwartz, Chief Executive Officer of AbilityOne's operating subsidiary, and Edward L. Donnelly, its Chief Operating Officer, entered into amendments to their existing employment agreements, which include three-year extensions of employment and provisions regarding non-competition and non-solicitation of key individuals, suppliers and others.
 
Peter L. Frechette, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Patterson, and David K. Beecken, a Director of Patterson and the Managing Director of Beecken Petty & Company, were direct and indirect owners of the stock of AbilityOne. Between May 2001 and March 2002, Mr. Frechette acquired a direct interest in AbilityOne's common stock and Class A Preferred Stock and was granted an option to purchase common stock of AbilityOne. Such interests represented less than a 1% interest of each class of AbilityOne's outstanding securities. Mr. Frechette also served as a member of AbilityOne's board of directors until December 20, 2002. Between September 2000 and March 2002, HEP Investors I, LLC, an investment entity with which Beecken Petty & Co. is affiliated, acquired AbilityOne's common stock, Class A Preferred Stock and warrants for the purchase of AbilityOne's common stock. Such interests represented an approximate 20% interest of each class of AbilityOne's outstanding shares. In September 2000, Beecken Petty & Co. was part of a group that purchased AbilityOne from BISSELL, Inc. A principal of Beecken Petty & Co. has served on the board of directors of AbilityOne since 2000. Prior to consideration of the acquisition of AbilityOne, Mr. Frechette and Mr. Beecken fully disclosed their interests in AbilityOne to the board of directors of Patterson and abstained from voting on the transaction. In connection with its acquisition of AbilityOne, Patterson received a fairness opinion from Banc of America Securities LLC that the acquisition was fair to Patterson from a financial point of view.
 
The Company financed the acquisition of AbilityOne through borrowings under a $500 million Bridge Credit Agreement dated September 12, 2003, with Banc One Mezzanine and additional lenders, and issued $4.5 million of three-year 0.5% convertible debentures of Patterson to two shareholders of AbilityOne.
 
The Agreement and Plan of Merger Among Patterson Dental Company, Retep, Inc., AbilityOne Products Corp. and AbilityOne II, L.L.C., As Representative of the Company Stockholders ("the Agreement") is included as Exhibit 2 and is incorporated into this Item 2 by reference.
 
About AbilityOne Products Corp.
 
Certain information of a non-historical nature contained in this Form 8-K includes forward-looking statements. Reference is made to Factors that May Affect Future Operating Results of the Company, for a discussion of certain factors which could in the future affect actual operating results of the Company and AbilityOne which could differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements.
 
General
 
AbilityOne, headquartered in Bolingbrook, Illinois, is the world's leading distributor of rehabilitative medical supplies and non-wheelchair assistive products.
 
AbilityOne believes it delivers the most comprehensive range of distributed and self-manufactured rehabilitation products to health care professionals globally. AbilityOne's mission is to provide health care professionals and their patients with
 
Table of Contents
access to products which improve peoples' lives by helping them to attain their highest achievable level of independence, safety and comfort.
 
AbilityOne occupies a desirable competitive position in the health care distribution sector by serving as the gateway through which over 15,000 rehabilitation products originating from more than 1,500 suppliers / manufacturers are sold to a diverse customer base with an emphasis on physical therapists ("PTs") and occupational therapists ("OTs").
 
AbilityOne offers its customers a "one-stop shop" through what it believes to be the most comprehensive catalog in the industry, the largest direct sales force and the category's most efficient customer service and distribution operations. AbilityOne's major channels of distribution are acute care hospitals, long-term care facilities, rehabilitation clinics, dealers and schools. In addition, Patterson believes AbilityOne's reputation, global market presence and highly transferable business model will facilitate entry into new markets.
 
AbilityOne offers a wide range of differentiated, non-invasive products and expertise to users and their health care providers. AbilityOne recognizes that different customer segments have very different economic, product, distribution channel requirements and treatment goals. AbilityOne proactively attempts to anticipate and respond to the diverse needs of its customers, while focusing on niches, worldwide, where its capabilities, reputation and customer partnerships can result in a competitive advantage. AbilityOne's goal is to become its customers' first choice for rehabilitation medical supplies and assistive products in each of its chosen markets.
 
AbilityOne is generally known to its customers as Sammons Preston Rolyan, in the U.S. and Canada, and Homecraft, in the remainder of the world. The Sammons Preston Rolyan and Homecraft business models, which AbilityOne employs in the U.S., Canada and the U.K., have successfully driven revenue growth and profitability. A core element of Sammons Preston Rolyan's strategy is to maintain the most comprehensive single catalog of rehabilitation products and supplies. Customers are supported by a well-trained team of customer service representatives who employ customized software to respond to diverse customer requirements in a rapid and thorough manner.
 
Sammons Preston Rolyan's national accounts group works closely with AbilityOne's sales force to meet the changing needs of its expanding account base. The product management group works closely with customers, suppliers and the sales force to evaluate new products for inclusion in Sammons Preston Rolyan's product offering. Sammons Preston Rolyan adds new products to the catalog each year.
 
AbilityOne is highly diversified with no single product, customer or purchasing group representing a significant percentage of AbilityOne's total revenue. In addition, given the relatively small average and median order size (approximately $225 and $70, respectively), AbilityOne's products often do not represent a major expense category for its customers.
 
In March 2002, AbilityOne completed the acquisition of the Smith & Nephew Rehabilitation ("SNR") division of Smith & Nephew plc, and in doing so, acquired the Rolyan, Homecraft and Kinetec brand names. AbilityOne added 3,500 additional products through the SNR acquisition, as well as a broad array of other brand names and proprietary products. AbilityOne's acquisition of SNR combined the two leading distributors of rehabilitative medical supplies to create the only "one-stop shop" in the industry. AbilityOne manufactures or has exclusively manufactured for it products representing approximately 30% of its total revenue and purchases products representing the remaining 70%. AbilityOne derives approximately 80% of its revenue in North America.
 
Industry Background
 
AbilityOne believes the rehabilitative medical supplies and assistive products industry is approximately $3.4 billion in the U.S. and $4.7 billion worldwide and is expected to grow 6%8% over the next several years. Industry growth is driven by strong growth in the physical and occupational therapy markets and favorable demographic trends associated
 
Table of Contents
with the aging of the baby-boom generation. AbilityOne does not compete in wheelchairs, a market estimated to be approximately $900 million in the U.S. ($1.3 billion worldwide). Therefore, AbilityOne's addressable market (defined as the collective market for products sold by AbilityOne) is approximately $2.5 billion in the U.S. and $3.4 billion worldwide. AbilityOne believes that it has an industry leading market share of approximately 5% in a highly fragmented rehabilitation and assistive products market.
 
Demographic, industry and legislative trends are expected to drive growth within the rehabilitative and assistive products industry over the long-term.
 
Favorable Demographics
 
Favorable demographic trends such as extended life expectancy, active lifestyles and a general willingness to spend discretionary income on health care and well being, are expected to contribute to increased demand for products distributed by AbilityOne. Specifically, the aging baby-boomer population, together with their increased disposable income and desires for independence, will fuel product purchases to assist with the frailties associated with old age and provide sustained sales growth.
 
According to the U.S. Department of Commerce's Technology Assessment of the U.S. Assistive Technology Industry published in February 2003, growth in the number of older people in the U.S., Europe and Asia, suggests that there will be a strong and steady increase in the demand for a broad spectrum of assistive technology products over the next several years, many of which are sold by AbilityOne.
 
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the 65 or older population will double in the U.S. by 2030 to approximately 70 million, or one in every five Americans. Beginning in 2010, when the first of the baby boomers turns 65, through 2030, the number of people in the 65 and over age group should grow at nearly four times the rate of the overall population. During 1990-2010, the compounded annual growth rate of the elderly population should grow at 2.5 times the rate of the general population. Current trends indicate that this age group represents the majority of home and community-based health care patients. Similarly, the U.S. Census data predicts a doubling in the over 85 year-old population from 2000 to 2030.
 
The aging of the population is a revenue growth driver because approximately 10% of people over the age of 65 and approximately 50% of people over the age of 85, need assistance with everyday activities. AbilityOne believes it is well positioned to reap the benefits of the aging population by providing aids to daily living, namely dressing devices, toileting, dining, bathing aids and grooming devices, which promote greater patient independence, improved patient responsibility and improved responsiveness to treatment.
 
Increasing Number of PTs and OTs, AbilityOne's Primary User Groups
 
According to the U.S. Department of Labor Occupational Outlook Handbook, there were approximately 132,000 PTs in the U.S. in 2000. Approximately two-thirds of PTs were employed in either hospitals or offices of physical therapists. The remaining one-third of PTs was employed in home health agencies, outpatient rehabilitation clinics, physician offices and nursing homes. The demand for PTs is expected to remain strong largely driven by the (i) increase in the number of individuals with disabilities or limited function requiring therapy services; (ii) rapidly growing elderly population which is particularly vulnerable to chronic and debilitating conditions that require therapeutic services; (iii) baby-boom generation which is entering the prime age for heart attacks and strokes, increasing the demand for cardiac and physical rehabilitation; (iv) advances in medical technology which permit treatment of more disabling conditions; and (v) widespread interest in health promotion.
 
Another important driver of the growth in the PT market is the growing need for rehabilitative products resulting from the increasing frequency of reconstructive implant procedures, including hip and knee replacements. The worldwide reconstructive implant market is currently in excess of $5.0 billion and expected to grow at 7%-8% annually. This growth trajectory is largely driven by favorable demographics, as patient populations are expanding at both ends of the age spectrum. Among seniors, more active lifestyles and longer life expectancies are responsible for the increasing frequency of reconstructive implants. Younger
 
Table of Contents
patients are opting for reconstructive implants over less invasive alternatives due to improved and longer lasting implant technology. AbilityOne is well positioned to reap the benefits of the growth in reconstructive implants, by providing orthopedic soft goods, namely Continuous Passive Motion machines and splinting, which are critical to post-operatory rehabilitation.
 
According to the U.S. Department of Labor Occupational Outlook Handbook, there were approximately 78,000 OTs in the U.S. in 2000. The majority of OTs work in hospitals, including many in rehabilitation and psychiatric hospitals. The remaining OTs work in outpatient occupational therapy offices and clinics, schools, home health agencies, nursing homes, community mental health centers, adult day care programs, job training services and residential care facilities. The demand for OTs is expected to remain strong, largely driven by the (i) increase in the number of individuals with disabilities or limited function requiring therapy services; (ii) baby-boom generation's movement into middle age, a period when the incidence of heart attack and stroke increases; (iii) rapidly growing population for the 75 years of age and above segment, an age group that suffers from a high incidence of disabling conditions; and (iv) advances in medical technology enable more patients with critical problems to survive.
 
No Direct Reimbursement
 
The rehabilitative medical supplies and non-wheelchair assistive products that AbilityOne offers are generally not subject to reimbursement pressures from Medicare and Medicaid. AbilityOne does not engage in third-party billing and collection activities, but sells to customers, including dealers, who provide this service.
 
As part of the Balanced Budget Relief Act of 1997, on September 1, 2003, Congress imposed a Medicare outpatient therapy cap, or an annual allowance of $1,500 per patient for outpatient rehabilitative therapy services such as physical therapy, occupational therapy and speech-language pathology. Given AbilityOne's concentration in the inpatient therapy arena, AbilityOne believes the cap's effect on AbilityOne's financial results will be immaterial.
 
Highly Fragmented Industry
 
The rehabilitative medical supplies and non-wheelchair assistive products industry is highly fragmented. No one manufacturer, distributor or customer represents a significant portion of AbilityOne's revenue. There is a growing trend toward centralized corporate purchasing. In turn, this has fueled demand for suppliers with a wider range of product offerings, which facilitates national buying strategies. AbilityOne believes that as a "one-stop shop", it is well positioned to address this trend.
 
AbilityOne's Strategy
 
AbilityOne's objective is to be the customers' first choice for rehab medical supplies and non-wheelchair assistive products in each of its chosen markets.
 
The following are the principal elements of AbilityOne's Strategy:
 
Expand the Product Offering
 
AbilityOne currently offers its customers a "one-stop shop" for products through its industry-leading catalog with over 15,000 items, focused primarily on physical and occupational therapy products. AbilityOne adds new products each year to its ever-expanding catalog and is committed to doing so long-term. Consistent with AbilityOne's current product offering, some of these new products are branded, exclusive or self-manufactured.
 
AbilityOne recognizes that different customer groups have very different economic, product, distribution channel requirements and treatment goals. AbilityOne proactively attempts to anticipate and flexibly respond to the diverse needs of its customers, while focusing on niches, worldwide, where its capabilities, reputation and customer partnerships can result in a competitive advantage. As such, AbilityOne foresees an on-going evolution of its product offerings to meet the ever-increasing demands of its diverse customer segments.
 
Table of Contents
Increase Customer Penetration / Add New Customers
 
AbilityOne believes it is well positioned to continue to expand in its core markets. AbilityOne's market presence, clinical understanding and close customer relationships allow AbilityOne to anticipate and flexibly respond to the diverse needs of its customers. AbilityOne believes its market knowledge, strong vendor relationships and manufacturing capabilities will continue to drive the delivery of value-added solutions through the continual enrichment of its product mix. Additionally, AbilityOne believes it broad portfolio of national accounts and commitment to expand its sales force will enhance AbilityOne's growth and penetration within its current and new customer base.
 
Increase Global Presence
 
In connection with the SNR transaction, AbilityOne acquired the principal aids to daily living distributor in the UK, Homecraft. AbilityOne is leveraging this platform to accelerate international expansion, in terms of both product lines and geographic regions. Since the SNR transaction, AbilityOne has added over 300 pages of new products to the Homecraft catalog. Homecraft and Kinetec brought with them a proven capability to re-source products at very favorable costs and at high levels of quality from China, which has resulted in meaningful cost savings. AbilityOne's management team believes AbilityOne's business model is transferable to other countries, and is using Homecraft to cultivate new relationships through an enhanced product array, sales effort, distribution capability and catalog expertise.
 
Focus on Profit Enhancement
 
AbilityOne's existing infrastructure is scaleable without significant investment requirements for the next few years. This allows AbilityOne to enjoy bottom-line growth in excess of top-line metrics. AbilityOne plans to continue its strategy of selective price increases where appropriate. Additionally, AbilityOne's proprietary products, which consist of self-manufactured products, products manufactured for AbilityOne and products sold through exclusive distribution arrangements, represent approximately 30% of total revenues. These items help to provide AbilityOne with a comprehensive range of rehabilitative medical supplies. AbilityOne believes that its performance culture, oriented toward continuous improvement and "best practices", will contribute to the achievement of greater productivity and operating income gains.
 
Acquisitions
 
AbilityOne operates in the highly fragmented rehabilitative medical supplies and non-wheelchair assistive products industry. AbilityOne's competition is generally regionally focused. AbilityOne intends to opportunistically pursue expansion opportunities in order to add products, customers and capabilities, which will further differentiate AbilityOne from its competition.
 
Entry Into New and Related Markets
 
AbilityOne plans to penetrate several new markets. Target markets with significant core business product overlap include chiropractic, podiatry, sports medicine and institutional activities / crafts. These markets are similar to AbilityOne's core business in that they are characterized by large patient volumes and heavy reliance on the course of treatment advice of the respective professional.
 
Sources of Supply
 
Among AbilityOne's core strengths is its ability to obtain premier products from vendors. AbilityOne purchases its products from over 1,500 suppliers / manufacturers. Although no single supplier accounted for more than 4% of AbilityOne's total purchases in 2002, AbilityOne frequently is the largest single customer of these manufacturers. Suppliers view the ability to distribute their products through Sammons Preston Rolyan and Homecraft very positively due to their reputation, longstanding industry-leading position, comprehensive catalogs, national account contracts, sales force presence and distribution capabilities. AbilityOne continually works at strengthening its supplier relationships through the introduction of supplier programs.
 
Table of Contents
Distribution and Sales
 
AbilityOne's distribution process centers around its ability to fill small unit size and small dollar amount orders. In the U.S., over 4,000 packages ship daily from four locations. The primary distribution center is located in Bolingbrook, IL, with certain high volume product also fulfilled by a third-party logistic company for west coast customers. Approximately 95% of the packages in the U.S. ship via UPS.
 
AbilityOne's call center operates from 7am  7pm Monday through Friday, processing in excess of 5,000 calls per day. Order entry capability from 7pm  7am from Monday through Friday and weekends exists through an offsite, third-party contractor with limited systems access. The combination of in-house staff, supplemented with contracted, third party services, provide customers with 24 hours a day / 7 days a week ordering capabilities. In addition, fax orders and EDI capabilities support the larger, more technologically advanced customers, dealers and hospital and long-term care facilities. While internet ordering capabilities currently exist, customer reception to ordering products via the internet is currently minimal, but growing.
 
Sammons Preston Rolyan's U.S. national accounts program is staffed by seasoned professionals who have developed a comprehensive portfolio of contracts. AbilityOne's U.S. national accounts group is comprised of a very experienced staff with average industry tenure of 15 years. Many have come from larger organizations and have managed multi-billion dollar corporate contract portfolios. AbilityOne's U.S. national accounts group has longstanding relationships with the key group purchasing organizations. Furthermore, the integrated Sammons Preston Rolyan organization has national contracts with all of the major groups within each market segment, including hospitals, nursing homes and dealers.
 
For many years, Sammons Preston and SNR had the only national sales forces in the U.S. dedicated to the clinical education and sale of products to institutionally based PTs and OTs. With the recent integration of SNR, AbilityOne's clinical presence and sales capability have been enhanced with a broader product offering and an unparalleled range of proprietary brands. The AbilityOne sales professionals, many whom are therapists, are located throughout the U.S. and Canada. These sales professionals have utilized the extensive product line and the comprehensive national contracts portfolio to establish direct sales to U.S. hospitals, nursing homes and rehab clinics. AbilityOne also distributes to national distributors and local dealers.
 
In addition to AbilityOne's sales professionals in the U.S., Sammons Preston Rolyan has specialty sales managers that focus on high opportunity product categories including pediatric seating and positioning, Continuous Passive Motion machines and tourniquet and cuffs.
 
Competition
 
AbilityOne believes it is a market leader in many of the product categories in which it competes. End users of rehabilitative medical supplies and assistive devices purchase approximately 65% of their products from dealers. National catalog companies supply the remaining 35%. Although end users, in aggregate, buy the majority of their products from dealers, dealers tend to be local or regional players that do not have the product breadth of AbilityOne. Consequently, AbilityOne supplies product not only to the end user directly in its capacity as a national catalog distributor, but also to many dealers, who can be practically thought of as customers rather than competitors.
 
Competitive Position and Barriers to Entry
 
AbilityOne's competitive position in the rehab medical supplies and non-wheelchair assistive products industry has created barriers to entry, making it difficult for potential new market entrants to compete effectively.
 
 
 
Table of Contents
 
 
 
As a result of AbilityOne's significant operating history and proven business model, competitors face obstacles in challenging AbilityOne's market position.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF ABILITYONE PRODUCTS CORP.'S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Pro Forma for SNR Acquisition)
 
The commentary that follows should be read in conjunction with AbilityOne's Financial Statements and the Notes to the Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report.
 
The following unaudited Pro Forma Summary Financial Information for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 are based on the historical financial statements of AbilityOne and Smith & Nephew Rehabilitation adjusted to give effect as if AbilityOne and SNR were combined at the beginning of the fiscal years.
 
Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2002 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2001 (Pro Forma for SNR Acquisition)
 
 
 
Table of Contents
Revenue increased 6.2% to $209.2 million in 2002 from $197.0 million in 2001. The increase in revenue was primarily driven by selective price increases from the legacy AbilityOne business, expanded product offering with the addition of more than 2,000 products into AbilityOne's catalogs, sales to new customers and increased penetration of existing customers. During 2002, AbilityOne launched pilot catalogs targeted at the sports medicine, institutional activities/crafts and chiropractic markets. Additionally, the SNR acquisition provided AbilityOne with a global presence, access to new markets and products and the opportunity to cross-sell products into existing accounts.
Revenue.
 
Revenue growth comparisons for 2002 versus 2001 do not accurately reflect AbilityOne's underlying performance primarily due to two factors. In 2002, sales to Smith & Nephew plc foreign affiliates declined as Smith & Nephew plc worked to streamline their inventory levels and reduce purchasing from SNR subsequent to its combination with AbilityOne. Additionally, revenue growth was negatively impacted by a decline in certain non-core SNR businesses prior to the combination with AbilityOne. As the following table indicates, AbilityOne believes that AbilityOne's actual underlying growth for 2002 versus 2001 was 7.8%, after removing the effect of the decreased sales to Smith & Nephew plc foreign affiliates and the decline of certain non-core SNR businesses.
 
 
Our management, as well as certain investors, use these non-GAAP measures to analyze our current and future financial performance. These non-GAAP measurements do not replace the presentation of GAAP financial results. These measurements simply provide supplemental information to assist management and certain investors in analyzing our performance. We have provided this information to investors to enable them to perform meaningful comparisons of past, present and future performance and as a means to better understand the results of core on-going operations. We believe these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors regarding our results of operations. This belief is based upon the value of summarizing infrequent or significant transactions that impacted results of operations that are not necessarily indicative of our future results of operations, nor comparable with results of operations of prior periods. These non-GAAP measures are used for no purpose other than to provide supplemental information to assist management and investors in analyzing operational performance.
 
Gross profit margin increased 190 basis points to 45.9% in 2002 from 44.0% in 2001. The improvement in gross margin was primarily due to selective price increases from the legacy AbilityOne business, addition of new products, changes to SNR's freight policies, supplier/manufacturer consolidation related to the SNR acquisition and selected capital investments which improved manufacturing efficiencies and led to further cost reductions. Additional synergies were realized upon the merger of the SNR distribution business into the Sammons Preston Rolyan distribution center in Bolingbrook, IL in mid-2002. AbilityOne's increased sales volume resulted in the realization of significant cost reductions in both shipping costs and telephone costs.
Gross Profit Margin.
 
. Operating expenses decreased by 6.3% to $52.0 million in 2002 from $55.5 million in 2001. Operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue decreased 330 basis points to 24.9% in 2002 from 28.2% in 2001. This decrease was primarily due to synergies realized from the SNR acquisition and leveraging AbilityOne's operating infrastructure over a larger revenue base. More specifically, approximately 150 full-time positions were eliminated as a result of the SNR acquisition. There were staff reductions in all divisions, including sales, finance, distributions, sales administration, international, R&D and quality assurance.

Property, plant, and equipment are stated at cost. For financial reporting purposes, depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. For income tax purposes, accelerated depreciation methods and shorter useful lives are used.
 
Income Taxes
 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.
 
Use of Estimates in Preparation of Financial Statements

The Company adopted SFAS No. 142 during the first quarter of fiscal 2002. Management conducted a review of the estimated fair market value of the business segments during the third quarter of fiscal 2002, using an estimate of enterprise value based on a multiple of EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization). Based upon management's review, no impairment existed at December 31, 2002. Had SFAS No. 142 been in effect for 2001, net income would have been as follows:

In July 2001, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) 141, "Business Combinations" (SFAS 141), which became effective July 1, 2001, and SFAS 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" (SFAS 142), which became effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. These standards change the accounting for business combinations by, among other things, prohibiting the prospective use of pooling-of-interests accounting and requiring companies to stop amortizing goodwill and certain intangible assets with an indefinite useful life created by business combinations accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. Under the new rules, goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives will no longer be amortized, but will be subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with the new standards. Other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their useful lives.
 
The Company will apply the new rules on accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets beginning January 1, 2002. Application of the nonamortization provisions of the new standards is expected to result in an increase in pretax income of $3,446 for the year ended 2002.

In June 2001, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. Under SFAS No. 142, goodwill will no longer be amortized, but will be subject to annual impairment tests. Other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives.
 
The Company adopted SFAS No. 142 during the first quarter of fiscal 2002. Management conducted a review of the estimated fair market value of the business segments during the third quarter of fiscal 2002, using an estimate of enterprise value based on a multiple of EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization). Based upon management's review, no impairment existed at December 31, 2002.

The trade names and goodwill have an indefinite life. The patents are amortized over the life of the patents. The deferred financing costs are amortized over the life of the term loan ending March 27, 2008.

The Indemnified Party shall bear the fees and expenses of any additional counsel retained by it to participate in its defense unless any of the following shall apply: (i) the employment of such counsel shall have been authorized in writing by the Indemnifying Party, or (ii) the Indemnifying Party's legal counsel shall advise the Indemnifying Party in writing, with a copy to the Indemnified Party, that there is a conflict of interest that would make it inappropriate under applicable standards of professional conduct to have common counsel. If clause (i) or (ii) in the immediately preceding sentence is applicable, then the Indemnified Party may employ separate counsel at the expense of the Indemnifying Party to represent the Indemnified Party, but in no event shall the Indemnifying Party be obligated to pay the costs and expenses of more than one such separate counsel for any one complaint, claim, action or Proceeding in any one jurisdiction.
 
If the Indemnifying Party does not assume the defense of any such claim by a Third Party or litigation resulting therefrom after receipt of notice from the Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party may defend against such claim or litigation in such manner as it reasonably deems appropriate. The Indemnified Party may not settle such claim or litigation without the written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.
 
Each Party shall cooperate in good faith and in all respects with each Indemnifying Party and its representatives (including without limitation its counsel) in the investigation, negotiation, settlement, trial and/or defense of any Proceedings (and any appeal arising therefrom) or any claim. The Parties shall cooperate with each other in any notifications to and information requests of any insurers. No individual representative of any Person, or their respective Affiliates, shall be personally liable for any Loss or Losses under this Agreement, except as specifically agreed to by said individual representative.
 
SECTION 10.06 . Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Parties acknowledge and agree that the sole recourse of the Parent Indemnified Parties for any indemnification claim under this Article 10 that is validly established shall be to make claims against and to collect amounts solely from the Escrow Fund, and the Parent Indemnified Parties shall have no other recourse against the Company Stockholders or any of their respective assets and properties for any such claim. No claim for indemnification against any of the Company Stockholders in respect of the Transactions shall be available or asserted, and, except for claims alleging fraud, for which recovery will not be subject to the Basket Amount or limited to the Escrow Fund, or actions for injunctive relief or other equitable remedies (including Section 11.16), no Company Stockholder shall have any Liability of any nature whatsoever to any of the Parent Indemnified Parties, other than for their respective interests in the Escrow Fund.
Exclusive Remedy
 
SECTION 10.07 . An Indemnified Party who has a right to make a claim under any policy of insurance with respect to an indemnified claim made by the Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to make such claim on a prompt and competent basis in the manner required by the insurance carrier. The Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly and diligently pursue such claim and shall cooperate fully with the insurance carrier and the Indemnifying Party in the prosecution of the claim or claims. In the event an Indemnified Party receives insurance proceeds with respect to Losses for which the Indemnified Party has made an indemnification claim prior to the date on which the Indemnifying Party is required pursuant to this Article 10 to pay such indemnification claim, the indemnification claim shall be reduced by an amount equal to such insurance proceeds received by the Indemnified Party less all reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Indemnified Party in its pursuit of such insurance proceeds. If such insurance proceeds are received by the Indemnified Party after the date on which the Indemnifying Party is required pursuant to this Article 10 to pay such indemnification claim, the Indemnified Party shall, no later than five (5) days after the receipt of such insurance proceeds, reimburse the Indemnifying Party in an amount equal to such insurance proceeds (but in no event in an amount greater than the Losses theretofore paid to the Indemnified Party by the Indemnifying Party) less all reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Indemnified Party in obtaining such insurance proceeds. In either case, the Indemnifying Party shall compensate the Indemnified Party for all costs incurred by the Indemnified Party subsequent to either the reduction of any indemnification claim as provided above, or the delivery of any such insurance proceeds to the Indemnifying Party as provided above, as the case may be, as a result of any such insurance, including, but not limited to, retrospective premium adjustments, experience-based premium adjustments (whether retroactive or prospective) and indemnification or surety obligations of the Indemnified Party to any insurer. A claim for such costs shall be made by an Indemnified Party by delivery of a written notice to the Indemnifying Party requesting compensation and specifying this Section 10.07 as the basis on which compensation for such costs is sought, and the Indemnifying Party shall pay such costs no later than thirty (30) days after receiving the written notice requesting such compensation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, except to the extent set forth in the first two sentences of this Section 10.07, the Indemnified Party is not required to pursue a recovery from an insurer as a precondition to the Indemnifying Party's obligation to pay any indemnification claim as required by this Article 10, and the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to delay any payment beyond the respective payment dates for any indemnification

claims referred to in this Article 10 for the purpose of awaiting receipt of insurance proceeds or credits therefor as provided herein.
 
SECTION 10.08 . The amount of indemnification payment due hereunder shall be reduced by the amount of any Income Tax benefit that the Company (or its Affiliates) realizes (or will realize) as a result of incurring such Loss. The amount of the Income Tax benefit realized (or that will be realized) as a result of incurring a Loss shall be computed on a hypothetical basis and shall equal the product of (i) the sum of (A) the amount of each Income Tax deduction (or similar benefit) of the Company (or its Affiliates) resulting from the Loss that is reasonably anticipated to be deductible (or used) in the tax year including the date of indemnification payment (or in any prior tax years) plus (B) the present value as of the date of the indemnification payment of each Income Tax deduction (or similar benefit) of the Company (or its Affiliates) resulting from the Loss that is reasonably anticipated to be deductible (or used) in any tax year after the tax year of the indemnification payment multiplied by (ii) forty percent (40%). For purposes of clause (B), the present value of a future Income Tax deduction (or similar benefit) shall be determined using a discount rate of five percent (5%) and assuming that all Tax benefits from the deduction (or similar benefit) are realized on the 182nd day of the Company's tax year for the year in which the deduction (or similar benefit) is reasonably anticipated to be claimed.
Effect of Taxes
 
SECTION 10.09 . Any Loss for which an Indemnified Party seeks indemnification under this Article 10 shall take into account the amount, if any, actually received by such Indemnified Party with respect to such Losses from any manufacturer providing "pass-through" warranty coverage or from any other Third Party, including, without limitation, BISSELL Inc. and Smith & Nephew, Inc. (the ""). Any indemnification payment made under this Article 10 shall initially be made without regard to this Section 10.09, and the Indemnified Party shall remit to the Indemnifying Party the Third Party Recovery Amount when the Indemnified Party actually receives such amount (but in no event in an amount greater than the Losses theretofore paid to the Indemnified Party by the Indemnifying Party). The Indemnified Party shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, diligently pursue all available remedies and causes of action to recover the amount of its claim as may be available from any Third Party; that the Indemnified Party shall not be obligated to institute any lawsuit or offer or grant any accommodation (financial or otherwise) to any Person or incur any other obligation or liability to recover any such amount. In the event an Indemnifying Party indemnifies an Indemnified Party on any claim referred to in the previous sentence and the Indemnified Party is not pursuing such claim, the Indemnified Party shall assign to the Indemnifying Party, to the fullest extent allowable, its rights and causes of action with respect to such warranty coverage or Third Party claim, or in the event assignment is not permissible, the Indemnifying Party shall be allowed to pursue such claim in the name of the Indemnified Party or its Affiliate, at the Indemnifying Party's expense. The Indemnified Party shall provide the Indemnifying Party reasonable assistance in prosecuting such claim, at the expense of the Indemnifying Party, including making the Indemnified Party's books and records relating to such claim available and making its and its Affiliates' employees available for interviews, depositions, testimony and similar matters; , , that such assistance shall not unreasonably interfere with the business of the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates. If the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates recover from a Third Party any part of a claim that had

SECTION 11.09 .

Severability
 
SECTION 11.13 . The Parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the Parties and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of any of the provisions of this Agreement.

SECTION 11.16 . The Parties hereto agree that if any of the provisions of this Agreement or any other document contemplated by this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached, irreparable damage would occur, no adequate remedy at law would exist and damages would be difficult to determine, and, therefore, the Parties shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof and thereof, in addition to any other remedy at law or in equity.
