Patterson Dental Company (Nasdaq NMS: PDCO) today reported consolidated sales of $537,359,000 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 ended April 24, an increase of 20% from $447,326,000 in the year-earlier quarter. Net income increased 34% to $45,125,000 or $0.65 per diluted share, from $33,597,000 or $0.49 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. AbilityOne Products Corp., which was acquired on September 12, 2003, contributed fourth quarter earnings of $0.07 per diluted share on revenues of $57,473,000.
St. Paul, MNMay 20, 2004
 
For full-year fiscal 2004, consolidated sales increased 19% to $1,969,349,000 from $1,656,956,000 in the prior year. Net income rose 28% to $149,465,000 or $2.17 per diluted share, from $116,320,000 or $1.70 per diluted share in fiscal 2003, before the cumulative effect of an accounting change for goodwill that resulted in a one-time, non-cash benefit of $0.05 per diluted share.
 
Sales of the Patterson Dental Supply unit, Patterson's largest business, increased 8% to $426,709,000 in the fourth quarter. U.S. dental sales rose 9% for the period. All dental sales growth was generated by internal operations.
 
 
 
 
Sales of the Webster Veterinary Supply unit increased 9% in the fourth quarter to $53,177,000 on a comparable basis. This excludes the impact of a temporary, pharmaceutical distribution agreement that was in place during the year-earlier quarter but was converted back into an agency commission arrangement in this year's third quarter, as well as the April 16, 2004 acquisition of ProVet. When revenues from the distribution agreement are included in the prior year quarter and the added revenues from ProVet are factored in the current quarter results, Webster's sales for the fourth quarter of 2004 were virtually unchanged.
 
Peter L. Frechette, chairman and chief executive officer, commented: "The fourth quarter was another strong period for Patterson, with all of our units generating solid operating results. To further strengthen the competitive positions and long-term prospects of our businesses, we completed a series of strategic acquisitions over the past month. ProVet, which is expected to contribute sales of $50 to $60 million in fiscal 2005, makes Webster the nation's second largest distributor of companion-pet veterinary supplies by expanding the reach of this operation into the Midwest and Northwest. On May 3, we completed the acquisition of Medco Supply Company, Inc., a leading national distributor of sports medicine, first aid and medical supplies with sales of
approximately $40 million. Medco, which is being integrated rapidly into AbilityOne, also sells consumable supplies and equipment to podiatrists, which has been a developing customer base for AbilityOne. Then, on May 12, we completed the acquisition of CAESY Education Systems, Inc., the leading provider of electronic patient education services to dental practices in North America. CAESY's communications media educate patients about proper dental care, procedures and treatment alternatives, with the goal of influencing patient decisions about dental services and increasing the productivity of the dental professional. This product line will equip our dental sales force with an important new value-added service. The ProVet, Medco and CAESY acquisitions are strategic in the best sense of the word, and we are confident these transactions will benefit Patterson's performance in fiscal 2005, which we fully expect to be another year of record sales and earnings."
 
For the first quarter of fiscal 2005 ending July 31, Patterson is forecasting earnings of $0.58 to $0.60 per diluted share. This guidance reflects the impact of an extra week in the first quarter of fiscal 2005, which will be a 53-week year ending on April 30, 2005. For the full year, Patterson is forecasting earnings of $2.68 to $2.72 per diluted share. The ProVet, Medco and CAESY acquisitions are expected to have a combined accretive impact of $0.04 to $0.06 on fiscal 2005 earnings, with the majority of this annual contribution forecasted during the second half of the year.
 
Patterson also announced that Howard A. Schwartz, president and chief executive officer of AbilityOne, has taken a medical leave of absence. Edward L. Donnelly, AbilityOne's chief operating officer, will temporarily assume Mr. Schwartz's responsibilities. Mr. Donnelly has been with AbilityOne and its prior owner for 10 years and has over 25 years of experience in the industry.
