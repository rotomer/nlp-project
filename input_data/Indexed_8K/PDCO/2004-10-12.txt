Section 2. . Provider hereby guarantees to Recipient the full and punctual payment and performance by each Originator of the Obligations. This Undertaking is an absolute, unconditional and continuing guaranty of the full and punctual performance of all of the Obligations of each Originator under the Agreements and each other document executed and delivered by each Originator pursuant to the Agreements and is in no way conditioned upon any requirement that Recipient first attempt to collect any amounts owing by any Originator to Recipient, the Agent or the Purchasers from any other Person or resort to any collateral security, any balance of any deposit account or credit on the books of Recipient, the Agent or any Purchaser in favor of any Originator or any other Person or other means of obtaining payment. Should any Originator default in the payment or performance of any of the Obligations, Recipient (or its assigns) may cause the immediate performance by Provider of the Obligations and cause any payment Obligations to become forthwith due and payable to Recipient (or its assigns), without demand or notice of any nature (other than as expressly provided herein), all of which are hereby expressly waived by Provider. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Undertaking is not a guarantee of the collection of any of the Receivables and Provider shall not be responsible for any Obligations to the extent the failure to perform such Obligations by any Originator results from Receivables being uncollectible on account of the insolvency, bankruptcy or lack of creditworthiness of the related Obligor.

from each Originator, on a continuing basis, information concerning the financial condition of each such Originator, and that it is not relying on Recipient to provide such information, now or in the future.

Recipient (and its assigns) shall be at liberty, without giving notice to or obtaining the assent of Provider and without relieving Provider of any liability under this Undertaking, to deal with any Originator and with each other party who now is or after the date hereof becomes liable in any manner for any of the Obligations, in such manner as Recipient in its sole discretion deems fit, and to this end Provider agrees that the validity and enforceability of this Undertaking, including without limitation, the provisions of hereof, shall not be impaired or affected by any of the following: (a) any extension, modification or renewal of, or indulgence with respect to, or substitutions for, the Obligations or any part thereof or any agreement relating thereto at any time; (b) any failure or omission to enforce any right, power or remedy with respect to the Obligations or any part thereof or any agreement relating thereto, or any collateral securing the Obligations or any part thereof; (c) any waiver of any right, power or remedy or of any Termination Event, Amortization Event, or default with respect to the Obligations or any part thereof or any agreement relating thereto; (d) any release, surrender, compromise, settlement, waiver, subordination or modification, with or without consideration, of any other obligation of any person or entity with respect to the Obligations or any part thereof; (e) the enforceability or validity of the Obligations or any part thereof or the genuineness, enforceability or validity of any agreement relating thereto or with respect to the Obligations or any part thereof; (f) the application of payments received from any source to the payment of any payment Obligations of any Originator or any part thereof or amounts which are not covered by this Undertaking even though Recipient (or its assigns) might lawfully have elected to apply such payments to any part or all of the payment Obligations of such Originator or to amounts which are not covered by this Undertaking; (g) the existence of any claim, setoff or other rights which Provider may have at any time against any Originator in connection herewith or any unrelated transaction; (h) any assignment or transfer of the Obligations or any part thereof; or (i) any failure on the part of any Originator to perform or comply with any term of the Agreements or any other document executed in connection therewith or delivered thereunder, all whether or not Provider shall have had notice or knowledge of any act or omission referred to in the foregoing clauses (a) through (i) of this .
