ITEM 1.01 ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT
 
Edward L. Donnelly is named in the summary compensation table of Patterson Companies, Inc. (the "Company") in its Definitive Proxy Statement, which was filed on August 5, 2005.
 
On September 12, 2003, the Company completed its acquisition of AbilityOne Products Corp. ("AbilityOne"). In connection with the acquisition, the Company issued a 0.5% three-year convertible debenture in the principal amount of $1,500,000 as part of the consideration paid to Mr. Donnelly for his stock in AbilityOne. This debenture is convertible into shares of the Company's common stock at a price of $25.49 per share, subject to adjustment as provided in the debenture. A copy of the convertible debenture appears as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated by reference herein.
 
Additionally, in August 2003, AbilityOne entered into an amended and restated employment agreement with Mr. Donnelly, then its Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. The agreement provides that for a period of three years (the "employment period"), Mr. Donnelly will serve as the Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of AbilityOne and its subsidiary, Patterson Medical Products, Inc (formerly AbilityOne Corporation). The agreement further provides that Mr. Donnelly shall receive a minimum annual base salary of $243,500, an incentive cash bonus target equal to 40% of his base salary and certain other benefits. The agreement also provides that if his employment terminates after the initial employment period, or if his employment is terminated under certain conditions during the initial employment period, he will be entitled to a severance pay package, conditioned upon his agreement not to compete with us for one year, equal to his base salary and bonus, plus his continuation in our healthcare and group life insurance plan for one year at company expense. No severance pay is owed if he voluntarily terminates his employment prior to the end of the initial employment period, or is terminated for "cause." Mr. Donnelly was named President of Patterson Medical Products, Inc. in October 2004. A copy of the amended and restated employment agreement appears as Exhibit 99.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated by reference herein.

In the event Company shall give notice of any such prepayment, such notice shall specify such principal amount to be prepaid and the date of the prepayment (the "Prepayment Date"), and thereupon such principal amount, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the Prepayment Date, shall become due and payable on the Prepayment Date, unless this Debenture has been converted prior to such Prepayment Date. Upon prepayment, the Holder shall surrender this Debenture at the principal office of the Company.

In case a Debenture shall be surrendered for partial repurchase, the Company shall execute or deliver to Holder, together with the Repurchase Price, a new Debenture in aggregate principal amounts equal to the unpurchased portion of the surrendered Debenture.

2. .
Conversion Right
 
(a) The Holder may, at any time on and after the Conversion Date and prior to payment in full of this Debenture, convert any or all of the outstanding principal balance of this Debenture into duly authorized, fully paid and non-assessable shares of Common Stock of the Company at a conversion price per share of Common Stock equal to $50.98 (the "Conversion Price"), subject to adjustment pursuant to the provisions of Subsection (c) of this Section 2. For purposes of this Debenture, a Conversion Date shall mean the earlier to occur of (i) July 14, 2006, (ii) a Designated Event or (iii) an Event of Default (as defined below); provided, however, that in the case of any Designated Event constituting a Change of Control the Conversion Date shall be deemed to occur on the business day immediately preceding such Change of Control.
(b) In order to convert this Debenture into shares of Common Stock of the Company, Holder hereof shall surrender at the office of the Company hereinabove mentioned this original Debenture, duly endorsed to the Company or in blank, and give written notice to the Company at such office that such holder elects to convert the principal balance of this Debenture. Holder may convert a portion of this Debenture if the portion is $10,000 or an integral multiple of $10,000. The principal of this Debenture shall be deemed to have been converted immediately prior to the close of business on the day of the surrender of such Debenture for conversion as herein provided. To determine the number of shares issuable upon conversion, the principal amount to be converted shall be divided by the Conversion Price in effect on the date of conversion. As promptly as practicable on or after the date of conversion, the Company shall issue and deliver or cause to be issued and delivered a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock of the Company issuable upon such conversion. Together with such certificates, the Company will deliver to Holder a check for any fractional shares otherwise issuable upon conversion, the amount of which shall be determined in accordance with Section 2 hereof, and for any accrued interest that is unpaid with respect to that portion of the Debenture so converted. In addition, in case any Debenture is surrendered, for partial conversion, the Company shall execute and deliver to Holder, a new Debenture in aggregate principal amount equal to the unconverted portion of the surrendered Debenture.. The Company from time to time may voluntarily reduce the Conversion Price for a period of time, provided that the Conversion Price is not less than the par value of a share of Common Stock.
 
(c) The Conversion Price shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as hereinafter provided. Upon each adjustment of the Conversion Price the holder of this Debenture shall thereafter be entitled to receive the number of shares of Common Stock of the Company obtained by multiplying the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment by the number of shares issuable pursuant to conversion immediately prior to such adjustment and dividing the product thereof by the Conversion Price resulting from such adjustment.
 
(d)     (i) In case the Company shall at any time issue a stock dividend or subdivide its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater number of shares, the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such subdivision shall be proportionately reduced, and conversely, in case the outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Company shall be combined into a smaller number of shares, the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such combination shall be proportionately increased.
 
(ii) In case the Company shall issue rights or warrants to all holders of its outstanding shares of Common Stock entitling them to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock at a price per share less than the Market Price (as defined below) on the Record Date (as defined below) fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such rights or warrants, the Conversion Price shall be reduced so that the same shall equal the price determined by multiplying the Conversion Price in effect at the opening of business on the date after such Record Date by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the Record Date plus the number of shares which the aggregate offering price
of the total number of shares so offered would purchase at such Market Price, and of which the denominator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on the close of business on such Record Date plus the total number of additional shares of Common Stock so offered for subscription or purchase. Such adjustment shall become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the Record Date fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to receive such rights or warrants. To the extent that shares of Common Stock are not delivered pursuant to the exercise of such rights or warrants, upon the expiration or termination of such rights or warrants the Conversion Price shall be readjusted to the Conversion Price which would then be in effect had the adjustments made upon the issuance of such rights or warrants been made on the basis of delivery of only the number of shares of Common Stock actually delivered. In the event that such rights or warrants are not so issued, the Conversion Price shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Price which would then be in effect if such date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such rights or warrants had not been fixed. In determining whether any rights or warrants entitle the holders to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock at less than such Market Price, and in determining the aggregate offering price of such shares of Common Stock, there shall be taken into account any consideration received for such rights or warrants, the value of such consideration, if other than cash, to be determined by the Board of Directors of the Company whose determination shall be conclusive.
 
(iii) In case the Company shall, by dividend or otherwise, distribute to all holders of its Common Stock shares of any class of capital stock of the Company (other than any dividends or distributions to which Section 2(d)(i) applies) or evidences of its indebtedness, cash or other assets (including securities, but excluding any rights or warrants referred to in Section 2(d)(ii) and dividends and distributions paid exclusively in cash and excluding any capital stock, evidences of indebtedness, cash or assets distributed upon a merger or consolidation to which Section 2(e) applies) (the foregoing hereinafter in this Section 2(d)(iii) are referred to as the "Securities"), then, in each such case, the Conversion Price shall be reduced so that the same shall be equal to the price determined by multiplying the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the Record Date with respect to such distribution by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the Market Price on such date less the fair market value (as determined by the Board of Directors of the Company, whose determination shall be conclusive) on such date of the portion of the Securities so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock and the denominator shall be such Market Price, such reduction to become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the day following the applicable Record Date; provided, however, that in the event the then fair market value (as so determined) of the portion of the Securities so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock is equal to or greater than the Market Price on such Record Date, in lieu of the foregoing adjustment, adequate provision shall be made so that each Holder shall have the right to receive upon conversion of a Debenture (or any portion thereof) the amount of Securities such holder would have received had such holder converted such Debenture (or portion thereof) immediately prior to such Record Date. In the event that such dividend or distribution is not so paid or made, the Conversion Price shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Price which would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.
(iv) In case the Company shall, by dividend or otherwise, distribute to all holders of its Common Stock cash (excluding any cash that is distributed upon a merger or consolidation to which Section 2(e) applies) in an aggregate amount that, combined together with the aggregate amount of any other such distributions to all holders of its Common Stock made exclusively in cash within the twelve (12) months preceding the date of payment of such distribution, and in respect of which no adjustment pursuant to this Section 2(d)(iv) has been made, exceeds 10% of the product of the Market Price on the Record Date with respect to such distribution multiplied by the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on such date, then, and in each such case, immediately after the close of business on such date, the Conversion Price shall be reduced so that the same shall equal the price determined by multiplying the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the close of business on such Record Date by a fraction (a) the numerator of which shall be equal to the Market Price on the Record Date less an amount equal to the quotient of (1) the excess of such combined amount over such 10% and (2) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on the Record Date and (b) the denominator of which shall be equal to the Market Price on such date; provided, however, that in the event the portion of the cash so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock is equal to or greater than the Market Price of the Common Stock on the Record Date, in lieu of the foregoing adjustment, adequate provision shall be made so that each Holder shall have the right to receive upon conversion of a Debenture (or any portion thereof) the amount of cash such holder would have received had such holder converted such Debenture (or portion thereof) immediately prior to such Record Date. In the event that such dividend or distribution is not so paid or made, the Conversion Price shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Price which would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.
 
(e) If any capital reorganization or reclassification of the capital stock of the Company, or consolidation or merger of the Company with another corporation, or the sale of all or substantially all of its assets to another corporation shall be effected in such a way that holders of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive cash, stock, securities or assets with respect to or in exchange for Common Stock, then, as a condition of such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger or sale, lawful and adequate provision shall be made whereby the Holder shall thereafter have the right to receive upon the basis and upon the terms and conditions specified herein and in lieu of the shares of the Common Stock of the Company immediately theretofore receivable upon the conversion of this Debenture, such cash, shares of stock, securities or assets as may be issued or payable with respect to or in exchange for a number of outstanding shares of such Common Stock equal to the number of shares of such stock immediately theretofore receivable upon the conversion of this Debenture had such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger or sale not taken place, plus all unpaid interest accrued thereon to the date of such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger or sale, and in any such case appropriate provision shall be made with respect to the rights and interests of this Debenture to the end that the provisions hereof (including without limitation provisions for adjustments of the Conversion Price and of the number of shares receivable upon the conversion of this Debenture) shall thereafter be applicable, as nearly as may be in relation to any cash, shares of stock, securities or assets thereafter receivable upon the conversion of this Debenture. The Company shall not effect any
such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger or sale, unless prior to the consummation thereof the successor corporation (if other than the Company) resulting from such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation or merger or the company purchasing such assets shall assume by written instrument the Company's obligations hereunder, including, without limitation, the obligation to deliver such cash, shares of stock, securities or assets as, in accordance with the foregoing provisions, the Holder may be entitled to receive.
 
(f) Upon any adjustment of the Conversion Price, the Company shall give written notice thereof, by first-class mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the Holder, at the address of the Holder as shown on the books of the Company, which notice shall state the Conversion Price resulting from such adjustment and the increase or decrease, if any, in the number of shares receivable at such price upon the conversion of this Debenture, setting forth in reasonable detail the method of calculation and the facts upon which such calculation is based. No adjustment to the Conversion Price shall be required unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least one percent (1%) in such Conversion Price; provided, however, that any adjustments which by reason of this Section 2 are not required to be made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment. All calculations under this Section 2 shall be made to the nearest cent or to the nearest one-hundredth of a share, as the case may be. Anything in this Section 2 to the contrary notwithstanding, the Company shall be entitled to make such decreases in the Conversion Price in addition to those required by this Section 2 as it in its discretion shall determine to be advisable in order that any stock dividends, subdivisions of shares, distribution of rights to purchase stock or securities, or distribution of securities convertible into or exchangeable for stock hereafter made by the Company to its stockholders shall not be taxable.
 
(g) In case at any time: (i) there shall be any capital reorganization, or reclassification of the capital stock of the Company, or consolidation or merger of the Company with, or sale of all or substantially all of its assets to, another Corporation; (ii) there shall be a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Company; then, in any one or more of said cases, the Company shall give written notice, by first-class mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the Holders at the addresses as shown on the books of the Company, of the date on which (a) the books of the Company shall close or a record shall be taken for such dividend, distribution or subscription rights, or (b) such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, dissolution, liquidation or winding up shall take place, as the case may be. Such notice shall also specify the date as of which the holders of Common Stock of record shall participate in such dividend, distribution or subscription rights, or shall be entitled to exchange their Common Stock for securities or other property deliverable upon such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, dissolution, liquidation, or winding up, as the case may be. Such written notice shall be given at least twenty (20) days prior to the action in question and, if applicable, not less than twenty (20) days prior to the record date or the date on which the Company's transfer books are closed in respect thereto. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall also provide Holder with prompt written notice of any Designated Event.
(h) For the benefit of the Holders, if any event occurs as to which in the opinion of the Board of Directors of the Company the other provisions of this Section 2 are not strictly applicable or if strictly applicable would not fairly protect the rights of the Holders in accordance with the essential intent and principles of such provisions, then the Board of Directors shall make an adjustment in the application of such provisions, in accordance with such essential intent and principles, so as to protect such rights as aforesaid.
 
(i) As used in this Section 2:
 
"Common Stock" shall mean and include the Company's presently authorized Common Stock and any additional common stock that may be authorized by due action of the Company's Board of Directors and shareholders entitled to vote thereon.
 
"Market Price" shall mean if the Common Stock is traded on a securities exchange or on the NASDAQ Stock Market, the average of the closing sale prices of the Common Stock on such exchange or the NASDAQ Stock Market over a period of twenty (20) consecutive trading days ending on the date immediately prior to the date as of which such price is being determined, or, if the Common Stock is otherwise traded in the over-the-counter market, the closing bid price, in each case averaged over a period of twenty (20) consecutive trading days ending on the date immediately prior to the date as of which such price is being determined. If at any time the Common Stock is not traded on an exchange or the NASDAQ Stock Market, or otherwise traded in the over-the-counter market, the "Market Price" shall be deemed to be the fair value thereof determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Company as of a date which is within fifteen (15) days of the date as of which the determination is to be made.
 
"Record Date" shall mean, with respect to any dividend, distribution or other transaction or event in which the holders of the Common Stock have the right to receive any cash, securities or other property or in which the Common Stock (or other applicable security) is exchanged for or converted into any combination of cash, securities or other property, the date fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to receive such cash, securities or other property (whether such date is fixed by the Board of Directors or by statute, contract or otherwise).
 
(j) No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued upon conversion, but, instead of any fraction of a share which would otherwise be issuable, the Company shall pay a cash adjustment in respect of such fraction in an amount equal to the same fraction of the Market Price per share of Common Stock as of the close of business on the day of conversion.
 
(k) The Company covenants that it will at all times reserve and keep available, solely for the purpose of issue upon conversion of this Debenture, such number of shares of Common Stock as shall be issuable upon the conversion of the entire outstanding principal amount of such Debenture; provided, that nothing contained herein shall be
construed to preclude the Company from satisfying its obligations in respect of the conversion of this Debenture by delivery of purchased shares of Common Stock of the Company.
 
(l) The Company covenants that if any shares of Common Stock required to be reserved for purposes of conversion of this Debenture require registration with or approval of any governmental authority under any federal or state law, before such shares may be issued upon conversion, the Company will cause such shares to be duly registered or approved, as the case may be.
 
(m) The Company covenants that all shares of Common Stock issued upon conversion of the shares of this Debenture will upon issue be duly authorized, fully paid and nonassessable and not subject to any preemptive rights, liens or charges with respect to the issue thereof.
 
(n) The Company covenants that if at any time the Common Stock shall be traded on the NASDAQ Stock Market or listed on any national securities exchange, the Company will cause any shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Debenture to be so traded or listed.
 
(o) If a Holder converts all or any portion of the principal amount of the Debenture, the Company shall pay any documentary, stamp or similar issue or transfer tax due on the issue of shares of Common Stock upon the conversion. However, the Holder shall pay any such tax which is due because the shares are issued or transferred to a person other than the Holder. As a condition to the issuance of any Common Stock upon conversion, or upon payment of principal or interest hereunder, the Holder shall pay or reimburse the Company for the amount of any taxes or other amounts required to be withheld under applicable state and federal laws.
