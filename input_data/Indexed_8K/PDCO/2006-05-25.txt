EXHIBIT 99
Patterson Companies, Inc. (Nasdaq NMS: PDCO) today reported consolidated sales of $695,177,000 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 ended April 29, an increase of 11% from $627,272,000 in the year-earlier quarter. Excluding the impact of two acquisitions earlier in fiscal 2006, sales rose approximately 8%. Net income increased 13% to $56,819,000 or $0.41 per diluted share, from $50,242,000 or $0.36 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005.
St. Paul, MNMay 25, 2006
For full-year fiscal 2006, consolidated sales increased 8% to $2,615,123,000, from $2,421,457,000 in fiscal 2005. Fiscal 2005 included an additional or fifty-third selling week that adversely impacts the fiscal 2006 revenue growth rate by approximately one to two percentage points. Net income rose 8% to $198,425,000 or $1.43 per diluted share, from $183,698,000 or $1.32 per diluted share in the prior fiscal year.
Patterson Dental, Patterson's largest business, reported sales growth of 11% to $522,934,000 in the fourth quarter. The September 2005 acquisition of Accu-Bite, Inc., a Michigan-based dental distributor, accounted for approximately four percentage points of Patterson Dental's fourth quarter sales growth.
 
 
 
Sales of the Webster Veterinary unit increased 19% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 to $97,327,000. Excluding the December 2005 acquisition of Intra Corp, one of the nation's leading developers of veterinary practice management software, Webster's sales rose 17%. Sales of Patterson Medical, Patterson's rehabilitation supply and equipment unit, were substantially unchanged at $74,916,000 in comparison to the year-earlier level.
James W. Wiltz, president and chief executive officer, commented: "Patterson's improved fourth quarter results were paced by the strength of our dental and veterinary supply businesses. The performance of our dental unit benefited from robust sales of consumable supplies and new-generation digital equipment and related software, in addition to a solid rebound in sales of basic dental equipment. We believe these factors reflect the continued vitality of the North American dental market and our ability to capitalize upon growth opportunities in this arena. Our veterinary supply business is benefiting from the expansion of its geographic market through targeted acquisitions and its increasingly successful internal start-up in California, the positive impact of new pharmaceutical distribution agreements, and strong sales of veterinary equipment. Webster's strategic emphasis on veterinary equipment has been strengthened by the acquisition of the IntraVet software product line, which positions us to offer veterinarians a value-added technology solution by maximizing the capabilities of digital radiography equipment. The fourth quarter performance of Patterson Medical was consistent with our forecast, as domestic sales growth of rehabilitation supplies and equipment largely offset continued weakness in the unit's international operations. Patterson Medical's new management team has completed its strategic analysis of this business and is now implementing a range of strategies that are expected to result in stronger overall growth in fiscal 2007."
Wiltz added: "We are optimistic about Patterson's prospects as we look ahead to fiscal 2007. We believe Patterson Dental is generating growing sales momentum; our Webster unit is
well-positioned for continued growth; and we expect Patterson Medical's performance to strengthen during the coming fiscal year. Reflecting these factors, Patterson is forecasting earnings of $0.31 to $0.33 per diluted share for the first quarter of fiscal 2007 ending July 29, 2006. For the full year, we are forecasting earnings of $1.61 to $1.64 per diluted share. These forecasts do not include the impact of SFAS No. 123(R), which we expect to be approximately $.04 per diluted share for the full fiscal year"
