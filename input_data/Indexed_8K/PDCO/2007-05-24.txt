On May 24, 2007, Patterson Companies, Inc. issued a press release announcing its financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007 ended April 28, 2007. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated by reference herein.

Exhibit 99
Patterson Companies, Inc. (Nasdaq: PDCO) today reported consolidated sales of $739,143,000 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 ended April 28, an increase of 6% from $695,177,000 in the year-earlier quarter. On a comparable basis, which excludes the telemarketing operation of the former Accu-Bite business that was closed in early May 2006, consolidated sales increased approximately 8%. Net income came to $59,924,000 or $0.44 per diluted share, up 6% from $56,819,000 or $0.41 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. Current quarter earnings included stock compensation expense of approximately $0.01 per diluted share.
St. Paul, MNMay 24, 2007
Consolidated fourth quarter sales were consistent with Patterson's expectations. Earnings for this period were affected by a reduced dental gross margin due primarily to under-plan sales of high-margin software.
For full-year fiscal 2007, consolidated sales increased 7% to $2,798,398,000 from $2,615,123,000 in fiscal 2006. Net income of $208,336,000 or $1.51 was up 5% from $198,423,000 or $1.43 per diluted share, in fiscal 2006. Fiscal 2007 earnings included stock compensation expense of approximately $0.05 per diluted share.
Sales of Patterson Dental, Patterson's largest business, reported comparable basis sales growth of approximately 6% to $542,573,000 in the fourth quarter or 4% when Accu-Bite's telemarketing sales are included.
 
 
 
Sales of the Webster Veterinary unit increased 13% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 to $109,687,000. Sales of Patterson Medical, Patterson's rehabilitation supply and equipment unit, increased 16% in the fourth quarter to $86,883,000 in comparison to the year-earlier level. Excluding the impact of three acquisitions related to the unit's branch office strategy and foreign currency translations, fourth quarter sales of Patterson Medical rose approximately 8%.
James W. Wiltz, president and chief executive officer, commented: "Total dental sales generally met our expectations, paced by solid sales of consumable supplies and a rebound in sales of basic dental equipment. As expected, CEREC sales declined during the process of rolling out several important new enhancements to this product line. New CEREC software results in significantly greater ease of use, while a new optional milling chamber provides for faster crown milling times. Customer interest in CEREC units equipped with these features has been encouraging, and we believe CEREC sales should strengthen in fiscal 2008."
He continued: "Patterson's veterinary business recorded another strong performance in the fourth quarter due to the continued growth of its consumables business and a 60% increase in sales of equipment and IntraVet practice management software. Webster's strategic emphasis on expanding its value-added platform, which encompasses its equipment and software initiatives, is clearly starting to pay dividends. We also are encouraged by Patterson Medical's solid sales growth, which is benefiting from the revenues generated by its branch office strategy and other growth initiatives implemented during the year."
Wiltz added: "Based upon the progress posted by our three businesses in the fourth quarter, we are optimistic about Patterson's prospects for fiscal 2008. We are forecasting earnings of $0.34 to $0.36 per diluted share for the first quarter of fiscal 2008 ending July 28, 2007, and for the full year, we are forecasting earnings of $1.73 to $1.77 per diluted share."
Impact of Compensation Expense Under SFAS No. 123(R)
Net income and earnings per share excluding the impact of compensation expense under SFAS No. 123(R) are considered non-GAAP financial measures. The company adopted SFAS No. 123(R) on April 30, 2006 using the modified prospective method. Management believes that reporting net income and earnings per share excluding the impact of compensation expense under SFAS No. 123(R) provides useful supplemental information that may enhance investors' overall understanding of the company's current financial performance and may enhance the comparability of results against comparable periods. Net income and earnings per share excluding the impact of SFAS No. 123(R) are used by management internally to measure the company's profitability and performance, but should not be considered as an alternative to, or a substitute for, GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of net income and earnings per share with and without the impact of SFAS No. 123(R) is included as a table attached to this press release.
