The Notes shall be substantially in the forms set out in Exhibits 1(a) through 1(c), with such changes therefrom, if any, as may be approved by you and the Company. Certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement are defined in Schedule B; references to a "Schedule" or an "Exhibit" are, unless otherwise specified, to a Schedule or an Exhibit attached to this Agreement.
 
If the Debt to Adjusted EBITDA Ratio at any time exceeds 3.50 to 1.00, as evidenced by an Officer's Certificate delivered pursuant to Section 7.2(a), the interest rate payable on the Notes shall be increased by 0.75% (the "Incremental Interest"). Such Incremental Interest shall begin to accrue on the first day of the fiscal quarter following the fiscal quarter in respect of which such Certificate was delivered, and shall continue to accrue until the Company has provided an Officer's Certificate pursuant to Section 7.2(a) demonstrating that, as of the last day of the fiscal quarter in respect of which such Certificate is delivered, the Debt to Adjusted EBITDA Ratio is not more than 3.50 to 1.00. In the event such Officer's Certificate is delivered, the Incremental Interest shall cease to accrue on the last day of the fiscal quarter in respect of which such Certificate is delivered.
 
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Obligors will issue and sell to you and each of the other purchasers named in Schedule A (the "Other Purchasers"), and you and the Other Purchasers will purchase from the Obligors, at the Closing provided for in Section 3, Notes in the principal amount and series specified opposite your names in Schedule A at the purchase price of 100% of the principal amount thereof. Your obligation hereunder and the obligations of the Other Purchasers are several and not joint obligations and you shall have no liability to any Person for the performance or non-performance by any Other Purchaser hereunder.

If at the Closing any Obligor fails to tender such Notes to you as
 
provided above in this Section 3, or any of the conditions specified in Section 4 shall not have been fulfilled to your satisfaction, you shall, at your election, be relieved of all further obligations under this Agreement, without thereby waiving any rights you may have by reason of such failure or such nonfulfillment.

The Obligors shall deliver a fully executed copy of the Credit Agreement containing covenants no more onerous than those in the Term Loan Agreement.

Each Obligor represents and warrants to you that:
 
Each Obligor is a corporation or limited partnership duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization, and is duly qualified as a foreign corporation or foreign limited partnership and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which such qualification is required by law, other than those jurisdictions as to which the failure to be so qualified or in good standing could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Each Obligor has the corporate or partnership power and authority to own or hold under lease the properties it purports to own or hold under lease, to transact the business it transacts and proposes to transact, to execute and deliver this Agreement and the Notes and to perform the provisions hereof and thereof.
 
This Agreement and the Notes have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate or partnership action on the part of each Obligor, and this Agreement constitutes, and upon execution and delivery thereof each Note will constitute, a legal, valid and binding obligation of each Obligor enforceable against each Obligor in accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by (i) applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and (ii) general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).
 
The Obligors, through their agent, J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., have delivered to you and each Other Purchaser a copy of a Confidential Private Placement Memorandum, dated October 2011, including the Company's Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the fiscal years ended April 30, 2011 and April 24, 2010 and the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended July 30, 2011 (the "Memorandum"), relating to the transactions contemplated hereby. The Memorandum fairly describes, in all material respects, the general nature of the business and principal properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries. Except as disclosed in Schedule 5.3, this Agreement, the Memorandum, the documents, certificates or other writings delivered to you by or on behalf of the Obligors in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and the financial statements listed in Schedule 5.5, taken as a whole, do not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in light of the circumstances under which they were made. Except as disclosed in the Memorandum or as expressly described in Schedule 5.3, or in one of the documents, certificates or other writings identified therein, or in the financial statements listed in Schedule 5.5, since April 30, 2011, there has been no change in the financial condition, operations, business or properties of the Company or any Subsidiary except changes that individually or in the aggregate could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. There is no fact known to any Obligor that could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect that has not been set forth herein or in the Memorandum or in the other documents, certificates and other writings delivered to you by or on behalf of the Obligors specifically for use in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.
 
(a) Schedule 5.4 contains (except as noted therein) complete and correct lists of: (i) the Company's Subsidiaries, showing, as to each Subsidiary, the correct name thereof, the jurisdiction of its organization, and the percentage of shares of each class of its capital stock or similar equity interests outstanding owned by the Company and each other Subsidiary, (ii) the Company's Affiliates, other than Subsidiaries, and (iii) the Company's directors and senior officers.
(b) All of the outstanding shares of capital stock or similar equity interests of each Subsidiary shown in Schedule 5.4 as being owned by the Company and its Subsidiaries have been validly issued, are fully paid and nonassessable and are owned by the Company or another Subsidiary free and clear of any Lien (except as otherwise disclosed in Schedule 5.4).
(c) Each Subsidiary identified in Schedule 5.4 is a corporation or other legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization, and is duly qualified as a foreign corporation or other legal entity and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which such qualification is required by law, other than those jurisdictions as to which the failure to be so qualified or in good standing could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Each such Subsidiary has the corporate or other power and
 
authority to own or hold under lease the properties it purports to own or hold under lease and to transact the business it transacts and proposes to transact.
(d) No Subsidiary is a party to, or otherwise subject to, any legal restriction or any agreement (other than this Agreement, the agreements listed on Schedule 5.4 and customary limitations imposed by corporate or limited partnership law statutes) restricting the ability of such Subsidiary to pay dividends out of profits or make any other similar distributions of profits to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that owns outstanding shares of capital stock or similar equity interests of such Subsidiary.
 
The Company has delivered to you and each Other Purchaser copies of the financial statements of the Company and its Subsidiaries listed on Schedule 5.5. All of said financial statements (including in each case the related schedules and notes) fairly present in all material respects the consolidated financial position of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the respective dates specified in such Schedule and the consolidated results of their operations and cash flows for the respective periods so specified and have been prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied throughout the periods involved except as set forth in the notes thereto (subject, in the case of any interim financial statements, to normal year-end adjustments).
 
The execution, delivery and performance by each Obligor of this Agreement and the Notes will not (i) contravene, result in any breach of, or constitute a default under, or result in the creation of any Lien in respect of any property of any Obligor or any other Subsidiary under, any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan, purchase or credit agreement, lease, corporate charter or by-laws, or any other agreement or instrument to which any Obligor or any other Subsidiary is bound or by which any Obligor or any other Subsidiary or any of their respective properties may be bound or affected, (ii) conflict with or result in a breach of any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any order, judgment, decree, or ruling of any court, arbitrator or Governmental Authority applicable to any Obligor or any other Subsidiary or (iii) violate any provision of any statute or other rule or regulation of any Governmental Authority applicable to any Obligor or any other Subsidiary.
 
No consent, approval or authorization of, or registration, filing or declaration with, any Governmental Authority is required in connection with the execution, delivery or performance by any Obligor of this Agreement or the Notes.
 
(a) Except as disclosed in Schedule 5.8, there are no actions, suits or proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of any Obligor, threatened against or affecting any Obligor or any other Subsidiary or any property of any Obligor or any other Subsidiary in any court or before any arbitrator of any kind or before or by any
 
Governmental Authority that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
(b) Neither any Obligor nor any other Subsidiary is in default under any term of any agreement or instrument to which it is a party or by which it is bound, or any order, judgment, decree or ruling of any court, arbitrator or Governmental Authority or is in violation of any applicable law, ordinance, rule or regulation (including Environmental Laws, the USA PATRIOT Act or any of the other laws and regulations that are referred to in Section 5.16) of any Governmental Authority, which default or violation, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
 
The Company and its Subsidiaries have filed all tax returns that are required to have been filed in any jurisdiction, and have paid all taxes shown to be due and payable on such returns and all other taxes and assessments levied upon them or their properties, assets, income or franchises, to the extent such taxes and assessments have become due and payable and before they have become delinquent, except for any taxes and assessments (i) the amount of which is not individually or in the aggregate Material or (ii) the amount, applicability or validity of which is currently being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and with respect to which the Company or a Subsidiary, as the case may be, has established adequate reserves in accordance with GAAP. The Company knows of no basis for any other tax or assessment that could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The charges, accruals and reserves on the books of the Company and its Subsidiaries in respect of Federal, state or other taxes for all fiscal periods are adequate. The Federal income tax liabilities of the Company and its Subsidiaries have been determined by the Internal Revenue Service and paid for all fiscal years up to and including the fiscal year ended April 30, 2005.
 
The Company and its Subsidiaries have good and sufficient title to their respective properties that individually or in the aggregate are Material, including all such properties reflected in the most recent audited balance sheet referred to in Section 5.5 or purported to have been acquired by the Company or any Subsidiary after said date (except as sold or otherwise disposed of in the ordinary course of business), in each case free and clear of Liens prohibited by this Agreement. All leases that individually or in the aggregate are Material are valid and subsisting and are in full force and effect in all material respects.
 
Except as disclosed in Schedule 5.11,
(a) the Company and its Subsidiaries own or possess all licenses, permits, franchises, authorizations, patents, copyrights, service marks, trademarks and trade names, or rights thereto, that individually or in the aggregate are Material, without known conflict with the rights of others;
 
(b) to the best knowledge of each Obligor, no product of any Obligor or any other Subsidiary infringes in any material respect any license, permit, franchise, authorization, patent, copyright, service mark, trademark, trade name or other right owned by any other Person; and
(c) to the best knowledge of each Obligor, there is no Material violation by any Person of any right of any Obligor or any other Subsidiary with respect to any patent, copyright, service mark, trademark, trade name or other right owned or used by the any Obligor or any other Subsidiary.
 
(a) The Company and each ERISA Affiliate have operated and administered each Plan in compliance with all applicable laws except for such instances of noncompliance as have not resulted in and could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has incurred any liability pursuant to Title I or IV of ERISA or the penalty or excise tax provisions of the Code relating to employee benefit plans (as defined in Section 3 of ERISA), and no event, transaction or condition has occurred or exists that could reasonably be expected to result in the incurrence of any such liability by the Company or any ERISA Affiliate, or in the imposition of any Lien on any of the rights, properties or assets of the Company or any ERISA Affiliate, in either case pursuant to Title I or IV of ERISA or to section 430(k) of the Code or to any such penalty or excise tax provisions under the Code or Federal law or section 4068 of ERISA or by the granting of a security interest in connection with the amendment of a Plan, other than such liabilities or Liens as would not be individually or in the aggregate Material.
(b) The present value of the aggregate benefit liabilities under each of the Plans (other than Multiemployer Plans), determined as of the end of such Plan's most recently ended plan year on the basis of the actuarial assumptions specified for funding purposes in such Plan's most recent actuarial valuation report, did not exceed the aggregate current value of the assets of such Plan allocable to such benefit liabilities. The term "benefit liabilities" has the meaning specified in section 4001 of ERISA and the terms "current value" and "present value" have the meaning specified in section 3 of ERISA.
(c) The Company and its ERISA Affiliates have not incurred withdrawal liabilities (and are not subject to contingent withdrawal liabilities) under section 4201 or 4204 of ERISA in respect of Multiemployer Plans that individually or in the aggregate are Material.
(d) The expected postretirement benefit obligation (determined as of the last day of the Company's most recently ended fiscal year in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 106, without regard to liabilities attributable to continuation coverage mandated by section 4980B of the Code) of the Company and its Subsidiaries is not Material.
 
(e) The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the issuance and sale of the Notes hereunder will not involve any transaction that is subject to the prohibitions of section 406 of ERISA or in connection with which a tax could be imposed pursuant to section 4975(c)(1)(A)-(D) of the Code. The representation by the Company in the first sentence of this Section 5.12(e) is made in reliance upon and subject to the accuracy of your representation in Section 6.2 as to the sources of the funds used to pay the purchase price of the Notes to be purchased by you.
 
Neither any Obligor nor anyone acting on its behalf has offered the Notes or any similar securities for sale to, or solicited any offer to buy any of the same from, or otherwise approached or negotiated in respect thereof with, any person other than you and the Other Purchasers and not more than 45 other Institutional Investors, each of which has been offered the Notes at a private sale for investment. Neither any Obligor nor anyone acting on its behalf has taken, or will take, any action that would subject the issuance or sale of the Notes to the registration requirements of Section 5 of the Securities Act.
 
The Obligors will apply the proceeds of the sale of the Notes to refinance Debt of the Company as set forth in Schedule 5.14 and for general corporate purposes, including repurchases of the Company's Capital Stock and business or asset acquisitions. No part of the proceeds from the sale of the Notes will be used, directly or indirectly, for the purpose of buying or carrying any margin stock within the meaning of Regulation U of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (12 CFR 221) so as to involve any Obligor or any holder of Notes in a violation of such Regulation (or so as to require any holder of Notes to make any filing under such Regulation), or for the purpose of buying or carrying or trading in any securities under such circumstances as to involve any Obligor in a violation of Regulation X of said Board (12 CFR 224) or to involve any broker or dealer in a violation of Regulation T of said Board (12 CFR 220). Margin stock does not constitute more than 10% of the value of the consolidated assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries and the Obligors do not have any present intention that margin stock will constitute more than 10% of the value of such assets. As used in this Section, the terms "margin stock" and "purpose of buying or carrying" shall have the meanings assigned to them in said Regulation U.
 
(a) Except as described therein, Schedule 5.15 sets forth a complete and correct list of all outstanding Debt of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of December 1, 2011 since which date there has been no Material change in the amounts, interest rates, sinking funds, installment payments or maturities of the Debt of the Company or its Subsidiaries. Neither any Obligor nor any other Subsidiary is in default and no waiver of default is currently in effect, in the payment of any principal or interest on any Debt of any Obligor or any other Subsidiary and no event or condition exists with respect to any Debt of any Obligor or any other Subsidiary that would permit (or that with notice or the lapse of time, or both, would permit) one or more Persons to cause such Debt to become
 
due and payable before its stated maturity or before its regularly scheduled dates of payment.
(b) Except as disclosed in Schedule 5.15, neither any Obligor nor any other Subsidiary has agreed or consented to cause or permit in the future (upon the happening of a contingency or otherwise) any of its property, whether now owned or hereafter acquired, to be subject to a Lien not permitted by Section 10.4.
 
(a) Neither any Obligor nor any Controlled Entity is (i) a Person whose name appears on the list of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons published by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, U.S. Department of Treasury ("OFAC") (an "OFAC Listed Person") or (ii) a department, agency or instrumentality of, or is otherwise controlled by or acting on behalf of, directly or indirectly, (x) any OFAC Listed Person or (y) any Person, entity, organization, foreign country or regime that is subject to any OFAC Sanctions Program (each OFAC Listed Person and each other Person, entity, organization and government of a country described in clause (ii), a "Blocked Person").
(b) No part of the proceeds from the sale of the Notes hereunder constitutes or will constitute funds obtained on behalf of any Blocked Person or will otherwise be used, directly by the Obligors or indirectly through any Controlled Entity, in connection with any investment in, or any transactions or dealings with, any Blocked Person.
(c) To each Obligor's actual knowledge after making due inquiry, neither such Obligor nor any Controlled Entity (i) is under investigation by any Governmental Authority for, or has been charged with, or convicted of, money laundering, drug trafficking, terrorist-related activities or other money laundering predicate crimes under any applicable law (collectively, Anti-Money Laundering Laws), (ii) has been assessed civil penalties under any Anti-Money Laundering Laws or (iii) has had any of its funds seized or forfeited in an action under any Anti-Money Laundering Laws.

"
"
(d) No part of the proceeds from the sale of the Notes hereunder will be used, directly or indirectly, for any improper payments to any governmental official or employee, political party, official of a political party, candidate for political office, official of any public international organization or anyone else acting in an official capacity, in order to obtain, retain or direct business or obtain any improper advantage. The Obligors have taken reasonable measures appropriate to the circumstances (in any event as required by applicable law) to ensure that the Obligors and each Controlled Entity is and will continue to be in compliance with all applicable current and future anti-corruption laws and regulations.
 
Neither any Obligor nor any other Subsidiary is subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, the ICC Termination Act, as amended, or the Federal Power Act, as amended.
 
Neither any Obligor nor any other Subsidiary has knowledge of any claim or has received any notice of any claim, and no proceeding has been instituted raising any claim against any Obligor or any other Subsidiary or any of their respective real properties now or formerly owned, leased or operated by any of them or other assets, alleging any damage to the environment or violation of any Environmental Laws, except, in each case, such as could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. Except as otherwise disclosed to you in writing,
(a) neither any Obligor nor any other Subsidiary has knowledge of any facts which would give rise to any claim, public or private, of violation of Environmental Laws or damage to the environment emanating from, occurring on or in any way related to real properties now or formerly owned, leased or operated by any of them or to other assets or their use, except, in each case, such as could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect;
(b) neither any Obligor nor any other Subsidiary has stored any Hazardous Materials on real properties now or formerly owned, leased or operated by any of them and has not disposed of any Hazardous Materials in a manner contrary to any Environmental Laws in each case in any manner that could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect; and
(c) all buildings on all real properties now owned, leased or operated by any Obligor or any other Subsidiary are in compliance with applicable Environmental Laws, except where failure to comply could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

You understand that the Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act and may be resold only if registered pursuant to the provisions of the Securities Act or if an exemption from registration is available, except under circumstances where neither such registration nor such an exemption is required by law, and that the Obligors are not required to register the Notes.

In the case of each prepayment of Notes pursuant to this Section 8, the principal amount of each Note to be prepaid shall mature and become due and payable on the date fixed for such prepayment, together with interest on such principal amount accrued to such date and the applicable Make-Whole Amount, if any.

Any Note paid or prepaid in full shall be surrendered to the Company and canceled and shall not be reissued, and no Note shall be issued in lieu of any prepaid principal amount of any Note.

Any such offer shall provide each holder with sufficient information reasonably determined by the Obligors to enable it to make an informed decision with respect to such offer, and shall remain open for at least 10 Business Days. If the holders of more than 25% of the principal amount of the Notes of the series to which such offer is directed then outstanding accept such offer, the Company shall promptly notify the remaining holders of such fact and the expiration date for the acceptance by holders of such series of Notes of such offer shall be extended by the number of days necessary to give each such remaining holder at least 10 Business Days from its receipt of such notice to accept such offer.

The term "" means, with respect to any Note, an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the Discounted Value of the Remaining Scheduled Payments with respect to the Called Principal of such Note over the amount of such Called Principal, provided that the Make-Whole Amount may in no event be less than zero. For the purposes of determining the Make-Whole Amount, the following terms have the following meanings:
Make-Whole Amount
"" means, with respect to any Note, the principal of such Note that is to be prepaid pursuant to Section 8.2(a) or has become or is declared to be immediately due and payable pursuant to Section 12.1, as the context requires.
Called Principal
"" means, with respect to the Called Principal of any Note, the amount obtained by discounting all Remaining Scheduled Payments with respect to such Called Principal from their respective scheduled due dates to the Settlement Date with respect to such Called Principal, in accordance with accepted financial practice and at a discount factor (applied on the same periodic basis as that on which interest on the Notes is payable) equal to the Reinvestment Yield with respect to such Called Principal.
Discounted Value
"" means, with respect to the Called Principal of any Note, .50% over the yield to maturity implied by the yield(s) reported as of 10:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the second Business Day preceding the Settlement Date with respect to such Called Principal, on the display designated as "Page PX1" (or such other display as may replace Page PX1) on Bloomberg Financial Markets for the most recently issued actively traded on-the-run U.S. Treasury securities ("Reported") having a maturity equal to the Remaining Average Life of such Called Principal as of such Settlement Date. If there are no such U.S. Treasury securities Reported having a maturity equal to such Remaining Average Life, then such implied yield to maturity will be determined by
Reinvestment Yield
 
(a) converting U.S. Treasury bill quotations to bond equivalent yields in accordance with accepted financial practice and (b) interpolating linearly between the yields Reported for the applicable most recently issued actively traded on-the-run U.S. Treasury securities with the maturities (1) closest to and greater than such Remaining Average Life and (2) closest to and less than such Remaining Average Life. The Reinvestment Yield shall be rounded to the number of decimal places as appears in the interest rate of the applicable Note.
If such yields are not Reported or the yields Reported as of such time are not ascertainable (including by way of interpolation), then "Reinvestment Yield" means, with respect to the Called Principal of any Note, .50% over the yield to maturity implied by the U.S. Treasury constant maturity yields reported, for the latest day for which such yields have been so reported as of the second Business Day preceding the Settlement Date with respect to such Called Principal, in Federal Reserve Statistical Release H.15 (or any comparable successor publication) for the U.S. Treasury constant maturity having a term equal to the Remaining Average Life of such Called Principal as of such Settlement Date. If there is no such U.S. Treasury constant maturity having a term equal to such Remaining Average Life, such implied yield to maturity will be determined by interpolating linearly between (1) the U.S. Treasury constant maturity so reported with the term closest to and greater than such Remaining Average Life and (2) the U.S. Treasury constant maturity so reported with the term closest to and less than such Remaining Average Life. The Reinvestment Yield shall be rounded to the number of decimal places as appears in the interest rate of the applicable Note.
"" means, with respect to any Called Principal, the number of years obtained by dividing (i) such Called Principal into (ii) the sum of the products obtained by multiplying (a) the principal component of each Remaining Scheduled Payment with respect to such Called Principal by (b) the number of years, computed on the basis of a 360-day year composed of twelve 30-day months, that will elapse between the Settlement Date with respect to such Called Principal and the scheduled due date of such Remaining Scheduled Payment.
Remaining Average Life
"" means, with respect to the Called Principal of any Note, all payments of such Called Principal and interest thereon that would be due after the Settlement Date with respect to such Called Principal if no payment of such Called Principal were made prior to its scheduled due date, provided that if such Settlement Date is not a date on which interest payments are due to be made under the terms of the Notes, then the amount of the next succeeding scheduled interest payment will be reduced by the amount of interest accrued to such Settlement Date and required to be paid on such Settlement Date pursuant to Section 8.2(a) or 12.1.
Remaining Scheduled Payments
"" means, with respect to the Called Principal of any Note, the date on which such Called Principal is to be prepaid pursuant to Section 8.2(a) or has become or is declared to be immediately due and payable pursuant to Section 12.1, as the context requires.

The Obligors will, and will cause each other Subsidiary to, maintain, with financially sound and reputable insurers, insurance with respect to their respective properties and businesses against such casualties and contingencies, of such types, on such terms and in such amounts (including deductibles, co-insurance and self-insurance, if adequate reserves are maintained with respect thereto) as is customary in the case of entities of established reputations engaged in the same or a similar business and similarly situated.
 
The Obligors will, and will cause each other Subsidiary to, maintain and keep, or cause to be maintained and kept, their respective properties in good repair, working order and condition (other than ordinary wear and tear), so that the business carried on in connection therewith may be properly conducted at all times, provided that this Section shall not prevent any Obligor or any other Subsidiary from discontinuing the operation and the maintenance of any of its properties if such discontinuance is desirable in the conduct of its business and the Company has concluded that such discontinuance could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
 
The Obligors will, and will cause each other Subsidiary to, file all income tax or similar tax returns required to be filed in any jurisdiction and to pay and discharge all taxes shown to be due and payable on such returns and all other taxes, assessments, governmental charges, or levies imposed on them or any of their properties, assets, income or franchises, to the extent such taxes and assessments have become due and payable and before they have become delinquent and all claims for which sums have become due and payable that have or might become a Lien on properties or assets of any Obligor or any other Subsidiary, provided that neither any Obligor nor any other Subsidiary need pay any such tax or assessment or claims if
 
(i) the amount, applicability or validity thereof is contested by such Obligor or such Subsidiary on a timely basis in good faith and in appropriate proceedings, and an Obligor or another Subsidiary has established adequate reserves therefor in accordance with GAAP on its books or (ii) the nonpayment of all such taxes and assessments in the aggregate could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
 
Subject to Sections 10.6 and 10.7, each Obligor will at all times preserve and keep in full force and effect its corporate existence. Subject to Sections 10.6 and 10.7, the Company will at all times preserve and keep in full force and effect the corporate existence of each of its Subsidiaries (unless merged into the Company or a Subsidiary) and all rights and franchises of the Company and its Subsidiaries unless, in the good faith judgment of the Company, the termination of or failure to preserve and keep in full force and effect such corporate existence, right or franchise could not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.
 
The Notes and the Obligors' obligations under this Agreement will rank at least pari passu with all of the Obligors' outstanding unsecured Senior Debt.
 
(a) . The Obligors will not permit any other Material Domestic Subsidiary to become a borrower under, or to directly or indirectly guarantee any obligations of any Obligor under, any Loan Agreement unless the Obligors cause such Subsidiary, concurrently therewith, to execute and deliver a guaranty in substantially the form of Exhibit 9.7 (the "Subsidiary Guaranty"), or, if such Subsidiary Guaranty has previously been delivered, to execute and deliver a Joinder to the Subsidiary Guaranty and deliver to each holder of Notes:
Subsidiary Guarantors
(i) copies of such directors' or other authorizing resolutions, charter, bylaws and other constitutive documents of such Subsidiary as the Required Holders may reasonably request; and
(ii) an opinion of counsel covering the authorization, execution, delivery, compliance with law, no conflict with other documents, no consents and enforceability of the Subsidiary Guaranty against such Subsidiary.
(b) . If at any time (i) the aggregate assets of all of the Company's Domestic Subsidiaries that are not Obligors or Subsidiary Guarantors exceeds 20% of Consolidated Total Assets, or (ii) the Consolidated Adjusted Net Income for the four consecutive fiscal quarters most recently ended of all of the Company's Domestic Subsidiaries that are not Obligors or Subsidiary Guarantors exceeds 20% of the Company's Consolidated Adjusted Net Income for such period, the Company will, within 30 days after its senior management becomes aware (or reasonably should have become aware) of such event, cause additional Domestic Subsidiaries to execute and deliver a Joinder to the Subsidiary Guaranty so that, after giving effect
Additional Subsidiary Guarantors
 
thereto, the threshold levels in clauses (i) and (ii) above are not exceeded and shall deliver to each holder of Notes the documents listed in Section 9.7(a)(i) and (ii).
 
The Company will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to, maintain proper books of record and account in conformity with GAAP and all applicable requirements of any Governmental Authority having legal or regulatory jurisdiction over the Company or such Subsidiary, as the case may be.
 
The Obligors, jointly and severally, covenant that so long as any of the Notes are outstanding:
 
The Company will not permit the Debt to Adjusted EBITDA Ratio, as of the end of any fiscal quarter, to be greater than 3.50 to 1.00; provided that, upon notice by the Obligors to the holders of Notes, as of the last day of each of the four consecutive fiscal quarters immediately following a Qualified Acquisition, such ratio may be greater than 3.50 to 1.00, but in no event greater than 4.00 to 1.00, if the Company pays the additional interest provided for in Section 1.2.
 
The Company will not permit the ratio of Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA to Consolidated Interest Expense (in each case for the Company's then most recently completed four fiscal quarters) to be less than 2.50 to 1.00 at any time.
 
The Company will not permit Priority Debt to exceed 15% of Consolidated Total Assets (as of the end of the Company's then most recently completed fiscal quarter) at any time.
 
The Company will not, and will not permit any Subsidiary to, permit to exist, create, assume or incur, directly or indirectly, any Lien on its properties or assets, whether now owned or hereafter acquired, except:
(a) Liens for taxes, assessments or governmental charges not then due and delinquent or the nonpayment of which is permitted by Section 9.4;
(b) any attachment or judgment Lien, unless the judgment it secures has not, within 60 days after the entry thereof, been discharged or execution thereof stayed pending appeal, or has not been discharged within 60 days after the expiration of any such stay;
 
(c) Liens incidental to the conduct of business or the ownership of properties and assets (including landlords', lessors', carriers', warehousemen's, mechanics', materialmen's and other similar Liens) and Liens to secure the performance of bids, tenders, leases or trade contracts, or to secure statutory obligations (including obligations under workers compensation, unemployment insurance and other social security legislation), surety or appeal bonds or other Liens of like general nature incurred in the ordinary course of business and not in connection with the borrowing of money;
(d) encumbrances in the nature of leases, subleases, zoning restrictions, easements, rights of way, minor survey exceptions and other rights and restrictions of record on the use of real property and defects in title arising or incurred in the ordinary course of business, which, individually and in the aggregate, do not materially impair the use of the property or assets subject thereto by the Company or such Subsidiary in their business or which relate only to assets that in the aggregate are not Material;
(e) Liens securing Debt existing on property or assets of the Company or any Subsidiary as of the date of this Agreement that are described in Schedule 10.4;
(f) Liens (i) existing on property at the time of its acquisition by the Company or a Subsidiary and not created in contemplation thereof, whether or not the Debt secured by such Lien is assumed by the Company or a Subsidiary; or (ii) on property (including (Capital Leases) created contemporaneously with its acquisition or within 180 days of the acquisition or completion of construction or improvements thereof to secure or provide for all or a portion of the acquisition price or cost of construction or improvements of such property after the date of Closing; or (iii) existing on property of a Person at the time such Person is merged or consolidated with, or becomes a Subsidiary of, or substantially all of its assets are acquired by, the Company or a Subsidiary and not created in contemplation thereof; provided that such Liens do not extend to additional property of the Company or any Subsidiary (other than property that is an improvement to or is acquired for specific use in connection with the subject property) and that the aggregate principal amount of Debt secured by each such Lien does not exceed the lesser of cost of acquisition or construction or the fair market value (determined in good faith by one or more officers of the Company to whom authority to enter into the transaction has been delegated by the board of directors of the Company) of the property subject thereto;
(g) Liens resulting from extensions, renewals or replacements of Liens permitted by paragraphs (e) and (f), provided that (i) there is no increase in the principal amount or decrease in maturity of the Debt secured thereby at the time of such extension, renewal or replacement, (ii) any new Lien attaches only to the same property theretofore subject to such earlier Lien and (iii) immediately after such extension, renewal or replacement no Default or Event of Default would exist;
(h) Liens securing Debt of a Subsidiary owed to the Company or to a Wholly Owned Subsidiary;
 
(i) Liens arising in connection with a Contract Purchase Facility or a Permitted Receivables Securitization Transaction on the assets transferred in connection therewith, including proceeds and cash;
(j) Liens securing Debt not otherwise permitted by paragraphs (a) through (i) above, provided that Priority Debt does not exceed 15% of Consolidated Total Assets (as of the end of the Company's then most recently completed fiscal quarter) at any time; provided, further, that notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company will not, and will not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, secure any Debt outstanding under or pursuant to the Credit Agreement or the Term Loan Agreement pursuant to this Section 10.4(j) unless and until the Notes (and any guaranty delivered in connection therewith) shall be concurrently secured equally and ratably with such Debt pursuant to documentation reasonably acceptable to the Required Holders in substance and in form.
 
The Company will not at any time permit any Subsidiary (other than an Obligor), directly or indirectly, to create, incur, assume, guarantee, have outstanding, or otherwise become or remain directly or indirectly liable for, any Debt other than:
(a) Debt outstanding on the date hereof that is described on Schedule 10.5, and any replacement, renewal, refinancing or extension of any such Debt that (i) does not exceed the aggregate principal amount (plus accrued interest and any applicable premium and associated fees and expenses) of the Debt being replaced, renewed, refinanced or extended, (ii) does not have a Weighted Average Life to Maturity at the time of such replacement, renewal, refinancing or extension that is less than the Weighted Average Life to Maturity of the Debt being replaced, renewed, refinanced or extended and (iii) does not rank at the time of such replacement, renewal, refinancing or extension senior to the Debt being replaced, renewed, refinanced or extended;
(b) Debt owed to the Company or a Wholly Owned Subsidiary;
(c) Debt of any Subsidiary Guarantor;
(d) Debt of a Subsidiary outstanding at the time of its acquisition by the Company, provided that (i) such Debt was not incurred in contemplation of becoming a Subsidiary, and (ii) at the time of such acquisition and after giving effect thereto, no Default or Event of Default exists or would exist, and any replacement, renewal, refinancing or extension of any such Debt that (i) does not exceed the aggregate principal amount (plus accrued interest and any applicable premium and associated fees and expenses) of the Debt being replaced, renewed, refinanced or extended, (ii) does not have a Weighted Average Life to Maturity at the time of such replacement, renewal, refinancing or extension that is less than the Weighted Average Life to Maturity of the Debt being replaced, renewed, refinanced or extended and (iii) does not rank at the time of such replacement, renewal, refinancing or extension senior to the Debt being replaced, renewed, refinanced or extended;
 
(e) Debt not otherwise permitted by the preceding clauses (a) through (d), provided that immediately before and after giving effect thereto and to the application of the proceeds thereof,
(i) no Default or Event of Default exists, and
(ii) Priority Debt does not exceed 15% of Consolidated Total Assets (as of the end of the Company's then most recently completed fiscal quarter) at any time.
 
(a) The Company will not consolidate with or merge with any other Person or convey, transfer, sell or lease all or substantially all of its assets in a single transaction or series of transactions to any Person unless:
(i) the successor formed by such consolidation or the survivor of such merger or the Person that acquires by conveyance, transfer, sale or lease all or substantially all of the assets of the Company as an entirety, as the case may be, is a solvent corporation organized and existing under the laws of the United States or any state thereof (including the District of Columbia), and, if the Company is not such corporation, such corporation (A) shall have executed and delivered to each holder of any Notes its assumption of the due and punctual performance and observance of each covenant and condition of this Agreement and the Notes and (B) shall have caused to be delivered to each holder of any Notes an opinion of nationally recognized independent counsel or other independent counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Required Holders, to the effect that all agreements or instruments effecting such assumption are enforceable in accordance with their terms and comply with the terms hereof; and
(ii) immediately before and after giving effect to such transaction, no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing.
No such conveyance, transfer, sale or lease of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company shall have the effect of releasing the Company or any successor corporation that shall theretofore have become such in the manner prescribed in this Section 10.6 from its liability under this Agreement or the Notes.
(b) The Company will not permit any Subsidiary that is an Obligor to consolidate with or merge with any other Subsidiary that is not an Obligor (a "Non-Obligor Subsidiary") if such Non-Obligor Subsidiary is the successor or survivor, or convey, transfer, sell or lease all or substantially all of its assets in a single transaction or series of transactions to any Non-Obligor Subsidiary, unless:
(i) such Non-Obligor Subsidiary (A) is a solvent corporation organized and existing under the laws of the United States or any state thereof (including the District of Columbia), (B) shall have executed and delivered to each holder of any Notes its assumption of the due and punctual performance and
 
observance of each covenant and condition of this Agreement and the Notes and (C) shall have caused to be delivered to each holder of any Notes an opinion of nationally recognized independent counsel or other independent counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Required Holders, to the effect that all agreements or instruments effecting such assumption are enforceable in accordance with their terms and comply with the terms hereof; and
(ii) immediately before and after giving effect to such transaction, no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing.
 
Except as permitted by Section 10.6, the Company will not, and will not permit any Subsidiary to, make any Asset Disposition unless:
(a) in the good faith opinion of the Company, the Asset Disposition is in exchange for consideration having a fair market value at least equal to that of the property exchanged and is in the best interest of the Company or such Subsidiary;
(b) immediately after giving effect to the Asset Disposition, no Default or Event of Default would exist; and
(c) immediately after giving effect to the Asset Disposition, the Disposition Value of all property that was the subject of any Asset Disposition occurring in the then current fiscal year of the Company would not exceed 15% of Consolidated Total Assets as of the end of the then most recently completed fiscal year of the Company; and
If the Net Proceeds Amount for any Transfer is applied to a Debt Prepayment Application or a Property Reinvestment Application within 90 days before or 365 days after such Transfer, then such Transfer, only for the purpose of determining compliance with paragraph (c) of this Section 10.7 as of any date, shall be deemed not to be an Asset Disposition.
 
The Company will not and will not permit any Subsidiary to enter into directly or indirectly any Material transaction or Material group of related transactions (including without limitation the purchase, lease, sale or exchange of properties of any kind or the rendering of any service) with any Affiliate (other than the Company or another Subsidiary), except in the ordinary course of the Company's or such Subsidiary's business and upon fair and reasonable terms no less favorable to the Company or such Subsidiary than would be obtainable in a comparable arm's-length transaction with a Person not an Affiliate.
 
The Obligors will not and will not permit any Controlled Entity to (a) become a Blocked Person or (b) have any investments in or engage in any dealings or transactions with any
 
Blocked Person if such investments, dealings or transactions would cause any holder of a Note to be in violation of any laws or regulations that are applicable to such holder.
 
An "Event of Default" shall exist if any of the following conditions or events shall occur and be continuing:
(a) the Obligors default in the payment of any principal, Make-Whole Amount, if any, on any Note when the same becomes due and payable, whether at maturity or at a date fixed for prepayment or by declaration or otherwise; or
(b) the Obligors default in the payment of any interest on any Note for more than five Business Days after the same becomes due and payable; or

(f) (i) any Obligor or any other Subsidiary is in default (as principal or as guarantor or other surety) in the payment of any principal of or premium or make-whole amount or libor-breakage amount or interest on any Debt that is outstanding in an aggregate principal amount of at least the greater of $50,000,000 or 2% of Consolidated Total Assets beyond any period of grace provided with respect thereto, or (ii) any Obligor or any other Subsidiary is in default in the performance of or compliance with any term of any evidence of any Debt that is outstanding in an aggregate principal amount of at least the greater of $50,000,000 or 2% of Consolidated Total Assets or of any mortgage, indenture or other agreement relating thereto or any other condition exists, and as a consequence of such default or condition such Debt has become, or has been declared (or one or more Persons are entitled to declare such Debt to be), due and payable before its stated maturity or before its regularly scheduled dates of payment, or (iii) as a consequence of the occurrence or continuation of any event or condition (other than the passage of time or the right of the holder of Debt to convert such Debt into equity interests), (A) any Obligor or any other Subsidiary has become obligated to purchase or repay Debt before its regular maturity or before its regularly scheduled dates of payment in an aggregate outstanding principal amount of at least the greater of $50,000,000 or 2% of Consolidated Total Assets or (B) one or more Persons have the right to require any Obligor or any other Subsidiary so to purchase or repay such Debt; or
 
(g) any Obligor or any other Subsidiary (i) is generally not paying, or admits in writing its inability to pay, its debts as they become due, (ii) files, or consents by answer or otherwise to the filing against it of, a petition for relief or reorganization or arrangement or any other petition in bankruptcy, for liquidation or to take advantage of any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar law of any jurisdiction, (iii) makes an assignment for the benefit of its creditors, (iv) consents to the appointment of a custodian, receiver, trustee or other officer with similar powers with respect to it or with respect to any substantial part of its property, (v) is adjudicated as insolvent or to be liquidated, or (vi) takes corporate action for the purpose of any of the foregoing; or

(i) a final judgment or judgments for the payment of money aggregating more than the greater of $50,000,000 or 2% of Consolidated Total Assets are rendered against one or more of the Obligors and any other Subsidiaries, which judgments are not, within 60 days after entry thereof, bonded, discharged or stayed pending appeal, or are not discharged within 60 days after the expiration of such stay; or

(k) any Subsidiary Guarantor defaults in the performance of or compliance with any term contained in the Subsidiary Guaranty or the Subsidiary Guaranty ceases to be in full force and effect as a result of acts taken by the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor, except as provided in Section 22, or is declared to be null and void in whole or in material part by a court or other governmental or regulatory authority having jurisdiction or the validity or enforceability thereof shall be contested by any of the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor or any of them renounces any of the same or denies that it has any or further liability thereunder.
As used in Section 11(j), the terms "employee benefit plan" and "employee welfare benefit plan" shall have the respective meanings assigned to such terms in Section 3 of ERISA.
 
 
(a) If an Event of Default with respect to any Obligor described in paragraph (g) or (h) of Section 11 (other than an Event of Default described in clause (i) of paragraph (g) or described in clause (vi) of paragraph (g) by virtue of the fact that such clause encompasses clause (i) of paragraph (g)) has occurred, all the Notes then outstanding shall automatically become immediately due and payable.
(b) If any other Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, holders of at least 51% in principal amount of the Notes at the time outstanding may at any time at its or their option, by notice or notices to the Obligors, declare all the Notes then outstanding to be immediately due and payable.
(c) If any Event of Default described in paragraph (a) or (b) of Section 11 has occurred and is continuing, any holder or holders of Notes at the time outstanding affected by such Event of Default may at any time, at its or their option, by notice or notices to the Company, declare all the Notes held by it or them to be immediately due and payable.
Upon any Notes becoming due and payable under this Section 12.1, whether automatically or by declaration, such Notes will forthwith mature and the entire unpaid principal amount of such Notes, plus (w) all accrued and unpaid interest thereon and (x) any applicable Make-Whole Amount determined in respect of such principal amount (to the full extent permitted by applicable law), shall all be immediately due and payable, in each and every case without presentment, demand, protest or further notice, all of which are hereby waived. The Obligors acknowledge, and the parties hereto agree, that each holder of a Note has the right to maintain its investment in the Notes free from repayment by the Obligors (except as herein specifically provided for) and that the provision for payment of a Make-Whole Amount by the Obligors in the event that the Notes are prepaid or are accelerated as a result of an Event of Default, is intended to provide compensation for the deprivation of such right under such circumstances.
 
If any Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, and irrespective of whether any Notes have become or have been declared immediately due and payable under Section 12.1, the holder of any Note at the time outstanding may proceed to protect and enforce the rights of such holder by an action at law, suit in equity or other appropriate proceeding, whether for the specific performance of any agreement contained herein or in any Note, or for an injunction against a violation of any of the terms hereof or thereof, or in aid of the exercise of any power granted hereby or thereby or by law or otherwise.
 
At any time after any Notes have been declared due and payable pursuant to clause (b) or (c) of Section 12.1, the holders of at least 51% in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, by written notice to the Obligors, may rescind and annul any such declaration and its consequences if (a) the Obligors have paid all overdue interest on the Notes, all principal of and any Make-Whole Amount on any Notes that are due and payable and are unpaid other than by reason of such declaration, and all interest on such overdue principal and any Make-Whole Amount and (to the extent permitted by applicable law) any overdue interest in respect of the Notes, at the Default Rate, (b) all Events of Default and Defaults, other than non-payment of amounts that have become due solely by reason of such declaration, have been cured or have been waived pursuant to Section 17, and (c) no judgment or decree has been entered for the payment of any monies due pursuant hereto or to the Notes. No rescission and annulment under this Section 12.3 will extend to or affect any subsequent Event of Default or Default or impair any right consequent thereon.
 
No course of dealing and no delay on the part of any holder of any Note in exercising any right, power or remedy shall operate as a waiver thereof or otherwise prejudice such holder's rights, powers or remedies. No right, power or remedy conferred by this Agreement or by any Note or the Subsidiary Guaranty upon any holder thereof shall be exclusive of any other right, power or remedy referred to herein or therein or now or hereafter available at law, in equity, by statute or otherwise. Without limiting the obligations of the Obligors under Section 15, the Obligors will pay to the holder of each Note on demand such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover all costs and expenses of such holder incurred in any enforcement or collection under this Section 12, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees, expenses and disbursements.
 
 
The Company shall keep at its principal executive office a register for the registration and registration of transfers of Notes. The name and address of each holder of one or more Notes, each transfer thereof and the name and address of each transferee of one or more Notes shall be registered in such register. Prior to due presentment for registration of transfer, the Person in whose name any Note shall be registered shall be deemed and treated as the owner
 
and holder thereof for all purposes hereof, and the Company shall not be affected by any notice or knowledge to the contrary. The Company shall give to any holder of a Note that is an Institutional Investor, promptly upon request therefor, a complete and correct copy of the names and addresses of all registered holders of Notes.
 
Upon surrender of any Note at the principal executive office of the Company for registration of transfer or exchange (and in the case of a surrender for registration of transfer, duly endorsed or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer duly executed by the registered holder of such Note or his attorney duly authorized in writing and accompanied by the address for notices of each transferee of such Note or part thereof), the Obligors shall execute and deliver within five Business Days, at the Obligors' expense (except as provided below), one or more new Notes (as requested by the holder thereof) of the same series in exchange therefor, in an aggregate principal amount equal to the unpaid principal amount of the surrendered Note. Each such new Note shall be payable to such Person as such holder may request and shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit 1(a), (b) or (c) as appropriate. Each such new Note shall be dated and bear interest from the date to which interest shall have been paid on the surrendered Note or dated the date of the surrendered Note if no interest shall have been paid thereon. The Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any stamp tax or governmental charge imposed in respect of any such transfer of Notes. Notes shall not be transferred in denominations of less than $100,000, provided that if necessary to enable the registration of transfer by a holder of its entire holding of Notes, one Note may be in a denomination of less than $100,000. Any transferee, by its acceptance of a Note registered in its name (or the name of its nominee), shall be deemed to have made the representation set forth in Section 6.2.
 
Upon receipt by the Company of evidence reasonably satisfactory to it of the ownership of and the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of any Note (which evidence shall be, in the case of an Institutional Investor, notice from such Institutional Investor of such ownership and such loss, theft, destruction or mutilation), and
(a) in the case of loss, theft or destruction, of indemnity reasonably satisfactory to it (provided that if the holder of such Note is, or is a nominee for, an original Purchaser or another Institutional Investor holder of a Note with a minimum net worth of at least $50,000,000, such Person's own unsecured agreement of indemnity shall be deemed to be satisfactory), or
(b) in the case of mutilation, upon surrender and cancellation thereof,
the Obligors at their own expense shall execute and deliver within five Business Days, in lieu thereof, a new Note of the same series, dated and bearing interest from the date to which interest shall have been paid on such lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated Note or dated the date of such lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated Note if no interest shall have been paid thereon.
 
 
Subject to Section 14.2, payments of principal, Make-Whole Amount, if any, and interest becoming due and payable on the Notes shall be made in New York City at the principal office of JPMorgan Chase, NA in such jurisdiction. The Obligors may at any time, by notice to each holder of a Note, change the place of payment of the Notes so long as such place of payment shall be either the principal office of the Company in such jurisdiction or the principal office of a bank or trust company in such jurisdiction.
 
So long as you or your nominee shall be the holder of any Note, and notwithstanding anything contained in Section 14.1 or in such Note to the contrary, the Obligors will pay all sums becoming due on such Note for principal, Make-Whole Amount, if any, and interest by the method and at the address specified for such purpose below your name in Schedule A, or by such other method or at such other address as you shall have from time to time specified to the Company in writing for such purpose, without the presentation or surrender of such Note or the making of any notation thereon, except that upon written request of the Company made concurrently with or reasonably promptly after payment or prepayment in full of any Note, you shall surrender such Note for cancellation, reasonably promptly after any such request, to the Company at its principal executive office or at the place of payment most recently designated by the Company pursuant to Section 14.1. Prior to any sale or other disposition of any Note held by you or your nominee you will, at your election, either endorse thereon the amount of principal paid thereon and the last date to which interest has been paid thereon or surrender such Note to the Company in exchange for a new Note or Notes pursuant to Section 13.2. The Obligors will afford the benefits of this Section 14.2 to any Institutional Investor that is the direct or indirect transferee of any Note purchased by you under this Agreement and that has made the same agreement relating to such Note as you have made in this Section 14.2.
 
 
Whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, the Obligors will pay all costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees of a special counsel and, if reasonably required, local or other counsel) incurred by you and each Other Purchaser or holder of a Note in connection with such transactions and in connection with any amendments, waivers or consents under or in respect of this Agreement or the Notes (whether or not such amendment, waiver or consent becomes effective), including: (a) the costs and expenses incurred in enforcing or defending (or determining whether or how to enforce or defend) any rights under this Agreement or the Notes, or in responding to any subpoena or other legal process or informal investigative demand issued in connection with this Agreement or the Notes, or by reason of being a holder of any Note, (b) the costs and expenses, including financial advisors' fees, incurred in connection with the insolvency or bankruptcy of any Obligor or any other Subsidiary or in connection with any work-out or restructuring of the transactions
 
contemplated hereby and by the Notes, and (c) the costs and expenses not in excess of $3,000 incurred in connection with the initial filing of this Agreement and all related documents and financial information, and all subsequent annual and interim filings of documents and financial information related to this Agreement, with the Securities Valuation Office of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners or any successor organization succeeding to the authority thereof. The Obligors will pay, and will save you and each other holder of a Note harmless from, all claims in respect of any fees, costs or expenses if any, of brokers and finders (other than those retained by you).
 
The obligations of the Obligors under this Section 15 will survive the payment or transfer of any Note, the enforcement, amendment or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or the Notes, and the termination of this Agreement.
 
All representations and warranties contained herein shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Notes, the purchase or transfer by you of any Note or portion thereof or interest therein and the payment of any Note, and may be relied upon by any subsequent holder of a Note, regardless of any investigation made at any time by or on behalf of you or any other holder of a Note. All statements contained in any certificate or other instrument delivered by or on behalf of any Obligor pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed representations and warranties of such Obligor under this Agreement. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement and the Notes embody the entire agreement and understanding between you and the Obligors and supersede all prior agreements and understandings relating to the subject matter hereof.
 
 
This Agreement, the Notes and the Subsidiary Guaranty may be amended, and the observance of any term hereof or of the Notes may be waived (either retroactively or prospectively), with (and only with) the written consent of the Obligors and the Required Holders, except that (a) no amendment or waiver of any of the provisions of Section 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or 21 hereof, or any defined term (as it is used therein), will be effective as to you unless consented to by you in writing, and (b) no such amendment or waiver may, without the written consent of the holder of each Note at the time outstanding affected thereby, (i) subject to the provisions of Section 12 relating to acceleration or rescission, change the amount or time of any prepayment or payment of principal of, or reduce the rate or change the time of payment or method of computation of interest or of the Make-Whole Amount on, the Notes, (ii) change the percentage of the principal amount of the Notes the holders of which are required to consent to any such amendment or waiver, or (iii) amend any of Sections 8, 11(a), 11(b), 12, 17 or 20.
 
(a) . The Company will provide each holder of the Notes (irrespective of the amount of Notes then owned by it) with sufficient information, sufficiently far in advance of the date a decision is required, to enable such holder to make an informed and considered decision with respect to any proposed amendment, waiver or consent in respect of any of the provisions hereof or of the Notes. The Company will deliver executed or true and correct copies of each amendment, waiver or consent effected pursuant to the provisions of this Section 17 to each holder of outstanding Notes promptly following the date on which it is executed and delivered by, or receives the consent or approval of, the requisite holders of Notes.
Solicitation
(b) . The Obligors will not directly or indirectly pay or cause to be paid any remuneration, whether by way of supplemental or additional interest, fee or otherwise, or grant any security or provide other credit support, to any holder of Notes as consideration for or as an inducement to the entering into by any holder of Notes or any waiver or amendment of any of the terms and provisions hereof unless such remuneration is concurrently paid, or security is concurrently granted, or other credit support is concurrently provided, on the same terms, ratably to each holder of Notes then outstanding even if such holder did not consent to such waiver or amendment.
Payment
(c) . Any consent made pursuant to this Section 17 by a holder of Notes that has transferred or has agreed to transfer its Notes to any Obligor, any Subsidiary or any Affiliate of any Obligor and has provided or has agreed to provide such written consent as a condition to such transfer shall be void and of no force or effect except solely as to such holder, and any amendments effected or waivers granted or to be effected or granted that would not have been or would not be so effected or granted but for such consent (and the consents of other holders of Notes that were acquired under the same or similar conditions) shall be void and of no force or effect except solely as to such holder.
Consent in Contemplation of Transfer
 
Any amendment or waiver consented to as provided in this Section 17 applies equally to all holders of Notes and is binding upon them and upon each future holder of any Note and upon the Obligors without regard to whether such Note has been marked to indicate such amendment or waiver. No such amendment or waiver will extend to or affect any obligation, covenant, agreement, Default or Event of Default not expressly amended or waived or impair any right consequent thereon. No course of dealing between the Obligors and the holder of any Note nor any delay in exercising any rights hereunder or under any Note shall operate as a waiver of any rights of any holder of such Note. As used herein, the term "this Agreement" or "the Agreement" and references thereto shall mean this Agreement as it may from time to time be amended or supplemented.
 
Solely for the purpose of determining whether the holders of the requisite percentage of the aggregate principal amount of Notes then outstanding approved or consented to any amendment, waiver or consent to be given under this Agreement or the Notes, or have directed the taking of any action provided herein or in the Notes to be taken upon the direction of the holders of a specified percentage of the aggregate principal amount of Notes then outstanding, Notes directly or indirectly owned by any Obligor or any of its Affiliates shall be deemed not to be outstanding.
 
All notices and communications provided for hereunder shall be in writing and sent (a) by facsimile if the sender on the same day sends a confirming copy of such notice by a recognized overnight delivery service (charges prepaid), or (b) by registered or certified mail with return receipt requested (postage prepaid), or (c) by a recognized overnight delivery service (with charges prepaid). Any such notice must be sent:
(i) if to you or your nominee, to you or it at the address specified for such communications in Schedule A, or at such other address as you or it shall have specified to the Company in writing,
(ii) if to any other holder of any Note, to such holder at such address as such other holder shall have specified to the Company in writing, or
(iii) if to the Company or to the Obligors, to the Company at its address set forth at the beginning hereof to the attention of the Chief Financial Officer, or at such other address as the Company shall have specified to the holder of each Note in writing.
Notices under this Section 18 will be deemed given only when actually received.
 
This Agreement and all documents relating thereto, including, without limitation, (a) consents, waivers and modifications that may hereafter be executed, (b) documents received by you at the Closing (except the Notes themselves), and (c) financial statements, certificates and other information previously or hereafter furnished to you, may be reproduced by you by any photographic, photostatic, microfilm, microcard, miniature photographic or other similar process and you may destroy any original document so reproduced. The Obligors agree and stipulate that, to the extent permitted by applicable law, any such reproduction shall be admissible in evidence as the original itself in any judicial or administrative proceeding (whether or not the original is in existence and whether or not such reproduction was made by you in the regular course of business) and any enlargement, facsimile or further reproduction of such reproduction shall likewise be admissible in evidence. This Section 19 shall not prohibit the Obligors or any other holder of Notes from contesting any such reproduction to the same extent that it could contest the original, or from introducing evidence to demonstrate the inaccuracy of any such reproduction.
 
For the purposes of this Section 20, "Confidential Information" means information delivered to you by or on behalf of any Obligor or any other Subsidiary in connection with the transactions contemplated by or otherwise pursuant to this Agreement that is proprietary in nature and that was clearly marked or labeled or otherwise adequately identified when received by you as being confidential information of such Obligor or such Subsidiary, provided that such term does not include information that (a) was publicly known or otherwise known to you prior to the time of such disclosure, (b) subsequently becomes publicly known through no act or omission by you or any person acting on your behalf, (c) otherwise becomes known to you other than through disclosure by any Obligor or any other Subsidiary or (d) constitutes financial statements delivered to you under Section 7.1 that are otherwise publicly available. You will maintain the confidentiality of such Confidential Information in accordance with procedures adopted by you in good faith to protect confidential information of third parties delivered to you, provided that you may deliver or disclose Confidential Information to (i) your directors, trustees, officers, employees, agents, attorneys and affiliates (to the extent such disclosure reasonably relates to the administration of the investment represented by your Notes), (ii) your financial advisors and other professional advisors who agree to hold confidential the Confidential Information substantially in accordance with the terms of this Section 20, (iii) any other holder of any Note, (iv) any Institutional Investor to which you sell or offer to sell such Note or any part thereof or any participation therein (if such Person has agreed in writing prior to its receipt of such Confidential Information to be bound by the provisions of this Section 20), (v) any Person from which you offer to purchase any security of any Obligor (if such Person has agreed in writing prior to its receipt of such Confidential Information to be bound by the provisions of this Section 20), (vi) any federal or state regulatory authority having jurisdiction over you, (vii) the National Association of Insurance Commissioners or any similar organization, or any nationally recognized rating agency that requires access to information about your investment portfolio or (viii) any other Person to which such delivery or disclosure may be necessary or appropriate (w) to effect compliance with any law, rule, regulation or order applicable to you, (x) in response to any subpoena or other legal process, (y) in connection with any litigation to which you are a party or (z) if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, to the extent you may reasonably determine such delivery and disclosure to be necessary or appropriate in the enforcement or for the protection of the rights and remedies under your Notes and this Agreement. Each holder of a Note, by its acceptance of a Note, will be deemed to have agreed to be bound by and to be entitled to the benefits of this Section 20 as though it were a party to this Agreement. On reasonable request by the Obligors in connection with the delivery to any holder of a Note of information required to be delivered to such holder under this Agreement or requested by such holder (other than a holder that is a party to this Agreement or its nominee), such holder will enter into an agreement with the Obligors embodying the provisions of this Section 20.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein or in any other written or oral understanding or agreement to which the parties hereto are parties or by which they are bound, the parties acknowledge and agree that (i) any obligations of confidentiality contained herein and therein do not apply and have not applied from the commencement of discussions between the parties to the tax treatment and tax structure of the Notes (and any related transactions or arrangements), and (ii) each party (and each of its employees, representatives, or
 
other agents) may disclose to any and all persons, without limitation of any kind, the tax treatment and tax structure of the Notes and all materials of any kind (including opinions or other tax analyses) that are provided to such party relating to such tax treatment and tax structure, all within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.6011-4.
 
You shall have the right to substitute any one of your Affiliates as the purchaser of the Notes that you have agreed to purchase hereunder, by written notice to the Obligors, which notice shall be signed by both you and such Affiliate, shall contain such Affiliate's agreement to be bound by this Agreement and shall contain a confirmation by such Affiliate of the accuracy with respect to it of the representations set forth in Section 6. Upon receipt of such notice, wherever the word "you" is used in this Agreement (other than in this Section 21), such word shall be deemed to refer to such Affiliate in lieu of you. In the event that such Affiliate is so substituted as a purchaser hereunder and such Affiliate thereafter transfers to you all of the Notes then held by such Affiliate, upon receipt by the Company of notice of such transfer, wherever the word "you" is used in this Agreement (other than in this Section 21), such word shall no longer be deemed to refer to such Affiliate, but shall refer to you, and you shall have all the rights of an original holder of the Notes under this Agreement.
 
(a) . Each holder of a Note fully releases and discharges, immediately and without any further act, any Obligor, other than the Company, from its obligations under this Agreement and the Notes, or any Subsidiary Guarantor from the Subsidiary Guaranty, if such Obligor or Subsidiary Guarantor ceases to be a Subsidiary as a result of an Asset Disposition permitted by Section 10.7, provided that, at the time of such release and discharge, the Company delivers to each holder of Notes a certificate of a Responsible Officer certifying that such Obligor or Subsidiary Guarantor is being so released pursuant to this Section 22(a) and setting forth the facts and calculations necessary to establish compliance with Section 10.7.
Release Due to Asset Disposition
(b) . Each holder of a Note fully releases and discharges, immediately and without any further act, any Obligor, other than the Company, from its obligations under this Agreement and the Notes, or any Subsidiary Guarantor from the Subsidiary Guaranty at such time as the banks party to all Loan Agreements to which such Obligor or Subsidiary Guarantor is a party release and discharge such Subsidiary Guarantor from any Guaranties thereunder or as a borrower thereunder; provided that,
Release Due to Release Under Loan Agreements
(i) no Default or Event of Default exists or will exist immediately following such release and discharge of such Obligor or Subsidiary Guarantor;
(ii) if any fee or other consideration is paid or given to any holder of Debt under any Loan Agreement in connection with such release and discharge of an Obligor or Subsidiary Guarantor, other than the repayment of all or a portion
 
of such Debt under any applicable Loan Agreement, each holder of a Note receives equivalent consideration on a pro rata basis; and
(iii) at the time of such release and discharge, the Company delivers to each holder of Notes a certificate of a Responsible Officer certifying (x) that such Obligor or Subsidiary Guarantor has been or is being released and discharged as guarantor or borrower under and in respect of all applicable Loan Agreements and (y) as to the matters set forth in clauses (i) and (ii).
 
 
All covenants and other agreements contained in this Agreement by or on behalf of any of the parties hereto bind and inure to the benefit of their respective successors and assigns (including, without limitation, any subsequent holder of a Note) whether so expressed or not.
 
Anything in this Agreement or the Notes to the contrary notwithstanding (but without limiting the requirement in Section 8.3 that the notice of any optional prepayment specify a Business Day as the date fixed for such prepayment), any payment of principal of or Make-Whole Amount or interest on any Note that is due on a date other than a Business Day shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day without including the additional days elapsed in the computation of the interest payable on such next succeeding Business Day; provided that if the maturity date of any Note is a date other than a Business Day, the payment otherwise due on such maturity date shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day and shall include the additional days elapsed in the computation of interest payable on such next succeeding Business Day.
 
(a) All accounting terms used herein that are not expressly defined in this Agreement have the meanings respectively given to them in accordance with GAAP. Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, (i) all computations made pursuant to this Agreement shall be made in accordance with GAAP, and (ii) all financial statements shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP.
(b) For purposes of determining compliance with the financial covenants contained in this Agreement, any election by the Company to measure any financial liability using fair value (as permitted by Accounting Standard Codification Topic No. 825-10-25  or any similar accounting standard) shall be disregarded and such determination shall be made as if such election had not been made.
Fair Value Option
(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company notifies the holders of Notes that, in the Company's reasonable opinion, or if the Required Holders notify the Company that, in the Required Holders' reasonable opinion, as a result of a change in
 
GAAP after the date of this Agreement, any covenant contained in Sections 10.1 through 10.5 and Section 10.7, or any of the defined terms used therein no longer apply as intended such that such covenants are materially more or less restrictive to the Company than as at the date of this Agreement, the Company shall negotiate in good faith with the holders of Notes to make any necessary adjustments to such covenant or defined term to provide the holders of the Notes with substantially the same protection as such covenant provided prior to the relevant change in GAAP. Until the Company and the Required Holders so agree to reset, amend or establish alternative covenants or defined terms, (i) the covenants contained in Sections 10.1 through 10.5 and Section 10.7, together with the relevant defined terms, shall continue to apply and compliance therewith shall be determined on the basis of GAAP in effect at the date of this Agreement and (ii) each set of financial statements delivered to holders of Notes pursuant to Section 7.1(a) or (b) during such time shall include detailed reconciliations reasonably satisfactory to the Required Holders as to the effect of such change in GAAP.
 
Any provision of this Agreement that is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall (to the full extent permitted by law) not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.
 
Each covenant contained herein shall be construed (absent express provision to the contrary) as being independent of each other covenant contained herein, so that compliance with any one covenant shall not (absent such an express contrary provision) be deemed to excuse compliance with any other covenant. Where any provision herein refers to action to be taken by any Person, or which such Person is prohibited from taking, such provision shall be applicable whether such action is taken directly or indirectly by such Person.
 
This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original but all of which together shall constitute one instrument. Each counterpart may consist of a number of copies hereof, each signed by less than all, but together signed by all, of the parties hereto.
 
This Agreement shall be construed and enforced in accordance with, and the rights of the parties shall be governed by, the law of the State of New York excluding choice-of-law principles of the law of such State that would require the application of the laws of a jurisdiction other than such State.
Each Obligor irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York and of the courts of the United States of America having jurisdiction in the State of
 
New York for the purpose of any legal action or proceeding in any such court with respect to, or arising out of, this Agreement or the Notes. Each Obligor consents to process being served in any suit, action or proceeding by mailing a copy thereof by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, to the address of such Obligor specified in or designated pursuant to this Agreement. Each Obligor agrees that such service upon receipt (i) shall be deemed in every respect effective service of process upon it in any such suit, action or proceeding and (ii) shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be taken and held to be valid personal service upon and personal delivery to such Obligor.
 
If you are in agreement with the foregoing, please sign the form of agreement on the accompanying counterpart of this Agreement and return it to the Company, whereupon the foregoing shall become a binding agreement between you and the Obligors.

EXHIBIT 4.4(a)
The opinions of Briggs and Morgan and of Matthew L. Levitt, Esq., counsel to the Obligors, shall be to the effect that:
1. Each Obligor and each other Subsidiary organized under the laws of the United States or any state thereof (including the District of Columbia) is a corporation or limited partnership validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization, and each has all requisite corporate or partnership power and authority to own and operate its properties, to carry on its business as now conducted, and, in the case of each Obligor, to enter into and perform the Agreement and to issue and sell the Notes.
2. The Agreement and the Notes have been duly authorized by proper corporate action on the part of each Obligor, have been duly executed and delivered by an authorized officer of each Obligor and constitute the legal, valid and binding agreements of each Obligor, enforceable in accordance with their terms, except to the extent that enforcement thereof may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws of general application relating to or affecting the enforcement of the rights of creditors or by equitable principles, regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding in equity or at law.
3. A Minnesota court, or a Federal court sitting in Minnesota, would honor the choice of New York law to govern the Agreement and the Notes.
4. The offer, sale and delivery of the Notes do not require the registration of the Notes under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the qualification of an indenture under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended.
5. No authorization, approval or consent of, and no designation, filing, declaration, registration and/or qualification with, any Governmental Authority is necessary or required in connection with the execution, delivery and performance by each Obligor of the Note Purchase Agreement or the offer, issuance and sale by each Obligor of the Notes.
6. The issuance and sale of the Notes by each Obligor, and the execution, delivery and performance by each Obligor of the terms and conditions of the Notes and the Agreement do not result in any breach or violation of any of the provisions of, or constitute a default under, or result in the creation or imposition of any Lien on, the property of any Obligor or any other Subsidiary pursuant to the provisions of (i) the certificate or articles of incorporation or bylaws, or other organizational documents of any Obligor or any other Subsidiary, (ii) the Credit Agreement or any other loan or receivables purchase or sale agreement to which any Obligor or any other Subsidiary is a party or by which any of them or their property is bound, (iii) any other agreement or instrument to which any Obligor or any other Subsidiary is a party or by which any of them or their property is bound that is filed (or incorporated by reference) as an exhibit to the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 28, 2007 or any other report or registration statement subsequently filed by the Company with the
 
Securities and Exchange Commission, (iv) any law (including usury laws) or regulation applicable to any Obligor, or (v) to the knowledge of such counsel, any order, writ, injunction or decree of any court or Governmental Authority applicable to any Obligor.
7. Except as disclosed in Schedule 5.8 to the Note Purchase Agreement, to such counsel's knowledge there are no actions, suits or proceedings pending, or threatened against the Company or any Subsidiary, at law or in equity or before or by any Governmental Authority, that are likely to result, individually or in the aggregate, in a Material Adverse Effect.
8. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is an "investment company" or a company "controlled" by an "investment company," as such terms are defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
9. The issuance of the Notes and the intended use of the proceeds of the sale of the Notes do not violate or conflict with Regulation U, T or X of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.
The opinions of Briggs and Morgan and of Matthew L. Levitt, Esq. shall cover such other matters relating to the sale of the Notes as the Purchasers may reasonably request. With respect to matters of fact on which such opinions are based, such counsel shall be entitled to rely on appropriate certificates of public officials and officers of the Obligors. With respect to matters governed by the laws of any jurisdiction other than the United States of America and the State of Minnesota, such counsel may rely upon the opinions of counsel deemed (and stated in their opinion to be deemed) by them to be competent and reliable. For purposes of their opinion as to enforceability in Section 2 and as to no conflicts with laws in Section 6(iv), such counsel may assume that Minnesota law governs the Note Purchase Agreement and the Notes. Such opinions shall state that subsequent transferees and assignees of the Notes may rely thereon.
 
EXHIBIT 4.4(b)
The opinion of Foley & Lardner LLP, special counsel to the Purchasers, shall be to the effect that:
1. The Agreement and the Notes have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by and constitute the legal, valid and binding agreements of each Obligor, enforceable in accordance with their terms, except to the extent that enforcement thereof may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws of general application relating to or affecting the enforcement of the rights of creditors or by equitable principles, regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding in equity or at law.
2. Based on the representations set forth in the Agreement, the offer, sale and delivery of the Notes and delivery of the Subsidiary Guaranty do not require the registration of the Notes or the Subsidiary Guaranty under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the qualification of an indenture under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended.
3. No approval, consent or withholding of objection on the part of, or filing, registration or qualification with, any governmental body, Federal or state, is necessary in connection with the execution and delivery of the Note Purchase Agreement or the Notes.
For purposes of its opinion in paragraph 1 as to authorization, execution and delivery, Foley & Lardner LLP may rely on the opinions of Briggs and Morgan and of Matthew L. Levitt, Esq. delivered to you pursuant to the Agreement. The opinion of Foley & Lardner LLP shall state that such opinions are satisfactory in form and scope to it, and that, in its opinion, the Purchasers and it are justified in relying thereon. The opinion shall state that subsequent transferees and assignees of the Notes may rely thereon and shall cover such other matters relating to the sale of the Notes as the Purchasers may reasonably request.

SECTION 3. . The obligations of each Guarantor under this Guaranty shall be primary, absolute and unconditional obligations of each Guarantor, shall not be subject to any counterclaim, set-off, deduction, diminution, abatement, recoupment, suspension, deferment, reduction or defense based upon any claim each Guarantor or any other person may have against the Obligors or any other person, and to the full extent permitted by applicable law shall remain in full force and effect without regard to, and shall not be released, discharged or in any way affected by, any circumstance or condition whatsoever (whether or not each Guarantor or the Obligors shall have any knowledge or notice thereof), including:

(f) any voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, arrangement, readjustment, assignment for the benefit of creditors, composition, receivership, conservatorship, custodianship, liquidation, marshaling of assets and liabilities or similar proceedings with respect to the Obligors, any Guarantor or to any other person or any of their respective properties or creditors, or any action taken by any trustee or receiver or by any court in any such proceeding;
(g) any discharge, termination, cancellation, frustration, irregularity, invalidity or unenforceability, in whole or in part, of any of the Note Documents or any other agreement or instrument referred to in paragraph (a) above or any term hereof;

(k) any other occurrence, circumstance, happening or event whatsoever, whether similar or dissimilar to the foregoing, whether foreseen or unforeseen, and any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable defense or
 
discharge of the liabilities of a guarantor or surety or which might otherwise limit recourse against any Guarantor.
Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Guaranty, each Guarantor's liability with respect to the principal amount of the Notes shall be no greater than the liability of the Obligors with respect thereto.
SECTION 4. . The obligations of each Guarantor set forth herein constitute the full recourse obligations of such Guarantor enforceable against it to the full extent of all its assets and properties.
Full Recourse Obligations
SECTION 5. . Each Guarantor unconditionally waives, to the extent permitted by applicable law, (a) notice of any of the matters referred to in Section 3, (b) notice to such Guarantor of the incurrence of any of the Obligations, notice to such Guarantor or the Obligors of any breach or default by such Obligors with respect to any of the Obligations or any other notice that may be required, by statute, rule of law or otherwise, to preserve any rights of the Holders against such Guarantor, (c) presentment to or demand of payment from the Obligors or the Guarantor with respect to any amount due under any Note Document or protest for nonpayment or dishonor, (d) any right to the enforcement, assertion or exercise by any of the Holders of any right, power, privilege or remedy conferred in the Note Purchase Agreement or any other Note Document or otherwise, (e) any requirement of diligence on the part of any of the Holders, (f) any requirement to exhaust any remedies or to mitigate the damages resulting from any default under any Note Document, (g) any notice of any sale, transfer or other disposition by any of the Holders of any right, title to or interest in the Note Purchase Agreement or in any other Note Document and (h) any other circumstance whatsoever which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge, release or defense of a guarantor or surety or which might otherwise limit recourse against such Guarantor.
Waiver
SECTION 6. . Until one year and one day after all Obligations have been indefeasibly paid in full, each Guarantor agrees not to take any action pursuant to any rights which may have arisen in connection with this Guaranty to be subrogated to any of the rights (whether contractual, under the United States Bankruptcy Code, as amended, including Section 509 thereof, under common law or otherwise) of any of the Holders against the Obligors or against any collateral security or guaranty or right of offset held by the Holders for the payment of the Obligations. Until one year and one day after all Obligations have been indefeasibly paid in full, each Guarantor agrees not to take any action pursuant to any contractual, common law, statutory or other rights of reimbursement, contribution, exoneration or indemnity (or any similar right) from or against the Obligors which may have arisen in connection with this Guaranty. So long as the Obligations remain, if any amount shall be paid by or on behalf of the Obligors to any Guarantor on account of any of the rights waived in this paragraph, such amount shall be held by such Guarantor in trust, segregated from other funds of such Guarantor, and shall, forthwith upon receipt by such Guarantor, be turned over to the Holders (duly endorsed by such Guarantor to the Holders, if required), to be applied against the Obligations, whether matured or unmatured, in such order as the Holders may determine. The provisions of this paragraph shall survive the term of this Guaranty and the payment in full of the Obligations.
Subrogation, Contribution, Reimbursement or Indemnity
 
SECTION 7. . This Guaranty shall continue to be effective or be automatically reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, in whole or in part, of any of the sums due to any of the Holders pursuant to the terms of the Note Purchase Agreement or any other Note Document is rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned by such Holder upon the insolvency, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation or reorganization of the Obligors or any other person, or upon or as a result of the appointment of a custodian, receiver, trustee or other officer with similar powers with respect to the Obligors or other person or any substantial part of its property, or otherwise, all as though such payment had not been made. If an event permitting the acceleration of the maturity of the principal amount of the Notes shall at any time have occurred and be continuing, and such acceleration shall at such time be prevented by reason of the pendency against the Obligors or any other person of a case or proceeding under a bankruptcy or insolvency law, each Guarantor agrees that, for purposes of this Guaranty and its obligations hereunder, the maturity of the principal amount of the Notes and all other Obligations shall be deemed to have been accelerated with the same effect as if any Holder had accelerated the same in accordance with the terms of the Note Purchase Agreement or other applicable Note Document, and such Guarantor shall forthwith pay such principal amount, Make-Whole Amount, if any, and interest thereon and any other amounts guaranteed hereunder without further notice or demand.
Effect of Bankruptcy Proceedings, etc
SECTION 8. . This Guaranty and all guaranties, covenants and agreements of each Guarantor contained herein shall continue in full force and effect and shall not be discharged until such time as all of the Obligations shall be paid and performed in full and all of the agreements of such Guarantor hereunder shall be duly paid and performed in full.
