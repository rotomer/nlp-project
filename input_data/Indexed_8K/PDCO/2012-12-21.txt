Item 8.01 Other Events
On December 21, 2012, the Company entered into a stock repurchase plan established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "1934 Act"), in connection with its previously authorized stock repurchase program. A Rule 10b5-1 plan allows a company to repurchase its shares at times when it otherwise might be unable to do so under the 1934 Act's insider trading rules.
The Company's 10b5-1 repurchase plan (the "Plan") will facilitate purchases of the Company's common shares under its authorized stock repurchase program, which authorizes the repurchase of 25 million shares and expires March 15, 2016.
The Company's designated broker will have authority under the Plan to repurchase shares of the Company's common stock effective December 24, 2012 and expiring February 26, 2013 (the "Plan Period"), unless terminated earlier in accordance with the terms of the Plan. Because the repurchases under the Plan will be subject to specified parameters and certain price and volume restraints as established in the Plan, there is no guarantee as to the exact number of shares that will be repurchased, or that there will be any repurchases at all pursuant to the Plan.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
