These results excluded a below-the-line benefit of $370 million or $1.64 per share related to the adoption of a new accounting standard for fossil and nuclear decommissioning and also excluded charges of $15 million or 6 cents per share related to discontinued operations at PSEG Energy Technologies. Comparatively, earnings from ongoing operations for the first quarter of 2002 were $181 million or 88 cents per share, based on 206 million average shares outstanding. These results included charges of $31 million or 15 cents for currency-related write-downs on the company's former Argentine investments. The 88 cents per share also excluded below-the-line charges of $121 million or 59 cents per share primarily related to the adoption of a new accounting standard for goodwill. Attachments to this release provide a summary of 2003 and 2002 results and details of quarterly results for PSEG's principal subsidiaries - Public Service Electric and Gas Company (PSE&G), PSEG Power and PSEG Energy Holdings. The first-quarter results were announced today at PSEG's Annual Meeting of Stockholders in Newark, NJ. Thomas M. O'Flynn, PSEG's chief financial officer, said solid contributions by PSEG Power and PSE&G accounted for overall strong results for the quarter. O'Flynn said the principal driver at PSEG Power was the effective management of its electric and natural gas portfolio. "This includes meeting its obligations under Basic Generation Service (BGS) contracts with suppliers of electric energy to New Jersey's utilities, including PSE&G, as well as a Basic Gas Supply Service (BGSS) contract with PSE&G."
EXHIBIT 99 The BGSS and the BGS contracts became effective on May 1 and August 1, 2002, respectively. "The impact of these contracts helped provide Power with ongoing results that were more than 35% higher than achieved in the first quarter of last year," O'Flynn said. In addition, O'Flynn said PSEG Power benefited in the first quarter from its operation of two generating facilities in Connecticut. "Power acquired and began operating these assets in December 2002," he said. "The facilities provide more than 1,000 megawatts of capacity, half of which is under contract. The other half is available at market prices in the attractive, energy-constrained, southern Connecticut region." Colder weather, causing greater demand for heating, was the key driver for PSE&G during the first quarter. This improved PSE&G's earnings by 18 cents per share when compared to the results produced during the mild winter last year and helped to offset higher operations and maintenance expenses, pension and other costs. "Despite the weather benefits this quarter, PSE&G continues to produce low returns as a result of no electric rate relief for more than a decade," O'Flynn said. "We expect that a fair outcome of our pending electric rate case will correct this situation." In discussing other factors affecting PSEG's first-quarter earnings from ongoing operations, O'Flynn said that PSEG Energy Holdings showed an improvement largely due to the timing of an annual payment under PSEG Global's Eagle Point cogeneration contract and to the absence of the currency-related charges in Argentina that were recorded in 2002. Regarding PSEG's adoption of SFAS #143 for fossil and nuclear decommissioning, O'Flynn said: "The first-quarter gain of $370 million or $1.64 per share is not included in our earnings guidance for 2003, which is based on ongoing results. However, the benefit to the equity balance will strengthen our balance sheet." O'Flynn added that the issuance of 19 million shares of common stock last year had the effect of reducing consolidated results from ongoing operations by 14 cents per share for the quarter. Other Key First-Quarter Developments The state of New Jersey conducted its second BGS auction in February, in which PSE&G was successful in securing contracts for all its load obligations. The auction contained three components: a 10-month, energy and capacity requirement for two thirds of the residential and small commercial load, a 34-month energy and capacity requirement for the remaining one third and a 10-month, capacity-only obligation for the state's largest industrial and commercial customers. The 10- and 34-month time frames were used to reset the starting point for future contracts to June 1 - the start of the peak summer season and the beginning of the PJM ISO calendar year. PSEG Power also successfully participated in the auction, securing contracts consistent with its targeted range of 75% of its PJM capacity. Power was again an indirect participant in the 10- and 34-month auctions, entering into contracts with the direct suppliers of energy to New Jersey's utilities. Power was a direct participant in the capacity-only auction. In March, the company successfully closed on two, 364-day credit facilities to replace an expiring $695 million of maturing facilities at PSEG. The new facilities -- a $250 million joint
EXHIBIT 99 facility at PSEG/PSEG Power and a $350 million PSEG facility -- include more flexible terms and were oversubscribed, according to O'Flynn. At the end of the first quarter, PSEG had $1.9 billion of liquidity available under its $2.4 billion of credit facilities. "Of the total, we have $2.0 billion of facilities with maturities in 2004 and beyond," O'Flynn said. "This year we need to renew only a $200 million facility at our utility and we do not plan to renew a $200 million facility at PSEG Energy Holdings due to reduced needs and an existing $495 million facility that matures next year." 2003 Financial Outlook O'Flynn said first-quarter results supported PSEG's expectations for 2003 earnings from ongoing operations. He reiterated EPS guidance of $3.70 to $3.90. "In support of our guidance, we expect Power to produce ongoing results between $475 and $520 million," O'Flynn said. "The range is somewhat wide because subsequent quarters may not be as strong as the first due to the interplay between fuel and electric prices, the operational status of our generation fleet and the uncertain impact of weather, particularly in the summer months." PSE&G is projecting earnings in the range of $210 to $230 million, reflecting the favorable impact from weather in the first quarter and anticipating a reasonable outcome in its electric rate case, which is now pending before the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities. As the final step in the state's deregulation process, new electric rates are scheduled to become effective on August 1, 2003. PSEG Energy Holdings is forecasting 2003 ongoing results in the range of $145 to $155 million. "With the commercial operation of PSEG Global's new generating facilities in California and Poland, we expect Energy Holdings to perform slightly better than it did in 2002," O'Flynn said. O'Flynn added that there are additional parent-level interest costs of approximately $25 to $30 million that are not included in the expectations for each company. Note: Thomas M. O'Flynn, chief financial officer of PSEG, will discuss the results for the first quarter of 2003 during a live internet webcast on www.pseg.com tomorrow (April 16) at 11 a.m. In addition, our annual Financial and Statistical Review can also be found on our website, www.pseg.com.
