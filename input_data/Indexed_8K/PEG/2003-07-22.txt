EXHIBIT 99 [LETTERHEAD OF PSEG] July 22, 2003 PSEG ANNOUNCES SECOND-QUARTER 2003 EARNINGS: 66 CENTS PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS Solid Energy Portfolio Management at PSEG Power Is Key Driver In Producing Earnings Consistent with 2003 Guidance of $3.70 to $3.90 Per Share PSEG Issues Initial 2004 Guidance of $3.75 to $3.95 per share Public Service Enterprise Group (PSEG) announced today (July 22) that earnings from continuing operations for the second quarter of 2003 were $150 million or 66 cents per share of common stock, based on 227 million average shares outstanding. These results exclude two after-tax, below-the-line items. The first is an extraordinary charge of $18 million or 8 cents per share related to the recent conclusion of Public Service Electric and Gas Company's (PSE&G) electric base rate case. The second item is $2 million or 1 cent per share related to discontinued operations at PSEG Energy Technologies. Including these items, PSEG's reported earnings for the quarter were $130 million or 57 cents per share. For the six months through June 30, 2003, PSEG produced earnings from continuing operations of $471 million or $2.09 per share, based on 226 million average shares outstanding. Excluded from these results are a net benefit of $335 million or $1.48 per share related to the adoption of a new accounting standard for fossil and nuclear decommissioning in the first quarter, the effect of the extraordinary charge due to the finalization of the electric base rate case in the second quarter and the reporting of discontinued operations for Energy Technologies for both quarters. Including these items, PSEG's reported earnings for the first half of the year were $806 million or $3.57 per share. Attachments to this release provide a summary of 2003 and 2002 results and details of the quarterly and year-to-date results for PSEG's principal subsidiaries -- Public Service Electric and Gas Company (PSE&G), PSEG Power and PSEG Energy Holdings. Thomas M. O'Flynn, PSEG's chief financial officer, said that the solid second quarter results -- representing a 10-cents per share improvement over comparable results for the second quarter of 2002, which excluded losses relating to PSEG Energy Holdings' Argentine investments -- were primarily driven by the strength of PSEG Power's energy portfolio management, favorable weather impacts on PSE&G's sales and higher investment income at PSEG Resources.
EXHIBIT 99 O'Flynn said PSEG Power continues to benefit from its ability to optimize its generation assets around the basic generation supply (BGS) contracts offered in New Jersey. "Our ability to combine electric generation, fuel supply, trading and purchased power costs effectively to meet the needs of BGS suppliers is reflected in PSEG's year over year earnings improvement," he said. "Looking ahead, these skills will be especially important during the peak electric demand months of the third quarter." Outside New Jersey, PSEG Power continued to benefit from the 2002 acquisition of two generating facilities in Connecticut, O'Flynn added. PSE&G had a benefit in the second quarter due to weather. The unusually cold spring resulted in higher gas heating demand in April, partially offset by lower electric cooling demands in June. Also in the second quarter, the decision by the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (BPU) in PSE&G's electric base rate case marked a major final step in the transition process to a deregulated electric market that began in 1999. The extraordinary charge recorded in the second quarter resulted from the disallowance of some previously recognized revenues related to nuclear decommissioning. In deciding the rate case, the BPU approved an increase in annual revenues of $159.5 million, effective August 1. "Even with the increase, customer rates will still be slightly below levels before the start of the four-year transition to deregulation," O'Flynn said. "During that four-year period, customers enjoyed rate discounts of up to 14%." O'Flynn said there were several positive developments at PSEG Energy Holdings. "Two of PSEG Global's generation projects have been completed -- one in Oman that began operation in May and the other in California that was placed in service this month," he said. "There were also improvements at both generating units in Texas in which Global has investments. And, in Brazil, Global's distribution business received a significant rate increase. "In addition, there were improvements in the credit quality and liquidity of several lessees of merchant energy facilities in which PSEG Resources has invested." O'Flynn said Holdings' results for the second-quarter were, however, impacted by the timing of an annual payment for PSEG Global's share of the Eagle Point facility. The payment was received in the first quarter this year, compared to the second quarter of last year. The absence of the payment in the second quarter was partially offset by improved performance of the securities in the KKR portfolio in 2003 compared to 2002. "PSEG's overall second-quarter results were consistent with our objectives for the first half of the year and keeps us on track to achieve 2003 earnings from continuing operations in the range of $3.70 to $3.90 per share." O'Flynn said. "We anticipate a solid second half of the year, barring unforeseen circumstances."
EXHIBIT 99 O'Flynn said PSEG, anticipating its solid performance will continue into next year, has set initial 2004 earnings guidance at $3.75 to $3.95 per share. While the company is still early in its business planning stages for the next five years, he said its results next year would benefit from, among other factors: The effect of PSEG Power's contracts with BGS suppliers to New Jersey's utility customers at higher prices established in an auction conducted by the Board of Public Utilities (BPU). The higher prices will be effective August 1 through next May 31. This will help offset the elimination of the market transition charge (MTC) at the conclusion of the transition period this year. A full year's effect of $159.5 million of additional electric distribution revenues from customers of PSE&G, which were approved by the BPU effective August 1. =============================================================================== FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENT Readers are cautioned that statements contained in this press release about our and our subsidiaries' future performance, including future revenues, earnings, strategies, prospects and all other statements that are not purely historical, are forward-looking statements for purposes of the safe harbor provisions under The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
