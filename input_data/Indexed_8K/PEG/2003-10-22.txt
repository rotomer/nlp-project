Item 9. Regulation FD Disclosure - --------------------------------- On October 22, 2003, PSEG announced unaudited financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2003. A copy of the press release of earnings dated October 22, 2003 is furnished as Exhibit 99 to this Form 8-K. The information contained in Item 9 of this report is being furnished pursuant to Item 12 under Item 9 as directed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. To supplement PSEG's consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the Company uses non-GAAP measures of pro forma operating income and pro forma operating income per share which does not include losses relating to the impairment and operations of Energy Holdings' Argentine investments in 2002.

The Company believes that the inclusion of non-GAAP financial measures provides consistent and comparable measures to help shareholders understand PSEG's current and future operating results. PSEG urges shareholders to carefully review the GAAP financial information included as part of the PSEG's Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and quarterly press releases of earnings. 2

EXHIBIT 99 [LETTERHEAD OF PSEG] October 22, 2003 PSEG ANNOUNCES THIRD-QUARTER 2003 EARNINGS: 93 CENTS PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS Results Reflect Impact of Storm-Related Weather on PSEG Power And Higher Electric Base Rates at PSE&G Company Reiterates Earnings Per Share Guidance of $3.60 to $3.75 for 2003 and $3.60 to $3.80 for 2004 Public Service Enterprise Group (PSEG) announced today (October 22) that earnings from continuing operations for the third quarter of 2003 were $213 million or 93 cents per share of common stock, based on 228 million average shares outstanding. These results exclude a net loss of $3 million or 1 cent per share related to discontinued operations at PSEG Energy Technologies. Including these items, PSEG's reported earnings for the quarter were $210 million or 92 cents per share of common stock. For the nine months through September 30, 2003, PSEG produced earnings from continuing operations of $684 million or $3.02 per share, based on 226 million average shares outstanding. Excluded from these results is a net benefit of $332 million or $1.47 per share related to the positive impact of the adoption of a new accounting standard for fossil and nuclear decommissioning in the first quarter, partially offset by the effects of an extraordinary charge due to the finalization of the electric base rate case in the second quarter and the reporting of discontinued operations for Energy Technologies for all three quarters. Including these items, PSEG's reported earnings for the first nine months of the year were $1.02 billion or $4.49 per share of common stock. Attachments to this release provide a summary of 2003 and 2002 results and details of the quarterly and year-to-date results for PSEG's principal subsidiaries - Public Service Electric and Gas Company (PSE&G), PSEG Power and PSEG Energy Holdings. Thomas M. O'Flynn, PSEG's chief financial officer, said that generally strong results for the quarter were offset by unexpected, storm-related expenditures at both PSEG Power and PSE&G and by the dilutive effect of additional shares of common stock. "The impact of Hurricane Isabel and storms in Pennsylvania and central Jersey in late September had a combined impact of about 8 cents per share in the quarter," O'Flynn said. "In particular, the hurricane caused heavy salt spray from the Delaware Bay to coat the electrical
equipment outside our three nuclear units in south Jersey. We shut down the plants for about a week to clean the equipment. There was no effect on the units themselves, but we had to purchase replacement power." On a quarterly comparative basis, PSEG Power's results were down about 11 cents per share, including the dilutive effect of 17 million additional shares of common stock issued by PSEG in November 2002. O'Flynn said the cost of replacement power due to the shutdown of the units resulted in PSEG Power's reducing its 2003 earnings expectations by about $20 million. This replacement power cost, combined with PSEG's issuance of more than 8 million additional shares of common stock in October 2003, resulted in PSEG's decision to lower its overall 2003 earnings expectations by 10 to 15 cents per share to a range of $3.60 to $3.75. "Although it was a difficult decision to issue common equity, we are pleased with the results and the incremental balance sheet strength and financial flexibility we have gained," O'Flynn said. For PSE&G, August 1 marked the beginning of new electric base rates in line with the conclusion of New Jersey's four-year industry restructuring and the elimination of customer discounts that approached 14% in the final year. PSE&G earned 4 cents per share more this year than in the third quarter of 2002. "With the transition period now complete, the utility is earning returns that support our investments designed to ensure customer reliability," O'Flynn said. "These investments have been made since the last base rate increase a decade ago. However, the effect of the higher rates for two months was largely offset by relatively higher O&M costs. This increase in O&M was not unexpected. Last year, PSE&G engaged in an aggressive, but temporary, cost-containment program to offset the financial impact of the mild winter in 2002. Most of the cost savings occurred in the last half of 2002. Absent the impact from storm-related activities, O&M for the third quarter of this year was in line with our expectations." PSEG Energy Holdings' results for the third quarter generally paralleled 2002 third-quarter results. O'Flynn said this was due in part to the expansion of generation projects in California and to improved contributions by projects in Texas, which offset lower income from leveraged lease investments at PSEG Resources. In looking ahead, O'Flynn said the recent common stock sale in October resulted in PSEG's reducing 2004 earnings guidance by about 15 cents per share to a range of $3.60 to $3.80. "In general, PSEG remains fundamentally strong on several fronts," O'Flynn said. "We were on target to achieve our initial earnings expectations for 2003 until we were unexpectedly impacted by Hurricane Isabel. Our balance sheet was strengthened in early October through the issuance of the additional 8 million shares of common stock, the proceeds of which were used to pay down short-term debt."
