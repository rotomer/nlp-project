Other Events PSEG Announces 2003 Results - --------------------------- On January 27, 2004, the following unaudited results were announced for PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings. Income from Continuing Operations for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $852 million, $247 million, $474 million and $189 million for PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings, respectively. As required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), Income from Continuing Operations for PSE&G and Energy Holdings does not include preferred stock dividends of $4 million and $23 million, respectively. Net Income for PSEG, or Earnings Available to PSEG with respect to PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings, for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $1,166 million, $225 million, $844 million and $128 million, respectively. PSEG also announced that prior period financial statements for Energy Holdings and PSEG will be restated in their respective 2003 Form 10-K's for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 to correct foreign currency translation/transaction impacts of Energy Holdings' equity method investment in RGE, a distribution company in Brazil, and other minor items. The restatement reduced PSEG's and Energy Holdings' Common Stockholders'/Member's Equity at December 31, 2002 by approximately $100 million, which includes a negative impact of about $0.04 and $0.03 per share for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) Request - ------------------------------------------- On January 30, 2004, PSEG announced that it was initiating an in-depth self- assessment of the work environment at its Salem and Hope Creek nuclear generating facilities in response to a request from the NRC. A copy of the press release dated January 30, 2004 relating to this matter is attached as exhibit 99.1 to this form 8-K. Item 12. Results of Operations and Financial Condition On January 27, 2004, PSEG announced unaudited financial results for the year ended December 31, 2003. A copy of the earnings release dated January 27, 2004 is furnished as Exhibit 99 to this Form 8-K. The information contained in this report is being furnished pursuant to Item 12 as directed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. To supplement PSEG's consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, the Company uses non-GAAP measures of pro forma operating income and pro forma operating income per share which does not include losses relating to the impairment and operations of Energy Holdings' Argentine investments in 2002. PSEG's management reviews these non-GAAP measures internally to evaluate the Company's performance and manage its operations. The Company believes that the inclusion of non-GAAP financial measures provides consistent and comparable measures to help shareholders understand PSEG's current and future operating results. PSEG urges shareholders to carefully review the GAAP financial information included as part of PSEG's Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and quarterly earnings releases. 2

These results exclude a gain of $370 million or $1.62 per share associated with the adoption of a new accounting standard for fossil and nuclear decommissioning and also exclude losses totaling $56 million or 25 cents per share related to discontinued operations at PSEG Energy Holdings and to an extraordinary item related to the finalization of Public Service Electric and Gas Company's (PSE&G) electric base rate case. Including these items, PSEG's net income for 2003 was $1.166 billion or $5.09 per share of common stock. PSEG also announced today that earnings from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2003 were $164 million or 69 cents per share, based on 236 million average shares outstanding. These results exclude a loss of $19 million or 8 cents per share associated with the discontinued operations at a generating facility in Rades,Tunisia in which PSEG Global, a subsidiary of Energy Holdings, had invested. Including this charge, PSEG's net income for the fourth quarter was $145 million or 61 cents per share of common stock. Attachments to this release provide a summary of 2003 and 2002 results and details of the quarterly and annual results for PSEG and its principal subsidiaries - PSE&G, PSEG Power and PSEG Energy Holdings. The results reflect the restatement of prior period financial statements to correct foreign currency translation impacts of Energy Holdings' equity method investment in RGE, a distribution company in Brazil and other minor items. The restatement reduced equity at December 31, 2002 by approximately $100 million, which includes a negative impact of about four cents per share on 2002 results and about three cents per share on 2001 results. These corrections will be addressed in more detail in the 2003 10-K filing.
"Despite the effects of Hurricane Isabel and other storms, our business segments made generally solid contributions in 2003 that enabled PSEG to produce record results," said E. James Ferland, chairman and chief executive officer. "Our earnings of $852 million from ongoing operations, which were about 10% higher than comparable 2002 earnings, clearly reflected our fundamental strengths." While total earnings were considerably higher, Ferland explained that the issuance of additional common stock in both 2002 and 2003 resulted in generally comparable earnings per share. "However, the additional equity on the balance sheet helped substantially in our efforts to improve our credit profile," he said. "We also appreciate that the financial marketplace recognized our efforts during a year of uncertainty for the utility sector," Ferland said. "PSEG's total return for 2003 - a combination of stock price appreciation and dividend - was about 44%, placing us among the top performers for the year." Ferland said improving shareholder value remains a key strategic focus for PSEG. On January 20, the company's board of directors raised the company's common stock dividend from 54 to 55 cents per share for the first quarter of 2004. This quarterly increase reflects an indicated annual dividend rate of $2.20 per share. PSEG has paid annual dividends on an uninterrupted basis since 1907, Ferland noted. "Based on our long-range business outlook and the improved tax treatment afforded dividends by the 2003 Tax Reform Act, we felt the time was right to increase the dividend," Ferland said. "Our objective is to continue modest increases in future years provided we achieve our financial expectations." In discussing 2003 results, Ferland said a major driver was a $160 million annual electric rate increase authorized by the Board of Public Utilities. "The increase, which was the first in more than a decade, returned PSE&G's electric earnings to a reasonable level and, more importantly, marked the conclusion of a very successful restructuring of the electric industry in New Jersey," Ferland said. Two other key factors for the year involved PSEG Power, Ferland said. "Power benefited from its successful participation in New Jersey's second basic generation service (BGS) auction and also from a full year's ownership of generating facilities in Connecticut, " he said. "Unfortunately, these benefits were offset by increased costs, due in part to the effects of Hurricane Isabel and other storms, which caused brief shutdowns of Power's nuclear facilities." Ferland said PSEG's 2003 performance reflected overall reliable and safe operations. "Power's nuclear plants had an aggregate capacity factor of 88%. This was lower than anticipated in part because of the severe storms. Expected performance in 2004 should bring the nuclear capacity factor into the 90% range assuming normal conditions. PSEG Global's domestic and international operations also performed well in 2003." Ferland said the company remained focused on balance sheet improvement in 2003. "We started the year with a debt ratio, as defined by our parent lenders, of 61% and an objective to reduce it below 59%," Ferland said. "At year end, our debt ratio had declined to 57%."
He said PSEG's total equity increased by about $1.6 billion to approximately $5.5 billion in 2003. This included about $670 million of retained earnings and $439 million of common stock issued through a public offering in October and through the dividend reinvestment plan during the year. The remainder represented an increase in Other Comprehensive Income (OCI) due primarily to the effects of pension fund and foreign currency improvements. A combination of pension fund earnings of almost 25% for the year and ongoing contributions to the pension fund by the company resulted in the elimination of a $292 million charge to equity that was recorded at the end of 2002. In looking ahead, Ferland said the company is reiterating its initial 2004 EPS guidance of $3.60 to $3.80 per share from continuing operations. He said actual results for the year would depend on, among other factors, the outcome of the BPU's third BGS auction, scheduled to be held in early February. He added that this year's results could also be impacted by the outcome of similar auctions in other states in which Power, as a wholesale energy provider, may choose to participate. "Future earnings performance beyond this year will also depend on many factors, particularly improvement in PJM generation capacity prices, which are currently at historic lows," Ferland said.

EXHIBIT 99.1 [PSEG Investor News LOGO] NYSE:PEG For further information, contact: o Brian Smith, Director, Investor Relations Phone: 973-430-6564 o Sue Carson, Director, Financial Communications Phone: 973-430-6565 o Greg McLaughlin, Sr. Investor Relations Analyst Phone: 973-430-6568 - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- January 30, 2004 PSEG RESPONDS TO NRC REQUEST FOR WORK ENVIRONMENT SELF-ASSESSMENT AT SALEM AND HOPE CREEK NUCLEAR PLANTS Public Service Enterprise Group (PSEG) said today (January 30, 2004) that it has initiated an in-depth self-assessment of the work environment at its Salem and Hope Creek nuclear facilities in New Jersey. The self-assessment stems from a request by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) in a letter dated January 28, 2004 to E. James Ferland, chairman of PSEG. The letter discusses a review by the NRC of Salem and Hope Creek to assess the environment for raising and addressing safety issues. The NRC's letter is scheduled to be posted on its web site: www.nrc.gov. The letter acknowledges recent management changes to improve the work environment at the nuclear facilities but requested that PSEG conduct its own in-depth assessment and provide a plan of action for addressing various issues. Ferland issued the following statement today: The NRC's letter addresses workplace environment issues that we have been fully aware of for a period of time. Our reorganization last year, including the addition of Roy Anderson as Chief Nuclear Officer, addressed many of these issues. Roy recently completed a structural reorganization at Salem and Hope Creek. This reorganization involved significant operational changes at all the facilities and the introduction of several new members of our management team. We are pleased that the NRC has recognized the management realignment that has occurred and the positive response it has generated at the stations. We are also aware that we must work diligently to continue this improvement in the workplace environment and believe we have the resources and organization to do so. As requested by the NRC, we will be conducting our own in-depth assessment of the work environment at our nuclear plants and will implement any necessary changes to continue to make progress. ### FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENT Readers are cautioned that statements contained in this press release about our and our subsidiaries' future performance, including future revenues, earnings, strategies, prospects and all other statements that are not purely historical, are forward-looking statements for purposes of the safe harbor provisions under The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
