EXHIBIT 99 [LETTERHEAD OF PSEG INVESTOR NEWS] April 29, 2004 PSEG ANNOUNCES FIRST-QUARTER 2004 RESULTS: $1.14 PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS Termination of Collins Lease During Quarter Highlights Efforts To Improve Risk Profile Results Support Initial 2004 EPS Guidance Of $3.60 to $3.80 Per Share From Continuing Operations Company Continues To Face Challenges Of Capacity Overbuild And Volatile Energy Prices Public Service Enterprise Group (PSEG) announced today (April 29, 2004) that earnings from continuing operations and net income for the first quarter of 2004 were $271 million or $1.14 per share of common stock, based on 239 million average shares outstanding. Comparatively, PSEG's earnings from continuing operations for the first quarter of 2003 were $324 million or $1.43 per share of common stock, based on 226 million average shares outstanding. These earlier period results excluded a below-the-line benefit of $370 million or $1.64 per share related to the adoption of a new accounting standard for fossil and nuclear decommissioning and also excluded charges of $13 million or 6 cents per share related to discontinued operations. Net income, including these items, was $681 million or $3.01 per share. Attachments to this release provide a comparative summary of 2004 and 2003 results and other details about the quarterly results for PSEG and its principal subsidiaries -- Public Service Electric and Gas Co. (PSE&G), PSEG Power and PSEG Energy Holdings. E. James Ferland, chairman and chief executive officer of PSEG, said first-quarter results reflected a solid performance by PSE&G, due primarily to higher electric rates, which became effective last August 1 and represented the first increase in more than a decade. However, Ferland said the benefit of the rate increase in the quarter was more than offset by various factors impacting both PSEG Power and PSEG Energy Holdings.
"Power's comparatively lower results were caused in large measure," Ferland explained, "by the absence of revenues from a market transition charge collected from electric customers during a four-year period of industry restructuring here in New Jersey. As expected, these revenues fell away last August at the same time PSE&G's rate increase was implemented. Power's results also reflected higher O&M costs at various electric generating facilities and reduced basic generation service (BGS) margins due to lower volumes and to the introduction of seasonal pricing last August." PSEG Energy Holdings' quarterly results were lower than those of last year's first quarter principally because the termination of PSEG Resources' lease investment in the Collins generating facility in Illinois reduced earnings on a one-time basis by about $17 million or 7 cents per share. Under the terms of the lease termination, Resources received pre-tax proceeds of about $184 million of cash or more than 92% of its investment in the facility, which is operated by Midwest Generation LLC, an indirect subsidiary of Edison Mission Energy (EME). "Despite the modest loss of 7 cents per share, the lease termination substantially reduced our risk exposure to EME, with which Resources has lease investments in two other coal-fired Illinois generating facilities," Ferland said. "This is consistent with our strategic objective to continuously improve our overall risk profile." Other significant developments in the first quarter included the following: o The New Jersey Board of Public Utilities held the third annual BGS auction in February. PSE&G was successful in securing 12- and 36-month contracts for the electric needs of their customers at very competitive rates. This year, PSEG Power was a direct participant in the auction and, combined with the results of prior BGS auctions and other opportunities, has secured contracts for more than 75% of its expected output over the next 18-24 months. o In March, PSEG successfully completed a 4-year, $450 million credit facility at PSEG and a 3-year, $600 million joint facility at PSEG and PSEG Power. These new multi-year agreements substantially extended the maturities and increased the capacity of PSEG's liquidity facilities to $2.3 billion, of which approximately $1.9 billion was available at March 31, 2004. "We were very pleased with the market's response to these transactions, both of which were oversubscribed," Ferland said. o Also in March, PSEG Power issued $250 million of 5-year and $250 million of 10-year senior notes at rates of 3.75% and 5.00%, respectively. The proceeds from these issuances, combined with cash on hand, allowed PSEG Power to re-finance the $800 million of non-recourse loans that were issued for the construction of two generating plants in the Midwest. In looking ahead, Ferland said that PSEG's major businesses have the following 2004 earnings targets: PSE&G -- $320 to $340 million, PSEG Power -- $400 to $450 million, and PSEG Energy Holdings -- $130 to $150 million. "PSEG's overall first-quarter results were not as strong as last year's and have put greater pressure on us to perform well during the rest of 2004 to achieve our guidance of $3.60 to $3.80 for the full year," he said.
"Although PSEG Power was successful in achieving its hedging objective in the 2004 BGS process, the auction was extremely competitive, which could affect our margins," Ferland said. "This is why it will be essential that Power's generating facilities, particularly its nuclear units, operate well during the summer." "Our Hope Creek nuclear station has undergone a planned maintenance outage this spring and one of our Salem nuclear units is nearing completion of a refueling and other improvements," he said. "We scheduled these outages to assure reliability of service to our customers during the hot summer months." Ferland said a strong performance by Power's generating fleet this summer will help counter the pressures from earnings in the first quarter. "Over the course of the year, we anticipate that nearly 90% of our generation output will come from our low-cost nuclear and coal facilities, and most of these assets are situated near the vast majority of our customers," he said. Ferland said that the energy industry continues to be in a "highly challenging" time. "We are facing such pressures as an oversupply of electric generation capacity and the resulting competition, volatile energy prices and market conditions, and demanding capital markets," he said. "This could constrain near-term earnings growth for PSEG. Longer term, we expect capacity prices to begin rebounding. This should improve future cash flows, improve our range of business opportunities and provide prospects for growth." - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENT Readers are cautioned that statements contained in this press release about our and our subsidiaries' future performance, including future revenues, earnings, strategies, prospects and all other statements that are not purely historical, are forward-looking statements for purposes of the safe harbor provisions under The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
