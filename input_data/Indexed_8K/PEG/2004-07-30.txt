These results exclude a gain of $5 million or 2 cents per share from discontinued operations at PSEG Global. Including this item, PSEG's reported earnings for the quarter were $124 million or 52 cents per share. Comparatively, PSEG's earnings from continuing operations for the second quarter of 2003 were $156 million or 69 cents per share of common stock, based on 227 million average shares outstanding. These results exclude two below-the-line items. The first is an extraordinary charge of $18 million or 8 cents per share related to the conclusion of Public Service Electric and Gas Company's (PSE&G) last electric base rate case. The second item is a loss of 5 million or 2 cents per share related to discontinued operations at PSEG Energy Technologies and PSEG Global. Including these items, PSEG's reported earnings for the quarter were $133 million or 59 cents per share. For the six months through June 30, 2004, PSEG produced earnings from continuing operations of $390 million or $1.64 per share, based on 238 million average shares outstanding. These results exclude a gain of $5 million or 2 cents per share from discontinued operations at PSEG Global. Including this item, PSEG's reported earnings for the first half of the year were $395 million or $1.66 per share.
For the comparable six-month period in 2003, earnings from continuing operations were $480 million or $2.12 per share, based on 226 million average shares outstanding. These results exclude a net benefit of $334 million or $1.48 per share related to the adoption of a new accounting standard for fossil and nuclear decommissioning, the effect of an extraordinary charge due to the finalization of PSE&G's electric base rate case and discontinued operations at PSEG Energy Technologies. Including this net benefit, PSEG's reported earnings for the first half of 2003 were $814 million or $3.60 per share. Attachments to this release provide a summary of quarterly and year-to-date results for 2004 and 2003 and consolidating financial statements for the same time periods for PSEG and its principal subsidiaries - PSE&G, PSEG Power and PSEG Energy Holdings. E. James Ferland, chairman of the board, said the quarterly results reflected a sharply lower contribution by PSEG Power, the wholesale energy business. Power's quarterly results were down $57 million or 26 cents per share of common stock, as compared to earnings in the second quarter of 2003. He said a major impact on quarterly results was replacement power costs totaling about $39 million or 16 cents per share, about a third of which was attributable to higher congestion in New Jersey. Congestion is generally caused by restrictions in the movement of electricity. This occurred as a result of a 30% de-rating of PSE&G's electric transformer in Branchburg, NJ, which caused higher energy prices in the vicinity. The de-rated transformer is scheduled to be replaced and returned to full service by mid-2005. The primary reasons for the replacement power requirements were longer-than-planned or unexpected refurbishment outages at the Salem 1 and Hope Creek nuclear stations and a delay in the return to service of the 600-megawatt Mercer coal-fired station from the installation of technology to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions. Ferland said PSEG Power's quarterly results were also affected by several other factors: the absence of $34 million or 14 cents per share from market transition charges (MTC) revenues collected over a four-year period ended July 31, 2003; comparatively higher O&M and other costs of about $10 million or 4 cents per share, and comparatively lower operating margins, including trading, of about $10 million or 4 cents per share. Partially offsetting these decreases at Power was comparatively higher income of about $19 million or 8 cents per share from its nuclear decommissioning trust fund. This increased income represents realized gains that resulted from the change in investment styles within the fund. Ferland said Public Service Electric and Gas Company's (PSE&G) quarterly performance was comparatively better by $41 million or 17 cents per share, primarily as a result of a $159.5 million electric distribution rate case that became effective in August 2003. This improvement at PSE&G also helped offset the decline at Power as well as a decrease of $18 million or 8 cents per share in quarterly earnings at PSEG Energy
Holdings due primarily to lower project income at PSEG Global and lower lease income at PSEG Resources. "Although all of our nuclear units were returned to service in early June, the outages reduced PSEG's aggregate capacity factor over the first six months of 2004 to about 85% compared to our plan of 93%. We now expect our combined annual capacity factor to be at about 86% for 2004." "These refurbishment outages occurred largely in April and May when we had some particularly hot weather days that drove up electric demand volumes as well as energy prices to levels some 20% higher than initially forecasted," Ferland said. "Higher energy prices generally benefit PSEG Power when its generating facilities are operating steadily, but we experienced the opposite result this spring because of the overlapping nature of the nuclear and coal outages that created the need to buy replacement power at these higher prices." On the positive side, Ferland noted that the steam turbine replacement accomplished during the Salem 1 outage would enable the unit to boost its output by 63 megawatts. He also said that the installation of state-of-the-art equipment to control nitrogen oxide emissions at the Mercer station has enabled its two units to remain in compliance with environmental regulations. Ferland said Power's higher unanticipated expenses totaled $48 million or 19 cents per share in the second quarter. He said Power, during the balance of the year, is likely to sustain additional impacts of approximately $50 to $60 million or 20 to 25 cents per share on its projected 2004 earnings for several reasons: A recent decision to extend the Hope Creek refueling outage in the fall by two weeks to perform preventive maintenance, the ongoing impact of congestion around the Branchburg transformer, and lower-than-planned trading revenues. "As a result of all these factors, PSEG is revising its 2004 earnings guidance from a range of $3.60 to $3.80 per share to a range of $3.15 to $3.35 per share," he said. "The Hope Creek work in the spring and the work planned for later this year strongly support our key objective of strengthening the reliability of our nuclear operations," he said. "This objective is critical to our long-term success and is well worth a short-term earnings impact." In revising the 2004 guidance, Ferland said PSEG Power now expects to earn in the range of $300 to $350 million, down from an original estimate of $400 to $450 million. He said expectations for PSE&G have improved by $20 million, reflective of an improvement in the economy and higher weather-related energy sales, to a range of $340 to $360 million. PSEG Energy Holdings' target remains unchanged at $130 to $150 million.
"All of our businesses remain fundamentally solid," Ferland said. "In particular, PSE&G, our delivery company, is performing very well, with its contribution for 2004 expected to represent almost 45% of PSEG's total earnings." In looking ahead, Ferland said PSEG has initiated its annual business planning process. "While we will not provide specific 2005 guidance until this process is completed, early indications are that several 2004 factors will carry over to next year," he said. "They include higher nuclear and fossil O&M expenses, more modest revenues from our trading operations and the ongoing impacts of the Branchburg de-rating. These factors, combined with an oversupply of generation capacity and volatility in the energy markets, will continue to affect earnings." - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENT Readers are cautioned that statements contained in this press release about our and our subsidiaries' future performance, including future revenues, earnings, strategies, prospects and all other statements that are not purely historical, are forward-looking statements for purposes of the safe harbor provisions under The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
