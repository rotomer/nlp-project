EXHIBIT 99 [PSEG INVESTOR NEWS LETTERHEAD] October 22, 2004 PSEG ANNOUNCES THIRD-QUARTER 2004 EARNINGS: $1.04 PER SHARE OF COMMON STOCK Earnings Are 19% Higher Than Same Period in 2003, Reflecting Improved Margins at PSEG Power and PSE&G Public Service Enterprise Group (PSEG) announced today (October 22) that earnings from continuing operations for the third quarter of 2004 were $248 million or $1.04 per share of common stock, based on 238 million average shares outstanding. Comparatively, PSEG's earnings for the third quarter of 2003 were $207 million or 91 cents per share of common stock, based on 228 million average shares outstanding. For the nine months ended September 30, 2004, PSEG produced earnings from continuing operations of $638 million or $2.68 per share, based on 238 million average shares outstanding. These results exclude a gain of $5 million or 2 cents per share from discontinued operations at PSEG Global. Including this item, PSEG's reported earnings for the first nine months of the year were $643 million or $2.70 per share. For the comparable nine-month period in 2003, earnings from continuing operations were $688 million or $3.04 per share, based on 226 million average shares outstanding. These results exclude a net benefit of $333 million or $1.47 per share related to the adoption of a new accounting standard for fossil and nuclear decommissioning, the effect of an extraordinary charge due to the finalization of Public Service Electric and Gas Company's (PSE&G) electric base rate case, and discontinued operations at PSEG Energy Technologies. Including this net benefit, PSEG's reported earnings for the first nine months of 2003 were $1.02 billion or $4.51 per share. Attachments to this release provide a summary of quarterly and year-to-date results for 2004 and 2003 and other related information. Additional details will be included in PSEG's third-quarter 10-Q, which is expected to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on or before November 1. E. James Ferland, chairman of the board, said the earnings from continuing operations for the third quarter were about 19% higher than results for the comparable period a year ago. "The better performance stemmed largely from improved operating margins at PSEG Power,
our wholesale energy business, and PSE&G, our regulated electric and gas delivery business," he said. Ferland said Power's quarterly contribution, which improved by about $21 million or 7 cents per share, was due largely to higher margins from various wholesale energy contracts and also by lower energy replacement power costs. He explained that the level of replacement power was higher in the third quarter of 2003 primarily because of Hurricane Isabel's impact on Power's three nuclear units in South Jersey. The storm caused heavy salt spray from the Delaware Bay to coat electrical equipment outside the units, forcing them out of service for about a week. He said the benefit this year of lower replacement power costs was due to the absence of a similar storm-related problem. In addition to these factors, Ferland said, Power's quarterly results were affected by the absence of the market transition charge (MTC) revenues collected over a four-year period ended July 31, 2003 and by higher O&M and depreciation costs principally associated with the commercial operation this year of generating facilities in the Midwest. PSE&G's quarterly contribution improved on a relative basis by $24 million or 9 cents per share. Ferland said the increase was primarily due to a $159.5 million electric distribution rate case that became effective in August 2003. Ferland said the stronger quarterly performance by PSEG Power and PSE&G was offset by a relatively lower contribution from PSEG Energy Holdings and by the dilutive effect of an additional 10 million average shares of common stock resulting from an issuance of about 9 million shares in October 2003 and additional shares through the ongoing Dividend Reinvestment Plan. The contribution by Holdings, which is the parent of PSEG Global, an international and domestic generation and distribution business, and PSEG Resources, which manages energy-related financial investments, declined by $5 million or 3 cents per share, due primarily to lower project income and lower lease income at Global and Resources, respectively, because of the monetization of selected assets. In looking ahead, Ferland said PSEG will focus on achieving operational excellence throughout its businesses. "In particular, we are taking significant steps to improve the performance of our nuclear and fossil generating units to assure long-term reliability," Ferland said. He noted that longer-than-expected refurbishment outages and related replacement power and O&M costs this year -- along with increased competitive pressures within the energy industry - caused PSEG to revise its 2004 earnings guidance, which is now in the range of $3.15 to $3.35 per share. Ferland said increased pressure was placed on earnings guidance earlier this week when PSEG Power announced that its Hope Creek nuclear station will transition to a planned refueling outage following the unit's shutdown on October 10 due to a steam pipe failure.
Refueling was to have begun on October 28 and conclude in mid-December. However, an earlier start of the refueling may provide an opportunity for an earlier return to service, he said. He said the extension of the refueling outage is expected to increase replacement power costs and O&M by about $12 million (after taxes) or 5 cents per share of PSEG common stock in the fourth quarter. "These incremental costs will pressure the low end of our guidance of $3.15 to $3.35 per share," Ferland said. "The competitive pressures cut across many fronts," Ferland said. "For example, fuel prices have skyrocketed more than 40% and this has driven up electric energy prices within our PJM region by more than 25%. This run-up in prices has impacted the potential benefit of PSEG Power's generation supply contracts we entered into before prices spiked." Ferland said this recent development and other competitive factors will continue to pressure the company's performance at least through next year. "As a result, we recently announced that guidance for 2005 will be in the range of 2004 guidance -- $3.15 to $3.35 per share," he said. He said the earnings outlook should begin to improve beyond 2005. "In 2006, our efforts to upgrade the performance and reliability of our low-cost nuclear units will be completed and a significant portion of our contracted generation will be freed up for repricing," he said. "This should help us achieve our long-term earnings growth rate target of 4%-6% and further support our continuing objective of modest and sustainable dividend increases on an annual basis." ================================================================================ FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENT Readers are cautioned that statements contained in this press release about our and our subsidiaries' future performance, including future revenues, earnings, strategies, prospects and all other statements that are not purely historical, are forward-looking statements for purposes of the safe harbor provisions under The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

EXHIBIT 99.1 [PSEG INVESTOR NEWS LETTERHEAD] October 18, 2004 HOPE CREEK NUCLEAR UNIT TO BEGIN REFUELING OUTAGE EARLY Decision Follows October 10 Shutdown Due to Steam Pipe Failure Unexpected Replacement Power Costs and O&M Will Pressure PSEG's 2004 Earnings Guidance of $3.15 to $3.35 Per Share PSEG Power, the wholesale energy subsidiary of Public Service Enterprise Group (PSEG), has informed the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) that its Hope Creek nuclear station will transition to a planned refueling outage following the unit's shutdown on October 10 due to a steam pipe failure. Refueling was to have begun on October 28 and conclude in mid-December. However, an earlier start of the refueling may provide an opportunity for an earlier return-to-service date. Chris Bakken, PSEG's chief nuclear officer and president of PSEG Nuclear, said in a message to employees that the "best course of action is to keep the unit off line and transition to the refueling outage now." Bakken added: "After this outage, I expect Hope Creek will be a much stronger plant, prepared for a safe and reliable cycle." Thomas O'Flynn, PSEG's chief financial officer, said the extension of the refueling outage is expected to increase replacement power costs and O&M by about $12 million (after taxes) or 5 cents per share of PSEG common stock in the fourth quarter. "These added costs will pressure the low end of PSEG's 2004 guidance of $3.15 to $3.35 per share," O'Flynn said. Hope Creek was manually taken out of service as a result of a failed eight-inch discharge line from the "A" moisture separator to the main condenser in Hope Creek's turbine building. "Our preliminary investigation of the event has revealed equipment and personnel performance issues, which we will address prior to the restart of the unit," Bakken said. In a letter over the weekend to the NRC, Bakken outlined the key actions that will be completed prior to resumption of service. A copy of the NRC letter is attached and is available at www.pseg.com/nrcletter.

October 17, 2004 LR-N04-0472 Mr. Samuel J. Collins, Regional Administrator United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission Region I 475 Allendale Road King of Prussia, PA 19406-1415 PSEG ACTIONS IN RESPONSE TO OCTOBER 10, 2004 SCRAM HOPE CREEK GENERATING STATION DOCKET NO. 50-354 Dear Mr. Collins, The purpose of this letter is to provide the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) with an overview of our plans to respond to the Hope Creek steam leak of October 10, 2004. As the NRC staff is aware, on October 10, 2004, Public Service Enterprise Group (PSEG) Nuclear personnel manually shutdown the Hope Creek Generating Station reactor in response to a steam leak in the turbine building. The steam leak was due to a failed eight (8) inch discharge line from the "A" Moisture Separator to the Main Condenser. Our preliminary investigation of the event has revealed equipment and personnel performance issues. PSEG is appropriately focused on maintaining the plant in a safe condition and continues to aggressively investigate this event. In light of the significance of this event, PSEG Nuclear is providing a summary of the actions planned and underway. Hope Creek Generating Station is currently in cold shutdown. PSEG Nuclear does not plan to recommence power operation until completion of the Hope Creek refueling outage in December 2004. Prior to startup, we will complete the following actions: 1. Complete a root cause analysis of the event. 2. Address the adequacy of operator response and Technical Specification usage during the event. 3. Address the significant equipment issues surrounding this transient and the associated impact on plant operations.
2 Mr. Samuel J. Collins LR-N04-0472 4. Complete the extent of condition review and inspections pertaining to the failed line and components. 5. Repair the failed moisture separator discharge line. 6. Complete necessary operations procedure changes and associated training due to issues identified in post trip review.
