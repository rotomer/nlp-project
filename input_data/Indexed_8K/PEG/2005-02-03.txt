EXHIBIT 99
 
February 3, 2005
PSEG ANNOUNCES 2004 RESULTS:
$3.05 PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS
Fourth Quarter Results of 38 Cents Per Share
Reflect Impact of Outages at Hope Creek and Salem Stations
Company Reaffirms 2005 Guidance of $3.15 to $3.35 Per Share
Public Service Enterprise Group (PSEG) announced today (February 3) that earnings from continuing operations for the year 2004 were $726 million or $3.05 per share of common stock, based on 238 million average shares outstanding. These results exclude income of $5 million or 2 cents per share related to discontinued operations at PSEG Energy Holdings. Including this item, PSEG's net income for 2004 was $731 million or $3.07 per share of common stock. For 2003, comparable earnings from continuing operations were $852 million or $3.72 per share of common stock, based on 229 million average shares outstanding. Including the effects of the adoption of a new accounting standard for asset retirement obligations at PSEG Power, losses associated with discontinued operations at PSEG Energy Holdings and an extraordinary loss at Public Service Electric and Gas (PSE&G) due to the finalization of the electric base rate case, 2003 net income was $1.16 billion or $5.07 per share of common stock.
PSEG also announced today that earnings for the fourth quarter of 2004 were $92 million or 38 cents per share, based on 239 million average shares outstanding. Comparatively, PSEG's earnings from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2003 were $164 million or 69 cents per share of common stock, based on 236 million average shares outstanding. Including the effect of discontinued operations at PSEG Energy Holdings, fourth quarter 2003 net income was $139 million or 59 cents per share.
Attachments to this release provide a summary of fourth quarter and year-to-date results for 2004 and 2003 and other related information. Additional details will be included in PSEG's Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is expected to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) later in the month.
Fourth Quarter 2004 Results
E. James Ferland, chairman and chief executive officer, said PSEG's fourth-quarter 2004 results from continuing operations declined by 31 cents per share, compared to fourth-quarter 2003 results, largely because of a lower contribution from PSEG Power.
"For the quarter, PSEG Power spent over $65 million or 27 cents per share on operation and maintenance expenses and replacement power costs for the Hope Creek outage expansion", Ferland said. "The Hope Creek unit was held off line longer than planned for evaluation of a reactor recirculation pump. Extensive studies confirmed the plant would be safe to operate and with the concurrence of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), Hope Creek was returned to service in January", Ferland explained.
In an unrelated matter in early December, Ferland said, the two Salem units were taken off line due to an oil spill from a tanker upstream on the Delaware River. The units, which draw river water for cooling purposes, were shut down for about two weeks as a precautionary measure to avoid intake of the spilled oil. The cost of replacement power for the period was about $18 million, or 8 cents per share. Ferland indicated that replacement power costs were higher than they would have otherwise been because of overlapping outages at Hope Creek and Salem.
Ferland said one offset to PSEG Power's unanticipated nuclear costs in the quarter were improved results from PSEG Energy Resources & Trade (ER&T). "We had a slow start this year, but with more favorable markets in the fourth quarter, we clearly benefited from the scope of the products we manage within ER&T. Results for the quarter were $31 million, or 13 cents per share higher than the comparable quarter last year. Full-year results for ER&T were in line with our mid-year update."
Results from PSE&G were up three cents per share compared to the fourth quarter of 2003, primarily due to reduced interest expense.
PSEG Energy Holdings reported quarterly earnings that were two cents per share lower than comparable 2003 results. At PSEG Global, the strengthening of the Polish Zloty negatively impacted the non-US dollar denominated project debt by about $14 million or 6 cents per share for the quarter. The currency loss recorded on the debt will be offset over time by the increase in the value of the Polish Zlotys that will be received under the Power Purchase Agreement. The negative impact at PSEG Global was partially offset by improved results at PSEG Resources.
At the parent level, PSEG had costs of $5 million or 2 cents per share related to its proposed merger with Exelon Corporation. On December 20, 2004 the two companies announced an agreement to merge contingent upon regulatory and shareholder approvals.
Ferland said the simultaneous outages at Hope Creek and Salem in December, combined with the stronger Polish Zloty at PSEG Global, made it a particularly tough quarter for PSEG.
Full Year 2004 Results
For the full year, PSE&G reported earnings from continuing operations of $342 million or $1.44 per share, an increase of 38 cents per share over comparable 2003 results. Most of this increase was the result of the electric base rate increase that was effective in August 2003. This increase was partially offset at PSEG Power with the elimination of $66 million or 29 cents per share in MTC revenues that ended when the new electric base rates became effective.
In addition to the MTC revenue loss, Power reported full year results from continuing operations that were about $100 million or 49 cents per share lower than 2003. This was primarily the result of the additional work at Hope Creek during the fourth quarter and replacement power costs throughout the year at various fossil and nuclear units. For the full year Power reported earnings of $308 million or $1.29 per share.
Energy Holdings reported income from continuing operations of $125 million or 52 cents per share for the year, a reduction of 21 cents from comparable 2003 results. About half this decline was due to the strengthening of the Polish Zloty during the fourth quarter and other foreign currency impacts throughout the year. Year-over-year earnings were also reduced as a result of a lower ownership in GWF Energy in 2004. At PSEG Resources, the termination of the Collins lease agreement in the first quarter resulted in the loss of expected earnings throughout the year and a partial write-off of the investment. This was offset during the year by improved lease earnings and gains on the KKR portfolio.
2005 Outlook
In discussing the outlook for 2005, Ferland reiterated previously announced earnings guidance of $3.15 to $3.35 per share. He said expectations for PSEG's major businesses are: PSEG Power - $335 to $385 million, PSE&G - $325 to $345 million and Energy Holdings - $135 to $155 million for the year.
He said these projected earnings "comfortably support" PSEG's increase in its quarterly common stock dividend from 55 cents to 56 cents per share, which was approved by the Board of Directors on January 18, 2005. This increase is indicative of an annual dividend of $2.24 per share.
"In general, our businesses remain fundamentally strong," Ferland said. "In particular, we expect improved performance at our Salem and Hope Creek facilities in the coming year due to the major maintenance activities we completed during 2004 and from the implementation, in January 2005, of a nuclear services operating contract with Exelon."
Ferland added that the proposed merger with Exelon creates a company with characteristics that neither company could create on its own. "Exelon's nuclear expertise, and merger integration skills are of special interest to us, while PSE&G's excellence in transmission and distribution operations, as well as its experiences in the development of the BGS auction process will add considerable value to the Exelon business model". It is expected that the transaction will close in the first quarter of 2006.
