Exhibit 99
 
May 4, 2005
PSEG ANNOUNCES FIRST- QUARTER 2005 RESULTS:
$1.18 PER SHARE OF COMMON STOCK
Balanced Performance from all Operating Subsidiaries
Results Support 2005 EPS Guidance
Of $3.15 to $3.35 Per Share of Common Stock
Public Service Enterprise Group (PSEG) announced today (May 4, 2005) that net income for the first quarter of 2005 was $285 million or $1.18 per share of common stock, based on 242 million average shares outstanding.
Comparatively, PSEG's net income for the first quarter of 2004 was $271 million or $1.14 per share of common stock, based on 239 million average shares outstanding.
Attachments to this release provide a comparative summary of 2005 and 2004 results and other details about the quarterly results for PSEG and its principal subsidiaries  Public Service Electric and Gas Co. (PSE&G), PSEG Power and PSEG Energy Holdings.
Quarterly Results
"The first quarter produced solid results from all three of our operating subsidiaries," said E. James Ferland, chairman and chief executive officer of PSEG. Overall results for the quarter were higher due to the absence of charges, such as those related to the Collins lease termination, which were recorded last year, Ferland said.
"At PSE&G, we are starting to see some customer sensitivity to rising natural gas prices," Ferland explained. Gas demand was lower than what would be expected, given the cold temperatures during the quarter. For the quarter, PSE&G reported earnings of 48 cents per share, a decrease of 4 cents per share from the prior year. Overall weather for the quarter was slightly colder than normal, but not as cold as the first quarter of 2004, reducing quarterly earnings by one-cent per share. Reduced demands, absent the weather impact, and higher O&M expenses combined to further reduce earnings at PSE&G by 4 cents per share.
 
Improved performance of the PSEG Power fossil fleet, in particular the Hudson unit in New Jersey and the Bridgeport Harbor plant in Connecticut, reduced replacement power costs for the quarter. The absence of a 4-cent per share charge related to a refinancing last year helped offset an increase in fuel and O&M expenses and increased depreciation expenses for the Lawrenceburg plant that became operational last summer. For the quarter, PSEG Power reported earnings of 45 cents per share, a one-cent per share decline from the comparable period last year.
For the quarter, PSEG Energy Holdings reported earnings of 32 cents per share, a 14-cent per share improvement over 2004 results. In the first quarter of last year, PSEG Resources recorded a 7-cent per share charge related to the termination of the Collins lease. The absence of that charge, combined with improved results by PSEG Global and a mark-to-market gain on the KKR portfolio held by PSEG Resources, were the primary drivers of PSEG Energy Holdings' improved first quarter performance.
At the corporate level, increased interest expense and merger related costs reduced quarter-over-quarter results by 5 cents per share.
Nuclear Operations
The five-unit PSEG Power nuclear fleet had a combined capacity factor of 89% for the quarter, a 4% decrease from last year. Most of this decline was due to Hope Creek, which had a quarterly capacity factor of 61% this year versus 79% last year. The unit was restarted in late January and performed well until late March when it was taken off-line to repair a small leak. Hope Creek returned to service on April 10
th
and is currently running at full power. Excellent performance during the first quarter from the Salem and Peach Bottom Units  operating at a combined capacity factor of 100%  helped mitigate the impact of the Hope Creek outages on the fleet.
"We are very pleased with the implementation of the Exelon Nuclear Management Model at the site and have already seen improvements in the performance of the nuclear units since Exelon took over the operations on January 17
th
," Ferland said. Salem Unit 2 is currently finishing up a scheduled refueling outage that included the replacement of the reactor vessel head. Salem Unit 1 is scheduled to undergo the same refueling and vessel head replacement in the fall.
2005 Guidance
Earnings expectations of $3.15 to $3.35 per share from continuing operations for the year were reaffirmed. The major businesses remain on target for the year - PSE&G, $325 to $345 million, PSEG Power, $335 to $385 million and PSEG Energy Holdings, $135 to $155 million.
Ferland indicated that costs associated with the merger could reduce 2005 results by as much as 10 cents per share and is not reflected in the current guidance. "We didn't anticipate these costs when we developed our guidance last fall, but we're committed to providing the
 
necessary resources to ensure the proposed merger with Exelon is achieved in a timely manner," Ferland said.
"The completion of the Salem Unit 2 refueling and Hope Creek maintenance provide a strong foundation for optimal summer performance from our nuclear fleet," Ferland said. "Also, at PSE&G, our crews are hard at work ensuring summer reliability as part of our ongoing commitment to provide safe, reliable and cost-effective electricity and natural gas to over 2 million customers in New Jersey."
Other Events
Also during the quarter, the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (BPU) held their fourth annual Basic Generating Service (BGS) auction to procure approximately one-third of the energy needs for New Jersey customers over the next three years. For PSE&G customers, the average auction price increased over 18% from the prior year, primarily due to fuel prices, from 5.5 cents per kwhr to 6.5 cents per kwhr. However, the impact to customers this year will be a modest 2.8% increase because the lower rates from prior auctions are blended with the current year results.
On the merger front, PSEG and Exelon continue to work toward securing the necessary regulatory approvals. Final approval is expected early in the second quarter of 2006, with the potential for earlier approval if settlement discussions with the New Jersey BPU are successful and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) does not require hearings. If the FERC were to hold hearings with respect to the Merger, the approval process could extend the anticipated closing into mid-2006 or perhaps later. PSEG expects to know sometime this summer if FERC is going to hold hearings.
