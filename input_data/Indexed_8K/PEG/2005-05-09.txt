Basic Generation Service (BGS) Auction Summary
Fourth annual reverse auction in NJ completed 2/16/05
While the
wholesale
price of energy increased by 18% over last year's prices, the staggered terms of the auction contracts will result in customers of NJ's largest utility (PSE&G) seeing an annual increase to total bills of 2.8%
Only 1/3 of the energy component in the overall bill is put out to bid annually
The energy component is approximately half of the overall bill (with the delivery and transmission components comprising the remaining half)
Therefore, in any given year, 1/3 of about 50% (or about 1/6) of the total electric bill is out for bid
25 suppliers participated in the reverse auction with 7 winning bidders
