The information contained in this Form 8-K is filed for PSEG Energy Holdings L.L.C. (Energy Holdings), a wholly owned subsidiary of Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated (PSEG), solely under Item 2.06 and for PSEG solely under Item 8.01.

Item 2.06. Material Impairments (Energy Holdings) and Item 8.01. Other Events (PSEG)
 
PSEG Resources L.L.C. (Resources), a wholly owned subsidiary of Energy Holdings, is the lessor of various aircraft to several domestic airlines, including a Boeing B767 aircraft to United Airlines (UAL). In December 2002, UAL filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. On June 13, 2005, Resources received a notice from the Trustee under the UAL lease that the lenders had terminated the lease and repossessed the aircraft. Upon receipt of this notice, Energy Holdings concluded that it would write off its entire investment of approximately $15 million, net of tax, in June 2005 since management believes that there will be insufficient proceeds to recover the recorded amount of its investment due to the termination. Following the write off, Resources' remaining gross investment in leased aircraft will be approximately $36 million.
