FORM 8-K
 
CURRENT REPORT
Pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
 
August 11, 2005
Date of Report (Date of earliest event reported)
 
 
Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions:
 
 
 
Section 8  Other Events.
 
Item 8.01. Other Events.
 
This Current Report on Form 8-K is being filed separately by Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated (PSEG), Public Service Electric and Gas Company, PSEG Power LLC and PSEG Energy Holdings L.L.C., collectively, the "PSEG Registrants"). Information contained herein relating to any individual PSEG Registrant has been filed by such registrant on its own behalf. No individual PSEG Registrant makes any representation as to information relating to any other PSEG Registrant.
 
As previously announced, on December 20, 2004, Exelon Corporation (Exelon) and PSEG entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, pursuant to which PSEG will merge with and into Exelon with Exelon continuing as the surviving corporation (Merger). There are a number of regulatory approvals or other regulatory actions required to consummate the Merger, including those described in previous Reports on Form 8-K.
 
On August 11, 2005, the administrative law judge in the proceeding before the Pennsylvania Public Utilities Commission (PAPUC) issued a third prehearing order establishing a modified timetable for the regulatory approval process in Pennsylvania. The modified timetable provides for the administrative law judge to issue an initial decision by mid-December 2005.
Thereafter, a decision of the full PAPUC can be expected in January 2006.
 
On August 11, 2005, the administrative law judge in the proceeding before the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (NJBPU) amended a prior prehearing order to modify the timetable for the regulatory approval process in New Jersey. The order provides for the administrative law judge to issue an initial decision by March 30, 2006. Thereafter, pursuant to the provisions of the New Jersey Administrative Procedure Act, a decision of the full NJBPU could reasonably be expected by approximately May 15, 2006.
 
The procedural schedules for both the PAPUC and NJBPU proceedings include opportunities for settlement discussions among the parties during the course of the proceeding. Exelon and PSEG will endeavor to settle differences of opinion among the administrative litigants during the course of the proceedings if they are able to do so on satisfactory terms. Any such settlements could allow for earlier approval of the Merger. If settlements are not reached, the companies expect that, assuming all other conditions to completion of the Merger are satisfied, the closing of the Merger will occur during the second quarter of 2006.
 
Although Exelon and PSEG believe that the expectations as to timing for the closing of the Merger described above are reasonable, no assurances can be given as to the timing of the receipt of any required regulatory approvals or that all required approvals will be received.
