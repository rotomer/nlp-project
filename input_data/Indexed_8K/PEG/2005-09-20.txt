The Debt Securities will be issued in one or more series as senior indebtedness (the "

Senior Indenture
"), between PSEG and Wachovia Bank, National Association (formerly known as First Union National Bank), as trustee (the "

Each series of Debt Securities may vary, as applicable, as to title, aggregate principal amount, rank, interest rate or formula and timing of payments thereof, stated maturity date, redemption and/or repayment provisions, sinking fund requirements, conversion provisions and any other variable terms established by or pursuant to the applicable Indenture.
As used herein, "
Securities
" shall mean the Senior Debt Securities and/or the Subordinated Debt Securities, as applicable.
Whenever PSEG determines to make an offering of Securities through _______________ (the "
Representatives
"), or through an underwriting syndicate managed by the Representatives, PSEG will enter into an agreement (each, a "
Terms Agreement
") providing for the sale of such Securities to, and the purchase and offering thereof by, the Representatives and such other underwriters, if any, selected by the Representatives (the "

The Terms Agreement relating to the offering of Securities shall specify the aggregate principal amount of Securities to be initially issued (the "

In addition, if applicable, such Terms Agreement shall specify whether PSEG has agreed to grant to the Underwriters an option to purchase additional Securities to cover over-allotments, if any, and the aggregate principal amount of Securities subject to such option (the "

SECTION 6.
Indemnification
.
(a) Indemnification of Underwriters.
PSEG agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act as follows:
(i) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;
 
20
(ii)      against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, to the extent of the aggregate amount paid in settlement of any litigation, commenced or threatened, or of any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission or any alleged untrue statement or omission, if such settlement is effected with the written consent of PSEG; and
(iii)     against any and all expense whatsoever, as incurred, reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission, to the extent that any such expense is not paid under (i) or (ii) above;
provided
,
however
, that this indemnity agreement shall not apply (i) to any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense to the extent arising out of any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to PSEG by any Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), or any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or (ii) to any Underwriter in connection with any preliminary prospectus to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability of such Underwriter results solely from the fact that such Underwriter sold Underwritten Securities to a person to whom it is established that there was not sent or given, at or prior to the written confirmation of such sale, a copy of the Prospectus (excluding documents incorporated by reference) in any case where such delivery is required by the 1933 Act, if PSEG has previously furnished to the Representatives on behalf of the Underwriters, including such Underwriter, the copies thereof theretofore requested by the Representatives, and the loss, claim, damage or liability of such Underwriter results from an untrue statement or omission of a material fact contained in a preliminary prospectus that was corrected in the Prospectus.
(b)
In no case shall PSEG be liable under the indemnity agreement set forth in Section 6(a) hereof with respect to any claim made against any Underwriter or any such controlling person unless such party shall be notified in writing of the nature of the claim promptly after the assertion thereof, but failure to so notify such party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of said indemnity agreement. PSEG shall be entitled to participate at its own expense in the defense, or, if it so elects, within a reasonable time after receipt of such notice, to assume the defense of any suit brought to enforce any such claim, but if it so elects to assume the defense, such defense shall be conducted by counsel chosen by it and approved by the Underwriter or Underwriters or controlling person or persons, defendant or defendants in any suit so brought, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. In the event that PSEG elects to assume the defense of any such suit and retains such counsel, the Underwriter or Underwriters or controlling person or persons, defendant or defendants in the suit shall bear the fees and expenses of any additional counsel thereafter retained by them. In the event that the parties to any such action (including impleaded parties) include PSEG and one or more Underwriters and any such Underwriter shall have been advised by counsel chosen by it and satisfactory to PSEG, as the case may be, that there may be one or more legal defenses available to it which are different from or additional to those available to PSEG, PSEG shall not have the right to assume the defense of such action on behalf of such Underwriter and PSEG will reimburse
 
21
such Underwriter and any person controlling such Underwriter as aforesaid for the reasonable fees and expenses of any counsel retained by them, it being understood that PSEG shall not, in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys for all such Underwriters and controlling persons, which firm shall be designated by the Representatives in writing. PSEG agrees to notify the Representatives promptly after the assertion of any claim against it, any of its directors, any of its officers who signed the Registration Statement, or any person who controls it within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act, in connection with the issuance and sale, as the case may be, of the Securities.
(c) Indemnification of PSEG, Directors and Officers.
Each Underwriter severally agrees to indemnify and hold harmless PSEG, its directors, each of its officers who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls PSEG within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense described in the indemnity contained in subsection (a) of this Section, as incurred, but only with respect to statements or omissions, or alleged untrue statements or omissions, made in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), or any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to PSEG by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) or such preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto). In case any action shall be brought against PSEG or any person so indemnified based on the Registration Statement, such preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto and in respect of which indemnity may be sought against any Underwriter, such Underwriter shall have the rights and duties given to PSEG, and PSEG and each person so indemnified shall have the rights and duties given to the Underwriters by the provisions of Section 6(b) hereof.

SECTION 7.
Contribution
. In order to provide for just and equitable contribution in circumstances in which the indemnity agreement provided for in Section 6 is for any reason held
 
22
to be unenforceable by the indemnified parties although applicable in accordance with its terms, PSEG and the Underwriters shall contribute to the aggregate losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses of the nature contemplated by said indemnity agreements incurred by PSEG and one or more of the Underwriters in such proportions that the Underwriters are responsible for that portion represented by the percentage that the underwriting discount in the Terms Agreement or appearing on the cover page of the Prospectus relating to the Underwritten Securities bears to the initial public offering price appearing thereon and PSEG is responsible for the balance;
provided
,
however
, that no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.

24
No action taken pursuant to this Section 10 shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of its default.
In the event of any such default which does not result in (i) a termination of the applicable Terms Agreement or (ii) in the case of a Date of Delivery after the Closing Time, a termination of the obligations of the Underwriters and PSEG with respect to the related Option Underwritten Securities, as the case may be, either the Representatives or PSEG shall have the right to postpone the Closing Time or the relevant Date of Delivery, as the case may be, for a period not exceeding seven days in order to effect any required changes in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements.

TRUSTEE'S CERTIFICATE OF AUTHENTICATION
This is one of the Securities of the series designated therein referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.
 
 
This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of securities (the "Securities") of the Company (which term includes any successor corporation under the Indenture hereinafter referred to) issued and to be issued pursuant to such Indenture. This Security is one of a series designated by the Company as its _____________ Notes due _____ (the "Notes") and will be subject, without the consent of the holders of any series of Securities, to the issuance of additional Notes in the future having the same terms, other than the date of original issuance and the date on which interest begins to accrue, so as to form one series with the Notes. The Indenture does not limit the aggregate principal amount of the Notes or the Securities.
The Company issued this Note pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of November 1, 1998, between the Company and Wachovia Bank, National Association (formerly known as First Union National Bank), as trustee (the "Trustee", which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), as amended by the First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of September 10, 2002, between the Company and the Trustee, and the Second Supplemental Indenture, dated as of July 27, 2005, between the Company and the Trustee (as so amended, the "Indenture" which term, for the purpose of this Note, shall include the Officers' Certificate dated __________________, delivered pursuant to Section 301 of the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and Holders of the Notes and of the terms upon which the Notes are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered.

[The interest rate on the Notes for each Interest Period (as defined below) shall be reset quarterly and the Notes shall bear interest at a per annum rate (computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over a 360-day year) equal to LIBOR (as defined below) for the applicable Interest Period, plus _____%. Interest on this Note shall accrue from and including the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for to but excluding the applicable Interest Payment Date, Stated Maturity or date of earlier redemption, as the case may be.]
If any Interest Payment Date or date of redemption (the "Redemption Date") (would otherwise be a day that is not a Business Day (as defined below), such Interest Payment Date or Redemption Date shall be postponed to the next succeeding day that is a Business Day.
[The Notes will bear interest for each quarterly Interest Period at a per annum rate determined by the Calculation Agent, subject to the maximum interest rate permitted by New Jersey or other applicable state law, as such law may be modified by United States law of general application. The per annum interest rate applicable during each quarterly Interest Period will be equal to LIBOR, determined on the Interest Determination Date for such Interest Period, plus _____%. Promptly upon such determination, the Calculation Agent will notify the Company and the Trustee, if the Trustee is not then serving as the Calculation Agent, of the interest rate for the new Interest Period. The interest rate determined by the Calculation Agent, absent manifest error, shall be binding and conclusive upon the Company, the beneficial owners and holders of the Notes, and the Trustee.
"LIBOR" for any Interest Determination Date will be the offered rate for deposits in U.S. dollars having an index maturity of three months for a period commencing on the second London Business Day immediately following such Interest Determination Date in amounts of not less than U.S. $1,000,000, as such rate appears on Telerate Page 3750 or a successor reporter of such rates selected by the Calculation Agent and acceptable to the Company, at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on such Interest Determination Date (the "Reported Rate").
If the following circumstances exist on the applicable Interest Determination Date, the Calculation Agent shall determine LIBOR as follows:

"Business Day" means any day other than (i) a Saturday or Sunday (ii) a day on which banks in New York, New York are authorized or obligated by law, regulation or executive order to remain closed or (iii) a day on which the Trustee's corporate trust office is closed for business, and which is a London Business Day.

"Interest Determination Date" means the second London Business Day (as defined below) immediately preceding the first day of the relevant Interest Period.

"London Business Day" means any day (other than a Saturday or a Sunday) on which dealings in deposits in U.S. Dollars are transacted in the London interbank market.
"Telerate Page 3750" means the display designated on page 3750 on Moneyline Telerate, Inc. (or such other page as may replace the 3750 page on that service or such other service as may be nominated by the British Bankers' Association for the purpose of displaying London interbank offered rates for U.S. dollar deposits).
All percentages resulting from any calculation of any interest rate for this Note will be rounded to the nearest one hundred-thousandth of a percentage point with five one-millionths of a percentage point rounded upwards (e.g., 9.876545% (or .09876545) would be rounded to 9.87655% (or .0987655)), and all dollar amounts used in or resulting from such calculation on the Notes will be rounded to the nearest cent (with one-half cent being rounded upward).
On or after ______________, the Company may redeem all or part of the Notes at the principal amount of the Notes being redeemed, plus any unpaid interest accrued to the Redemption Date.

If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Note will state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. The Company will issue a Note in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the original Note in the name of the holder thereof upon cancellation of the original Note. Notes called for redemption will become due on the date fixed for redemption. On or after the Redemption Date, interest will cease to accrue on Notes or portions of them called for redemption.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, interest due on an Interest Payment Date that is on or prior to a Redemption Date shall be payable to the persons in whose names the Notes are registered on the 15th calendar day (whether or not a Business Day) prior to such Interest Payment Date.
The redemption price for any redemption (the "Redemption Price") shall be equal to ___% of the principal amount to be redeemed plus any unpaid interest accrued to the Redemption Date.
All notices of redemption shall state the Redemption Date, the Redemption Price, if fewer than all the outstanding Notes are to be redeemed, the identification (and, in the case of partial redemption, the principal amounts) of the particular Notes to be redeemed, that on the Redemption Date the Redemption Price shall become due and payable upon each Note, or portion thereof, to be redeemed, that interest on each Note, or portion thereof, called for redemption shall cease to accrue on the Redemption Date and the place or places where Notes may be surrendered for redemption.
For all purposes of this Note and the Indenture, unless the context otherwise requires, all provisions relating to the redemption by the Company of this Note shall relate, in the case that this Note is redeemed or to be redeemed by the Company only in part to that portion of the principal amount of this Note that has been or is to be redeemed.]
If an Event of Default (as set forth in the Indenture) with respect to Notes shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Notes may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
The Indenture permits, in certain circumstances therein specified, the amendment thereof without the consent of the Holders of the Securities. The Indenture also permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations under the Indenture of the Company and the rights of Holders of the Securities of each series to be affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of each series to be affected. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of each series at the
 
7
time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all the Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Note and of any Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note.
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note, subject to the provisions for satisfaction and discharge in Article Four of the Indenture, shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Note at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
The Indenture permits the Company, by irrevocably depositing, in amounts and maturities sufficient to pay and discharge at the Stated Maturity or Redemption Date, as the case may be, the entire indebtedness on all Outstanding Notes, cash or U.S. Government Obligations with the Trustee in trust solely for the benefit of the Holders of all Outstanding Notes, to defease the Indenture with respect to such Notes, and upon such deposit the Company shall be deemed to have paid and discharged its entire indebtedness on such Notes. Thereafter, Holders would be able to look only to such trust fund for payment of principal and interest at the Stated Maturity or Redemption Date, as the case may be.
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of Notes is registrable in the Security Register, upon surrender of a Note for registration of transfer at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee or at the office or agency of the Trustee in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, or at such other offices or agencies as the Company may designate, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Notes of like tenor, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, shall be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.
No service charge shall be made by the Company, the Trustee or the Security Registrar for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith (other than exchanges pursuant to Sections 304, 906, 1107 or 1305 of the Indenture, not involving any transfer).
Prior to due presentment of this Note for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Note is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Note be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
This Note shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the law of the State of New Jersey without regard to principles of conflicts of laws.
All undefined terms used in this Note which are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.
