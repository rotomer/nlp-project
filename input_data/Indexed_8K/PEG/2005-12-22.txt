Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
 
On December 20, 2005, Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated's (PSEG) Board of Directors Organization and Compensation Committee approved amendments to the following PSEG deferred compensation and supplemental executive retirement plans: the Deferred Compensation Plan for Certain Employees of Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated and Its Affiliates (the "Officers' Deferred Compensation Plan), the Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated Deferred Compensation Plan for Directors ( the "Directors' Deferred Compensation Plan"), the Limited Supplemental Benefits Plan for Certain Employees of Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated and its Subsidiaries (the "Limited Plan"), the Retirement Income Reinstatement Plan for Non-Represented Employees of Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated and its Affiliates (the "Reinstatement Plan") and the Mid-Career Hire Supplemental Retirement Income Plan for Selected Employees of Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated and Its Affiliates (the "Mid-Career Plan").
 
The amendments were made primarily to bring the plans into compliance with the requirements of new section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. However, certain changes permitted by Internal Revenue Service regulations were made to the Officers' Deferred Compensation Plan and the Directors' Deferred Compensation Plan to allow limited changes to prior deferral elections and the definition of "compensation" was changed in the Reinstatement Plan to conform to the definition of "compensation" in the Limited Plan, with the result that certain participants (those who are not also participants in the Limited Plan) will, potentially, be eligible for a larger plan benefit than before this change.
