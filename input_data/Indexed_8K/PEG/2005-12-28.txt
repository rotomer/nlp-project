Item 8.01. Other Events
 
On December 22, 2005, Energy Holdings' subsidiary, PSEG Resources L.L.C. (Resources) entered into an agreement for the sale of its interest in the Seminole Generation Station Unit 2, located in Palatka, Florida to Seminole Electric Cooperative, Inc. The sale of the 659 MW coal-fired unit was completed on December 28, 2005 for $286 million resulting in an approximate $41 million after-tax gain for Resources.  
 
The net proceeds of $235 million, after taxes, combined with previously repatriated cash from Energy Holdings' subsidiary, PSEG Global L.L.C., will be used to redeem all of Energy Holdings' currently outstanding 7.75% Senior Notes due in 2007 totaling $309 million.
 
The approximate $41 million after-tax gain, or approximately $0.17 per share of PSEG's common stock, was not contemplated in PSEG's 2005 guidance of $3.15 to $3.35 per share, which PSEG last affirmed in November 2005.
