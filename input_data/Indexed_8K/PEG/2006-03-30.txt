Item 4.01 Change in Registrant's Certifying Accountant
 
 
The Named Fiduciary for Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated ("PSEG") Thrift and Tax-Deferred Savings Plan and the PSEG Employee Savings Plan (the "PSEG Plans") has engaged Kronick Kalada Berdy & Co. as Independent Registered Public Accountants to audit the financial statements of the PSEG Plans for the 2005 fiscal year. The date of their appointment as Independent Registered Public Accountants was March 24, 2006. The PSEG Plans file Annual Reports on Form 11-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 
For years prior to 2005, Deloitte & Touche LLP had audited the financial statement for the PSEG Plans. The decision to change to another accounting firm for the PSEG Plans was made in anticipation of the pending merger between PSEG and Exelon Corporation.
 
Prior to this change, there were no disagreements between Deloitte & Touche LLP and PSEG or the PSEG Plans' Named Fiduciary regarding any matter of accounting principles, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure related to the PSEG Plans. The reports of Deloitte & Touche LLP for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 for each of the PSEG Plans did not contain an adverse or disclaimer of opinion, nor were such reports qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles.
 
Also, prior to this change, there was no consultation between Kronick Kalada Berdy & Co. and PSEG or the Named Fiduciary of the PSEG Plans regarding any matter related to the financial statements of the PSEG Plans.
 
PSEG provided both Deloitte & Touche LLP and Kronick Kalada Berdy & Co. with this Form 8-K prior to filing it with the Securities and Exchange Commission. PSEG requested that Deloitte & Touche LLP provide a letter addressed to the Securities and Exchange Commission stating whether or not it agrees with the foregoing statements. A copy of the letter from Deloitte & Touche LLP, dated March 30, 2006, is furnished as Exhibit 16 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
