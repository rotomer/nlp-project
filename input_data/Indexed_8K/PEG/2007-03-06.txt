The 1st RPM-year spans June 2007 through May 2008, and will cover similar one year (BGS) intervals thereafter.  Recent market activity has shown considerable price increases for the 2007/2008 year.
PJM's Reliability Pricing Model
RPM reflects a change in                      market design
- More structured, forward- looking, transparent pricing model
- Gives prospective investors in new generating facilities more
clarity on future value of capacity
- Sends pricing signal to encourage expansion of capacity where needed for future market demands
Capacity revenues, driven by RPM, provide a meaningful increase in Power's expected margin - $100 - $150 million for 2007 - and is anticipated to increase in future years due to full year PJM impact and as more capacity comes off existing contracts.
