New Jersey Smart Growth Initiative 
Goals
Revitalize the State's cities and towns
Promote beneficial economic growth, development and renewal for all residents of New Jersey
PSE&G Investment
Additional $101M in distribution substation reinforcements
Potential for an additional $80M in distribution system reinforcement for circuit level overloads and planned replacement program for aging infrastructure
 matches well with the PSE&G service territory and will create long term growth within New Jersey's urban centers.
The Governor's plan to revitalize New Jersey's urban centers has worked as planned, resulting in PSE&G needing to invest to support its electrical systems.
32
The New Jersey Energy Master Plan's challenges for PSE&G include 
PSEG Key Strategies with the Potential for Helping the State:
1.
Advanced Metering Infrastructure
2.
Solar Green Towns
3.
Residential Energy Efficiency
4.

Looking ahead, Power is well positioned to benefit from generation value improvement

Put upward pressure on capacity prices, and
Drive heat rate expansion if baseload additions are insufficient
The implementation of carbon is becoming more likely
Anticipated to put upward pressure on prices

Global's near-term strategy is to improve returns and further reduce risk 
International  reducing generation risk
Proactively exploring potential sale of Electroandes ($160M Book Value)
Significant amount of interest expressed in non-strategic asset
Opportunity to reallocate capital if valuations attractive
Continue to assess opportunities regarding remaining modest international generation investments (Turboven, PPN and Prisma - aggregate $150M investment)
Economically relever distribution companies in Chile & Peru  returning capital and improving returns ($150M - $250M)
Incremental capital available
Optimize operations in distribution companies to improve returns and increase values
Will consider further monetizations as appropriate based upon valuations and alternate use of capital
Ability to further leverage Texas assets could also generate incremental capital
 by continuing to return capital through opportunistic monetizations and debt financing.

In 2008, the company forecasts that a full year of higher energy prices as hedges roll off coupled with a decline in interest expense could lead to a 15% increase in operating earnings from 2007 to 2008 to $5.60-$6.10 per share.
Izzo told the financial community that PSEG at this point in time has the right assets in the right markets to benefit from a convergence of factors influencing the market  a need to
invest in utility infrastructure, tightening energy markets and, a national and local interest in reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
PSEG expects strong cash flow to result from the projected increase in earnings and to use the cash generated to meet its debt reduction targets over the near term. PSEG should also have the opportunity beginning in 2008 to use excess cash for the repurchase of shares and/or for investment to expand in markets we know. He also indicated that with a decline in the company's payout ratio, PSEG may be in a position to consider a faster rate of growth in the common dividend than past practice. Izzo concluded by saying that he's tremendously excited about the opportunities for PSEG.
