PSE&G's Solar Initiative Plan filed with BPU on  4/19/07
PSE&G would invest $100M over 2008-2009 to help finance installation of 30MW of solar photovoltaic systems on homes, businesses and municipal buildings.
The solar initiative is designed to fulfill 50% of the renewable portfolio standard (RPS) requirements over this two year period.
Program will provide loans to developers to cover 40-50% of the cost of solar installation project. The remaining cost of the project will be funded by an equity partner (or host customer) who would also own the solar panels.
PSE&G will be repaid the principal plus interest over 15 year period in the form of credits called Solar Renewable Energy Certificates (SREC's) in cash.  PSE&G will allocate SRECS to Load Serving Entities (LSE) which will lower their renewable portfolio compliance cost standards over time.
PSE&G would earn a return for the full cost of capital plus an incentive for spurring the solar market.

   PJM released results on April 13 from its first capacity auction under the Reliability Pricing Model (RPM) for the 2007-2008 delivery year.
   Pricing in initial auction for Eastern MAAC reflected "Cost of New Entry": standard simple cycle gas turbine adjusted for location.
   Future auction pricing could be influenced by changes in demand and capacity availability including transmission capability between zones.
   Market prices support our forecast year- over-year improvement in capacity margin of $125M - $175M in 2007 with further improvement in 2008.
  Auctions are scheduled throughout the year to provide transition through the 2010- 2011 delivery year.
