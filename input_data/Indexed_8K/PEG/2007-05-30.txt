PJM released results on April 13 from its
first capacity auction under the Reliability Pricing Model (RPM) for the 2007-2008 delivery year.
Pricing in initial auction for Eastern MAAC
reflected "Cost of New Entry": standard simple cycle gas turbine adjusted for location.
Future auction pricing could be influenced
by changes in demand and capacity availability including transmission capability between zones.
Market prices support our forecast year-
over-year improvement in capacity margin of $125M - $175M in 2007 with further improvement in 2008.
Auctions are scheduled throughout the
year to provide transition through the 2010- 2011 delivery year.

Looking ahead, Power is well positioned to benefit from generation value improvement 
Tightening reserve margins should:
Put upward pressure on capacity prices, and
Drive heat rate expansion if baseload additions are insufficient
The implementation of carbon rules is becoming more likely
Anticipated to put upward pressure on prices
Nuclear generation stands to benefit from carbon constraints
