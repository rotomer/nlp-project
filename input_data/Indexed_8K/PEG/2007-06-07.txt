PSE&G's Solar Initiative Plan filed with BPU on  4/19/07
PSE&G would invest $100M over 2008-2009 to help finance installation of 30MW of solar photovoltaic systems on homes, businesses and municipal buildings.
The solar initiative is designed to fulfill 50% of the renewable portfolio standard (RPS) requirements over a two year period.
Program will provide loans to developers to cover 40-50% of the cost of solar installation project. The remaining cost of the project will be funded by an equity partner (or host customer) who would also own the solar panels.
PSE&G will be repaid the principal plus interest over 15 year period in the form of credits called Solar Renewable Energy Certificates (SRECs) or, in cash.  PSE&G will allocate SRECs to Load Serving Entities (LSE) which will lower their renewable portfolio compliance cost standards over time.
PSE&G would earn a return for the full cost of capital plus an incentive for spurring the solar market.

Reserve margins in the key Power markets are expected to continue to decline 
 which should sustain higher energy prices as heat rates expand.

More structured, forward- looking, transparent pricing model
Gives prospective investors in new generating facilities more clarity on future value of capacity
Sends locational pricing signal to encourage expansion of capacity where needed for future market demands
 in which longer-term price signals are provided.

PJM released results on April 13 from its
first capacity auction under the Reliability
Pricing Model (RPM) for the 2007-2008
delivery year.
Pricing in initial auction for Eastern MAAC
reflected "Cost of New Entry": standard
simple cycle gas turbine adjusted for
location.
Future auction pricing could be influenced
by changes in demand and capacity
availability including transmission capability
between zones.
Market prices support our forecast year-
over-year improvement in capacity margin
of $125M - $175M in 2007 with further
improvement in 2008.
Auctions are scheduled throughout the
year to provide transition through the 2010-
2011 delivery year.

 as market fundamentals and regulatory policy impact market conditions.
Looking ahead, Power is well positioned to benefit from generation value improvement 
Tightening reserve margins should:
Put upward pressure on capacity prices, and
Drive heat rate expansion if baseload additions are insufficient
The implementation of carbon rules is becoming more likely
Anticipated to put upward pressure on prices
Nuclear generation stands to benefit from carbon constraints
