Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
          On August 1, 2007, Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated (PSEG) announced unaudited financial results for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2007. A copy of the earnings release and related slideshow presentation dated August 1, 2007 are furnished as Exhibits 99 and 99.1 to this Form 8-K. The information contained in this report is being furnished pursuant to Item 2.02 as directed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized. The signature of the undersigned company shall be deemed to relate only to matters having reference to such company and any subsidiaries thereof.
Date: August 1, 2007

Exhibit 99
Public Service Enterprise Group (PSEG) reported today (August 1, 2007) income from continuing operations for the second quarter of 2007 of $293 million or $1.15 per share compared to a loss of $8 million or $0.03 per share for the comparable period in 2006. Excluding merger-related costs of $3 million or $0.01 per share, and a loss from the sale of RGE of $177 million or $0.70 per share, PSEG reported operating earnings of $172 million or $0.68 per share for the 2006 second quarter. Losses from discontinued operations of $18 million or $0.07 per share reduced net income for the second quarter of 2007 to $275 million or $1.08 per share. Income (losses) from discontinued operations, including a gain on the sale of discontinued operations raised net income for the second quarter of 2006 by $217 million or $0.86 per share to $209 million or $0.83 per share.
Ralph Izzo, chairman, president and chief executive officer of PSEG, said that he was extremely pleased with the financial results reported for the quarter, as well as a number of other accomplishments that allowed the company to meet its commitments as it begins to address opportunities for growth.
"Earnings at PSEG Power during the quarter are the result of an improvement in realized prices and lower costs," Izzo said. "Public Service Electric and Gas Company's (PSE&G) earnings benefited from the impact of the gas and electric rate settlements effective in the fourth quarter of 2006 and more normal weather conditions."
Operating earnings exclude the impact of the sale of certain non-core domestic and international assets and costs stemming from the merger agreement with Exelon Corporation that was terminated in September 2006. The table below provides a reconciliation of PSEG's net income to operating earnings (a non-GAAP measure) for the second quarter.
PSEG believes that the non-GAAP financial measure of "Operating Earnings" provides a consistent and comparable measure of performance of its businesses to help shareholders understand financial trends.
Izzo said that PSEG Energy Holdings moved its investment in Electroandes (Peru) to discontinued operations during the second quarter. "We are getting strong interest in PSEG Energy Holdings' $166 million investment in Electroandes," he said. "We expect a sale to be consummated around year-end."
Izzo also said "our distribution businesses (primarily in Chile and Peru) are performing well and showed growth in the quarter". He added that "the markets in Latin America are strong, and PSEG is more actively exploring its strategic options for these investments."
Izzo noted several key highlights during the second quarter:
These developments, Izzo said, are clear signs that PSEG can make disciplined investments that ensure reliability and protect the environment.
Izzo said PSEG's strong year-to-date operating performance supports 2007's operating guidance of $4.90-$5.30 per share. The mid-point of the guidance represents a 37% increase over 2006's operating earnings of $3.71 per share. Higher prices for contracted power and the implementation of pricing on capacity under the PJM's Reliability Pricing Model provide support for projected growth in 2008 of 15% to $5.60-$6.10 per share.
Operating earnings guidance by subsidiary for 2007 has been modestly adjusted as follows:
Operating Earnings Review and Outlook by Operating Subsidiary
See Attachment 8 for detail regarding the quarter over quarter reconciliations for each of PSEG's businesses.
PSEG Power
PSEG Power reported operating earnings of $187 million ($0.73 per share) for the second quarter compared with operating earnings of $86 million ($0.34 per share) reported during the second quarter of 2006.
PSEG Power's margins benefited from higher pricing in all markets (particularly PJM), an increase in output and lower operating costs. Higher realized power prices and stronger operations added $0.37 per share to earnings. A quarter over quarter improvement in output of 2.6% was derived from stronger performance from the combined cycle fleet. The nuclear fleet operated at a level comparable to the 90.0% capacity factor recorded in the second quarter of 2006. Lower operating costs added $0.04 per share to earnings. Power's earnings also benefited from favorable market conditions which aided margins on the BGSS contract
by $0.03 per share largely offsetting the recognition of a mark-to-market loss during the quarter of $0.04 per share.
PSEG Power announced in July that it will proceed with the installation of advanced emissions controls at its Hudson Generating Station coal-fired Unit 2 in Jersey City. Completion of the retrofits by 2010 will allow long-term, continued operation of the unit.
William Levis, president and chief operating officer of PSEG Power, said. "This decision is consistent with the company's commitment to provide New Jersey and the region with reliable and environmentally responsible energy supplies."
PSEG Power's expenditures associated with retrofitting Hudson as well as meeting other environmental commitments will increase its capital commitments for the 2007-2011 period by $100 million as part of a total capital program of $2.7 billion during this timeframe.
PSEG Power's operating earnings for 2007 are expected to continue to reflect higher electric power prices and the successful auction of capacity in PJM. Power raised its full year 2007 operating earnings guidance range by $15 million to $840-$920 million based on the strength of year-to-date earnings.
"We expect continued strong operating performance in the remainder of the year" Levis said.
PSE&G
PSE&G reported operating earnings in the second quarter of 2007 of $62 million ($0.24 per share) versus $34 million ($0.13 per share) for the second quarter of 2006.
PSE&G's quarterly operating earnings benefited from a number of factors. Higher revenue from electric and gas rate adjustments implemented in November 2006 represented an increase in earnings of $0.07 per share. Earnings comparisons also benefited from more normal weather in 2007 compared to mild conditions experienced a year ago. This added $0.03 per share to earnings. An increase in electric and gas demand by residential and commercial customers added $0.03 per share to earnings. Several other items including an increase in depreciation expense resulted in a $0.02 per share reduction to earnings in the quarter.
PSE&G announced that it will take part in the construction of a new 500 kilovolt transmission line from Susquehanna, PA to Roseland, NJ approved by PJM in June. This line will coexist with a 230 kilovolt transmission line along this route. Permitting activity with construction to follow is expected to begin in 2008 with the new line in-service during 2012. It is one of three 500 kilovolt lines that PSE&G has endorsed to improve long-term electric reliability in N.J. If all three lines are constructed, PSE&G would increase its investment in transmission by approximately $1 billion over 5-8 years.
PSE&G's earnings during the second half of 2007 will continue to reflect the impact of a full year of the electric and gas rate agreements implemented in November 2006 and more
"normal weather" for the balance of the year. The anticipated contribution from these sources of revenue, coupled with the strength of earnings year-to-date, continues to support 2007 operating earnings guidance for PSE&G of $340 million to $360 million.
PSEG Energy Holdings
PSEG Energy Holdings reported operating earnings in the second quarter of 2007 of $59 million ($0.24 per share) versus $70 million ($0.28 per share) recorded in the second quarter of 2006.
Holdings' subsidiary, PSEG Global, reported a modest decline in operating earnings due to softness in the Texas market and an extended outage at its Italian bio-mass generation facility. The operating earnings for Holdings' 2000-Mw of combined cycle generating capacity in Texas were reduced by a decline in spark spreads ($0.03 per share) as a result of very mild weather conditions. This decline in operating earnings was partially offset by an increase in mark-to-market of $0.01 per share. Global's international generation results were hurt by a lengthy outage at the San Marco bio-mass generation facility which reduced earnings by $0.06 per share. The cost of the outage more than offset improved earnings from SAESA and modest income from other small investments. Global's results during the quarter were supported by a reduction in administrative costs and lower interest expense which added $0.04 per share to earnings.
Holdings' other subsidiary, PSEG Resources, experienced a $0.01 per share decline in operating earnings for the second quarter of 2007. The results for the quarter were influenced by a decline in lease income, resulting from the impact of new accounting standards.
PSEG Energy Holdings moved its investment in Electroandes, a hydro-electric generation and transmission company located in Peru, to discontinued operations. Initial bids for this $166 million investment have been strong, and Holdings expects to complete the sale of the asset around year-end.
PSEG is lowering full year 2007 operating earnings guidance range for PSEG Energy Holdings to $120 million to $135 million from $130 million to $145 million, as a result of reclassifying Electroandes as discontinued operations. The full year earnings contribution from PSEG Energy Holdings will be influenced by the sale of assets, Texas power markets, the implementation of new accounting standards and lower operating expenses.

GAAP Disclaimer
PSEG presents Operating Earnings in addition to its Net Income reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Operating Earnings is a non-GAAP financial measure that differs from Net Income because it excludes the impact of the sale of certain non-core domestic and international assets and costs stemming from the terminated merger agreement with Exelon Corporation. PSEG presents Operating Earnings because management believes that it is appropriate for investors to consider results excluding these items in addition to the results reported in accordance with GAAP. PSEG believes that the non- GAAP financial measure of Operating Earnings provides a consistent and comparable measure of performance of its businesses to help shareholders understand performance trends.  This information is not intended to be viewed as an alternative to GAAP information.

Capacity Position
* Delivery year runs from June 1  May 31
Only a portion of PSEG Power's capacity was open to realize prices in the recent PJM-RPM auctions.  Increasing amounts are open to realize prices in future years.
  A significant percent of Power's capacity was contracted as part of New Jersey's 3-year BGS* auction (Power currently serving 11 tranches from the 2005 auction, 20 tranches from 2006 and 19 tranches from 2007), as well as other contracting activity.
  The balance of Power's PJM capacity has obtained price certainty through May 31, 2009 from the first two RPM auctions.
  All of Power's New England capacity has obtained price certainty through May 31, 2010 as a result of the fixed price nature of the transitional FCM auction.
Existing capacity hedges support our forecast year-over-year improvement in capacity margin for 2007 of $125 - $175 million with similar improvement in 2008.
