The statements contained in this communication about our and our subsidiaries' future performance, including, without limitation, future revenues, earnings, strategies, prospects and all other statements that are not purely historical, are forward-looking statements for purposes of the safe harbor provisions under The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

GAAP Disclaimer
PSEG presents Operating Earnings in addition to its Net Income reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). Operating Earnings is a non-GAAP financial measure that differs from Net Income because it excludes the impact of the sale of certain non-core domestic and international assets and costs stemming from the terminated merger agreement with Exelon Corporation. PSEG presents Operating Earnings because management believes that it is appropriate for investors to consider results excluding these items in addition to the results reported in accordance with GAAP. PSEG believes that the non-GAAP financial measure of Operating Earnings provides a consistent and comparable measure of performance of its businesses to help shareholders understand performance trends.  This information is not intended to be viewed as an alternative to GAAP information. The last slide in this presentation includes a list of items excluded from Net Income to reconcile to Operating Earnings
, with a reference to that slide included on each of the slides where the non-GAAP information appears.  
These slides are only intended to be reviewed in conjunction with the oral presentation to which they relate.

Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) for the power sector is real

- NJ cap = 22.9 million tons

Allowance distribution methodology, "Leakage", and harmonizing with a national program are major concerns
NJ RGGI legislation and regulations are planned for Nov 2007
 and on schedule to go into effect January 1, 2009.
12
A key element of any Cap and Trade approach is the allowance distribution methodology.
Different approaches have been debated
:
Grandfathered (Historical)
Updated
Input
Output
Auction
RGGI states are going down path of 100% auction
The price of the credits, however, is independent of the allocation method and determined primarily by the level of the CO

cap.

PSE&G  Responding to environmental challenges 
Conservation through energy efficiency improvements and investment in hybrids, electric-drive bucket trucks and alternative fuels will cut carbon emissions by 140,000 tons over 10 years
Proposed investing $100 million in solar initiative that would meet 30 MW (50%) of renewable requirements over 2009-2010
Advocating for direct investment by utilities in customer efficiency programs
Most cost effective means of meeting State goals
 and playing a key role in designing programs to meet State goals.
21
Summary
States are not waiting for federal government to take action on climate issues
Key policy focus on electric sector is:
Energy efficiency
Renewables
New nuclear
Carbon capture/storage
PSEG is well positioned:
Generating fleet less carbon intensive than many competitors
Policymakers need utility patient capital for investments in energy efficiency and renewables
With a carbon constrained future, PSEG's Salem/Hope Creek a good location for new nuclear in latter part of next decade
22
PSEG  Meeting commitments
Results on track to meet earnings guidance
Meeting commitment to system reliability with major expansion of transmission system
Addressing NJ's clean energy commitments
Solar initiative
PSE&G to use more energy efficient equipment and vehicles

Only a portion of PSEG Power's capacity was open to realize prices in the recent PJM-RPM auctions.  Increasing amounts are open to realize prices in future years.
A significant percent of Power's capacity was contracted as part of
New Jersey's 3-year BGS* auction (Power currently serving 11 tranches from the 2005 auction, 20 tranches from 2006 and 19 tranches from 2007), as well as other contracting activity.
The balance of Power's PJM capacity has obtained price certainty
through May 31, 2009 from the first two RPM auctions.
All of Power's New England capacity has obtained price certainty
through May 31, 2010 as a result of the fixed price nature of the transitional FCM auction.
Existing capacity hedges support our forecast year-over-year improvement in capacity margin for 2007 of $125 - $175 million with similar improvement in 2008.

Our forecasted cash flows remain intact
We remain comfortable with a forecast
improvement in cash
- Operating income in line with expectations
- Electroandes sale to close in October
- Planned rate mechanisms for transmission investments would provide cash recovery during construction
Excess cash between $1.5 billion and $2.0 billion
should be available through 2011
 with
excess cash expected to be used to retire debt through first half of 2008, thereafter for incremental growth and/or share repurchase
