Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
          On November 1, 2007, Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated (PSEG) announced unaudited financial results for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2007. A copy of the earnings release and related slideshow presentation dated November 1, 2007 are furnished as Exhibits 99 and 99.1 to this Form 8-K. The information contained in this report is being furnished pursuant to Item 2.02 as directed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized. The signature of the undersigned company shall be deemed to relate only to matters having reference to such company and any subsidiaries thereof.
Date: November 1, 2007

Exhibit 99
Public Service Enterprise Group (PSEG) reported today (November 1, 2007) income from continuing operations for the third quarter of 2007 of $500 million or $1.97 per share compared to income from continuing operations of $372 million or $1.47 per share for the comparable period in 2006. Excluding an impairment of $7 million recognized during the third quarter of 2007, operating earnings for the third quarter of 2007 were $507 million or $2.00 per share. During the third quarter of 2006, merger-related expenses of $2 million recognized earlier were reversed resulting in operating earnings for the third quarter of $370 million or $1.47 per share. Including earnings from discontinued operations of $6 million or $0.02 per share, PSEG reported net income for the third quarter of 2007 of $506 million or $1.99 per share. Income from discontinued operations raised net income for the third quarter of 2006 by $2 million, or $0.01 per share to $374 million or $1.48 per share.
Ralph Izzo, chairman, president and chief executive officer of PSEG, said "the results reported by PSEG are a tremendous tribute to the hard work and focus of our employees. Strong operational performance combined with better than anticipated market prices place us on track to exceed our business plan objectives for the year."
"We are raising our full year 2007 earnings guidance to $5.15-$5.45 per share from $4.90-$5.30 per share." Izzo went on to say "Based on the normal performance of our current businesses, results are expected to be at the upper end of the range. We continue to forecast 2008 earnings growth expectations of 10%."
Operating earnings exclude the impact of the sale of certain non-core domestic and international assets and costs stemming from the merger agreement with Exelon Corporation that was terminated in September 2006. The table below provides a reconciliation of PSEG's net income to operating earnings (a non-GAAP) measure for the third quarter.
PSEG believes that the non-GAAP financial measure of "Operating Earnings" provides a consistent and comparable measure of performance of its businesses to help shareholders understand financial trends.
"We have been successful on many fronts", Izzo said. "In addition to operating our assets at top quartile levels, we have reduced our investment exposure in Latin America, and we have identified areas for investment in domestic markets that strengthen our reliability as well as advance our growth."
Operating earnings guidance by subsidiary for 2007 has been adjusted as follows:
Operating Earnings Review and Outlook by Operating Subsidiary
See Attachment 8 for detail regarding the quarter over quarter reconciliations for each of PSEG's businesses.
PSEG Power
PSEG Power reported operating earnings of $338 million ($1.33 per share) for the third quarter compared with operating earnings of $205 million ($0.82 per share) reported during the third quarter of 2006.
PSEG Power's margins benefited from higher pricing in all markets and an increase in output. Higher realized prices and stronger operations added $0.55 per share to earnings. The impact of higher prices was partly offset by recognition of a mark-to-market adjustment during the quarter of $0.03 per share. Approximately half of the increase in earnings was driven by a full quarter of higher prices (including capacity revenues) under the BGS contract effective on June 1. The continued strong performance of the nuclear fleet, coupled with improved performance from the combined cycle units, also allowed PSEG Power to take advantage of strong market dynamics during the quarter. An increase in operating costs of $0.03 per share was offset by an equivalent decrease in taxes during the quarter.
The nuclear fleet maintained its outstanding performance from last year. During the quarter, output for the fleet increased 1.1% over last year's very strong results. The results for the quarter brought the year to date capacity factor for the fleet to 94%; in line with expectations for a full year 2007 capacity factor of 92%. Supporting these full year expectations, Peach Bottom No. 3 resumed operations 19 days after entering its refueling outage on September 23; and, Hope Creek is scheduled to return to service in early November from a refueling outage which began on October 12.
William Levis, president and chief operating officer of PSEG Power, has indicated that the physical work at Hope Creek associated with the planned 125Mw uprate in the unit's capacity is expected to be completed during the current refueling outage. However, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's review and approval of the work is anticipated by the second quarter of 2008. Although a delay from earlier expectations, the unit should be operating at higher capacity levels for the critical summer period.
PSEG Power also, Levis said, "expects to be in a position to resume independent operation of its nuclear facilities by year-end." He mentioned that "our organization has been strengthened considerably over the past three years. We are prepared for the resumption of independent operations, which will establish a new milestone in our development."
PJM released the results of its Reliability Pricing Model (RPM) Base Residual Auction for the 2009/2010 delivery year on October 12, 2007. This represented the third in a series of auctions held throughout 2007 to provide the market with greater clarity around the value of investments in new and existing capacity to meet reliability requirements.
PSEG Power has requested that PJM perform feasibility studies to determine its ability to add a total of 1,000Mw of new gas-fired capacity at some of its existing generating stations located in the Eastern MAAC reliability region. The company intends to bid as much as 300-400Mw of the new capacity into the 2008 RPM auctions. Levis said, "the final decision to proceed with the investment will take into account issues such as capital and interconnection-
costs, available siting and any potential environmental permitting restrictions." He also added that "the new capacity will complement PSEG Power's existing PJM fleet, improve the overall efficiency of the fleet, and enhance reliability, in particular for New Jersey customers, where PJM indicates additional energy is needed."
PSEG Power anticipates fourth quarter results will continue to benefit from higher pricing from recontracting. The improvement in margins, however, will be partially offset by the cost of the fourth quarter refueling outage at Power's 100% owned Hope Creek nuclear unit as compared to the 2006 fourth quarter refueling outage for Power's 57% owned Salem Unit No. 1. The year-to-date and anticipated performance supports an increase in the operating earnings guidance for PSEG Power to $890-$940 million from $840-$920 million.
PSE&G
PSE&G reported operating earnings of $106 million ($0.42 per share) for the third quarter compared with operating earnings of $86 million ($0.34 per share) during the third quarter of 2006.
PSE&G's quarterly results reflect more normal returns associated with the impact of electric and gas rate adjustments implemented in November 2006. Rate relief accounted for $0.06 per share of the year-over-year improvement in earnings. Results for the quarter also benefited from the positive response by customers to PSE&G's appliance service business which added $0.01 per share.
A decline in financing costs added $0.02 per share to earnings. PSE&G continues to experience growth in demand. On a weather normalized basis, electric sales in the quarter grew by 1.7% over the year ago quarter. However, mild weather in July and August relative to above normal temperatures during the same period a year ago resulted in a decline in earnings for the quarter of $0.01 per share. The year-to-date performance of PSE&G supports an increase in the operating earnings guidance for 2007 to $360-$380 million from $340-$360 million.
PSE&G  for the sixth year in a row  was awarded the Reliability One Award for the Mid-Atlantic region by PA Consulting. Ralph LaRossa, president and chief operating officer for PSE&G, was extremely pleased that the commitment of PSE&G's employees to "delivering safe, reliable electric service to its customers" continues to be recognized.
PSEG Energy Holdings
Holdings reported operating earnings of $73 million ($0.29 per share) for the third quarter compared with operating earnings of $97 million ($0.38 per share) reported during the third quarter of 2006.
Cool and wet weather experienced in Texas this past summer relative to the abnormally hot and dry conditions a year ago accounted for the majority of the reduction in earnings for the quarter. Global's Texas generating assets recorded a 6 cents per share decline in the mark to market gain of 12 cents per share booked in the year ago quarter.
Holdings' Latin American distribution assets continued to perform well benefiting from strong economic growth and a reduction in line losses. These favorable operating conditions added $0.01 per share to earnings in the quarter. Higher interest expense caused by a debt issuance at SAESA, and the repatriation of cash, reduced earnings by $0.03 per share in the quarter. Earnings were also impacted by higher taxes amounting to $0.03 per share. Earnings from Holdings' subsidiary, Resources, improved by $0.02 per share for the quarter. A stock distribution from the Northwest Airlines bankruptcy settlement added $0.02 per share to earnings for the quarter. A decline in lease income reduced earnings in the quarter by $0.02 per share, but was offset by lower financing costs amounting to $0.02 per share.
"The market has been recognizing the value for high quality Latin American electric distribution and generating companies," said Matthew McGrath, president of PSEG Global. PSEG Global announced during the third quarter that it had reached agreement to sell its ownership of Electroandes. This sale closed on October 17, 2007 for a purchase price of $390 million, including the assumption of $106 million of debt. PSEG Global has also announced that it is in agreement to sell its 50% ownership in Chilquinta Energia S.A. (Chilquinta), an electric distribution company in Chile, and its 38% ownership of Luz del Sur S.A.A., an electric distribution company in Peru for $685 million. This transaction, which is expected to close by year-end, would provide PSEG Global with after-tax proceeds of $480-$500 million. Global, during the quarter, also recorded an after-tax impairment of $7 million related to its investment in Venezuela.
"The sale of these interests sharply reduces PSEG's investment in international assets, the cash is available for the company to pursue growth opportunities in our core U.S. markets or to consider share repurchases, once our targeted debt levels have been reached," said Thomas M. O'Flynn, president, PSEG Energy Holdings and executive vice president and chief financial officer, PSEG.

GAAP Disclaimer
PSEG presents Operating Earnings in addition to its Net Income reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Operating Earnings is a non-GAAP financial measure that differs from Net Income because it excludes the impact of the sale of certain non-core domestic and international assets and costs stemming from the terminated merger agreement with Exelon Corporation. PSEG presents Operating Earnings because management believes that it is appropriate for investors to consider results excluding these items in addition to the results reported in accordance with GAAP. PSEG believes that the non- GAAP financial measure of Operating Earnings provides a consistent and comparable measure of performance of its businesses to help shareholders understand performance trends.  This information is not intended to be viewed as an alternative to GAAP information. The last slide in this presentation includes a list of items excluded from Net Income to reconcile to Operating Earnings

RPM is Working
RPM has had an influence on the market  forced outage rates declining, retirements slowing, more DSM bid into market.
PSEG Power is taking steps to add 300 - 400MW ($250 - $350 million) of new gas-fired peaking capacity that could be bid into PJM's Reliability Pricing Model (RPM) base residual auctions in 2008.
PSEG Power has requested that PJM perform a feasibility study to determine the system impact of adding as much as 1,000MW of new gas-fired capacity at some of its existing generating stations located in the eastern MAAC reliability region.
The final decision to proceed with construction would take into account capital and interconnection costs, available siting and potential for environmental limitations.
