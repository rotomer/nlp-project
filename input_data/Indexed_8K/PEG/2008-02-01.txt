Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
          On February 1, 2008, PSEG announced unaudited financial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2007. A copy of the earnings release and the related slideshow presentation dated February 1, 2008 are furnished as Exhibits 99 and 99.1 to this Form 8-K. The information contained in this report is being furnished pursuant to Item 2.02 as directed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized. The signature of the undersigned company shall be deemed to relate only to matters having reference to such company and any subsidiaries thereof.

Exhibit 99
February 1, 2008
Public Service Enterprise Group (PSEG) reported today (February 1, 2008) 2007 Income from Continuing Operations of $1,319 million or $5.18 per share as compared to $679 million or $2.69 per share for 2006. Operating Earnings for the year 2007 were $1,377 million or $5.41 per share compared to 2006 Operating Earnings of $872 million or $3.45 per share. Including charges in 2007 associated with the sale of Latin American assets and other related items ($0.23 per share) and income from discontinued operations ($0.06 per share), PSEG reported Net Income for the full year 2007 of $1,335 million or $5.24 per share compared to Net Income for the full year 2006 of $739 million or $2.93 per share.
PSEG also reported Income from Continuing Operations for the fourth quarter of 2007 of $226 million, or $0.89 per share. This compared to fourth quarter 2006 results of $135 million, or $0.54 per share. Operating Earnings for the fourth quarter of 2007 were $277 million, or $1.09 per share compared to fourth quarter 2006 Operating Earnings of $136 million, or $0.54 per share. Charges in 2007 associated with asset sales and other items ($0.20 per share), and losses from discontinued operations ($0.01 per share) resulted in PSEG reporting Net Income for the quarter of $224 million, or $0.88 per share. A charge of $220 million ($0.87 per share) associated with the discontinuation of operations at the Lawrenceburg Energy facility, in December 2006, partially offset by income from operations of SAESA ($0.12 per share) and Electroandes ($0.03 per share) which were discontinued during 2007, and merger costs resulted in a Net Loss for the 2006 fourth quarter of $47 million or $0.18 per share.
Operating Earnings exclude the impact of the sale of certain non-core domestic and international assets. The table below provides a reconciliation of PSEG's Net Income to Operating Earnings (a non-GAAP measure) for the full year and fourth quarter.
PSEG believes that the non-GAAP financial measure of "Operating Earnings" provides a consistent and comparable measure of performance of its businesses to help shareholders understand performance trends.
"The results for the quarter reflect the continued solid operating performance of PSEG Power and PSE&G" said Ralph Izzo, chairman, president and chief executive officer of PSEG. He went on to say, "full year 2007's operating earnings were at the top of our guidance range despite the loss of earnings from most of our Latin American operations. The past year was a defining year for our company. Our strong operational performance positioned PSEG Power to benefit from robust competitive power markets. PSE&G reinforced its reputation as a company interested in maintaining reliability and providing cost effective solutions to New Jersey's energy requirements, and we have reduced our international risk and enhanced our financial flexibility by reducing debt with proceeds from the sale of assets."
Izzo also reaffirmed operating earnings guidance for 2008 of $5.60-$6.10 per share, which represents an 8% improvement (at the mid-point of the range) over 2007's operating earnings. "Strong operations and a continuation of supportive energy markets are behind our
forecast of solid earnings growth in 2008 despite the loss of earnings from the sale of our Latin American assets."
Operating earnings by subsidiary for 2007, and our guidance for 2008 is as follows:
Reported earnings and operating income guidance on a per share basis are before the impact of a two-for-one stock split effective on February 5, 2008.
"Our outlook for operating earnings in 2008, the improvement in the balance sheet and the strength of our cash flow" Izzo said "supported the board's recent decision to increase the common dividend by 10%." He went on to say "this latest increase by the board resets the dividend to a payout of earnings in the middle of a range, 40%-50%, which provides flexibility for dividend growth and new investment. The board also authorized a two-for-one stock split effective with trading on February 5 for holders of record on January 25. The split adjusts the price of our stock to a level many shareholders may find more affordable without affecting shareholder value. Both actions by the board are viewed as positive indicators for the future of our company."
Operating Earnings Review and Outlook by Operating Subsidiary
See Attachments 8 and 9 for detail regarding the quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year earnings reconciliations for each of PSEG's businesses.
PSEG Power
PSEG Power reported operating earnings of $205 million ($0.80 per share) for the fourth quarter of 2007 bringing full year operating earnings to $949 million ($3.73 per share), a record year for Power. On a comparative basis, PSEG Power reported operating earnings of $102 million ($0.40 per share) and $515 million ($2.04 per share) for the fourth quarter and full year 2006 respectively.
PSEG Power's margins in the fourth quarter of 2007 continued to benefit from higher contracted pricing. Power's results also benefited from the expiration of contracts at year-end 2006, and an expansion in the market's heat rate which supported an increase in the capacity factor of Power's combined cycle fleet. An improvement in revenue for ancillary services also added to earnings. These items increased earnings by $0.32 per share. Higher pricing more than offset a decline in volume from the nuclear fleet. A 33 day refueling outage at Power's 100%-owned Hope Creek nuclear facility reduced the nuclear fleet's capacity factor for the
quarter to 83.6% resulting in a full year capacity factor of 91.4%--slightly below our forecast capacity factor for the year of 92%. An improvement in commodity pricing resulted in an expansion of BGSS margins during the quarter adding $0.06 per share to earnings. (See attachment 8 for a detailed look at items affecting quarter over quarter earnings comparisons.)
PSEG Power's operating earnings forecast for 2008 reflects the benefit of higher electric power pricing with the expiration of below market contracts. The operation of the competitive energy and capacity auctions has allowed Power to lock up most of its base load coal and nuclear capacity going into 2008. The February 2008 BGS auction process will replace the expiring 2005 contract. Also, the nuclear fleet's capacity factor in 2008 is expected to decline slightly to 91%. A replacement of the steam generator at Salem 2 during the spring 2008 refueling outage will more than double the normal time scheduled for refueling. We also expect BGSS-related margins to return to more normal levels in 2008 following the very strong results for 2007.
William Levis, president and chief operating officer of PSEG Power, indicated that he was "pleased to announce that PSEG Power resumed independent operation of its nuclear facilities at year-end 2007". He went on to say he's "extremely proud of the team and their accomplishment. The work required to complete the turnover signified great due diligence and focus. The nuclear fleet represents a valuable strategic asset for PSEG. The resumption of independent operation establishes a new milestone in the company's development, and allows us to move forward in planning for future capacity requirements."
PSE&G
PSE&G reported operating earnings of $77 million ($0.30 per share) for the fourth quarter compared with operating earnings of $64 million ($0.25 per share) for the fourth quarter of 2006. The results for the fourth quarter brought full year operating earnings to $376 million ($1.48 per share) as compared with 2006 results of $262 million ($1.04 per share).
Results for the quarter continued to benefit from gas and electric rate relief implemented in mid-November 2006 ($0.04 per share). Earnings comparisons were also supported by more normal weather conditions in 2007 as compared to warmer than normal weather experienced during the fourth quarter of 2006 ($0.06 per share). Weather normalized sales growth also supported the year-over-year improvement in earnings ($0.03 per share). These items more than offset an increase in operating and maintenance expense ($0.06 per share) associated with growth in demand and new programs.
PSE&G is expected to experience a modest decline in 2008's operating earnings. A forecast decline in transmission peak revenues is expected to have an impact on revenue and earnings. Results will also reflect an increase in financing costs associated with higher capital outlays, and operating and maintenance costs tied to training related expenses.
PSE&G filed several pilot programs with the NJ Board of Public Utilities (BPU) during the fourth quarter to promote conservation, energy efficiency and carbon abatement. The State of New Jersey also moved a step closer toward meeting its carbon reduction goals in January
2008 with enactment of The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI). Ralph La Rossa, president and chief operating officer of PSE&G, stated "the RGGI law enables PSE&G to participate as a strong partner with the State of New Jersey in meeting its energy goals. Our next step is to work with the BPU in determining what role we play. The completion of work on our new customer information system by year-end is a necessary first step for PSE&G as we move toward a decision on installation of advanced meters on a broad scale."
PSE&G also filed a request with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) seeking permission to include in rate base Construction Work In Progress (CWIP) associated with the capital cost of its planned $600 million investment in the 500Kv Susquehanna to Roseland transmission line. As part of its request, PSE&G is seeking a 150 basis point improvement in its authorized return on equity for this project. Spending on this project would begin in earnest during 2009 based on a scheduled in-service date of 2012. A decision by FERC is anticipated by mid-year.
PSEG Energy Holdings
PSEG Energy Holdings reported operating earnings of $15 million ($0.06 per share) for the fourth quarter compared with an operating loss of $14 million ($0.05 per share) during the fourth quarter of 2006. The results for the fourth quarter brought Holdings' full year 2007 operating earnings to $115 million ($0.45 per share) as compared with 2006 results of $161 million ($0.63 per share). Holdings' 2007 and 2006 operating earnings exclude SAESA and Electroandes, which are reflected in discontinued operations. Electroandes was sold in October 2007.
The results for the fourth quarter of 2007 were largely influenced by a decline in spark spreads and recognition of a mark-to-market gain of $8 million associated with a long term contract held by Global's Texas generating assets versus a $15 million mark-to-market loss booked in the 2006 fourth quarter. This reversal improved reported earnings by $0.06 per share. Global's results also benefited from a decline in outage related operating and maintenance expense at the gas-fired Texas generating facilities ($0.01 per share). The operating income from Resources declined $0.01 per share in the fourth quarter of 2007 as compared to the prior year. An increase in income taxes ($0.02 per share) and other expenses ($0.01 per share) offset the benefits of a decline in financing costs ($0.02 per share).
PSEG Energy Holdings' announced in December that Global sold its interest in Chilquinta and Luz Del Sur for $685 million, and hired Credit Suisse to advise PSEG on the planned sale of SAESA. SAESA will be accounted for as discontinued operations given the potential for a sale to occur within a year.
PSEG Energy Holdings' operating income is expected to decline in 2008 to $45-$60 million. The outlook reflects the loss of earnings from the sale of Chilquinta and Luz del Sur in 2007. Holdings' operating earnings could also be affected by the need to reverse out a portion of the cumulative mark to market gain booked under the Texas generating assets long term contract over the remaining three year term of the contract. Results will also be affected by a normal decline in Resources' lease income.
Losses at the Enterprise level increased to $20 million ($0.07 per share) during the fourth quarter versus a $16 million loss ($0.06 per share) recognized in the 2006 fourth quarter. The results for 2008 will reflect the impact of a decline in interest expense associated with a fourth quarter 2007 reduction in debt of $709 million.

GAAP Disclaimer
PSEG presents Operating Earnings in addition to its Net Income reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Operating Earnings is a non-GAAP financial measure that differs from Net Income because it excludes the impact of the sale of certain non-core domestic and international assets and costs stemming from the terminated merger agreement with Exelon Corporation. PSEG presents Operating Earnings because management believes that it is appropriate for investors to consider results excluding these items in addition to the results reported in accordance with GAAP. PSEG believes that the non- GAAP financial measure of Operating Earnings provides a consistent and comparable measure of performance of its businesses to help shareholders understand performance trends. This information is not intended to be viewed as an alternative to GAAP information. The last slide in this presentation includes a list of items excluded from Net Income to reconcile to Operating Earnings, with a reference to that slide included on each of the slides where the non-GAAP information appears. These slides are only intended to be reviewed in conjunction with the oral presentation to which they relate.
