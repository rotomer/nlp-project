GAAP Disclaimer
PSEG presents Operating Earnings in addition to its Net Income reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). Operating Earnings is a non-GAAP financial measure that differs from Net Income because it excludes the impact of the sale of certain non-core domestic and international assets and costs stemming from the terminated merger agreement with Exelon Corporation. PSEG presents Operating Earnings because management believes that it is appropriate for investors to consider results excluding these items in addition to the results reported in accordance with GAAP. PSEG believes that the non-GAAP financial measure of Operating Earnings provides a consistent and comparable measure of performance of its businesses to help shareholders understand performance trends.  This information is not intended to be viewed as an alternative to GAAP information. The last slide in this presentation includes a list of items excluded from Net Income to reconcile to Operating Earnings
, with a reference to that slide included on each of the slides where the non-GAAP information appears.  
These slides are intended to be reviewed in conjunction with the oral presentation to which they relate.

Climate Change: State, Regional and Federal Policy Developments
Anne Hoskins
Vice President - Federal Affairs and Policy, PSEG
Climate change is a classic example of the intersection between public policy and business 
 at all levels of the government.
Climate Change

21
New Jersey's 2020 State Energy Goals 
20% Reduction in projected BAU Consumption
20% Renewable Energy
Reduction to 1990 GHG Emissions Levels
 are a challenge and an opportunity for PSEG.
BAU: Business as Usual                           GHG: Greenhouse Gas
BAU: Business as Usual                           GHG: Greenhouse Gas
22
New Jersey's 2020 Energy Goals  Investment Opportunities
20% Reduction in BAU Consumption = 20,000 GWh of electricity in 2020
2004 NJ BPU study: 13,000 GWh of improved energy efficiency in New Jersey is economically feasible, at an incremental cost of over $5 billion; demand grows, but at a lower rate.
20% Renewable Energy = 16,000 GWh of renewable generation in 2020
State Energy Master Plan modeling presumes by 2020: 1,500 MW of solar capacity; 450 MW of biomass capacity and 300 MW of off-shore wind capacity.
At today's prices, this would cost over $10 billion, and would only achieve roughly 1/3 of the 16,000 GWh goal.
1990 GHG Levels = 46 million tons of CO
2
reduced in 2020
20% renewable energy = 10 million tons
20% consumption reduction = 12 million tons
24 million tons remain (one new 1,500 MW nuclear plant would save roughly 12 million tons)
23
Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) - Overview
Regional cap and trade program
Participating states: CT, MA, MD,  ME, NH, VT, NY, NJ, RI, and DE
Goal: CO
2
emissions from power plants capped in 2009; that cap is reduced by 10% between 2015  2019
24
NJ  RGGI enabling legislation enacted in January 2008 
 contained several provisions of importance to PSEG.
Mitigate Leakage
Phase-out RGGI
Utility Investment in Efficiency
Renewables
and
25
The next steps involve implementing the legislation 
 by defining the ground rules for carbon trading, leakage control and utility investment opportunities.
Efficiency and Renewable Rules
Leakage Mechanism
Carbon Auction
26
PSEG is in active dialogue around Federal carbon cap and trade legislative proposals 
 advocating rewarding clean generation and supporting one national trading system.
Strong Carbon Mandates
Allocation / Auction
Role for Utilities
One Nationwide System
27
Federal carbon cap and trade legislation is increasingly likely 
78 Congressional hearings on climate change
8 major bills on climate change introduced
Lieberman-Warner approved by Senate committee
2007 Activities
Senate floor debate after Memorial Day recess?
Slower action in the House
Legislation unlikely in 2008
 although the timeframe for passage may extend to 2009.
2008 Prospects
28
With the passage of time increased evidence has heightened concern over climate change.
PSEG will continue its efforts to support a national carbon trading system.

Coal Emissions Output
Aggregate emissions will decline nearly 70% after installation of the pollution control equipment
The installation will allow for fuel flexibility in future years
Fossil spending on BET reaches a peak of over $500 million in 2008
Fossil's coal fleet will be well positioned in 2010, with a dramatic reduction in capital spending on pollution control equipment

PSEG's evaluation of the proposed backbone transmission projects:
Northern 500kV route into Jefferson and Roseland

PJM approval was received for the $600-$650 million Susquehanna to Roseland line in October 2007
Siting and permitting process underway
Incentive filing submitted to FERC for:
150 BPS adder to ROE
100% CWIP in Rate Base
FERC approval of the MAPP projects also mandates an additional $100 million of capital at Salem/Hope Creek (2014-2015)
Pending FERC approval of Sub Transmission to Transmission system reliability investments represents about $250 million through 2012, post- 2012 ~$60 million/year
Other approved RTEP projects ~$250 million also contribute meaningfully to improved reliability and earnings growth
Backbone projects are in preliminary stages but present real opportunity to improve reliability throughout the state, with the potential investment of ~ $1.5B through 2015
When coupled with formula rate design
and additional incentives, it will provide current return on forecasted capital expenditures thereby improving profitability.

Due to market uncertainty 
Key drivers behind decision to remain largely unhedged beyond 2008:
Oversold market: Many generators seeking a hedge, limited appetite among hedge providers
Market uncertainty:
Uncertainty relating to move to a nodal pricing market
Recent sudden loss of wind generation in western ERCOT resulting in grid instability
Transmission maintenance: Extensive maintenance of 345kV line near Global's Odessa unit

Resources tax issues monitored closely; ultimate resolution is expected to take several years
Strong cash flow generation for debt retirement and growth
Attractive renewable generation opportunities in PSEG core markets  PSEG is well- positioned to participate in the rapidly- growing renewable generation marketplace
