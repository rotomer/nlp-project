Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
          On May 6, 2008, Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated (PSEG) announced unaudited financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2008. A copy of the earnings release and related slideshow presentation dated May 6, 2008 are furnished as Exhibits 99 and 99.1 to this Form 8-K. The information contained in this report is being furnished pursuant to Item 2.02 as directed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized. The signature of the undersigned company shall be deemed to relate only to matters having reference to such company and any subsidiaries thereof.

Public Service Enterprise Group (PSEG) reported today (May 6, 2008) First Quarter 2008 Income from Continuing Operations of $434 million or $0.85 per share as compared to $321 million or $0.63 per share for the First Quarter of 2007. Excluding the premium on bond redemptions of $1 million (related to asset sales) recognized during the first quarter of 2008, Operating Earnings for the first quarter were $435 million or $0.85 per share. Operating earnings were the same as Income from Continuing Operations for the first quarter of 2007. Including Income from Discontinued Operations, PSEG reported Net Income for the First Quarter of 2008 of $448 million or $0.88 per share compared to Net Income for the First Quarter of 2007 of $329 million or $0.65 per share.
Operating Earnings exclude the impact of the sale of certain non-core domestic and international assets. The table below provides a reconciliation of PSEG's Net Income to Operating Earnings (a non-GAAP measure) for the first quarter.
*
Results adjusted to reflect 2:1 stock split effective February 4, 2008.
PSEG believes that the non-GAAP financial measure of "Operating Earnings" provides a consistent and comparable measure of performance of its businesses to help shareholders understand performance trends.
"Our first quarter results highlight our continued focus on strong operations across the system," said Ralph Izzo, chairman, president and chief executive officer of PSEG. "Our operational focus allows PSEG to maintain a competitive cost structure and provide a reliable product to our customers. This operational success was complemented by achieving positive outcomes for several regulatory/policy initiatives that help to clarify the role of PSE&G in providing investments in clean, efficient and reliable energy resources."
Izzo also reaffirmed operating earnings guidance for 2008 of $2.80-$3.05 per share, which represents an 8% improvement (at the mid-point of the range) over 2007's operating earnings. "The first quarter leads the way. Strong operations and a continuation of supportive energy markets are behind our forecast of solid earnings growth in 2008."
Our operating earnings guidance by subsidiary for 2008 follows.
Operating Earnings Review and Outlook by Operating Subsidiary
See Attachment 5 for detail regarding the quarter-over-quarter earnings reconciliations for each of PSEG's businesses.
PSEG Power
PSEG Power reported operating earnings for the first quarter of 2008 of $275 million ($0.54 per share) compared to operating earnings of $219 million ($0.43 per share) in the first quarter of 2007.
PSEG Power's margins in the first quarter of 2008 benefited from recontracting at higher prices, and an increase in generation in response to strong market fundamentals. These factors added $0.15 per share to earnings. The nuclear fleet operated in line with expectations at an average capacity factor of 94% during the quarter. Salem no. 2, 57%-owned and operated by PSEG Power, began its refueling and steam generator replacement outage on March 11 and is scheduled to return to service this month. The unit's operating capacity will increase by 15MW upon its return to service.
Results for the quarter were impacted by a slight decline in margin under the BGSS contract against very strong results reported in the year ago period. More mild winter weather reduced demand which more than offset the effect of higher natural gas prices. This resulted in a $0.01 per share decline in earnings for the quarter. In addition, equity market turmoil in the first quarter resulted in a lower value for some securities held by Power's nuclear decommissioning trust. Lower trust earnings reduced Power's earnings by $0.03 per share. Earnings in the quarter were also lower as a result of higher interest expense. This increase in finance costs reduced earnings by $0.01 per share.
PSEG Power's operating earnings forecast for 2008 reflects the benefit of higher electric power pricing with the expiration of below market contracts. The operation of the competitive energy and capacity auctions has allowed Power to hedge most of its base load coal and nuclear output in 2008. The February 2008 BGS auction contract for $111.50 per MWh will replace the 2005 contract expiring on June 1. This improvement in pricing will be offset somewhat by higher fuel costs, and an anticipated decline in BGSS-related margins for the full year following very strong results in 2007.
William Levis, president and chief operating officer of PSEG Power, indicated that he's "extremely pleased with work by PSEG Power's employees. This focus and dedication support existing operations, and represent critical elements of success as Power looks to pursue growth in the business".
PSE&G
PSE&G reported operating earnings of $136 million ($0.26 per share) for the first quarter compared with operating earnings of $131 million ($0.26 per share) for the first quarter of 2007.
The results for the quarter were affected by a number of factors. Weather conditions during the quarter were mild relative to normal, and relative to a year ago. Degree Days were 6.6% warmer than normal during the first quarter versus 1.9% colder than normal last year. More mild weather conditions reduced demand for gas and lowered earnings comparisons by $0.02 per share. The abnormal weather conditions had only a nominal impact on electric demand and earnings. PSE&G's results were also affected by a slight increase in operating and maintenance expense of 2.3% which reduced earnings comparisons by $0.01 per share.
These items were fully offset by a decline in the tax rate during the quarter. PSE&G's tax rate was lower during the quarter as a result of an IRS approved refund claim at PSEG for earlier tax years. This adjustment added $0.04 per share to PSE&G's earnings.
PSE&G is expected to experience a modest decline in 2008's operating earnings. A forecast decline in transmission peak revenues is expected to have an impact on revenue and earnings. Results will also reflect an increase in financing costs associated with higher capital outlays, and operating and maintenance costs tied to training-related expenses.
The quarter was marked by the successful resolution of three key regulatory initiatives. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) approved PSE&G's incentive rate request on its planned $600-$650 million investment in the 500kV Susquehanna to Roseland transmission line. FERC, in March 2008, also supported PSE&G's filing to classify as transmission (rather
than distribution) certain 69kV transmission facilities that PSE&G will construct. PSE&G also recently received approval from the NJ Board of Public Utilities (BPU) for its $105 million solar initiative. This program will support the installation of 30MW of solar capacity over a two-year period.
Ralph LaRossa, president and chief operating officer of PSE&G, said "the support shown by our key regulatory agencies for these important initiatives lays the groundwork for our long-term capital programs."
PSEG Energy Holdings
PSEG Energy Holdings reported operating earnings of $29 million ($0.06 per share) versus an operating loss of $11 million (($0.02) per share) during the first quarter of 2007. Operating earnings exclude the impact of SAESA which was discontinued for accounting purposes in the fourth quarter of 2007.
The improvement in operating earnings for the quarter was largely influenced by factors affecting the earnings comparisons for Holdings' Global subsidiary. A decline in forward spark spreads, as compared to the prior year, led to MTM gains of $1.8 million in the first quarter of 2008 versus a loss of $19.0 million in the first quarter of 2007, improving reported earnings by $0.04 per share. The Texas generating units performed in line with year ago results. Global's earnings comparisons were also affected by international asset sales which closed during 2007. The absence of this income in 2008 reduced earnings comparisons by $0.03 per share.
These items were offset by a decline in interest expense during the first quarter which improved earnings by $0.02 per share. Global also experienced a benefit from an IRS approved refund claim at PSEG for earlier tax years. This reduction in taxes improved Global's earnings comparisons by $0.06 per share. Earnings from Holdings' Resources subsidiary were flat against year ago results.
PSEG Energy Holdings' operating income is expected to decline in 2008. The outlook reflects the loss of earnings from the sale of Chilquinta and Luz del Sur in 2007. Holdings' operating earnings could also be affected by the need to reverse a portion of the cumulative mark to market gain booked under the Texas generating assets long term contract which expires at the end of 2010.
Holdings continues to move forward on plans to exit its international businesses. The sale of Global's investment in SAESA, announced in December 2007, is expected to close in the third quarter of 2008.
Regarding income tax claims relative to certain of Holdings' leveraged lease investments, there have been two recent court decisions involving other entities. One case, which was on appeal, has been decided in favor of the government. The other case involves a jury verdict that is currently in dispute. Based on these developments, PSEG anticipates that, absent reaching an agreement with the IRS to resolve the issue, a decision to proceed to litigation may occur in 2008. It is also
possible that we will revisit our reserve levels for these lease transactions which could result in a material charge to earnings.
PSEG expects that it could have $3 billion of cash available through the end of 2011 to pursue disciplined growth of its businesses through acquisition, construction or other development projects or to re-purchase common stock. It is possible, however, that the amount of cash flow required to pursue resolution of Holdings' tax claims may occur sooner and may be larger than initially contemplated in our long range forecast of cash available through 2011. Management believes that any financing activity that may be required to pursue resolution of these claims can occur with manageable impact to PSEG's key credit metrics.

Note 1:
PSEG's credit agreements contain covenants that require PSEG's debt to capitalization ratio not to exceed 70.0% at any time. This ratio is presented for the benefit of the investors and the related securities to which the covenants apply and is not intended as a financial performance or liquidity measure.
2008
The debt to capitalization ratio calculated under PSEG's credit agreements as of March 31, 2008 was 47.1%. The ratio as calculated pursuant to these covenants excludes non-recourse project debt ($373 million) and securitization debt ($1.668 billion). It also includes capital lease obligations ($46 million), and certain other obligations such as guarantees and letters of credit ($59 million), excluding any letters of credit related to collateral posting on energy/commodity contracts. The calculation excludes the equity reduction ($167 million) from the funded status of the pension and benefit plans associated with FAS 158 "Employers' Accounting for Defined Pension and Other Post-Retirement Plans" and excludes the Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss ($493 million) related to the mark-to-market of energy contracts.
2007
The debt to capitalization ratio calculated under PSEG's credit agreements as of December 31, 2007 was 49.9%. The ratio as calculated pursuant to these covenants excludes non-recourse project debt ($387 million) and securitization debt ($1.708 billion). It also includes capital lease obligations ($47 million), and certain other obligations such as guarantees and letters of credit ($55 million), excluding any letters of credit related to collateral posting on energy/commodity contracts. The calculation excludes the equity reduction ($167 million) from the funded status of the pension and benefit plans associated with FAS 158 "Employers' Accounting for Defined Pension and Other Post-Retirement Plans" and excludes the Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss ($250 million) related to the mark-to-market of energy contracts.
Attachment 4
Includes changes in working capital of $400 million and $440 million for 2008 and 2007, respectively. Changes in working capital are primarily attributable to BGSS cash flows at PSEG Power. The 2008 changes in working capital declined slightly due to cash tax payments at PSEG Energy Holdings related to 2007 asset sales, partially offset by increased cash collections at PSE&G.

GAAP Disclaimer
PSEG presents Operating Earnings in addition to its Net Income reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). Operating Earnings is a non-GAAP financial measure that differs from Net Income because it excludes the impact of the sale of certain non-core domestic and international assets. PSEG presents Operating Earnings because management believes that it is appropriate for investors to consider results excluding these items in addition to the results reported in accordance with GAAP. PSEG believes that the non- GAAP financial measure of Operating Earnings provides a consistent and comparable measure of performance of its businesses to help shareholders understand performance trends.  This information is not intended to be viewed as an alternative to GAAP information. The last slide in this presentation includes a list of items excluded from Net Income to reconcile to Operating Earnings
, with a reference to that slide included on each of the slides where the non-GAAP information appears.  
These slides are intended to be reviewed in conjunction with the oral presentation to which they relate.

Summary
Cash flow projection
During Q1 2008, cash from operations improved by approximately $100 million over the same period last year.  Excluding changes in working capital, cash from operations is approximately $140 million higher than the first quarter of 2007.
PSEG expects that it could have up to $3 billion of cash available through the end of 2011 to pursue disciplined growth of its businesses or to repurchase common stock.
Our forecast of cash available over 2008-2011 assumed some financing costs associated with meeting potential tax claims related to Holdings' leveraged lease investments.
Our ultimate liability could exceed our forecast and may be met sooner than anticipated.  However, management believes that the impact of any financing activity would have a manageable impact on its key credit metrics.

PSEG - Summary
The PSEG organization has maintained its focus on safe and reliable operations
