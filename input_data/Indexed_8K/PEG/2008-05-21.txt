Forward-Looking Statement
Readers are cautioned that statements contained in this presentation about our and our subsidiaries' future performance, including future revenues, earnings, strategies, prospects and all other statements that are not purely historical, are forward-looking statements for purposes of the safe harbor provisions under The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

The results or events predicted in these statements may differ materially from actual results or events.  Factors which could cause results or events to differ from current expectations include, but are not limited to:
Adverse Changes in energy industry, policies and regulation, including market rules that may adversely affect our operating results.
Any inability of our energy transmission and distribution businesses to obtain adequate and timely rate relief and/or regulatory approvals from federal and/or state regulators.
Changes in federal and/or state environmental regulations that could increase our costs or limit operations of our generating units.
Changes in nuclear regulation and/or developments in the nuclear power industry generally, that could limit operations of our nuclear generating units.

GAAP Disclaimer
PSEG presents Operating Earnings in addition to its Net Income reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). Operating Earnings is a non-GAAP financial measure that differs from Net Income because it excludes the impact of the sale of certain non-core domestic and international assets and costs stemming from the terminated merger agreement with Exelon Corporation. PSEG presents Operating Earnings because management believes that it is appropriate for investors to consider results excluding these items in addition to the results reported in accordance with GAAP. PSEG believes that the non-GAAP financial measure of Operating Earnings provides a consistent and comparable measure of performance of its businesses to help shareholders understand performance trends.  This information is not intended to be viewed as an alternative to GAAP information. The last slide in this presentation includes a list of items excluded from Net Income to reconcile to Operating Earnings
, with a reference to that slide included on each of the slides where the non-GAAP information appears.  
These slides are intended to be reviewed in conjunction with the oral presentation to which they relate.

emissions 
 Power stands in good position based on its low carbon fleet.
($/Ton)
The diversity of the portfolio makes Power well positioned to capture value in a wide range of potential regulatory outcomes, with about half of Power's revenue increase expected to remain in EBITDA after the cost of carbon credits.

100% CWIP in Rate Base
FERC approval of the MAPP projects also mandates an additional $100 million of capital at Salem/Hope Creek (2014-2015)
FERC approval of Sub Transmission to Transmission system reliability investments represents about $250 million through 2012, post- 2012 ~$60 million/year
Other approved RTEP projects ~$250 million also contribute meaningfully to improved reliability and earnings growth
Backbone projects are in preliminary stages but present real opportunity to improve reliability throughout the state, with the potential investment of ~ $1.5B through 2015
When coupled with formula rate design
and additional incentives, it will provide current return on forecasted capital expenditures thereby improving profitability.

Due to market uncertainty 
Key drivers behind decision to remain largely unhedged beyond 2008:
Oversold market: Many generators seeking a hedge, limited appetite among hedge providers
Market uncertainty:
Uncertainty relating to move to a nodal pricing market
Recent sudden loss of wind generation in western ERCOT resulting in grid instability
Transmission maintenance: Extensive maintenance of 345kV line near Global's Odessa unit

Leveraged leases under challenge by IRS
PSEG's Energy Holdings' Resources Subsidiary has $1.5 billion invested in LILO / SILO type lease transactions.
Have been in discussions with the Office of Appeals of the IRS.
Recorded $904 million in deferred taxes through March 31, 2008 related to these transactions.  Under a total loss scenario, after tax interest of $195 million would become due.
In 2008, may decide to litigate.  It is also possible that we may re- measure  our reserve levels for these transactions in the near-term and record a material charge to earnings.
 LILO / SILO potential tax liability manageable within key credit metrics.
