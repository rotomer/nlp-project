GAAP Disclaimer
PSEG presents Operating Earnings in addition to its Net Income reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). Operating Earnings is a non-GAAP financial measure that differs from Net Income because it excludes the impact of the sale of certain non-core domestic and international assets and costs stemming from the terminated merger agreement with Exelon Corporation. PSEG presents Operating Earnings because management believes that it is appropriate for investors to consider results excluding these items in addition to the results reported in accordance with GAAP. PSEG believes that the non-GAAP financial measure of Operating Earnings provides a consistent and comparable measure of performance of its businesses to help shareholders understand performance trends.  This information is not intended to be viewed as an alternative to GAAP information. The last slide in this presentation includes a list of items excluded from Net Income to reconcile to Operating Earnings
, with a reference to that slide included on each of the slides where the non-GAAP information appears.  
These slides are intended to be reviewed in conjunction with the oral presentation to which they relate.

Cash flow projection
During Q1 2008, cash from operations improved by approximately   $100 million over the same period last year.  Excluding changes in working capital, cash from operations is approximately $140 million higher than the first quarter of 2007.
PSEG expects that it could have up to $3 billion of cash available through the end of 2011 to pursue disciplined growth of its businesses or to repurchase common stock.
Our forecast of cash available over 2008-2011 assumed some financing costs associated with meeting potential tax claims related to Holdings' leveraged lease investments.
Our ultimate liability could exceed our forecast and may be met   sooner than anticipated.  However, management believes that the impact of any financing activity would have a manageable impact on its key credit metrics.
Redeploying our $3.0B of discretionary cash towards additional growth and / or share repurchases
drives our Consolidated earnings growth rate resulting in a total shareholder return between 10  13%.
