Forward-Looking Statement
Readers are cautioned that statements contained in this presentation about our and our subsidiaries' future performance, including future revenues, earnings, strategies, prospects and all other statements that are not purely historical, are forward-looking statements for purposes of the safe harbor provisions under The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although we believe that our expectations are based on reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance they will be achieved. The results or events predicted in these statements may differ materially from actual results or events. Factors which could cause results or events to differ from current expectations include, but are not limited to:
 - 
Adverse changes in energy industry, policies and regulation, including market rules that may adversely affect our operating results.
 - 
Any inability of our energy transmission and distribution businesses to obtain adequate and timely rate relief and/or regulatory approvals from federal and/or state regulators.
 - 
Changes in federal and/or state environmental regulations that could increase our costs or limit operations of our generating units.
 - 
Changes in nuclear regulation and/or developments in the nuclear power industry generally, that could limit operations of our nuclear
generating units.
 - 
Actions or activities at one of our nuclear units that might adversely affect our ability to continue to operate that unit or other units at the same site.
 - 
Any inability to balance our energy obligations, available supply and trading risks.
 - 
Any deterioration in our credit quality.
 - 
Any inability to realize anticipated tax benefits or retain tax credits.
 - 
Increases in the cost of or interruption in the supply of fuel and other commodities necessary to the operation of our generating units.
 - 
Delays or cost escalations in our construction and development activities.
 - 
Adverse capital market performance of our decommissioning and defined benefit plan trust funds.
 - 
Changes in technology and/or increased customer conservation.
For further information, please refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K, including Item 1A. Risk Factors, and subsequent reports on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These documents address in further detail our business, industry issues and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in this presentation.  In addition, any forward-looking statements included herein represent our estimates only as of today and should not be relied upon as representing our estimates as of any subsequent date.

GAAP Disclaimer
PSEG presents Operating Earnings in addition to its Net Income reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). Operating Earnings is a non-GAAP financial measure that differs from Net Income because it excludes the impact of the sale of certain non-core domestic and international assets and costs stemming from the terminated merger agreement with Exelon Corporation. PSEG presents Operating Earnings because management believes that it is appropriate for investors to consider results excluding these items in addition to the results reported in accordance with GAAP. PSEG believes that the non-GAAP financial measure of Operating Earnings provides a consistent and comparable measure of performance of its businesses to help shareholders understand performance trends. This information is not intended to be viewed as an alternative to GAAP information. The last slide in this presentation includes a list of items excluded from Net Income to reconcile to Operating Earnings, with a reference to that slide included on each of the slides where the non-GAAP information appears. These slides are intended to be reviewed in conjunction with the oral presentation to which they relate.
