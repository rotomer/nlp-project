Energy Efficiency, Demand Response and Renewables: Opportunities for Growth
Climate Change
The science on Climate Change is real and not debatable.
Satisfying the world's appetite for energy contributes to the growing crisis of global climate change.
NJ can help lead the way in reducing the threat of climate change, and position NJ to be as economically competitive as possible as the world mobilizes to address that threat.
PSE&G is committed to apply its broad-based expertise and "patient" capital in new ways to reduce energy demand, spur investment in renewable resources and develop new sources of carbon-free supply.
PSE&G will continue to do its part as a leader in the energy industry and responsible corporate citizen, working closely with other stakeholders to tackle the most important environmental challenge of our time.

Campaigning for tougher power plant emission standards
Installing new electrical wires and state-of-the-art  transformers that are expected to reduce carbon emissions by almost 60,000 tons by year 2020
CFL Pledge Campaign
Replacing 1,300 corporate fleet vehicles with fuel-efficient hybrids
Advanced Metering Infrastructure BPU Filing
Carbon Abatement Pilot BPU Filing
Helping customers obtain the latest energy-saving technology, such as     
      
programmable thermostats and high-efficiency lighting
EMP Working Group leadership and participation
Utility consensus position on utility participation in efficiency
RGGI legislation
10
PSE&G's Blueprint for Sustainability  a challenge and an opportunity
New Jersey has passed legislation that recognizes the important role of utilities in promoting a sustainable energy future.
In April, PSE&G received approval from the NJ BPU to begin a $105 million investment in solar energy.
We are working hard to obtain approval of two other initiatives:
Carbon abatement pilot
AMI pilot to deploy and test advanced metering infrastructure
11
Why did PSE&G initiate the Solar Loan Program?
At PSE&G, we're committed to doing our part to save energy, slow global warming, and reduce our dependence on foreign oil. As New Jersey's largest utility, PSE&G is uniquely positioned to provide the capital resources needed to implement this program.
12
Overview  Innovative Program
In April, PSE&G received BPU approval of a 2-energy year program to provide for the financing of solar panels and related equipment (Solar Energy System) to properly qualified borrowers on a first come, first served basis.  
The Solar Energy System must be installed within PSE&G's
electric
distribution area and be eligible for net metering.
Each loan will be secured by a first priority lien on the solar equipment, Solar Renewable Energy Certificates (SRECs) and project documents collectively, the "Collateral".
The borrower can repay the loan either in cash or by delivering SRECs generated by the Solar Energy System to PSE&G as payment.
PSE&G estimates that the financing will represent approximately 40% to 60% of total capital cost to purchase and install a Solar Energy System.
The actual loan amount is based on the Solar Energy System production capabilities (anticipated energy (mwh)).
13
PSE&G is exploring additional investments
  
* Plans not finalized and assumes that all regulatory approvals are obtained in the timeframe needed.
14
PV Solar:
PSE&G supplies 50% of the RPS requirements
Declining costs would increase % of RPS supplied with
same dollar today.
Energy
Efficiency
:
50% of EMP goal
(excluding portion met by code changes)
in PSE&G service territory.
Demand
Response:
Retool current AC Cycling program to replace existing
equipment.
Onshore
Wind:
5MW on-shore wind; utility-owned
CHP
:
Focus on the hospital segment to capture a % of the
total EMP load of 1500MW.
Other:
Consideration for emerging opportunities such as, green
collar jobs, geothermal, "Green Street Lights" and PHEV  
Why PSE&G?
15
Throughout its 104-year history PSE&G has been committed to
providing safe, highly reliable energy as cost-effectively as possible.
PSE&G is part of the community it serves and its customers are its
neighbors.  This close relationship puts the utility in a unique position
to promote energy efficiency, house- by-house, neighborhood-by-
neighborhood to all of its customers, including urban residents, low-
income customers, and renters.
PSE&G has staying power and can deploy capital over the long term to
ensure renewable sources and energy-efficiency gains are sustained.
We call that "patient" capital.
PSE&G is a national leader committed to reducing our collective
carbon footprint.

PSE&G's pre-tax WACC is 11.11%.  In the Residential segment, the interest rate of 6.5% is supplemented with a charge to all ratepayers to provide PSE&G its WACC on the loan.
The settlement also defines a guaranteed PSE&G ROE of 9.75% with recoverable administrative costs not to exceed $1MM in any year and no lost revenue.
If loans are paid off early, PSE&G retains the right to purchase SRECs through a call option.  The call option price is 75% of the then current Market Value of SRECs.  The parties agreed that the call option provides benefits to ratepayers after the loan has been repaid.  The price will be determined at the time the Company seeks to exercise the call option.
19
Key Loan Terms and Conditions
20
The borrower will fully repay the loans by providing PSE&G with
SRECs or cash, to repay principal and interest.
For every megawatt hour of energy produced by the Solar
Energy System, NJ's Office of Clean Energy will credit the
borrower's SREC account with one SREC (1mwh = 1 SREC).
Periodically, the SRECs will be transferred to PSE&G's SREC
account as payment of the loan.
For repayment purposes, PSE&G will value the SRECs at the
greater of:  the floor price of $475 per SREC, or the actual market
value at the time the SREC is credited.
Loan repayments are scheduled as fixed monthly payments
containing interest and principal.
Key Loan Terms and Conditions
PSE&G will conduct an annual true-up to compare the amount due under the loan agreement with the sum of the value of all SRECs generated that year.
The borrower will be required to pay any resulting shortfall (in cash) to PSE&G.  The owner of the Solar Energy System bears the production risk.
If the value of the SRECs exceeds the amount due under the loan agreement, such surplus will be credited toward the outstanding balance to accelerate the amortization of the loan.
                                 
Each borrower will have a minimum credit score, no bankruptcy in the preceding 3 years and a favorable PSE&G credit assessment.
21
Cost Recovery
PSE&G will recover the net monthly revenue requirements associated with the Program through a new Solar Pilot Recovery Charge ("SPRC"), which will be applicable to all electric Rate Schedules.  
PSE&G will defer costs to the SPRC for future recovery.

SRECs used as currency for loan repayment of principle and interest.  SREC value >= $475.  SREC value set by Mkt value on day of transaction.
At this point, the SREC certificate is a paper product.

Ratepayer sends cash to cover repayment of
Loan with
WACC return + recoverable Admin cost.
Public Market
Net  proceeds from SREC sale is sent to Rate Payer. (net after admin cost of auction)
PSE&G auctions its SRECs to the market.  It does not make a gain or loss.
PSE&Gs SRECs sent to its auction process
PSE&Gs SRECs sold at market price
Proceeds from SREC sold to PSE&G
When SREC > $475, Ratepayer will realize a benefit to the extent the loan is prepaid and the call option for the SRECs are exercised.  When SREC < $475, Ratepayer will experience a shortfall.  When SREC = $475, Ratepayer is   
        neutral with regard to the non-residential
        loans.  The ratepayer is always out of
        pocket with respect to the admin cost and to cover the difference between WACC and the 6.5% coupon rate on the residential loans.
Ratepayer funds repayment of loan.
The current SREC life is 1 year.  A proposed change to the SREC life would change the SREC life to 2 energy year plus 3 months.
