GAAP Disclaimer
PSEG presents Operating Earnings in addition to its Net Income reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). Operating Earnings is a non-GAAP financial measure that differs from Net Income because it excludes the impact of the sale of certain non-core domestic and international assets and costs stemming from the terminated merger agreement with Exelon Corporation. PSEG presents Operating Earnings because management believes that it is appropriate for investors to consider results excluding these items in addition to the results reported in accordance with GAAP. PSEG believes that the non-GAAP financial measure of Operating Earnings provides a consistent and comparable measure of performance of its businesses to help shareholders understand performance trends.  This information is not intended to be viewed as an alternative to GAAP information. The last slide in this presentation includes a list of items excluded from Net Income to reconcile to Operating Earnings
, with a reference to that slide included on each of the slides where the non-GAAP information appears.  
These slides are intended to be reviewed in conjunction with the oral presentation to which they relate.

Transmission opportunities will require substantial deployment of capital.
Transmission Growth
PJM approval was received for the $600-$650 million Susquehanna to Roseland line in October 2007
Siting and permitting process underway
FERC approved Incentive rate filing:
125 BPS adder to ROE
100% CWIP in Rate Base
FERC approval of the MAPP projects also mandates an additional $100 million of capital at Salem/Hope Creek (2014-2015)
FERC approval of Sub Transmission to Transmission system reliability investments represents about $250 million through 2012, post- 2012 ~$60 million/year
Other approved RTEP projects ~$250 million also contribute meaningfully to improved reliability and earnings growth
Backbone projects are in preliminary stages but present real opportunity to improve reliability throughout the state, with the potential investment of ~ $1.5B through 2015
When coupled with formula rate design
and additional incentives, it is expected to provide current return on forecasted capital expenditures thereby improving profitability.

Due to market uncertainty 
Key drivers behind decision to remain largely unhedged beyond 2008:
Oversold market: Many generators seeking a hedge, limited appetite among hedge providers
Market uncertainty:
Uncertainty relating to move to a nodal pricing market
Recent sudden loss of wind generation in western ERCOT resulting in grid instability
Transmission maintenance: Extensive maintenance of 345kV line near Global's Odessa unit

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
PSEG Global today announced that it has signed an agreement to sell the SAESA Group of Companies (SAESA Group) in southern Chile to a consortium formed by Morgan Stanley Infrastructure and the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan. The SAESA Group consists of major electric distribution and transmission businesses with 639,000 customers in Chile and total of more than 135 MWs of wind, hydro, diesel and gas electric generation capacity.
The transaction has a base equity sale value of approximately $870 million. There will be a price adjustment based on the timing of the closing which is expected to occur in the third quarter of this year. In addition to the equity, the buyers will assume in excess of $400 million of consolidated debt of the SAESA Group. Cash proceeds to PSEG from the transaction are expected to total approximately $600 million after both Chilean and US taxes. The sale is expected to generate an after-tax gain for PSEG of approximately $170 to $180 million during 2008, which will be reported in Discontinued Operations. A tax charge of $82 million was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2007, when the financial results of the SAESA Group were reclassified to Discontinued Operations.
This announcement follows PSEG Global's 2007 sales of its interests in the electric distribution businesses, Chilquinta Energia and Luz del Sur in Chile and Peru, and its ownership interest in the Peruvian hydroelectric generation company, Electroandes. "PSEG has been seeking to decrease international exposure by being open to selling international assets when we can obtain strong valuations," said Tom O'Flynn, CFO of PSEG and president, PSEG Energy Holdings. "These companies have been well run and are well situated. It is no surprise that there was substantial interest in acquiring these assets".
PSEG Global's remaining international assets consist of small investments in electric generation plants in Italy, India and Venezuela.
Credit Suisse acted as exclusive financial advisor to PSEG in connection with the transaction.
