Exhibit 99
 
August 1, 2008
PSEG ANNOUNCES STRONG SECOND QUARTER 2008 RESULTS
$750 MILLION SHARE REPURCHASE AUTHORIZED
Loss from Continuing Operations of $0.32 Per Share
Reflects Charge for Certain Leveraged Leases
Operating Earnings of $0.64 Per Share
Reaffirms 2008 Operating Earnings Guidance of $2.80-$3.05 Per Share
Public Service Enterprise Group (PSEG) reported today (August 1, 2008) a Loss from Continuing Operations for the second quarter of 2008 of $166 million or $0.32 per share as compared to Second Quarter 2007 Income from Continuing Operations of $281 million or $0.55 per share. The second quarter loss was principally the result of a charge of $490 million or $0.96 per share to reflect the Company's current assessment of certain leveraged leases being challenged by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Excluding such lease related charges, Operating Earnings for the second quarter of 2008 were $324 million, or $0.64 per share. Operating Earnings and Income from Continuing Operations were $281 million or $0.55 per share for the second quarter of 2007. Including Income from Discontinued Operations, PSEG reported a Net Loss for the second quarter of 2008 of $150 million or $0.29 per share compared to Net Income for the second quarter of 2007 of $275 million or $0.54 per share.
Ralph Izzo, chairman and chief executive officer of PSEG, said that "our results for the second quarter highlight the importance of our employees' focus on operations, and the equally important need to maintain a strong and stable capital position to meet the demands of today's business conditions."
PSEG CONSOLIDATED EARNINGS (unaudited)
For the Quarters Ended June 30,
2008 and 2007
 
PSEG believes that the non-GAAP financial measure of "Operating Earnings" provides a consistent and comparable measure of performance of its businesses to help shareholders understand performance trends.
Izzo went on to say that "along with maintaining strong operations, we have completed the sale of the last of our large international assets (SAESA), and recognized a charge associated with our leveraged lease investments. These actions impact our discretionary cash position, but improve our business risk profile as demonstrated by Moody's recent decision to maintain our credit ratings and improve our outlook to stable".
Izzo announced that the Company's Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to $750 million of common stock during an 18 month period. "This authorization is recognition of the company's solid financials and strong liquidity position. The repurchase of our shares may represent the best return for shareholders at this time as we seek to maintain our financial flexibility to pursue higher value opportunities as they become available."
Izzo also reaffirmed operating earnings guidance for 2008 of $2.80-$3.05 per share, which represents an 8% improvement (at the mid-point of the range) over 2007's operating earnings. "Strong operations and a largely contracted position continue to support our guidance -- all with a reduced risk profile."
Operating earnings guidance by subsidiary for 2008 remains as follows:
2008 Operating Earnings Guidance
($millions)
 
While there may be some modest movements in the component parts, we expect full year consolidated results to be in these ranges.
Operating Earnings Review and Outlook by Operating Subsidiary
See attachment 6 for detail regarding the quarter-over-quarter earnings reconciliations for each of PSEG's businesses.
PSEG Power
PSEG Power reported operating earnings for the second quarter of 2008 of $240 million ($0.47 per share) compared to operating earnings of $187 million ($0.37 per share) in the second quarter of 2007.
PSEG Power's margins in the second quarter of 2008 benefited from recontracting at higher prices in response to strong market fundamentals. These factors added $0.10 per share to earnings. Power's earnings also benefited from mark-to-market gains on positions entered into earlier in the year to hedge exposure to natural gas ($0.08 per share). The gain is expected to reverse by year-end. A reduction in margin on the BGSS contract reduced earnings by $0.01 per share.

The nuclear fleet continues to run well, operating at a capacity factor of 90.5% during the second quarter and bringing the fleet's year-to-date capacity factor to 92.3%. Salem 2, 57% owned and operated by PSEG Power, completed its refueling and steam generator replacement outage in 58 days returning to service on May 8. This ranked as the second shortest steam generator replacement outage in the history of the U.S. nuclear industry. The unit also saw an increase in nominal operating capacity upon its return to service. Also, we completed the Hope Creek extended power uprate of 125MW. Final performance testing on both of these units will be completed later this year.
Results for the quarter versus last year were impacted by scheduled outage work at several fossil stations  in particular, Hudson  to improve long-term reliability. This work resulted in an increase in operating and maintenance expense amounting to $0.04 per share. Earnings comparisons were also affected by higher depreciation expense ($0.01 per share); higher interest expense associated with an increase in collateral requirements ($0.01 per share) and a market - related decline in the value of some securities held by Power's nuclear decommissioning trust fund ($0.01 per share).
Higher prices for energy and capacity compared to 2007 are expected to continue to support the forecast improvement in Power's 2008 operating earnings. This improvement in pricing will be offset somewhat by higher fuel costs as well as an increase in operating and maintenance expense. The Mercer Station is scheduled to undergo a lengthy outage late in 2008 related to the addition of back-end technology to the units.
PSE&G
PSE&G reported operating earnings of $51 million ($0.10 per share) for the second quarter of 2008 compared with operating earnings of $62 million ($.12 per share) for the second quarter of 2007.
The results for the quarter were affected by a number of factors. A decline in demand for gas reduced earnings by $0.01 per share. A lower peak, due to a cooler summer in 2007, resulted in an expected decline in transmission revenues of $0.01 per share. Operating and maintenance expenses increased 1.8% this quarter, less than the rate of inflation. This increase reduced earnings by $0.01 per share.
These items were partially offset by lower depreciation and other items of $0.01 per share during the quarter.
PSE&G is expected to experience a modest decline in operating earnings for 2008. A forecast decline in transmission revenues due to the lower prior year peak will have an impact on revenue and earnings, as expected. Results will also reflect an increase in financing costs associated with higher capital outlays, and higher operating and maintenance expense associated with training programs supporting PSE&G's delivery projects and construction program.
Earlier this month, PSE&G petitioned the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) for formula rate treatment on its new and existing transmission investments to be effective on October 1, 2008. This petition followed approval by FERC earlier in the year for incentive rate treatment for the Susquehanna to Roseland line.
PSEG Energy Holdings
PSEG Energy Holdings reported operating earnings of $37 million ($0.08 per share) for the second quarter of 2008 versus operating earnings of $47 million ($0.09 per share) during the second quarter of 2007. Operating earnings exclude the lease related charges as well as the financial results of SAESA.

Holdings' operating earnings for the quarter were largely influenced by the performance of Holdings' Global subsidiary. Power prices are up and spark spreads have improved. The Texas generating units  in particular, Guadalupe are benefiting from strong demand and higher prices. Higher volumes and stronger pricing added $0.06 per share to earnings. The increase in forward spark spreads in 2008's second quarter, compared to the decline posted in the year ago period, led to mark-to-market losses in the second quarter which reduced earnings comparisons by $0.05 per share. Global's earnings comparisons were also affected by international asset sales which closed during 2007. The absence of this income in 2008 reduced earnings comparisons by $0.03 per share.
The availability of Bioenergie in 2008 improved earnings comparisons by $0.02 per share in the second quarter. Lower financing costs also added $0.02 per share to earnings. A higher tax rate partially offset these gains reducing Global's earnings comparisons by $0.03 per share.
Holdings' subsidiary, PSEG Resources, reported a $0.01 per share improvement in quarterly earnings comparisons. The improvement was the result of a lower tax rate ($0.02 per share) which offset a decline in lease income ($0.01 per share).
PSEG Global closed on the sale of SAESA on July 24. The sale, which had a final equity value of $887 million plus the assumption of approximately $413 million of debt, resulted in an after-tax gain of $180 million which will be reported in discontinued operations in the third quarter. PSEG Global's after-tax proceeds amount to approximately $600 million.
PSEG Energy Holdings' operating earnings are expected to decline in 2008. The outlook reflects the loss of earnings from the sale of Chilquinta and Luz del Sur in 2007. The power markets in Texas are stronger than what was anticipated earlier in the year. High natural gas prices and demand are leading to higher spark spreads which is more than offsetting the impact of added wind resources in West Texas on the dispatch of natural gas-fired generating assets. Resources' decision to recognize a substantial charge in the second quarter related to the IRS challenge of certain leveraged lease investments, however, will result in a decline of $30 million in Resources' income during the second half of the year from prior expectations.
Leveraged Leases
There are several pending tax cases involving other taxpayers with leverage lease investments that are similar to Resources'. To date, two cases have been decided at the trial court level in favor of the government, and a third case involves a jury decision that is currently being contested. An appeal of one of these decisions was recently affirmed. Based on the status of discussions with the IRS and considering developments in other cases, PSEG currently anticipates that it will pay $300 million to $350 million in taxes, interest and penalties claimed by the IRS for the 1997-2000 audit cycle later in 2008, and subsequently commence litigation to recover a refund. As a result of these decisions, PSEG has re-evaluated its reserve levels and recorded a material charge of $490 million in the second quarter. The charge includes an after-tax increase of $135 million to the company's interest reserve, and an after-tax charge of $355 million related to the recalculation of the return on the leases to take into account new assumptions on the timing of receipt of cash flow. This $355 million charge will be recognized as income over the remaining lives of the leases since total income from the leveraged leases is unaffected by changes in cash flow timing.
Discretionary Cash
PSEG's current forecast reflects $2.5 billion of discretionary cash over 2008-2011 versus our prior forecast of $3.0 billion during this period. The revised figure reflects higher than originally forecast
 
 
4
 
payments of $900-$950 million in lease-related taxes during this time frame. This potential tax payment is consistent with our reserve. Our revised forecast also reflects an increase in funds from asset sales.
Share Repurchase
In July 2008 the Board of Directors of PSEG authorized the repurchase of up to $750 million of PSEG Common Stock during an 18 month period beginning August 1, 2008. The amount and timing of the stock repurchases will be based on various factors such as management's assessment of business and market conditions, PSEG's capital structure and liquidity, and management's assessment of its ability to invest in attractive incremental growth opportunities.

GAAP Disclaimer
PSEG presents Operating Earnings in addition to its Net Income reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). Operating Earnings is a non-GAAP financial measure that differs from Net Income because it excludes the impact of the sale of certain non-core domestic and international assets and material impairments and lease-transaction-related charges. PSEG presents Operating Earnings because management believes that it is appropriate for investors to consider results excluding these items in addition to the results reported in accordance with GAAP. PSEG believes that the non- GAAP financial measure of Operating Earnings provides a consistent and comparable measure of performance of its businesses to help shareholders understand performance trends.  This information is not intended to be viewed as an alternative to GAAP information. The last slide in this presentation includes a list of items excluded from Net Income to reconcile to Operating Earnings
, with a reference to that slide included on each of the slides where the non-GAAP information appears.

Impact of Lease Transaction Reserves
2Q 2008 results include a charge of $490 million:
$135 million after-tax increase to the interest reserve recorded in Income Tax Expense.
$355 million after-tax charge reflecting a change in assumptions relating to the amount paid and timing of cash flow for certain leases in the portfolio.  This charge will be recognized in income over the remaining terms of the affected leases.
Reserves represent our view of most of the book exposure related to the leases under challenge.  In addition, our forecast of cash available includes potential cash outflows of $900 - $950 million over 2  3 years.
Based on status of discussions with IRS, PSEG anticipates that it will pay in 2008, the taxes, interest and penalties claimed by the IRS for 1997-2000 audit cycle ($300 - $350 million) and subsequently commence litigation to recover a refund.

Review of Discretionary Cash/Liquidity
Discretionary Cash / Liquidity
$2.5 billion forecast of discretionary cash for 2008  2011 versus prior forecast of $3.0 billion.
Revised figure reflects a higher than originally forecast payment of $900 - $950 million for taxes on our leveraged lease position over a period of several years, as well as higher proceeds from asset sales.
Major drivers that can influence our forecast of discretionary cash include changes in commodity prices and capital spending.
Collateral postings have declined by $1.3 billion to $800 million since the end of June 2008 with the decline in commodity prices.
