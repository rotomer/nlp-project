GAAP Disclaimer
PSEG presents Operating Earnings in addition to its Net Income reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). Operating Earnings is a non-GAAP financial measure that differs from Net Income because it excludes the impact of the sale of certain non-core domestic and international assets, costs stemming from the terminated merger agreement with Exelon Corporation and material impairments and lease-transaction-related charges. PSEG presents Operating Earnings because management believes that it is appropriate for investors to consider results excluding these items in addition to the results reported in accordance with GAAP. PSEG believes that the non- GAAP financial measure of Operating Earnings provides a consistent and comparable measure of performance of its businesses to help shareholders understand performance trends.  This information is not intended to be viewed as an alternative to GAAP information. The last slide in this presentation includes a list of items excluded from Net Income to reconcile to Operating Earnings
, with a reference to that slide included on each of the slides where the non-GAAP information appears.

Impact of Lease Reserves
2Q 2008 results include a charge of $490 million:
$135 million after-tax increase to the interest reserve recorded in Income Tax Expense.
$355 million after-tax charge reflecting a change in assumptions relating to the amount paid and timing of cash flow for certain leases in the portfolio.  This charge will be recognized in income over the remaining terms of the affected leases.
Reserves represent our view of most of the book exposure related to the leases under challenge.  In addition, our forecast of cash available includes potential cash outflows of $900 - $950 million over 2  3 years.
Based on status of discussions with IRS, PSEG anticipates that it will pay in 2008, the taxes, interest and penalties claimed by the IRS for 1997-2000 audit cycle ($300 - $350 million) and subsequently commence litigation to recover a refund.

Transmission opportunities will require substantial deployment of capital.
Transmission Growth
PJM approval was received for the $600-$650 million Susquehanna to Roseland line in October 2007
Siting and permitting process underway
FERC approved Incentive rate filing:
125 BPS adder to ROE
100% CWIP in Rate Base
FERC approval of the MAPP projects also mandates an additional $100 million of capital at Salem/Hope Creek
FERC approval of Sub Transmission to Transmission system reliability investments represents about $250 million through 2012, post- 2012 ~$60 million/year
Other approved RTEP projects ~$250 million also contribute meaningfully to improved reliability and earnings growth
Backbone projects are in preliminary stages but present real opportunity to improve reliability throughout the state, with the potential investment of ~ $1.5B through 2015
When coupled with formula rate design
and additional incentives, it is expected to provide current return on forecasted capital expenditures thereby improving profitability.

Due to market uncertainty 
Key drivers behind decision to remain largely unhedged beyond 2008:
Oversold market: Many generators seeking a hedge, limited appetite among hedge providers.
Market uncertainty:
Uncertainty relating to move to a nodal pricing market.
Impact of wind generation in western ERCOT.
Transmission maintenance: Extensive maintenance of 345kV line near Global's Odessa unit.
