GAAP Disclaimer
PSEG presents Operating Earnings in addition to its Net Income reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). Operating Earnings is a non-GAAP financial measure that differs from Net Income because it excludes the impact of the sale of certain non-core domestic and international assets and material impairments and lease-transaction-related charges. PSEG presents Operating Earnings because management believes that it is appropriate for investors to consider results excluding these items in addition to the results reported in accordance with GAAP. PSEG believes that the non- GAAP financial measure of Operating Earnings provides a consistent and comparable measure of performance of its businesses to help shareholders understand performance trends.  This information is not intended to be viewed as an alternative to GAAP information. The last slide in this presentation includes a list of items excluded from Net Income to reconcile to Operating Earnings
, with a reference to that slide included on each of the slides where the non-GAAP information appears.

Understanding
recent power market volatility 
PJM market - slight tightening in reserve margins forecast over next 5 years; FERC remains supportive of RPM capacity mechanism.
Financial market volatility has adversely affected liquidity in commodity markets, particularly in out years.
PSEG Power carefully screening credit capability of trading partners.
Energy prices have not responded to changes in price of coal.
Divergence between price of coal and energy not sustainable over long term.
Recent vacating of CAIR has depressed forward energy prices, but a replacement rule has been proposed.

Investments focused on improving customer support, enhancing efficiency and upgrading infrastructure.
Expect to file electric and gas rate case in 2009 with rates effective in mid-2010.
Future investment associated with meeting State energy efficiency and renewable goals dependent on receiving regulatory support before committing new capital.
BPU approved $105M investment in solar in April 2008 earning WACC with contemporaneous recovery.  Approval of $46M Carbon Abatement program expected.
Rate base growth supported by investment in new 500kV lines and upgrade of sub-transmission system to improve reliability.

The New Jersey Energy Master Plan released on October 22, 2008 
2020 Goals:
20% reduction in peak demand
20% reduction in energy consumption
30% of energy requirements supplied by renewables.
EMP, to help achieve its goals, calls for:
Redesign and transition of the State's current energy efficiency programs
Expanded utility company participation in demand response programs,  procurement of demand-side resources through BGS Process and direct load control and the piloting of different technologies (including AMI) and rate structures to determine the best way to achieve peak demand reductions
Energy Institute of NJ that will focus on energy technology developments
Development of 1500 MW of new cogeneration capacity in New Jersey by 2020
new commissions/committees that include an advisory stakeholder group (a possible sub-group to examine nuclear issues), an Offshore Wind Planning Group  and the Energy Institute of New Jersey
Governor Corzine also announced immediate action on an energy efficiency investment program for 2009 designed to increase job growth and stimulate the State's economy.
... provides blueprint for State's energy future and potential opportunities for PSE&G to invest for growth.

Stronger 2008 forecast from favorable market in Spring 2008
Looking forward to 2009:
Uncertainty on gross margin impact from new wind additions
Operations and maintenance approximately $20M higher in 2009 than 2007
Uncertainty due to implementation of nodal market
Mark-to-Market: earnings in 2009  2010 will be affected by the reversal of prior mark-to-market gains
Longer-term:  
Continued uncertainty from wind
Positive impact from transmission build-up

Impact of Lease Reserves
2008 results include a charge of $490 million:
$135 million after-tax increase to the interest reserve recorded in Income Tax Expense during 2Q 2008.
$355 million after-tax charge reflecting a change in assumptions relating to the amount paid and timing of cash flow for certain leases in the portfolio.  This charge will be recognized in income over the remaining terms of the affected leases.
Reserves represent our view of most of the book exposure related to the leases under challenge.
In addition, our forecast of cash available includes potential cash outflows of $900 - $950 million over 2  3 years.
Based on status of discussions with IRS, PSEG has made an $80M deposit in 2008 (in addition to $100 million deposited in 2007) to defray potential interest costs associated with this disputed tax liability.
PSEG anticipates paying between $230 - $360 million in tax, interest and penalties for tax years 1997 -2000 in first half 2009, with a possible additional $270 - $550 million in late 2009.
