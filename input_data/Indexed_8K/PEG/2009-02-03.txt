(February 3, 2009)  Public Service Enterprise Group (PSEG) reported Income from Continuing Operations for 2008 of $983 million or $1.93 per share as compared to $1,325 million or $2.60 per share for 2007. Operating Earnings for 2008 were $1,487 million or $2.92 per share compared to 2007 Operating Earnings of $1,385 million or $2.72 per share. Including Lease Transaction reserves and other asset impairment charges ($0.99 per share) and income from discontinued operations ($0.41 per share), PSEG reported Net Income for 2008 of $1,188 million or $2.34 per share compared to Net Income for 2007 of $1,335 million or $2.62 per share.
PSEG also reported Income from Continuing Operations for the fourth quarter of 2008 of $237 million, or $0.46 per share. This compares to fourth quarter 2007 results of $219 million, or $0.42 per share. Operating Earnings for the fourth quarter of 2008 were $250 million, or $0.49 per share compared to fourth quarter 2007 Operating Earnings of $272 million, or $0.53 per share. Net Income in the fourth quarter of 2008 amounted to $234 million, or $0.46 per share, compared to Net Income for the fourth quarter of 2007 of $225 million, or $0.43 per share.
PSEG believes that the non-GAAP financial measure of "Operating Earnings" provides a consistent and comparable measure of performance of its businesses to help shareholders understand performance trends. Operating Earnings exclude the impact of lease-related charges and the impact of the sale and/or impairment of certain non-core domestic and international assets. The table below provides a reconciliation of PSEG's Net Income to Operating Earnings (a non-GAAP measure) for the full year and fourth quarter. See Attachment 14 for a complete list of items excluded from Income from Continuing Operations in the determination of Operating Earnings.
"PSEG performed well in a difficult environment" said Ralph Izzo, chairman, president and chief executive officer of PSEG. "Clearly, the sale of international assets improved our liquidity and strengthened our balance sheet during a period of unprecedented financial market turbulence. Just as importantly, the commitment of our employees to operational excellence supported PSEG Power's record output from its generation fleet, and helped PSE&G advance the state's energy policy goals."
Izzo indicated that PSEG was refining its operating earnings guidance for 2009 to $3.00-$3.25 per share in accordance with statement made in the Fall. "We indicated to the financial community in our third quarter earnings release that we were expecting earnings for 2009 to come in at the lower half of our previously stated range of $3.05-$3.35 per share. This remains our expectation. The outlook for the economy remains weak; but, with the commitment of management and the support of PSEG's employees to control costs, we expect to be able to manage through these difficult times and meet the earnings objectives we established."
Izzo said "PSEG is committed to meeting the expectations of its customers and its shareholders. In the near-term, this commitment will be met through cost vigilance to mitigate the effects of a slowing economy. In the long run, growth will be aided by collaborative efforts with government, labor and other key partners supporting the investment of capital to advance a common goal of a sustainable strong economy." He mentioned that "the capital spending program recently proposed by PSE&G is designed to jump start the economy through the creation of jobs. It is this type of effort that assures our stakeholders of PSEG's dedication to providing safe, reliable, economic and green energy."
Operating Earnings by subsidiary for 2008, and our guidance for 2009 is as follows:
Operating Earnings Review and Outlook by Operating Subsidiary
See Attachments 6 and 7 for detail regarding the quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year earnings reconciliations for each of PSEG's businesses.
PSEG Power
PSEG Power reported operating earnings of $207 million ($0.40 per share) for the fourth quarter of 2008 bringing full year operating earnings to $1,050 million ($2.06 per share), a record year for Power. On a comparative basis, PSEG Power reported operating earnings of $205 million ($0.40 per share) and $949 million ($1.86 per share) for the fourth quarter and full year 2007 respectively.
PSEG Power's margins in the fourth quarter of 2008 continued to benefit from higher contracted pricing. Higher prices improved earnings comparisons by $0.07 per share during the quarter. The results for the quarter were also aided by the performance of the nuclear fleet. The nuclear fleet (including PSEG Power's interest in the Peach Bottom station) operated at a capacity factor of 91.3% in the fourth quarter compared to a capacity factor of 83.6% in the 2007 fourth quarter. Performance in the quarter was aided by the timing of year-over-year refueling outages. Power's fully-owned Hope Creek nuclear facility operated in excess of a 100% capacity factor during the 2008 fourth quarter (and full year) compared to a 57.3% capacity factor during the year ago quarter when Hope Creek experienced a 33-day refueling outage.
Power's earnings comparisons in the fourth quarter of 2008 were aided by a decline in operating and maintenance expense ($0.03 per share). The benefits of higher prices and lower costs offset a decline in the value of Power's nuclear decommissioning trust fund in the quarter ($0.10 per share) due to the turbulent financial markets.
William Levis, president and chief operating officer of PSEG Power, said "2008 was a record year for PSEG Power in terms of generation output and profitability. An alignment of interest in safety, reliability and performance yielded our record results, and should support continued improvement in a very challenging environment."
PSEG Power's operating earnings forecast for 2009 reflects the expected full year benefit of the extended power uprates at Hope Creek and Salem (173 Mw) as well as higher contracted load pricing. The competitive energy market has allowed Power to hedge most of its base-load coal and nuclear capacity going into 2009. Capacity has been hedged through PJM's RPM auction process. A forecasted improvement in year-over-year hedged power pricing is expected to offset the impact of
higher fuel costs under a renegotiated coal contract. The renegotiated agreement provides us with pricing more reflective of market levels in return for greater supply flexibility.
PSE&G
PSE&G reported operating earnings of $76 million ($0.15 per share) for the fourth quarter compared with operating earnings of $77 million ($0.15 per share) for the fourth quarter of 2007. The results for the fourth quarter brought PSE&G's operating earnings for 2008 to $360 million ($0.71 per share) as compared with 2007 results of $376 million ($0.74 per share).
Colder than normal weather conditions supported gas sales in the fourth quarter ($0.01 per share) and more than offset the impact of the economy on demand. This improvement also offset the impact of a decline in electric sales. During the quarter, electric sales for our two primary market segments (residential and commercial) declined 3.8% resulting in a 1.3% decline in sales to these segments for the year. Sales to industrial electric customers declined 18.3% in the fourth quarter resulting in an 8.6% decline for the year. This segment represents 12% of sales and contributes a smaller percentage to electric margin. Earnings comparisons benefited from PSE&G's ability to tailor its workload to match changes in operating conditions resulting in a decline in operating expenses ($0.04 per share). The decline offset an increase in taxes and depreciation expense.
Ralph LaRossa, president and chief operating officer of PSE&G, said "our employees can point to 2008 as a year of significant accomplishment. Their achievements in advancing regulatory and operational initiatives will support customer reliability and advance the goals of the state's energy master plan."
PSE&G expects to experience a decline in operating earnings in 2009. The forecast assumes a slight increase in electric sales for the year. However, an increase in pension expense as well as expenses associated with the start-up of the company's new customer information system (iPower) are expected to put pressure on PSE&G's full year return. PSE&G is planning to file a combined electric and gas rate case by mid-year that will take into consideration higher levels of operating costs, pension expense and capital investment.
PSEG Energy Holdings
PSEG Energy Holdings reported an operating loss for the fourth quarter of 2008 of $23 million ($0.04 per share) compared to operating earnings of $10 million ($0.02 per share) for the fourth quarter of 2007. The results for the fourth quarter brought Energy Holdings' full year 2008 operating earnings to $101 million ($0.20 per share) as compared with 2007's operating earnings of $123 million ($0.24 per share).
Earnings for the fourth quarter of 2008 as compared to the same period in the prior year were affected by mark-to-market losses ($0.05 per share) and higher operating and maintenance expenses associated with the Texas generating assets ($0.02 per share). Earnings comparisons were also affected by the absence of earnings from international assets sold late in 2007 ($0.03 per share) as well as a decline in the return on the leveraged lease portfolio ($0.02 per share). These items more than offset lower financing costs.
PSEG Energy Holdings expects to operate at close to break-even in 2009. Results will be influenced by a full year decline in income on the leveraged lease portfolio. The subsidiary's 2000 Mw of gas-fired Texas generating assets are also expected to be negatively affected by a forecast decline in natural gas prices (versus very high prices in the first half of 2008) as well as a decline in availability
and an increase in operating and maintenance expense.
Pension Expense
PSEG estimates pension expense in 2009 will increase $0.15 per share over 2008's expense (this estimated increase reflects the amount capitalized at PSE&G) due to a decline in market value of our pension assets. This year-over-year increase in pension expense also widened from our third quarter update due to a decline in financing costs used to establish the plan's discount rate.
Common Dividend Date
The dates for the Board of Directors to declare the common dividend in 2009 have been adjusted to reflect a change in the meeting schedule. The next regularly scheduled meeting for the Board of Directors is now scheduled for February 17, 2009. The dividend declared on that date will be payable on or before March 31, 2009 to shareholders of record as of the March 10, 2009 record date.

GAAP Disclaimer
PSEG presents Operating Earnings in addition to its Net Income reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). Operating Earnings is a non-GAAP financial measure that differs from Net Income because it excludes the impact of the sale of certain non-core domestic and international assets and material impairments and lease-transaction-related charges. PSEG presents Operating Earnings because management believes that it is appropriate for investors to consider results excluding these items in addition to the results reported in accordance with GAAP. PSEG believes that the non-GAAP financial measure of Operating Earnings provides a consistent and comparable measure of performance of its businesses to help shareholders understand performance trends.  This information is not intended to be viewed as an alternative to GAAP information. The last slide in this presentation includes a list of items excluded from Income from Continuing Operations to reconcile to Operating Earnings
, with a reference to that slide included on each of the slides where the non-GAAP information appears.
