GAAP Disclaimer
PSEG presents Operating Earnings in addition to its Net Income reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). Operating Earnings is a non-GAAP financial measure that differs from Net Income because it excludes the impact of the sale of certain non-core domestic and international assets and material impairments and lease-transaction-related charges. PSEG presents Operating Earnings because management believes that it is appropriate for investors to consider results excluding these items in addition to the results reported in accordance with GAAP. PSEG believes that the non- GAAP financial measure of Operating Earnings provides a consistent and comparable measure of performance of its businesses to help shareholders understand performance trends.  This information is not intended to be viewed as an alternative to GAAP information. The last slide in this presentation includes a list of items excluded from Net Income to reconcile to Operating Earnings
, with a reference to that slide included on each of the slides where the non-GAAP information appears.

Transmission Growth
PJM approved the $750M Susquehanna to Roseland line in October 2007
Siting and permitting process underway
Incentives approved by FERC:
ROE: 12.93% (125 basis point adder)
100% CWIP in Rate Base
FERC approval of Sub-Transmission to Transmission system reliability investments represents about $340M through 2011, post-2011 ~$60M per year
Other approved RTEP projects ~$250M also contribute meaningfully to improved reliability and earnings growth
PJM approved the Branchburg-Roseland-Hudson line in November 2008.  Additional 500 kV investments brings potential capital expenditures to approximately $1.0 -1.5B
These opportunities will require substantial deployment of capital with siting and permitting as the major challenges.

Texas assets are the major driver of PSEG Global's business results.
PSEG Texas projected EBITDA reflects higher maintenance costs and market uncertainty.
Strong 2008 performance from favorable market in Spring 2008
Looking ahead to 2009:
Uncertainty on gross margin impact from new wind additions
Operations and maintenance costs approximately $20M higher in 2009 than 2007 as plants enter periods of major maintenance
Longer-term:  
Continued uncertainty from wind
Positive impact from transmission build-up and potential unit mothballing by other generators

GWF Energy (CA)  363 MW (60% Ownership)
GWF & Hanford (CA)  132 MW (50% Ownership)

Bridgewater (NH)  16 MW (40% Ownership)
Conemaugh (PA)  15 MW (4% Ownership)
Renewables
:
Compressed Air Energy Storage (Energy Storage & Power joint venture):
Technology can be used to optimize an intermittent renewable energy source, such as wind, by storing energy at night and releasing this stored energy during the day when customers need power
Offshore Wind:
In October 2008, the New Jersey Office of Clean Energy (OCE) awarded a $4M grant to a PSEG Global joint venture in order to advance the development of a      350 MW wind farm approximately 16 miles off the shore of southern New Jersey
Solar:
Ongoing additional opportunity evaluation and investment
 while enhancing the performance of domestic assets and identifying opportunities for renewable growth.
Net other domestic owned capacity: 395 MW; Book value: $162M

Resources is focused on managing its current investment portfolio.
Net Investment in lease portfolio of $0.3B
Book investment of $2.3B less deferred taxes of $2.0B
Assuming 100% litigation loss, the lease portfolio would generate $2.1B of after-tax cash over the remaining life of the portfolio
Net present value of after tax cash flow using 8% discount rate would be approximately $800M

Resources continues to monitor its tax risks 
June 2008 results included after tax charges of $490M:
$135M interest reserve
$355M reduced return due to cash flow timing
This charge will be reversed into income over the remaining terms of the affected leases
Charge represents reserve against approximately 85% of potential estimated liability
As of 12/31/08, $180M deposited with IRS
The forecast of cash available assumes interest payments to IRS to limit growth in liability
PSEG anticipates paying between $500 - $920M for the tax years 1997 - 2003 to the IRS.
PSEG will then file for refund and commence litigation to recover these amounts
 and maintains a flexible plan to handle the uncertainty.

Coal Emissions Output
Aggregate emissions will decline nearly 66% after installation of the pollution control equipment
The installation will allow for fuel flexibility in future years

PJM forecasts New Jersey to maintain a higher demand growth rate than the EMAAC region and  the overall PJM region off a lower 2008 base
The ultimate demand will be driven by the economy, but Power's assets are well located to manage through difficult times
Electricity demand is anticipated to show moderate declines
PJM's January 2009 load forecast reflects a 0.6% drop in demand from '08 to '09
The growth rate forecast is more bearish than last year's forecast for '09 and '10, but higher starting in '11, with absolute load levels nearly recovered by 13
Electric load growth is affected by the economy

Rate Mechanism
                   
PSE&G proposes to recover the costs of the program through an annual adjustment to electric and gas rates which would not exceed 1%.
The cost of capital would be based on a capital structure consisting of 51.2% common equity with a return on common equity of 10.3%--consistent with the return allowed NJNG in its December 2008 base rate case decision.
The Energy Efficiency Program revenue requirements would include the recovery of lost distribution margin.

Exhibit 99.1
Ralph Izzo, chairman, president and chief executive officer of PSEG, spoke at a conference in New York hosted by the company for the financial community.
Izzo, and members of his senior management team, described a company in solid financial condition, a commitment to operational excellence, and a strong balance sheet with a greatly reduced risk profile positioned for organic growth opportunities -- especially utility related capital projects at a fair return. Izzo said that PSEGs financial strength and low dividend payout ratio (41%-44%) also provides the opportunity for growth.
PSEG recently declared a 3.1% increase in its quarterly common dividend rate to a current annual rate of $1.33 per share which is payable to shareholders on or before March 31, 2009. A copy of the presentation can be accessed at www.pseg.com/investor.
