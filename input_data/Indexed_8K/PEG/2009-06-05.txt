Transmission Growth
PJM approved the $750M Susquehanna to Roseland line in October 2007
Siting and permitting process underway
Incentives approved by FERC:
ROE: 12.93% (125 basis point adder)
100% CWIP in Rate Base
FERC approval of Sub-Transmission to Transmission system reliability investments represents about $340M through 2011, post-2011 ~$60M per year
Other approved RTEP projects ~$250M
PJM approved the Branchburg-Roseland-Hudson line in November 2008, which is expected to be in- service by 2013.  Coupled with additional 500 kV investments brings potential capital expenditures to approximately $1.5B
These opportunities will require substantial deployment of capital with siting and permitting as the major challenges.

Formula rates provides the proper incentives to encourage Transmission infrastructure investment.
       11
Delivering Value: Today and Tomorrow
State regulatory mechanisms must match desired capital investment outcomes.
Timely recovery of capital investment is of paramount importance.
Distribution Formula Rates presents a comprehensive solution to both investment and sales attrition.  
Annual projections for all components of rates including sales
True ups can handle weather variances, lost sales from economic downturn or conservation and differences in spending versus planned commitments
Regardless of the solution, the regulatory treatment needs to be fair and balanced.  
The New Jersey Capital Stimulus Investment is an excellent example of what can be achieved through collaboration with the regulators.
       12
Delivering Value: Today and Tomorrow
Rate Mechanism for EE Stimulus
       
PSE&G proposes to recover the costs of the program through an annual adjustment to electric and gas rates which would not exceed 1%.
The cost of capital would be based on a capital structure consisting of 51.2% common equity with a return on common equity of 10.3%--consistent with the return allowed NJNG in its December 2008 base rate case decision.
The Energy Efficiency Program revenue requirements would include the recovery of lost distribution margin.
Decoupling and Straight-Fixed-Variable rate design are meaningful alternatives
Maximizing energy savings without lost margin recovery perpetuates the utility disincentive.
       13
Delivering Value: Today and Tomorrow
We proposed an energy efficiency investment to stimulate the economy and create meaningful savings.

PSE&G Solar 4 All Proposal
Neighborhood Solar (40 megawatts) - $264M investment
Solar panels on utility poles and street lights in neighborhoods throughout PSE&G's service territory.
Local Government Solar (43 megawatts) - $273M investment
Solar, owned and operated by PSE&G, on municipal and public school district facilities. Local governments will receive a credit on their utility bill equal to the amount of energy generated by the system.
Centralized Solar (35 megawatts)  $221M investment
Solar systems on PSE&G land/buildings.
Solar energy farms on brownfields, non-profit-owned real estate, and underdeveloped real estate
HMFA/Affordable Housing Solar (2 megawatts) - $15M investment

Lower panel costs through acquisition for utility programs
Create meaningful and tangible progress towards aggressive EMP goals
Create a viable SREC market
PPA's are dilutive to our shareholders
Imputed debt by rating agencies require corrective action, i.e., increase equity content in capital structure to offset additional leverage
