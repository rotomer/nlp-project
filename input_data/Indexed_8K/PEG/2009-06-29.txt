GAAP Disclaimer
PSEG presents Operating Earnings in addition to its Net Income reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). Operating Earnings is a non-GAAP financial measure that differs from Net Income because it excludes the impact of the sale of certain non-core domestic and international assets and material impairments and lease-transaction-related charges. PSEG presents Operating Earnings because management believes that it is appropriate for investors to consider results excluding these items in addition to the results reported in accordance with GAAP. PSEG believes that the non- GAAP financial measure of Operating Earnings provides a consistent and comparable measure of performance of its businesses to help shareholders understand performance trends.  This information is not intended to be viewed as an alternative to GAAP information. The last slide in this presentation includes a list of items excluded from Net Income to reconcile to Operating Earnings
, with a reference to that slide included on each of the slides where the non-GAAP information appears.

As national carbon regulation looks increasingly likely
 Power should benefit based on its low carbon fleet.
The diversity of the portfolio makes Power well positioned to capture value in a wide range of potential regulatory outcomes.

FERC approval of Sub-Transmission to Transmission system reliability investments represents about $340M through 2011, post-2011 ~$60M per year
Other approved RTEP projects ~$250M also contribute meaningfully to improved reliability and earnings growth
PJM approved the Branchburg-Roseland-Hudson line in November 2008.  Additional 500 kV investments brings potential capital expenditures to approximately $1.0 -1.5B
These opportunities will require substantial deployment of capital with siting and permitting as the major challenges.

PSE&G proposes to recover the costs of the program through an annual adjustment to electric and gas rates which would not exceed 1%.
The cost of capital would be based on a capital structure consisting of 51.2% common equity with a return on common equity of 10.3%--consistent with the return allowed NJNG in its December 2008 base rate case decision.
The Energy Efficiency Program revenue requirements would include the recovery of lost distribution margin.
