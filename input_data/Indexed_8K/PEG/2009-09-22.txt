GAAP Disclaimer
PSEG presents Operating Earnings in addition to its Net Income reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). Operating Earnings is a non-GAAP financial measure that differs from Net Income because it excludes the impact of the sale of certain non-core domestic and international assets and material impairments and lease-transaction-related charges. PSEG presents Operating Earnings because management believes that it is appropriate for investors to consider results excluding these items in addition to the results reported in accordance with GAAP. PSEG believes that the non- GAAP financial measure of Operating Earnings provides a consistent and comparable measure of performance of its businesses to help shareholders understand performance trends.  This information is not intended to be viewed as an alternative to GAAP information. The last slide in this presentation includes a list of items excluded from Net Income to reconcile to Operating Earnings
, with a reference to that slide included on each of the slides where the non-GAAP information appears.

Incentives approved by FERC:
ROE: 12.93% (125 basis point adder)
100% CWIP in Rate Base
FERC approval of Sub-Transmission to Transmission system reliability investments represents about $340M through 2011, post-2011 ~$60M per year
Total investment in PJM approved projects, including Susquehanna to Roseland of $1.4B over 2009-2011
PJM approved the Branchburg-Roseland-Hudson line in November 2008.  Additional 500 kV investments could further increase transmission investment by approximately $1.0 -1.5B.
These opportunities will require substantial deployment of capital with siting and permitting as the major challenges.

emissions at recent levels through 2015 (~188 million tons per year)
Achieve a 10% reduction of CO

emissions below recent levels by 2019
This translates into ~13% reduction below 1990 levels or ~35% reduction from Business as Usual (BAU) levels by 2020

Rate Mechanism
                   
PSE&G proposes to recover the costs of the program through an annual adjustment to electric and gas rates which would not exceed 1%.
The cost of capital would be based on a capital structure consisting of 51.2% common equity with a return on common equity of 11.5% -- consistent with the return allowed NJNG in its December 2008 base rate case decision.

BPU approved a 10% ROE on its equity capital invested (47.4% common equity in its capital structure). Return and capital structure will change when a new WACC is established in a base rate case proceeding.  Customer rate impact mitigated by benefits associated with ITC and the value of electricity and Solar Renewable Energy Certificates (SRECs) generated by the projects
