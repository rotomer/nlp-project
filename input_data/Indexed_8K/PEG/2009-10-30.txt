GAAP Disclaimer
PSEG presents Operating Earnings in addition to its Net Income reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). Operating Earnings is a non-GAAP financial measure that differs from Net Income because it excludes the impact of the sale of certain non-core domestic and international assets and material impairments and lease-transaction-related charges. PSEG presents Operating Earnings because management believes that it is appropriate for investors to consider results excluding these items in addition to the results reported in accordance with GAAP. PSEG believes that the non- GAAP financial measure of Operating Earnings provides a consistent and comparable measure of performance of its businesses to help shareholders understand performance trends.  This information is not intended to be viewed as an alternative to GAAP information. The last two slides in this presentation include a list of items excluded from Net Income to reconcile to Operating Earnings
, with a reference to that slide included on each of the slides where the non-GAAP information appears.

In 2009, PJM total gross margin was sustained by lower costs to serve, including strong performance of our nuclear fleet, which offset lower overall demand

Power's hedging strategy secures pricing for near term output
Sell expected nuclear and coal output forward over a two to three year horizon
Contract fuel to balance position
Buy gas as we sell output
Utilize liquid markets to manage risk
BGS annual recontracting opportunity; 3-year term mitigates volatility and monetizes basis
Source contractual needs from market on opportunistic basis
BGS at maximum tranches is approximately 40-50% of Power's coal and nuclear output
Participation in the full requirements auctions supports margin opportunity commensurate with market risk
Extension of developed skill set supports participation in adjoining geographies within PJM
 which mitigates the impact of market movements on earnings.

FERC approval of Sub-Transmission to Transmission system reliability investments represents about $340M through 2011, post-2011 ~$60M per year
Other approved RTEP projects ~$250M also contribute meaningfully to improved reliability and earnings growth
