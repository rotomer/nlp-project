Other Events:
On December 16, the NJ Board of Public Utilities (BPU) approved the settlement that resolves all remaining issues in PSE&G's base rate case. In July 2010, as part of PSE&G's base rate proceeding, the BPU ordered a supplemental and expedited review of certain issues related to the gas transportation rate that PSE&G charged to its affiliate, PSEG Power and other electric generating customers in PSE&G's service territory including 1) whether the current rate charged to Power should be changed prospectively, 2) whether any retroactive relief is warranted with respect to these charges since 2002, 3) whether the Societal Benefits Charge (SBC) and other charges are applicable, and 4) whether the transportation service gas non-firm rate should apply to Power and other electric generation customers in PSE&G's service territories. A comprehensive settlement was reached and signed by all parties which provides 1) that there will be no retroactive adjustments or refunds made by PSE&G with respect to the gas delivery charges; 2) the natural gas delivery rate charged by PSE&G to Power may not be altered for any reason until after the on-going BPU generic proceeding to establish rules governing discounting of agreements, and a subsequent filing implementing any such rule to the transportation rate charged to Power's electric generating facilities provided however, that if the generic proceeding is not completed within 24 months, PSE&G may file with the BPU to seek a change in rates for gas transportation service to PSEG Power and 3) for PSE&G to prospectively charge a rate comparable to what it charges PSEG Power to certain competitive generating facilities owned by members of the Electric Customer Group for a period of 3 years. The settlement further provides for a release of all claims in the companion complaint filed at FERC.
As of November 30, PSEG Power has increased the amount of generation hedged in 2011 to 79% at an average price of $66 per MWh from 68% hedged, at an average price of $71 per MWh, as disclosed for the quarter ended September 30, 2010. The increase in percentage of generation hedged reflects normal hedging activity and expected nuclear and coal generation. The percentage of hedged volume also reflects an assumption on customer migration which represents a slightly increased level relative to that which was discussed at the time of reporting our third quarter financial results.
