Item 5.07 Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders
Our Annual Meeting of Stockholders was held on April 19, 2011. Proxies for the meeting were solicited by us pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities Act of 1934. There was no solicitation of proxies in opposition to management's nominees as listed in the proxy statement.
All of management's nominees were elected to the Board of Directors.
The advisory vote on executive compensation was approved.
The stockholders have recommended that an advisory vote on executive compensation be held every year. Based on that result and consistent with its own recommendation, the Board of Directors has determined that our stockholders will be presented with the opportunity to cast an advisory vote on executive compensation at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held in each year beginning in 2012 and continuing through the earlier of 2016 or the next Annual Meeting at which an advisory vote on the frequency of the advisory vote on executive compensation is presented to stockholders.
The appointment of Deloitte and Touche LLP as Independent Auditor was approved.
Final results of the voting are provided below:
