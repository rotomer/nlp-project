PURCHASE, NY (Oct. 8, 2002)
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Steve Reinemund said: "Our portfolio of businesses complemented each other and performed very well overall. We're pleased to report very strong operating profit and earnings per share growth. Our margins expanded as a result of synergies from our merger with Quaker, as well as strong productivity across our divisions. We increased our market share across our key U.S. businesses, and our cash flow was extremely healthy."
Reinemund continued: "Volume growth was strong across the portfolio, even as we rolled back the incremental promotional activity at Frito-Lay North America. In fact, promotional activity at Frito-Lay was normalized by Labor Day, as planned. Our businesses are fundamentally very healthy, and we are confident that we will achieve the higher end of our 13-14% earnings per share growth target for this year."

On a currency neutral basis, net revenues grew over 4% and faster than volume, both for the quarter and year to date.
Total line of business operating profits in the third quarter grew 11% to $1.5 billion, driven by strong Quaker merger synergies and productivity across the divisions. Year to date, line of business operating profits also grew 11%, to $3.9 billion. As a result, year to date, line of business operating margins have expanded over 150 basis points.

Frito-Lay North America pound volume increased 4% in the third quarter and 5% year to date. FLNA's net revenues grew 3% for the quarter and 4% year to date, reflecting the strong volume growth, but also the impact of the increased promotional allowances that were in place during a substantial portion of the quarter.
The incremental promotional overlay initiated in the second quarter was completely rolled back by Labor Day weekend. In fact, by the end of the quarter, FLNA's volume and revenue growth rates in the U.S. were virtually equal.
FLNA's operating profit growth of over 6% for the third quarter was the result of strong volume growth and productivity, but also reflects the impact of increased promotional allowances. However, year to date FLNA's operating profits have grown 8%.
In the most recently reported period, FLNA's share of salty snacks in measured channels grew by 1.9 points - its 19th straight quarter maintaining or gaining share.
FLNA's market share improvement and volume growth came primarily from new product introductions, single-digit growth in Doritos, and strong growth in Munchies Snack Mix, Cheetos and Rold Gold pretzels. The innovation including Quaker snacks such as new Quaker Bites (bite-sized Fruit and Oatmeal bars), and Go Snacks (bite-sized snacks in canisters), performed as planned and contributed significantly to the new product growth. The volume gains were partially offset by a decline in Ruffles potato chips.
For the fourth quarter, FLNA has a strong innovation pipeline, with news in:
Core products, including two new Taste of America flavors for Lay's (Wisconsin Cheddar and San Antonio Salsa), new Hearty Chili Cheese Ruffles, Tostitos Gold (a heartier chip designed to support a variety of dipping occasions), and Twisted Cheetos;
Convenient fuel, including new Tostitos Salsa Party Bowls (for more convenient dipping), two new Go Snack flavors (Tostitos Hint of Lime and Ruffles 3D's) and new Chocolate flavors of Quaker Chewy Dipps, and
Sensible Snacks, with Reduced Fat Lay's and a new flavor of Baked Doritos (Cooler Ranch) being introduced later this year.
FLNA's marketing calendar for the fourth quarter is also strong and features:
New advertising for Doritos, featuring the pop star Enrique Iglesias;
Solid promotional activity, including three Power of One promotions with Pepsi centered around NFL Football, Halloween and the Holiday season; and
Continuing re-sets of the salty snack aisle to highlight our Sensible Snack portfolio.

FLI kilo volume grew 5% in the third quarter, led by Sabritas and Gamesa in Mexico, and Walkers in the UK. This volume growth was particularly impressive as FLI faced a difficult macroeconomic environment in Latin America, especially in Argentina and Brazil, and a boycott of U.S. brands in the Middle East. Volume also grew 5% year-to-date.
FLI net revenues grew 3% for the quarter and year to date. On a currency neutral basis, net revenues grew 6% for the third quarter and year to date.
FLI's strong operating profit growth was primarily driven by the volume growth at Sabritas, Gamesa and Walkers, where successful new products included Sabritas Bistro, Gamesa Choki Colosal and Emperador Black and White and Walkers Sensations, as well as productivity.
FLI has a solid marketing calendar planned for the fourth quarter of 2002, and will continue to benefit from news such as:
In Mexico, Sabritas plans to launch new Bistro and Doritos flavors and to introduce Fritos Scoops, while Gamesa plans Mamut soft cookies and Choco-Shok;
In the U.K., Walkers will introduce a new Great British Flavor, Turkey and Paxo Stuffing, while promotions include Monster Munch Mystery Tongue and a "Friend-Chips" in-bag coupon promotion supporting Doritos Dippas;
In Europe, FLI will continue to expand Lay's Mediterraneas, a highly successful new portfolio of high-quality potato chips with specially designed local flavors, and Doritos Dippas; and
Across Latin America, in-bag promotions featuring cash, Tazo spinners and very popular comic characters like Spider-Man.
North American Beverages
In June, PepsiCo announced the consolidation of all North American beverage businesses under one management team, led by Gary Rodkin, former President of PCNA. Putting these powerful brand families in a single organization allows PepsiCo to leverage their combined strength more effectively.
To reflect this new organization and to facilitate comparison of our total North American beverage volume growth to that of our principal competitor, commencing in the first quarter of next year, PepsiCo will report the financial results of its North American Beverage operations as a single segment  PepsiCo Beverages North America (PBNA).
In the third fiscal quarter, volume for PBNA grew 5%. Gatorade's volume grew a very strong 16% and PCNA's bottler case sales were up a strong 4%, while Tropicana's volume was flat. Year to date, PBNA volume growth was 4%.
In addition, our key North American beverage businesses all gained share in measured channels for the most recently measured quarter, which ended September 7, and on a year to date basis, as set out below:
*Reflects the share, as measured by IRI in the large format channel (FDMx) for PepsiCo brands in the carbonated soft drink category, Aquafina in the non-jug, non-flavored still water category, Gatorade in the isotonic category and Tropicana brands in the chilled juice category.

For the third quarter, bottler case sales (BCS) increased 4%, while concentrate shipments and equivalents (CSE) increased over 2%. The BCS growth reflects a favorable shift in the timing of the Labor Day weekend. The difference in BCS and CSE growth reflects their different measurement periods, with BCS measured for June, July and August and CSE measured for the Company's fiscal third quarter. Year-to-date both BCS and CSE grew 3%.
For the quarter, PCNA's core carbonated soft-drink (CSD) trademarks showed solid growth. Trademark Pepsi benefited from the continued success of Pepsi Twist and the successful introduction of Pepsi Blue, a berry cola fusion in single-serve size aimed at teenagers and young adults, as well as from continued growth of Diet Pepsi. Trademark Mountain Dew BCS was also higher than prior year, reflecting continued gains in Code Red and the roll out of Diet Code Red, while Sierra Mist grew 11%. Aquafina water continued to have strong double-digit growth, and was the key driver of the 18% growth in PCNA's total non-carbonated portfolio.
In the fourth quarter, PCNA expects to continue to benefit from recently launched innovation, including Pepsi Blue, which will become available in take-home sized packages in the fall, as well as Diet Code Red and Brisk Lemonade. PCNA's promotional calendar for the fourth quarter includes: a Mountain Dew tie-in with "The Simpsons" and Power of One tie-ins with NFL Football, a "Great Pumpkin Party" at Halloween and a Holiday promotion linked to two new Disney films  "Santa Clause 2" and the animated "Treasure Planet".

Total volume for Gatorade/Tropicana North America for the third quarter of 2002 increased 10%, driven by strong 16% volume growth for Gatorade. Tropicana's volume was essentially flat. On a year-to-date basis, total volume grew 7%, reflecting 15% volume growth in the Gatorade portfolio, partially offset by a 2% decline in Tropicana products.
Total net revenues increased 8% in the third quarter, reflecting the volume growth, partially offset by higher promotional spending. GTNA's operating profit increase reflected a very strong performance from Gatorade, partially offset by a decline at Tropicana, as well as advertising and marketing costs to support new products and defend market share.
The volume at Tropicana was a sequential improvement over the second quarter of 2002. Volume gains in the Tropicana Pure Premium and Dole Blends portfolios were offset by declines in the ambient and "from-concentrate" juice businesses.
Gatorade's strong volume performance was driven by continued media support behind its successful "Is It In You?" campaign and continued success of new products introduced earlier in the year. Those products include:
Gatorade Ice, including Strawberry, Orange and Lime,
Gatorade Xtremo!, including Mango, Citrico and Tropicale,
A new Gatorade Frost flavor called Cascade Crush, and
The national roll out of Propel Fitness Water.
Gatorade also successfully introduced its new All Stars line  6-packs of 12 ounce plastic bottles of Gatorade in three flavors--Strawberry, Watermelon and Berry  all designed to appeal to kids.

PBI bottler case sales were up 5% in the third quarter and 4.5% year to date, led by widespread gains across most of the top markets, including double-digit growth in, China, India, Turkey and Russia. The introduction of new products, such as Mountain Dew, Pepsi Twist and line extensions Mirinda contributed to the overall volume growth. In addition, PBI's portfolio of non-carbonated beverages grew at a double-digit rate. The volume growth was restrained by a boycott of American products in the Middle East and weak local macroeconomic conditions, especially in Argentina.
Net revenues were essentially flat both for the quarter and year to date, reflecting the impact of franchising existing Gatorade businesses in certain countries (PBI now reports concentrate sales to the bottlers in these countries, as opposed to full goods revenues to the retail trade), as well as the Middle East boycott and country mix. The impact of the Gatorade franchising adversely impacted net revenues by 2 percentage points for the quarter. PBI's operating profits grew 10% for the quarter and 9% year to date, primarily due to the volume gains.

QFNA volume declined 6% for the quarter, but was down less than 1% year to date. The volume decline reflected softness in ready-to-eat and hot cereals as well as the impact of a shorter 2002 reporting period for Canada Foods.
For the third quarter, net sales decreased 4% primarily due to lower volume, partially offset by lower promotional spending on hot cereals. QFNA's operating profits grew a strong 14% for the quarter and 22% year to date, principally reflecting lower costs from merger synergies and productivity initiatives.
Corporate Items
. Corporate unallocated expenses increased to $98 million in the third quarter, reflecting higher pension costs and a loss on the sale of corporate aircraft. The increased pension costs resulted from a re-measurement of the pension expense for its U.S. plans and a revision of the Company's pension investment allocation. This mid-year re-measurement reflects a reduction in the rate of return to 8.25%.
Corporate Unallocated Expense
. Equity income increased 29%, driven by one-time items in our international bottling investments, principally Gemex, and the continuing solid performance of the bottling system.
Equity Income
. Third quarter net interest expense was flat, with lower interest expense offset by lower interest income.
Net Interest
. Our internal operating cash flow, net of capital spending, was a very strong $2.8 billion for the first three quarters of fiscal year 2002, compared to $2.1 billion for the same period in fiscal 2001, reflecting solid operating results. After the close of the third quarter, the Company contributed approximately $750 million to its pension plans.
Operating Cash Flow
On July 19, 2002, PepsiCo announced that its Board of Directors had authorized the repurchase of up to $5 billion of PepsiCo Common Stock over three years. Shortly thereafter, the Company began repurchasing its shares and during the third quarter purchased 30.3 million shares at a total cost of approximately $1.3 billion. The weighted average diluted number of shares outstanding for the third quarter of 2002 decreased 1.6%, reflecting share repurchases.
.
Share Repurchases
. The integration of the merger with The Quaker Oats Company is proceeding as planned. The Company expects to realize synergies of over $200 million for fiscal year 2002. The synergies have been judiciously re-invested to drive the base business and in new growth opportunities.
