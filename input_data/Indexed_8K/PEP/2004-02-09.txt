PepsiCo, Inc. (the "Company") is filing this amendment to its Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 5, 2004. The Current Report on Form 8-K filed on February 5, 2004 is referred to herein as the "Original Report."
 
Item 12. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
 
On February 5, 2004, the Company issued a press release relating to the Company's earnings for the fourth quarter and of fiscal year ended 2003. A copy of the press release was attached as Exhibit 99.1 to the Original Report.
 
As set forth in this Current Report on Form 8-K/A, the Company revised its 2003 and 2002 financial results issued on February 5, 2004 to correct the overstatement of stock option expense due to a computational error. Accordingly, the Company is furnishing the attached revisions to correct information that was furnished in the Original Report.
 
The information, including the exhibits attached hereto, in this Current Report is being furnished and shall not be deemed "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that Section. The information in this Current Report shall not be incorporated by reference into any registration statement or other document pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, except as otherwise expressly stated in such filing.
 
Attached and incorporated herein by reference as Exhibit 99.2 is a copy of the press release of the Company, dated February 9, 2004, reporting the Company's revisions to its 2003 and 2002 financial results issued in the Original Report.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 
 

Exhibit 99.2
 
 
 
 PepsiCo revised its 2003 and 2002 financial results issued on February 5, 2004 to correct the overstatement of stock option expense due to a computational error. The revision increased the previously reported earnings per share for 2003 by $0.04 to $2.05, and for 2002 by $0.02 to $1.68, on a fully diluted basis. The stock option expense is a non-cash charge and the revision had no impact on the company's previously reported cash flow or division operating profit.
PURCHASE, NY (Feb. 9, 2004)
 
PepsiCo adjusted its 2004 earnings per share guidance to a range of $2.27 to $2.29, 11-12% growth compared to 2003. "A correction of the computational error and a re-estimation of costs, combined with the continued business momentum we are seeing, gives us confidence to take up the EPS range," said Steve Reinemund, Chairman and CEO.
