Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
On March 30, 2005, PepsiCo, Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release announcing that Gary M. Rodkin, Chairman and CEO of PepsiCo Beverages and Foods, would leave the Company effective July 1, 2005. In connection with Mr. Rodkin's separation, the Company and Mr. Rodkin entered into an agreement on April 18, 2005, the material terms of which were approved by the Compensation Committee of the Company's Board of Directors. Under the agreement, Mr. Rodkin will remain employed by the Company until July 1, 2005 and after that he will be available to consult with the Company for two years through June 30, 2007. During the consultancy period, Mr. Rodkin will receive $190,000 per month and is prohibited from disclosing the Company's confidential information, competing against the Company, disparaging the Company or soliciting the Company's employees. The agreement also provides for each party's release of the other from legal claims. Mr. Rodkin will receive his performance-based annual and long-term bonuses for services in 2005 through July 1, 2005 and he will fully vest in his 2004 long-term bonus on July 1, 2005. Mr. Rodkin's 2003, 2004 and 2005 option grants are entitled to immediate vesting; however, Mr. Rodkin will forfeit these options and any other vested options if they are not exercised prior to July 1, 2005. Mr. Rodkin's 2005 and 2004 restricted stock units are also entitled to immediate vesting, but remain subject to future performance criteria as established under the terms and conditions of these awards. All other equity-based awards will be treated in accordance with their original terms as of the July 1 separation date. As Mr. Rodkin is leaving prior to meeting the requirements for early or normal retirement, he remains eligible for a standard deferred vested pension benefit.
