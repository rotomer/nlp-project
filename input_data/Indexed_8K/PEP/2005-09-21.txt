Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On September 16, 2005, modifications to PepsiCos Director Compensation program were approved, effective October 1, 2005. Consistent with the prior program which had remained unchanged since 2003, Directors who are employees of the Company receive no additional compensation for serving as Directors. All other Directors continue to receive an annual retainer and an annual equity grant. The annual retainer remains unchanged at $100,000. Committee chairs receive an additional $20,000 retainer (increased from $10,000) for the supplemental duties associated with serving as a committee chair. Directors may continue to elect to receive their retainer in cash or defer their retainer into PepsiCo Common Stock equivalents, which are payable in cash at the end of the deferral period. The former program provided a $75,000 annual grant of restricted stock units. Directors were able to convert all or a portion of this award into stock options; the number of stock options was determined by multiplying the number of restricted stock units to be converted by four. Under the new program, the value of the annual equity award to Directors is $100,000 and is equally split between stock options and restricted stock units. The number of restricted stock units awarded is determined by dividing $50,000 by the fair market value of PepsiCo Common Stock on the date of grant. The number of stock options awarded is determined by multiplying the number of restricted stock units to be awarded by four. Stock options granted have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of PepsiCo Common Stock on the date of grant. Restricted stock units and stock options normally vest after three years and vest earlier in the case of the directors death, disability or retirement. In addition, all newly appointed Directors continue to receive a one-time grant of 1,000 shares of PepsiCo Common Stock when they join the Board. Directors continue to be reimbursed for expenses incurred to attend Board and committee meetings. Directors do not receive any meeting fees, nor do they have a retirement plan or receive any benefits such as life or medical insurance. Directors do receive business travel and accident coverage and are eligible for PepsiCo Foundation matching of charitable contributions.
