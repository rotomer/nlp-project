Exhibit 99.1
These Terms and Conditions, along with the PepsiCo Annual Long-Term Incentive Award Summary (the "Award Summary") delivered herewith and signed by the individual named on the Award Summary (the "Participant") shall constitute an Agreement made as of the Grant Date (as indicated on the Award Summary), by and between PepsiCo, Inc., a North Carolina corporation having its principal office at 700 Anderson Hill Road, Purchase, New York 10577 ("PepsiCo," and with its divisions and direct and indirect subsidiaries, the "Company"), and the Participant.
WHEREAS, the Board of Directors and shareholders of PepsiCo have approved the 2003 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "Plan"), for the purposes and subject to the provisions set forth in the Plan; and
WHEREAS, pursuant to the authority granted to it in said Plan, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of PepsiCo (the "Committee"), by resolution duly adopted at a meeting held on or prior to the Grant Date desires to grant to the Participant the stock options and/or restricted stock units set forth on the Award Summary; and
WHEREAS, awards granted under the Plan are to be evidenced by an Agreement in such form and containing such terms and conditions as the Committee shall determine;
NOW, THEREFORE, it is mutually agreed as follows:
A. . These terms and conditions shall apply with respect to the stock options, if any, granted to the Participant as indicated on the Award Summary.
Terms and Conditions Applicable to Stock Options
1. . In consideration of the Participant remaining in the employ of the Company, PepsiCo hereby grants to the Participant, on the terms and conditions set forth herein, the right and option to purchase the number of shares of PepsiCo Common Stock, par value $.0167 per share, indicated on the Award Summary, at the Grant/Exercise Price per share indicated on the Award Summary (the "Option Exercise Price"), which was the Fair Market Value (as defined below) of PepsiCo Common Stock on the Grant Date. The right to purchase each such share is referred to herein as an "Option."
Grant
2. . Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Options shall become fully vested on the vesting date set forth in the Award Summary (the "Vesting Date") and shall be exercisable from the Vesting Date through the date set forth in the Award Summary (the "Expiration Date"). Options may vest only while the Participant is actively employed by the Company. Once vested and exercisable, and until terminated, all or any portion of the Options may be exercised from time to time and at any time under procedures that the Committee or its delegate shall establish from time to time, including, without limitation, procedures regarding the frequency of exercise and the minimum number of Options which may be exercised at any time.
Exercisability
3. . Subject to terms and conditions set forth herein, Options may be exercised by giving written notice of exercise to PepsiCo in the manner specified from time to time by PepsiCo. The aggregate Option Exercise Price for the shares being purchased, together with any amount which the Company may be required to withhold upon such exercise in respect of applicable foreign, federal (including FICA), state and local taxes, must be paid in full at the time of issuance of such shares.
Exercise Procedure
4. .
Effect of Termination of Employment, Death, Retirement and Total Disability
(a) . Options may vest only while the Participant is actively employed by the Company. Thus, vesting ceases upon the termination of the Participant's active employment with the Company. Only vested Options may be exercised. Subject to subparagraphs 4(b), 4(c) and 4(d), vested Options shall be exercisable until the earlier of the Expiration Date and the date that is the last trading day on the New York Stock Exchange during the 90-calendar day period after the date the Participant's employment with the Company terminates. Subject to subparagraphs 4(b), 4(c) and 4(d), all Options shall automatically expire upon and may not be exercised after the earlier of the Expiration Date and the date that is the last trading day on the New York Stock Exchange during the 90-calendar day period after the date the Participant's employment with the Company terminates. It is intended that an authorized leave of absence may extend employment (and thus extend when options may be exercised). However, an authorized leave will not extend the time to exercise options if prohibited by Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and it will not increase vesting.
Termination of Employment
(b) . If the Participant's employment terminates prior to the Vesting Date, by reason of the Participant's Retirement (as defined below) prior to attaining at least age 62, then: (i) the portion of the Options that shall vest on the Participant's last day of active employment with the Company will be in proportion to the Participant's active service (measured in calendar days) during the period commencing on the Grant Date and ending on the Vesting Date; (ii) the Options shall continue to become exercisable in accordance with Paragraph A.2 of this Agreement; and (iii) the Options may be exercised by the Participant prior to the Expiration Date in accordance with this Agreement.
Retirement Prior to Age 62
(c) . If the Participant's employment terminates by reason of the Participant's death, Total Disability (as defined below), or Retirement after attaining at least age 62, then: (i) the Options shall become fully vested on the Participant's last day of active employment with the Company; (ii) the Options shall continue to become exercisable in accordance with Paragraph A.2 of this Agreement; and (iii) the Options may be exercised by the Participant's legal representative (or any person to whom the Options may be transferred by will or the applicable laws of descent and distribution), in the event of death, or the Participant, in the event of Retirement or Total Disability, prior to the Expiration Date in accordance with this Agreement.
Death, Total Disability, or Retirement on or After Age 62
(d) . In the event the Participant transfers to a Related Entity (as defined below), as a result of actions by PepsiCo, the Options shall become fully vested and exercisable on the date of such transfer and shall otherwise remain outstanding and be exercisable in accordance with this Agreement.
Transfers to a Related Entity
5. . At any time after any Option becomes exercisable, the Committee shall have the right, in its sole discretion and without the consent of the Participant, to cancel such Option and pay to the Participant the difference between the Option Exercise Price and the Fair Market Value of the shares covered by the Option as of the date the Committee gives written notice (the "Buy Out Notice") of its intention to exercise such right. Payments of such buy out amounts pursuant to this provision shall be effected by PepsiCo as promptly as possible after the date of the Buy Out Notice and shall be made in shares of Common Stock. The number of shares shall be determined by dividing the amount of the payment to be made by the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock at the date of the Buy Out Notice, and by rounding up any fractional share to a whole share. Payments of any such buy out amounts shall be made net of the minimum applicable foreign, federal (including FICA), state and local withholding taxes, if any.
Buy-Out of Option Gains
B. . These terms and conditions shall apply with respect to the restricted stock units, if any, granted to the Participant as indicated on the Award Summary.
Terms and Conditions Applicable to Restricted Stock Units
1. . In consideration of the Participant remaining in the employ of PepsiCo, or one of its divisions or direct or indirect subsidiaries (collectively the "Company"), PepsiCo hereby grants to the Participant, on the terms and conditions set forth herein, the number of restricted stock units indicated on the Award Summary (the "Restricted Stock Units").
Grant
2. . Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein and subparagraphs 2(a) and (b) below, the Restricted Stock Units shall become fully vested on the Vesting Date and will be payable as soon as practicable after that date. Restricted Stock Units may vest only while the Participant is actively employed by the Company. The Restricted Stock Units payable pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be reduced by any Restricted Stock Units that are paid pursuant to subparagraphs (a) and (b) below.
Vesting
(a) . A Participant shall be vested in 33% of his Restricted Stock Units on the first February 1 that follows the Grant Date if on such February 1 the Participant: (i) is eligible for Retirement, (ii) is not yet age 62, and (iii) has been actively employed continuously since the Grant Date. This vested portion shall be paid as soon as practicable after this February 1. A Participant shall be vested in 66% of his Restricted Stock Units on the second February 1 that follows the Grant Date if on such February 1 the conditions in (i), (ii) and (iii) of this Paragraph B.2(a) are satisfied. This vested portion shall be paid as soon as practicable after this second February 1 (net of any Restricted Stock Units previously paid out).
Eligibility for Retirement Prior to Age 62
(b) . A Participant shall be fully vested in his Restricted Stock Units on the first February 1 that follows the Grant Date if on such February 1 the Participant: (i) is eligible for Retirement, (ii) is at least age 62, and (iii) has been actively employed continuously since the Grant Date. The Participant's Restricted Stock Units will be payable as soon as practicable after this February 1. A Participant shall be fully vested in his Restricted Stock Units on the second February 1 that follows the Grant Date if on such February 1 the conditions in (i), (ii) and (iii) of this Paragraph B.2(b) are satisfied. The Participant's Restricted Stock Units will be payable as soon as practicable after this second February 1 (net of any Restricted Stock Units previously paid out).
Eligibility for Retirement on or After Age 62
3. . Restricted Stock Units that vest and become payable shall be settled in shares of PepsiCo Common Stock with the Participant receiving one share of PepsiCo Common Stock for each vested Restricted Stock Unit. No fractional shares shall be delivered under this Agreement, and so any fractional share that may be payable shall be rounded to the nearest whole share. Any amount that the Company may be required to withhold upon the settlement of Restricted Stock Units and/or the payment of dividend equivalents (see Section B.5 below) in respect of applicable foreign, federal (including FICA), state and local taxes, must be paid in full at the time of the issuance of shares or payment of cash. Unless the Participant makes other arrangements to satisfy this withholding obligation in accordance with procedures approved by the Company in its discretion, the Company will withhold shares to satisfy the required withholding obligation related to the settlement of Restricted Stock Units.
Payment
4. .
Effect of Termination of Employment, Death, Retirement and Total Disability
(a) . Restricted Stock Units may vest and become payable only while the Participant is actively employed by the Company. Thus, vesting ceases upon the termination of the Participant's active employment with the Company. Subject to subparagraphs 4(b), 4(c) and 4(d), all unvested Restricted Stock Units shall automatically be forfeited and canceled upon the date that the Participant's employment with the Company terminates.
Termination of Employment
(b) . If the Participant's employment terminates prior to the Vesting Date, by reason of the Participant's Retirement prior to attaining age 62, then the whole number of Restricted Stock Units that shall vest on the Participant's last day of active employment with the Company will be in proportion to the Participant's active service (measured in calendar days) during the period commencing on the Grant Date and ending on the Vesting Date and will be payable as soon as practicable after that date (net of any Restricted Stock Units previously paid out)
Retirement Prior to Age 62

Death, Total Disability, or Retirement on or After Age 62
(d) . In the event the Participant transfers to a Related Entity (as defined below), as a result of actions by PepsiCo, the Restricted Stock Units shall become fully vested and payable on the date of such transfer (net of any Restricted Stock Units previously paid out).
Transfers to a Related Entity
5. . During the vesting period, the Participant shall accumulate dividend equivalents with respect to the Restricted Stock Units, which dividend equivalents shall be paid in cash (without interest) to the Participant only if and when the applicable Restricted Stock Units vest and become payable. Dividend equivalents shall equal the dividends actually paid with respect to PepsiCo Common Stock during the vesting period while (and to the extent) the Restricted Stock Units remain outstanding and unpaid.

(1) Non-Competition. Participant shall not accept any employment, assignment, position or responsibility, or acquire any ownership interest, which involves the Participant's Participation in a business entity that markets, sells, distributes or produces Covered Products, unless such business entity makes retail sales or consumes Covered Products without in any way competing with the Company.
(2) Raiding Employees. Participant shall not in any way, directly or indirectly (including through someone else acting on the Participant's recommendation, suggestion, identification or advice), solicit any Company employee to leave the Company's employment or to accept any position with any other entity.
(3) Non-Disclosure. Participant shall not use or disclose to anyone any confidential information regarding the Company other than as necessary in his or her position with the Company. Such confidential information shall include all non-public information the Participant acquired as a result of his or her positions with the Company which might be of any value to a competitor of the Company, or which might cause any economic loss or substantial embarrassment to the Company or its customers, bottlers, distributors or suppliers if used or disclosed. Examples of such confidential information include, without limitation, non-public information about the Company's customers, suppliers, distributors and potential acquisition targets; its business operations and structure; its product lines, formulas and pricing; its processes, machines and inventions; its research and know-how; its financial data; and its plans and strategies.

Participant shall not engage in any acts that are considered to be contrary to the Company's best interests, including, but not limited to, violating the Company's Code of Conduct, engaging in unlawful trading in the securities of PepsiCo or of any other company based on information gained as a result of his or her employment with the Company, or engaging in any other activity which constitutes gross misconduct.
(b) In the event the Company determines that the Participant has breached any term of Paragraph C.1(a), in addition to any other remedies the Company may have available to it, the Company may in its sole discretion:
(1) Cancel any unexercised Options or unvested Restricted Stock Units granted hereunder;
(2) Require the Participant to pay to the Company all gains realized from the exercise of any Options granted hereunder, which have been exercised within the twelve-month period immediately preceding the date as of which the Participant has breached a provision of Paragraph C.1(a), as determined by the Company; and/or
(3) Require the Participant to pay to the Company the value (determined as of the Vesting Date) of any Restricted Stock Units, which have vested within the twelve-month period immediately preceding the date as of which the Participant has breached a provision of Paragraph C.1(a), as determined by the Company.
2. . In the event of any change in the outstanding shares of PepsiCo Common Stock by reason of any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, reorganization, merger, consolidation, combination or exchange of shares, spin-off or other similar corporate change, (a) the number and type of shares which the Participant may purchase pursuant to the Options and the Option Exercise Price at which the Participant may purchase such shares may be adjusted appropriately, and (b) the number and type of shares to which the Restricted Stock Units held by the Participant relate may be adjusted appropriately.

For purposes of the preceding sentence, the gain on an Option shall be calculated as the difference between the closing price per share of PepsiCo Common Stock as of the date such Option becomes unexercisable and the Option Exercise Price.
Effect of Change in Control
e.g.
4. . Unless the Committee specifically determines otherwise: (a) the Options and Restricted Stock Units are personal to the Participant and, with respect to Options, during the Participant's lifetime, such Options may be exercised only by the Participant, and (b) the Options and Restricted Stock Units shall not be transferable or assignable, other than in the case of the Participant's death by will, the laws of descent and distribution.

Exhibit 99.2
These Terms and Conditions, along with the PepsiCo Performance-Based Long-Term Incentive Award Summary (the "Award Summary") delivered herewith and signed by the individual named on the Award Summary (the "Participant") shall constitute an Agreement made as of the Grant Date (as indicated on the Award Summary), by and between PepsiCo, Inc., a North Carolina corporation having its principal office at 700 Anderson Hill Road, Purchase, New York 10577 ("PepsiCo," and with its divisions and direct and indirect subsidiaries, the "Company"), and the Participant.
WHEREAS, the Board of Directors and shareholders of PepsiCo have approved the 2003 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "Plan"), for the purposes and subject to the provisions set forth in the Plan; and
WHEREAS, pursuant to the authority granted to it in said Plan, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of PepsiCo (the "Committee"), by resolution duly adopted at a meeting held on or prior to the Grant Date desires to grant to the Participant the stock options and restricted stock units set forth on the Award Summary; and
WHEREAS, awards granted under the Plan are to be evidenced by an Agreement in such form and containing such terms and conditions as the Committee shall determine;
NOW, THEREFORE, it is mutually agreed as follows:
A. . These terms and conditions shall apply with respect to the stock options granted to the Participant as indicated on the Award Summary.
Terms and Conditions Applicable to Stock Options
1. . In consideration of the Participant remaining in the employ of the Company, PepsiCo hereby grants to the Participant, on the terms and conditions set forth herein, the right and option to purchase the number of shares of PepsiCo Common Stock, par value $.0167 per share, indicated on the Award Summary, at the Grant/Exercise Price per share indicated on the Award Summary (the "Option Exercise Price"), which was the Fair Market Value (as defined below) of PepsiCo Common Stock on the Grant Date. The right to purchase each such share is referred to herein as an "Option."
Grant
2. . Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Options shall become fully vested on the vesting date set forth in the Award Summary (the "Vesting Date") and shall be exercisable from the Vesting Date through the expiration date set forth in the Award Summary (the "Expiration Date"). Options may vest only while the Participant is actively employed by the Company. Once vested and exercisable, and until terminated, all or any portion of the Options may be exercised from time to time and at any time under procedures that the Committee or its delegate shall establish from time to time, including, without limitation, procedures regarding the frequency of exercise and the minimum number of Options which may be exercised at any time.
Exercisability
3. . Subject to terms and conditions set forth herein, Options may be exercised by giving written notice of exercise to PepsiCo in the manner specified from time to time by PepsiCo. The aggregate Option Exercise Price for the shares being purchased, together with any amount which the Company may be required to withhold upon such exercise in respect of applicable foreign, federal (including FICA), state and local taxes, must be paid in full at the time of issuance of such shares.
Exercise Procedure
4. .
Effect of Termination of Employment, Death, Retirement and Total Disability
(a) . Options may vest only while the Participant is actively employed by the Company. Thus, vesting ceases upon the termination of the Participant's active employment with the Company. Only vested Options may be exercised. Subject to subparagraphs 4(b), 4(c) and 4(d), vested Options shall be exercisable until the earlier of (i) the date that is the last trading day on the New York Stock Exchange during the 90-calendar day period after the date the Participant's employment with the Company terminates and (ii) the Expiration Date. Subject to subparagraphs 4(b), 4(c) and 4(d), all Options shall automatically expire upon the earlier of (i) and (ii) in the immediately preceding sentence. It is intended that an authorized leave of absence may extend employment (and thus extend when options may be exercised). However, an authorized leave will not extend the time to exercise options if prohibited by Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and it will not increase vesting.
Termination of Employment
(b) . If the Participant's employment terminates prior to the Vesting Date, by reason of the Participant's Retirement (as defined below) prior to attaining at least age 62, then: (i) the whole number of Options that shall vest on the Participant's last day of active employment with the Company will be in proportion to the Participant's active service (measured in calendar days) during the period commencing on the Grant Date and ending on the Vesting Date; (ii) the Options shall continue to become exercisable in accordance with Paragraph A.2 of this Agreement; and (iii) the Options may be exercised by the Participant prior to the Expiration Date in accordance with this Agreement.
Retirement Prior to Age 62
(c) .

Death, Total Disability, or Retirement on or After Age 62
(d) . In the event the Participant transfers to a Related Entity (as defined below), as a result of actions by PepsiCo, the Options shall become fully vested and exercisable on the date of such transfer and shall otherwise remain outstanding and be exercisable in accordance with this Agreement.
Transfers to a Related Entity
5. . At any time after any Option becomes exercisable, the Committee shall have the right, in its sole discretion and without the consent of the Participant, to cancel such Option and pay to the Participant the difference between the Option Exercise Price and the Fair Market Value of the shares covered by the Option as of the date the Committee gives written notice (the "Buy Out Notice") of its intention to exercise such right. Payments of such buy out amounts pursuant to this provision shall be effected by PepsiCo as promptly as possible after the date of the Buy Out Notice and shall be made in shares of Common Stock. The number of shares shall be determined by dividing the amount of the payment to be made by the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock at the date of the Buy Out Notice, and by rounding up any fractional share to a whole share. Payments of any such buy out amounts shall be made net of the minimum applicable foreign, federal (including FICA), state and local withholding taxes, if any.
Buy-Out of Option Gains
B. . These terms and conditions shall apply with respect to the restricted stock units granted to the Participant as indicated on the Award Summary.
Terms and Conditions Applicable to Restricted Stock Units
1. . In consideration of the Participant remaining in the employ of the Company, PepsiCo hereby grants to the Participant, on the terms and conditions set forth herein, the number of restricted stock units indicated on the Award Summary (the "Restricted Stock Units").
Grant
2. . Subject to Paragraphs B.3 and B.4 below, the Restricted Stock Units shall vest on the Vesting Date and be payable as soon as practicable after such date (the "Payment Date"). Restricted Stock Units that become payable shall be settled in shares of PepsiCo Common Stock with the Participant receiving one share of PepsiCo Common Stock for each Restricted Stock Unit. No fractional shares shall be delivered under this Agreement, and so any fractional share that may be payable shall be rounded to the nearest whole share. Any amount that the Company may be required to withhold upon the settlement of Restricted Stock Units and/or the payment of dividend equivalents (see Paragraph B.5 below) in respect of applicable foreign, federal (including FICA), state and local taxes, must be paid in full at the time of the issuance of shares or payment of cash. Unless the Participant makes other arrangements to satisfy this withholding obligation in accordance with procedures approved by the Company in its discretion, the Company will withhold shares to satisfy the required withholding obligation related to the settlement of Restricted Stock Units.
Payment
3. . The number of Restricted Stock Units that are payable shall be determined based on the achievement of performance targets. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Restricted Stock Units shall be subject to forfeiture as follows:
Forfeiture of Restricted Stock Units
(a) The payment of one-third of the Restricted Stock Units shall be determined based on the achievement of specific {Year} performance targets. The specific performance targets and the percentage of the one-third of the Restricted Stock Units that shall be forfeited if such targets are not achieved shall be established by the Committee in the first ninety (90) days of {Year}.
(b) The payment of one-third of the Restricted Stock Units shall be determined based on the achievement of specific {Year+1} performance targets. The specific performance targets and the percentage of the one-third of the Restricted Stock Units that shall be forfeited if such targets are not achieved shall be established by the Committee in the first ninety (90) days of {Year+1}.
(c) The payment of one-third of the Restricted Stock Units shall be determined based on the achievement of specific {Year+2} performance targets. The specific performance targets and the percentage of the one-third of the Restricted Stock Units that shall be forfeited if such targets are not achieved shall be established by the Committee in the first ninety (90) days of {Year+2}.
(d) Notwithstanding the achievement of any performance targets established under Paragraphs B.3(a), (b) and (c) above, the Committee has the discretion to reduce the number of Restricted Stock Units paid, subject to and in accordance with the Plan. In the case of a Participant's death or Total Disability (as defined below), the Committee's right to exercise this discretion shall expire with respect to each one-third of the Restricted Stock Units at the later of: (i) the Participant's death or Total Disability (whichever applies), or (ii) the date the Committee certifies the results for the specific performance targets that relate to such one-third of the Restricted Stock Units. In all other cases, the Committee's right to exercise this discretion with respect to 100% of the Restricted Stock Units shall continue until the Payment Date. Accordingly, except in the case of death or Total Disability, the Restricted Stock Units for which a Participant has satisfied the performance criteria will be payable in one payment on the Payment Date.
4. .
Effect of Termination of Employment, Death, Retirement and Total Disability
(a) . Restricted Stock Units may vest and become payable only while the Participant is actively employed by the Company. Thus, vesting ceases upon the termination of the Participant's active employment with the Company. Subject to subparagraphs 4(b), 4(c) and 4(d), all unvested Restricted Stock Units shall automatically be forfeited and canceled upon the date that the Participant's employment with the Company terminates.
Termination of Employment
(b) . If the Participant's employment terminates prior to the Vesting Date, by reason of the Participant's Retirement (as defined below) prior to attaining at least age 62, then the whole number of Restricted Stock Units that shall vest on the Participant's last day of active employment with the Company will be in proportion to the Participant's active service (measured in calendar days) during the period commencing on the Grant Date and ending on the Vesting Date. All Restricted Stock Units that vest in accordance with the foregoing sentence shall remain subject to the payment and forfeiture provisions of Paragraphs B.2 and B.3.
Retirement Prior to Age 62
(c) . If the Participant's employment terminates by reason of the Participant's death, Total Disability (as defined below), or Retirement after attaining at least age 62, then the Restricted Stock Units shall become fully vested on the Participant's last day of active employment with the Company. All such vested Restricted Stock Units shall remain subject to the payment and forfeiture provisions of Paragraphs B.2 and B.3, except that in the case of death or Total Disability payment of each one-third of the Restricted Stock Units will be made as soon as practicable after the Committee's right to exercise discretion with respect to such one-third expires in accordance with Paragraph B.3(d).
Death, Total Disability, or Retirement on or After Age 62
(d) . In the event the Participant transfers to a Related Entity (as defined below), as a result of actions by PepsiCo, the Restricted Stock Units shall become fully vested on the Participant's last day of active employment with the Company. All such vested Restricted Stock Units shall remain subject to the payment and forfeiture provisions of Paragraphs B.2 and B.3.
Transfers to a Related Entity
5. . During the vesting period, the Participant shall accumulate dividend equivalents with respect to the Restricted Stock Units, which dividend equivalents shall be paid in cash (without interest) to the Participant only if and when the applicable Restricted Stock Units vest and become payable. Dividend equivalents shall equal the dividends actually paid with respect to PepsiCo Common Stock during the vesting period while (and to the extent) the Restricted Stock Units remain outstanding and unpaid.

For purposes of the preceding sentence, the gain on an Option shall be calculated as the difference between the closing price per share of PepsiCo Common Stock as of the date such Option becomes unexercisable and the Option Exercise Price.
Effect of Change in Control

4. . Unless the Committee specifically determines otherwise: (a) the Options and Restricted Stock Units are personal to the Participant and, with respect to Options, during the Participant's lifetime, such Options may be exercised only by the Participant, and (b) the Options and Restricted Stock Units shall not be transferable or assignable, other than in the case of the Participant's death by will, the laws of descent and distribution.

Exhibit 99.3
These Terms and Conditions, along with the PepsiCo Pro Rata Long-Term Incentive Award Summary (the "Award Summary") delivered herewith and signed by the individual named on the Award Summary (the "Participant") shall constitute an Agreement made as of the Grant Date (as indicated on the Award Summary), by and between PepsiCo, Inc., a North Carolina corporation having its principal office at 700 Anderson Hill Road, Purchase, New York 10577 ("PepsiCo," and with its divisions and direct and indirect subsidiaries, the "Company"), and the Participant.
WHEREAS, the Board of Directors and shareholders of PepsiCo have approved the 2003 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "Plan"), for the purposes and subject to the provisions set forth in the Plan; and
WHEREAS, pursuant to the authority granted to it in said Plan, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of PepsiCo (the "Committee"), by resolution duly adopted at a meeting held on or prior to the Grant Date authorized the granting of stock options to newly hired or promoted executives; and
WHEREAS, the Committee now desires to grant to the Participant the stock options set forth on the Award Summary (the "Options"); and
WHEREAS, awards granted under the Plan are to be evidenced by an Agreement in such form and containing such terms and conditions as the Committee shall determine;
NOW, THEREFORE, it is mutually agreed as follows:
A. . These terms and conditions shall apply with respect to the Options granted to the Participant as indicated on the Award Summary.
Terms and Conditions Applicable to Options
1. . In consideration of the Participant remaining in the employ of PepsiCo, or one of its divisions or direct or indirect subsidiaries (collectively the "Company"), PepsiCo hereby grants to the Participant, on the terms and conditions set forth herein, the right and option to purchase the number of shares of PepsiCo Common Stock, par value $.0167 per share, indicated on the Award Summary, at the Grant/Exercise Price per share indicated on the Award Summary (the "Option Exercise Price"), which was the Fair Market Value (as defined below) of PepsiCo Common Stock on the Grant Date. The right to purchase each such share is referred to herein as an "Option."
Grant
2. . Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Options shall become fully vested on the vesting/exercisable date set forth on the Award Summary (the "Vesting Date") and shall be exercisable from the Vesting Date through the expiration date set forth on the Award Summary (the "Expiration Date"). Options may vest only while the Participant is actively employed by the Company. Once vested and exercisable, and until terminated, all or any portion of the Options may be exercised from time to time and at any time under procedures that the Committee or its delegate shall establish from time to time, including, without limitation, procedures regarding the frequency of exercise and the minimum number of Options which may be exercised at any time.
Exercisability
3. . Subject to terms and conditions set forth herein, Options may be exercised by giving written notice of exercise to PepsiCo in the manner specified from time to time by PepsiCo. The aggregate Option Exercise Price for the shares being purchased, together with any amount which the Company may be required to withhold upon such exercise in respect of applicable foreign, federal (including FICA), state and local taxes, must be paid in full at the time of issuance of such shares.
Exercise Procedure
4. .
Effect of Termination of Employment, Death, Retirement and Total Disability
(a) . Options may vest only while the Participant is actively employed by the Company. Thus, vesting ceases upon the termination of the Participant's active employment with the Company. Only vested Options may be exercised. Subject to subparagraphs 4(b), 4(c) and 4(d), vested Options shall be exercisable until the earlier of the Expiration Date and the date that is the last trading day on the New York Stock Exchange during the 90-calendar day period after the date the Participant's employment with the Company terminates. Subject to subparagraphs 4(b), 4(c) and 4(d), all Options shall automatically expire upon and may not be exercised after the earlier of the Expiration Date and the date that is the last trading day on the New York Stock Exchange during the 90-calendar day period after the date the Participant's employment with the Company terminates. It is intended that an authorized leave of absence may extend employment (and thus extend when options may be exercised). However, an authorized leave will not extend the time to exercise options if prohibited by Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and it will not increase vesting.
Termination of Employment
(b) . If the Participant's employment terminates prior to the Vesting Date, by reason of the Participant's Retirement (as defined below) prior to attaining at least age 62, then: (i) the portion of the Options that shall vest on the Participant's last day of active employment with the Company will be in proportion to the Participant's active service (measured in calendar days) during the period commencing on the Grant Date and ending on the Vesting Date; (ii) the Options shall continue to become exercisable in accordance with Paragraph A.2 of this Agreement; and (iii) the Options may be exercised by the Participant prior to the Expiration Date in accordance with this Agreement.
Retirement Prior to Age 62
(c) . If the Participant's employment terminates by reason of the Participant's death, Total Disability (as defined below), or Retirement after attaining at least age 62, then: (i) the Options shall become fully vested on the Participant's last day of active employment with the Company; (ii) the Options shall continue to become exercisable in accordance with Paragraph A.2 of this Agreement; and (iii) the Options may be exercised by the Participant's legal representative (or any person to whom the Options may be transferred by will or the applicable laws of descent and distribution), in the event of death, or the Participant, in the event of Retirement or Total Disability, prior to the Expiration Date in accordance with this Agreement.
Death, Total Disability, or Retirement on or After Age 62
(d) . In the event the Participant transfers to a Related Entity (as defined below), as a result of actions by PepsiCo, the Options shall become fully vested and exercisable on the date of such transfer and shall otherwise remain outstanding and be exercisable in accordance with this Agreement.
Transfers to a Related Entity
5. . At any time after any Option becomes exercisable, the Committee shall have the right, in its sole discretion and without the consent of the Participant, to cancel such Option and pay to the Participant the difference between the Option Exercise Price and the Fair Market Value of the shares covered by the Option as of the date the Committee gives written notice (the "Buy Out Notice") of its intention to exercise such right. Payments of such buy out amounts pursuant to this provision shall be effected by PepsiCo as promptly as possible after the date of the Buy Out Notice and shall be made in shares of Common Stock. The number of shares shall be determined by dividing the amount of the payment to be made by the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock at the date of the Buy Out Notice, and by rounding up any fractional share to a whole share. Payments of any such buy out amounts shall be made net of the minimum applicable foreign, federal (including FICA), state and local withholding taxes, if any.

General Terms and Conditions
1. .
Prohibited Conduct
(a) The Participant agrees that, at any time prior to the exercise of the Options granted hereunder, and for a period of twelve months after the later of (i) completion of all such exercises of Stock Options, or (ii) termination of the Participant's employment with the Company for any reason whatsoever (including Retirement or Total Disability), he or she will not engage in any of the following activities anywhere in the world:
(1) Non-Competition. Participant shall not accept any employment, assignment, position or responsibility, or acquire any ownership interest, which involves the Participant's Participation in a business entity that markets, sells, distributes or produces Covered Products, unless such business entity makes retail sales or consumes Covered Products without in any way competing with the Company.
(2) Raiding Employees. Participant shall not in any way, directly or indirectly (including through someone else acting on the Participant's recommendation, suggestion, identification or advice), solicit any Company employee to leave the Company's employment or to accept any position with any other entity.
(3) Non-Disclosure. Participant shall not use or disclose to anyone any confidential information regarding the Company other than as necessary in his or her position with the Company. Such confidential information shall include all non-public information the Participant acquired as a result of his or her positions with the Company which might be of any value to a competitor of the Company, or which might cause any economic loss or substantial embarrassment to the Company or its customers, bottlers, distributors or suppliers if used or disclosed. Examples of such confidential information include, without limitation, non-public information about the Company's customers, suppliers, distributors and potential acquisition targets; its business operations and structure; its product lines, formulas and pricing; its processes, machines and inventions; its research and know-how; its financial data; and its plans and strategies.
(4) Misconduct. Participant shall not engage in any acts that are considered to be contrary to the Company's best interests, including, but not limited to, violating the Company's Code of Conduct, engaging in unlawful trading in the securities of PepsiCo or of any other company based on information gained as a result of his or her employment with the Company, or engaging in any other activity which constitutes gross misconduct.
(b) In the event the Company determines that the Participant has breached any term of Paragraph B.1(a), in addition to any other remedies the Company may have available to it, the Company may in its sole discretion:
(1) Cancel any unexercised Options granted hereunder; and/or
(2) Require the Participant to pay to the Company all gains realized from the exercise of any Options granted hereunder, which have been exercised within the twelve-month period immediately preceding the date as of which the Participant has breached a provision of Paragraph B.1(a), as determined by the Company
2. . In the event of any change in the outstanding shares of PepsiCo Common Stock by reason of any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, reorganization, merger, consolidation, combination or exchange of shares, spin-off or other similar corporate change, the number and type of shares which the Participant may purchase pursuant to the Options and the Option Exercise Price at which the Participant may purchase such shares may be adjusted appropriately.
Adjustment for Change in Common Stock
3. . At the date of a Change in Control (as defined in the Plan), all outstanding and unvested Options granted hereunder shall immediately vest and become exercisable and shall remain outstanding in accordance with their terms. In the event that any Option granted hereunder becomes unexercisable during its term on or after a Change in Control because: (i) the Participant is involuntarily terminated (other than for cause) within two years after the Change in Control; (ii) such Option is terminated or adversely modified; or (iii) PepsiCo Common Stock is no longer issued and outstanding, or no longer traded on a national securities exchange, then the Participant shall immediately be entitled to receive equity (, common stock) of the Acquiring Entity (as defined in the Plan) with a fair market value (taking into account any marketability limitations) equal to the greater of (x) the gain on such Option or (y) the Black-Scholes value of such Option (as determined by a nationally recognized independent investment banker chosen by PepsiCo), in either case calculated on the date such Option becomes unexercisable. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the gain on an Option shall be calculated as the difference between the closing price per share of PepsiCo Common Stock as of the date such Option becomes unexercisable and the Option Exercise Price.
Effect of Change in Control
e.g.
4. . Unless the Committee specifically determines otherwise: (a) the Options are personal to the Participant and, during the Participant's lifetime, such Options may be exercised only by the Participant, and (b) the Options shall not be transferable or assignable, other than in the case of the Participant's death by will, the laws of descent and distribution or such beneficiary designation process established by the Committee (or its delegate), and any such purported transfer or assignment shall be null and void.
Nontransferability

Exhibit 99.4
These Terms and Conditions along with the PepsiCo Stock Option Retention Award Summary (the "Award Summary") delivered herewith and signed by the individual named on the Award Summary (the "Participant") shall constitute an Agreement made as of the Grant Date (as indicated on the Award Summary) by and between PepsiCo, Inc., a North Carolina corporation having its principal office at 700 Anderson Hill Road, Purchase, New York 10577 ("PepsiCo," and with its divisions and direct and indirect subsidiaries, the "Company"), and the Participant.
WHEREAS, the Board of Directors and shareholders of PepsiCo have approved the 2003 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "Plan"), for the purposes and subject to the provisions set forth in the Plan; and
WHEREAS, pursuant to the authority granted to it in said Plan, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of PepsiCo (the "Committee"), by resolution duly adopted at a meeting held on or prior to the Grant Date desires to grant to the Participant the stock options set forth on the Award Summary; and
WHEREAS, awards granted under the Plan are to be evidenced by an Agreement in such form and containing such terms and conditions as the Committee shall determine.
NOW, THEREFORE, it is mutually agreed as follows:
1. . In consideration of the Participant remaining in the employ of the Company, PepsiCo hereby grants to the Participant, on the terms and conditions set forth herein, the right and option to purchase the number of shares of PepsiCo Common Stock, par value $.0167 per share, indicated on the Award Summary at the Grant/Exercise Price per share indicated on the Award Summary (the "Option Exercise Price"), which was the Fair Market Value (as defined below) of PepsiCo Common Stock on the Grant Date. The right to purchase each such share is referred to herein as an "Option".
Grant
2. . Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the number of Options specified in the Award Summary shall become vested on each vesting date set forth in the Award Summary ("Vesting Date"). The specified number of Options shall be exercisable from the applicable Vesting Date through the expiration date set forth in the Award Summary (the "Expiration Date"). Options may vest only while the Participant is actively employed by the Company. Once vested and exercisable, and until terminated, all or any portion of the Options may be exercised from time to time and at any time under procedures that the Committee or its delegate shall establish from time to time, including, without limitation, procedures regarding the frequency of exercise and the minimum number of Options which may be exercised at any time.
Exercisability
3. . Subject to terms and conditions set forth herein, Options may be exercised by giving written notice of exercise to PepsiCo in the manner specified from time to time by PepsiCo. The aggregate Option Exercise Price for the shares being purchased, together with any amount which the Company may be required to withhold upon such exercise in respect of applicable foreign, federal (including FICA), state and local taxes, must be paid in full at the time of issuance of such shares.
Exercise Procedure
4. .
Effect of Termination of Employment, Death, Retirement and Total Disability
(a) . Options may vest only while the Participant is actively employed by the Company. Thus, vesting ceases upon the termination of the Participant's active employment with the Company. Only vested options may be exercised. Subject to subparagraphs 4(b), 4(c) and 4(d), all Options shall automatically expire upon, and no Option may be exercised after the earlier of the Expiration Date and the date that is the last trading day on the New York Stock Exchange during the 90-calendar day period after the date the Participant's employment with the Company terminates. It is intended that an authorized leave of absence may extend employment (and thus extend when options may be exercised). However, an authorized leave will not extend the time to exercise options if prohibited by Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and it will not increase vesting.
Termination of Employment
(b) . If the Participant's employment terminates, by reason of the Participant's death or Total Disability (as defined below), then: (i) the portion of the Options that shall vest on the Participant's last day of active employment with the Company will be in proportion to the Participant's active service (measured in calendar days) during the period commencing on the Grant Date and ending on the Vesting Date for the Options (determined separately for the specified number of Options related to each Vesting Date); (ii) the Options (that are vested as provided above) shall continue to become exercisable on the applicable Vesting Date in accordance with this Agreement; and (iii) the Options (that are vested as provided above) may be exercised by the Participant's legal representative (or any person to whom the Options may be transferred by will or the applicable laws of descent and distribution), in the event of death, or the Participant, in the event of Total Disability, in accordance with this Agreement.
Death or Total Disability
(c) . In the event that, prior to the expiration of the Options, the Participant ceases to be an employee of the Company by reason of the Participant's Retirement (as defined below), then the Participant shall continue to be vested with and have the right to exercise those Options which are vested and exercisable as of the Participant's Retirement Date. Any Options which are not vested as of the Participant's Retirement Date shall automatically expire and terminate on the Retirement Date.
Retirement
(d) . In the event the Participant transfers to a Related Entity (as defined below), as a result of actions by PepsiCo, the Options shall become fully vested and exercisable on the date of such transfer and shall otherwise remain outstanding and be exercisable in accordance with this Agreement.
Transfers to a Related Entity
5. .
Prohibited Conduct
(a) The Participant agrees that, at any time prior to the exercise of the Options granted hereunder, and for a period of twenty-four months after the later of (i) completion of all such exercises or (ii) termination of the Participant's employment with the Company for any reason whatsoever (including Retirement or Total Disability), he or she will not engage in any of the following activities anywhere in the world:
(1) . Participant shall not accept any employment, assignment, position or responsibility, or acquire any ownership interest, which involves the Participant's participation in a business entity that markets, sells, distributes or produces Covered Products, unless such business entity makes retail sales or consumes Covered Products without in any way competing with the Company.
Non-Competition
(2) . Participant shall not in any way, directly or indirectly (including through someone else acting on the Participant's recommendation, suggestion, identification or advice), solicit any Company employee to leave the Company's employment or to accept any position with any other entity.
Raiding Employees
(3) . Participant shall not use or disclose to anyone any confidential information regarding the Company other than as necessary in his or her position with the Company. Such confidential information shall include all non-public information the Participant acquired as a result of his or her positions with the Company which might be of any value to a competitor of the Company, or which might cause any economic loss or substantial embarrassment to the Company or its customers, bottlers, distributors or suppliers if used or disclosed. Examples of such confidential information include, without limitation, non-public information about the Company's customers, suppliers, distributors and potential acquisition targets; its business operations and structure; its product lines, formulas and pricing; its processes, machines and inventions; its research and know-how; its financial data; and its plans and strategies.
Non-Disclosure
(4) . Participant shall not engage in any acts that are considered to be contrary to the Company's best interests, including, but not limited to, violating the Company's Code of Conduct, engaging in unlawful trading in the securities of PepsiCo or of any other company based on information gained as a result of his or her employment with the Company, or engaging in any other activity which constitutes gross misconduct.
Misconduct
(b) In the event the Company determines that the Participant has breached any term of this Paragraph 5, in addition to any other remedies the Company may have available to it, the Company may in its sole discretion:
(1) Cancel any unexercised Options granted hereunder; and/or
(2) Require the Participant to pay to the Company all gains realized from the exercise of any Options granted hereunder, which have been exercised within the twelve-month period immediately preceding the date at which the Participant has breached a provision of this Paragraph 5, as determined by the Company.
6. . In the event of any change in the outstanding shares of PepsiCo Common Stock by reason of any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, reorganization, merger, consolidation, combination or exchange of shares, spin-off or other similar corporate change, the number and type of shares which the Participant may purchase pursuant to the Options and the Option Exercise Price at which the Participant may purchase such shares may be adjusted appropriately.
Adjustment for Change in Common Stock
7. . At the date of a Change in Control (as defined in the Plan), all outstanding and unvested Options granted hereunder shall immediately vest and become exercisable, and such Options shall remain outstanding in accordance with their terms. In the event that any Option granted hereunder becomes unexercisable during its term on or after a Change in Control because: (i) the Participant is involuntarily terminated (other than for cause) within two years after the Change in Control; (ii) such Option is terminated or adversely modified; or (iii) PepsiCo Common Stock is no longer issued and outstanding, or no longer traded on a national securities exchange, then the Participant shall immediately be entitled to receive equity ( common stock) of the Acquiring Entity (as defined in the Plan) with a fair market value (taking into account any marketability limitations) equal to the greater of (x) the gain on such Option or (y) the Black-Scholes value of such Option (as determined by a nationally recognized independent investment banker chosen by PepsiCo), in either case calculated on the date such Option becomes unexercisable. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the gain on an Option shall be calculated as the difference between the closing price per share of PepsiCo Common Stock as of the date such Option becomes unexercisable and the Option Exercise Price.
Effect of Change in Control
e.g.,
8. . Unless the Committee specifically determines otherwise: (a) the Options are personal to the Participant and, during his or her lifetime, may be exercised only by the Participant, and (b) the Options shall not be transferable or assignable, other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution, and any such purported transfer or assignment shall be null and void.
Nontransferability
9. . At any time after any Option becomes exercisable, the Committee shall have the right, in its sole discretion and without the consent of the Participant, to cancel such Option and pay to the Participant the difference between the Option Exercise Price and the Fair Market Value of the shares covered by the Option as of the date the Committee gives written notice (the "Buy Out Notice") of its intention to exercise such right. Payments of such buy out amounts pursuant to this provision shall be effected by PepsiCo as promptly as possible after the date of the Buy Out Notice and shall be made in shares of Common Stock. The number of shares shall be determined by dividing the amount of the payment to be made by the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock at the date of the Buy Out Notice, and be rounding up any fractional share to a whole share. Payments of any such buy out amounts shall be made net of the minimum applicable foreign, federal (including FICA), state and local withholding taxes, if any.

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors and shareholders of PepsiCo have approved the 2003 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "Plan"), for the purposes and subject to the provisions set forth in the Plan; and
WHEREAS, pursuant to the authority granted to it in said Plan, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of PepsiCo (the "Committee"), by resolution duly adopted at a meeting held on September 19, 2003, delegated to the Chief Executive Officer of PepsiCo (and his designees) the authority to make retention long-term incentive awards to certain existing or newly hired executives of the Company; and
WHEREAS, awards granted under the Plan are to be evidenced by an Agreement in such form and containing such terms and conditions as the Committee shall determine;
NOW, THEREFORE, it is mutually agreed as follows:
These terms and conditions shall apply with respect to the restricted stock units granted to the Participant as indicated on the Award Summary.
1. . In consideration of the Participant remaining in the employ of the Company, PepsiCo hereby grants to the Participant, on the terms and conditions set forth herein, the number of restricted stock units indicated on the Award Summary (the "Restricted Stock Units").
Grant
2. . Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Restricted Stock Units shall become vested as indicated on the Award Summary (the "Vesting Date") and will be payable as soon as practicable after that date. Restricted Stock Units may vest only while the Participant is actively employed by the Company.
Vesting
3. . Restricted Stock Units that vest and become payable shall be settled in shares of PepsiCo Common Stock with the Participant receiving one share of PepsiCo Common Stock for each vested Restricted Stock Unit. Any amount that the Company may be required to withhold upon the settlement of Restricted Stock Units and/or the payment of dividend equivalents (see Section 5 below) in respect of applicable foreign, federal (including FICA), state and local taxes, must be paid in full at the time of the issuance of shares or payment of cash. Unless the Participant makes other arrangements to satisfy this withholding obligation in accordance with procedures approved by the Company in its discretion, the Company will withhold shares to satisfy the required withholding obligation related to the settlement of Restricted Stock Units.
Payment
4. .
Effect of Termination of Employment, Retirement, Death, and Total Disability
(a) . Restricted Stock Units may vest and become payable only while the Participant is actively employed by the Company. Thus, vesting ceases upon the termination of the Participant's active employment with the Company. Subject to subparagraphs 4(b) and 4(c), all unvested Restricted Stock Units shall automatically be forfeited and canceled upon the date that the Participant's employment with the Company terminates.
Termination of Employment
(b) . If the Participant's employment with the Company terminates by reason of the Participant's death or Total Disability (as defined below), then the whole number of Restricted Stock Units which is in proportion to the Participant's active service (measured in calendar days) during the period commencing on the Grant Date and ending on the Vesting Date shall become fully vested and payable on the date of termination, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
Death or Total Disability
(c) . In the event the Participant transfers to a Related Entity (as defined below), as a result of actions by PepsiCo, the Restricted Stock Units shall become fully vested and payable on the date of such transfer.
Transfers to a Related Entity
(d) . For purposes of clarity of Paragraph 4(a) and not of limitation, in the event that prior to the vesting of the Restricted Stock Units the Participant ceases active employment with the Company by reason of the Participant's Retirement (as defined below), then all unvested Restricted Stock Units shall automatically be forfeited and canceled upon the date that the Participant's employment with the Company terminates.
Retirement
5. . During the vesting period, the Participant shall accumulate dividend equivalents with respect to the Restricted Stock Units, which dividend equivalents shall be paid in cash (without interest) to the Participant only if and when the applicable Restricted Stock Units vest and become payable. Dividend equivalents shall equal the dividends actually paid with respect to PepsiCo Common Stock during the vesting period while (and to the extent) the Restricted Stock Units remain outstanding and unpaid.
Dividend Equivalents
6. .
Prohibited Conduct
(a) The Participant agrees that, at any time prior to the vesting and payment of the Restricted Stock Units granted hereunder, and for a period of twelve months after the later of (i) the vesting and payment of the Restricted Stock Units or (ii) termination of the Participant's employment with the Company for any reason whatsoever (including retirement or Total Disability), he or she will not engage in any of the following activities anywhere in the world:
(1) Non-Competition. Participant shall not accept any employment, assignment, position or responsibility, or acquire any ownership interest, which involves the Participant's Participation in a business entity that markets, sells, distributes or produces Covered Products, unless such business entity makes retail sales or consumes Covered Products without in any way competing with the Company.
