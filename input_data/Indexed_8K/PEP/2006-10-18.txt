Item 8.01 Other Events.
The Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") concluded its examination of PepsiCo, Inc.s ("PepsiCo") consolidated income tax returns for the years 1998 through 2002 and issued a Revenue Agents Report ("RAR") on October 17, 2006. PepsiCo has agreed with all the adjustments of the RAR, with the exception of one matter. The agreed adjustments include transfer pricing and various transactions, such as acquisitions, the public offering of The Pepsi Bottling Group, Inc., as well as the restructuring of our international snack foods operations. Consequently, in the fourth quarter of 2006, PepsiCo expects to record a non-cash tax benefit of approximately $600 million, which represents the reversal of tax reserves following the issuance of the RAR. This Current Report on Form 8-K contains statements concerning PepsiCos expectations for future performance. Any such forward-looking statements are inherently speculative and are based on currently available information, operating plans and projec tions about future events and trends. As such, they are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. Actual results and performance may be significantly different from expectations. PepsiCo undertakes no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. Please see PepsiCos filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, for a discussion of specific risks that may affect performance.
