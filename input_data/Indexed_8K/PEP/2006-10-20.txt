Item 2.05 Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.
On October 20, 2006, PepsiCo, Inc. announced that it is consolidating the manufacturing network at its Frito-Lay North America ("FLNA") division from 34 sites to 32 sites, and rationalizing other assets, to increase manufacturing productivity and supply chain efficiencies. As a result, FLNA will be closing two of its older plants, located in Lubbock, Texas and Honolulu, Hawaii. Timing of the plant closures will vary by location over the next several weeks, and is expected to be largely complete by the end of this year. A total of 387 jobs will be eliminated at the Lubbock and Honolulu facilities. As a result of this action, PepsiCo, Inc. expects to incur a pre-tax charge of approximately $66 million, comprised of approximately $43 million of asset impairments, $12 million of severance and other employee costs and $11 million of other costs. The employee and other costs portion will be paid in cash in the fourth quarter of 2006 and during 2007.

Exhibit 99.1
PepsiCo Reaffirms Confidence in Business Outlook and Updates 2006 Earnings Guidance to Reflect Impacts of Recent Tax Settlement and Fourth Quarter Restructuring Action
Purchase, N.Y., October 20, 2006, PepsiCo today reaffirmed its confidence in the company's business outlook and updated its full-year guidance to reflect the impacts of a recently concluded Internal Revenue Service audit settlement and of a restructuring action the company is taking in the fourth quarter.
Earlier this week, the company announced that, as a result of a recently completed IRS audit, the company expected to record in the fourth quarter of 2006 a non-cash tax benefit of approximately $600 million, or $0.36 per share.
Earlier today, the company announced that it is consolidating the manufacturing network at its Frito-Lay North America division from 34 sites to 32 sites to increase manufacturing productivity and supply chain efficiencies. The financial impact of the action is expected to result in a predominantly non-cash, pretax charge of approximately $66 million, or $0.03 cents per share in the fourth quarter.
As a result of this week's announcements, the company stated it now expects 2006 reported earnings per share of at least $3.31 per share, and reaffirmed its earlier full-year 2006 guidance of core earnings per share of at least $2.98.
The company also reaffirmed its full-year 2006 cash flow guidance of approximately $6.2 billion in cash from operating activities, $2.2 billion in capital spending and $3 billion in share repurchases.
Estimated Core EPS is not a measure defined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). However, we believe investors should consider this measure as it is consistent with how management evaluates the company's operational results and trends.
