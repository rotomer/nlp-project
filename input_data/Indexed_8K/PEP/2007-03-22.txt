Item 8.01. Other Events
Effective December 31, 2006 (the beginning of PepsiCo's 2007 fiscal year), the reporting calendars of certain operating units within PepsiCo International's ("PI") reporting segment were changed such that most PI operations will now report on a monthly calendar basis instead of a period reporting basis. Monthly reporting is preferable for our international businesses to facilitate local statutory reporting, which is generally based on monthly calendars. The change in reporting will substantially reduce the number of financial closings and reconciliations executed by the international operations, improving overall efficiency.
In addition, effective December 31, 2006, income for certain non-consolidated international bottling interests was reclassified from "bottling equity income" and "corporate unallocated" results to PI's division operating results, to be consistent with PepsiCo's internal management accountability.
In order to provide a basis for comparison between results for fiscal quarters in 2006 and forthcoming 2007 fiscal quarterly results, Table 1 below (pages 3-4) provides selected financial information for each of our 2006 fiscal quarters, reflecting the changes described above. Table 2 below (pages 5-6) provides selected financial information excluding the impact of certain items in 2006 and Table 3 below (pages 7-8) provides the reconciliation of this information with the most directly comparable financial measures in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The changes described above have no impact on our full year 2006 net income. These changes will be reflected in all prior periods presented in future filings of our financial statements. The information provided herein does not impact an investor's ability to rely on any of our previously issued financial statements.
The information in this Item 8.01 is being furnished and shall not be deemed "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that Section. The information in this Item 8.01 shall not be incorporated by reference into any registration statement or other document pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, except as otherwise expressly stated in such filing. Please see our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K, for further information on our financial results.

In 2006, we recorded non-cash tax benefits of $602 million ("2006 Tax Adjustments"), substantially all of which related to the Internal Revenue Service's (IRS) examination of our consolidated income tax returns for the years 1998 through 2002. In 2006, PBG also recorded non-cash tax benefits in connection with the IRS's examination of certain of their consolidated income tax returns. We recorded our share of these tax benefits in bottling equity income in the fourth quarter of 2006. In addition, in 2006, we recorded restructuring and impairment charges in conjunction with consolidating the manufacturing network at Frito-Lay North America by closing two plants in the U.S., and rationalizing other assets, to increase manufacturing productivity and supply chain efficiencies.
The financial measures listed below are not measures defined by GAAP. However, we believe investors should consider these measures as they are more indicative of our ongoing performance. Specifically, investors should consider the following with respect to our quarterly and full year results:
Operating Profit Reconciliation
Bottling Equity Income Reconciliation
Net Income Reconciliation
