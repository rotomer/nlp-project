The Dealers:

United States
The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act, and may not be offered or sold within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons except in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act or pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act. Each Dealer represents and agrees that it has offered, sold and delivered any Notes, and will offer, sell and deliver any Notes (1) as part of their distribution at any time and (ii) otherwise until 40 days after the completion of the distribution of all Notes of the Tranche of which such Notes are a part, as determined and notified as provided below, only in accordance with Rule 903 of Regulation S under the Securities Act. Accordingly, each Dealer further represents and agrees that it, its affiliates and any persons acting on its or their behalf have not engaged and will not engage in any directed selling efforts with respect to any Note, and it and they have complied and will comply with the offering restrictions requirement of Regulation S under the Securities Act. Each Dealer who has purchased Notes of a Tranche hereunder (or in the case of a sale of a Tranche of Notes issued to or through more than one Dealer, each of such Dealers as to the Notes of such Tranche purchased by or through it or, in the case of a syndicated issue, the relevant Lead Manager) shall determine and notify to the Agent the completion of the distribution of the Notes of such Tranche. On the basis of such notification or notifications, the Agent agrees to notify such Dealer/Lead Manager of the end of the distribution compliance period with respect to such Tranche. Each Dealer also agrees that, at or prior to confirmation of sale of Notes, it will have sent to each distributor, dealer or person receiving a selling concession, fee or other remuneration that purchases Notes from it during the distribution compliance period a confirmation or notice to substantially the following effect:
"The Securities covered hereby have not been registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the ) and may not be offered or sold within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons (i) as part of their distribution at any time or (ii) otherwise until 40 days after the completion of the distribution of the Securities as determined and notified by the Agent for the Securities to [name of Dealer(s)/Lead Manager], except in either case in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act. Terms used above have the meanings given to them by Regulation S under the Securities Act.".
Securities Act
Terms used in this Clause 1 have the meanings given to them by Regulation S.
In addition (unless the applicable Final Terms specifies otherwise):
 
Terms used in this clause have the meanings given to them by the U.S. Internal Revenue Code and regulations thereunder, including the D Rules. Whether or not an offer, sale or delivery is treated as made within the United States or its possessions or to a United States person will depend upon application of the D Rules.
Each issue of Indexed Notes or Dual Currency Notes shall be subject to such additional U.S. selling restrictions as the Issuer and the relevant Dealer may agree as a term of the issue and purchase of such Notes, which additional selling restrictions shall be set out in the Final Terms. Each relevant Dealer agrees that it shall offer, sell and deliver such Notes only in compliance with such additional U.S. selling restrictions.
European Economic Area
In relation to each Member State of the European Economic Area which has implemented the Prospectus Directive (each, a "Relevant Member State"), each Dealer has represented and agreed, and each further Dealer appointed under the Programme will be required to represent and agree, that with effect from and including the date on which the Prospectus Directive is implemented in that Relevant Member State (the "Relevant Implementation Date") it has not made and will not make an offer of Notes to the public in that Relevant Member State, except that it may, with effect from and including the Relevant Implementation Date, make an offer of Notes to the public in that Relevant Member State.
 
For the purposes of this provision, the expression an "offer of Notes to the public" in relation to any Notes in any Relevant Member State means the communication in any form and by any means of sufficient information on the terms of the offer and the Notes to be offered so as to enable an investor to decide to purchase or subscribe the Notes, as the same may be varied in that Member State by any measure implementing the Prospectus Directive in that Member State and the expression "Prospectus Directive" means Directive 2003/71 /EC and includes any relevant implementing measure in each Relevant Member State.
United Kingdom
Each Dealer has represented and agreed and each further Dealer appointed under the Programme will be required to represent and agree that:
 
Japan
The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities and Exchange Law of Japan (the "Securities and Exchange Law") and each Dealer has agreed and each further Dealer appointed under the Programme will be required to agree that it will not offer or sell any Notes, directly or indirectly, in Japan or to, or for the benefit of, any resident of Japan (which term as used herein means any person resident in Japan, including any corporation or other entity organised under the laws of Japan), or to others for reoffering or resale, directly or indirectly, in Japan or to a resident of Japan except pursuant to an exemption which will result in compliance with the Securities and Exchange Law and any other applicable laws and regulations of Japan.
General
Each Dealer has agreed and each further Dealer appointed under the Programme will be required to agree that it will comply with all applicable securities laws and regulations in force in any jurisdiction in which it purchases, offers, sells or delivers Notes or possesses or distributes this Prospectus and will obtain any consent, approval or permission required by it for the purchase, offer, sale or delivery by it of Notes under the laws and regulations in force in any jurisdiction to which it is subject or in which it makes such purchases, offers, sales or deliveries and neither the Issuer nor any other Dealer shall have any responsibility therefor.
Neither the Issuer nor any of the Dealers represents that Notes may at any time lawfully be sold in compliance with any applicable registration or other requirements in any jurisdiction, or pursuant to any exemption available thereunder, or assumes any responsibility for facilitating such sale.
With regard to each Tranche, the relevant Dealer(s) will be required to comply with such other additional restrictions as the Issuer and the relevant Dealer(s) shall agree and as shall be set out in the applicable Final Terms.
 
1. The Issuer has authorized the execution, delivery and performance of each of the Programme Agreement, the Agency Agreement, and the Deed of Covenant (together, the "Principal Agreements") and the Notes by all necessary corporate action. The Principal Agreements and those notes that have been sold have been duly executed and delivered.
2. The execution and delivery of and performance by the Issuer of its obligations under the Principal Agreements and the Notes, when issued, will not contravene any provision of the Restated Charter or By-Laws of the Issuer, or of any agreement or other instrument binding upon the Issuer or any of its subsidiaries that is material to the Issuer and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, or, to my knowledge, of any judgment, order, or decree of any governmental body, agency, or court having jurisdiction over the Issuer or any of its subsidiaries, in each of the foregoing cases except as would be reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition or results of operations of the Issuer and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole.
3. To my knowledge, there is no legal or governmental proceeding pending or threatened to which the Issuer or any of its significant subsidiaries is a party, or by which any of the properties of the Issuer or its significant subsidiaries is bound, which would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition or results of operations of the Issuer and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole.
