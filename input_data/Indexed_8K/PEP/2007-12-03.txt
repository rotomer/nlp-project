PepsiCo has filed with the SEC a prospectus supplement, dated November 29, 2007, together with the accompanying prospectus, dated May 2, 2006, relating to the offering and sale of the Notes.
The Notes are expected to be issued on December 4, 2007 pursuant to an Indenture (the "Indenture") dated as of May 21, 2007 between PepsiCo and The Bank of New York, as Trustee. The Notes will bear interest at the rate of 4.65% per year, with interest payable on February 15 and August 15 of each year, beginning on August 15, 2008 and will mature on February 15, 2013. The Notes are not redeemable and will be unsecured obligations of PepsiCo and will rank equally with all of PepsiCo's unsecured senior indebtedness. The Indenture also contains customary event of default provisions.

Section 12
Indemnification and Contribution.
(a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold each Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, harmless from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, or liabilities to which such Underwriter come subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, or any other federal or state law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages, or liabilities (and actions in respect thereof) arise out of, are based upon, or are caused by any untrue statement or allegedly untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus, or the Prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of, are based upon or are caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and the Company agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party for any reasonable legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability, or action; , that the Company will not be liable to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of, are based upon, or are caused by any such untrue statement or omission or allegedly untrue statement or omission included in or omitted from the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished by the Underwriters in writing expressly for use in the Registration Statement or such preliminary prospectus or the Time of Sale Prospectus or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto.
provided, however
(b) Each Underwriter severally agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers who sign the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to the Underwriters, but only with respect to such losses, claims, damages, and liabilities (and actions in respect thereof) that arise out of, are based upon, or are caused by any untrue statement or omission of a material fact or allegedly untrue statement or omission of a material fact included in or omitted from the Registration Statement, or any preliminary prospectus or the Time of Sale Prospectus or the Prospectus in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished by the Underwriters in writing expressly for use in the Registration Statement or such preliminary prospectus or the Time of Sale Prospectus or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto.
(c) In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to either paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 12, such person (the "") will promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "") in writing and the indemnifying party, upon request of the indemnified party, will retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and will pay the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party will have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel will be borne by the indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and, in the judgment of the indemnified party, representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood that the indemnifying party will not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified parties and that all such reasonable fees and expenses will be reimbursed as they are incurred. Such firm will be designated in writing by the Underwriters (in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section 12) or by the Company (in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section 12), as the case may be. The indemnifying party will not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent, or if there shall be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. No indemnifying party will, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding. Any provision of this paragraph (c) to the contrary notwithstanding, no failure by an indemnified party to notify the indemnifying party as required hereunder
indemnified party
indemnifying party
will relieve the indemnifying party from any liability it may have had to an indemnified party otherwise than under this Section 12 to the extent the indemnifying party is not materially prejudiced as a result thereof and in any event shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement.
(d) If the indemnification provided for in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 12 is unavailable to an indemnified party or is insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages, or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying the indemnified party thereunder, will contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages, or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other, from the offering of the Underwritten Securities pursuant to the applicable Terms Agreement, or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other, in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages, or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other, in connection with the offering of the Underwritten Securities pursuant to the applicable Terms Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of such Underwritten Securities (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total underwriting discount received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate initial public offering price of such Underwritten Securities as set forth on such cover. The relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and of the Underwriters, on the other, will be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or allegedly untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied or to be supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information, and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 12(d) are several in proportion to the number of Underwritten Securities set forth opposite their respective names in the applicable Terms Agreement, and not joint.
(e) The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to paragraph (d) above were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to therein. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, and liabilities referred to in paragraph (d) above will be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any reasonable legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Any other provisions of this Section 12 to the contrary notwithstanding, (i) the Underwriters will not be required to contribute to the Company any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Underwritten Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission (other than in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished to the Company by the Underwriters in writing expressly for use in the Registration Statement, the preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto), and (ii) no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) will be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
(f) The remedies provided for in this Section 12 are not exclusive and will not limit any rights or remedies that may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.
The applicable Terms Agreement will automatically terminate upon the expiration of the offering to which the Prospectus relates. The applicable Terms Agreement may not be terminated by the Underwriters prior to delivery of and payment for such Securities except upon the failure of any of the conditions precedent described in Section 6 hereof.
Section 13

The foregoing notwithstanding, copies of any Terms Agreement and of any certificate or opinion to be delivered by the Company to the Underwriters under paragraphs 5(a), 5(c) or 5(d) hereof will be deemed delivered if executed by all required signatories and telecopied to the Company and/or the Underwriters, as the case may be, with receipt confirmed in writing (by telecopied facsimile or otherwise). In the event that any Terms Agreement or any such certificate or opinion is delivered via telecopier as contemplated in the preceding sentence, the parties will use best efforts to ensure that "original" copies of such documents will be distributed promptly thereafter.

No other person will have any right or obligation hereunder. No party to the applicable Terms Agreement may assign its rights thereunder without the written consent of the other parties.
Section 16
. Successors; Non-transferability.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have acted as special counsel for PepsiCo, Inc. (the "Company"), a North Carolina corporation, in connection with the Terms Agreement dated November 29, 2007 (incorporating the Underwriting Agreement Standard Provisions dated November 29, 2007) (the "Terms Agreement" and together with the Standard Provisions, the "Underwriting Agreement") among the Company and you, as representatives of the several underwriters named therein (the "Underwriters"), under which you and the other Underwriters have severally agreed to purchase from the Company $1,000,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 4.65% Senior Notes due 2013 (the "Notes"). The Notes are to be issued pursuant to the provisions of an Indenture dated as of May 21, 2007 (the "Indenture") between the Company and The Bank of New York, as Trustee. This opinion is furnished to you at the request of the Company pursuant to Section 5(a) of the Underwriting Agreement.
We have examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of such documents, corporate records, certificates of public officials and other instruments as we have deemed necessary or advisable for the purpose of rendering this opinion.
We have participated in the preparation of the Company's registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-133735) (other than the documents incorporated by reference
therein (the "Incorporated Documents")) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") pursuant to the provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), relating to the registration of securities (the "Shelf Securities") to be issued from time to time by the Company, the preliminary prospectus supplement dated November 29, 2007 relating to the Notes, the free writing prospectus set forth in Schedule II to the Underwriting Agreement (the "Issuer Free Writing Prospectus") and the prospectus supplement dated November 29, 2007 relating to the Notes (the "Prospectus Supplement"), and have reviewed the Incorporated Documents. The registration statement became effective under the Act upon the filing of the registration statement with the Commission on May 2, 2006 pursuant to Rule 462(e) under the Act. The registration statement at the date of the Underwriting Agreement, including the Incorporated Documents and the information deemed to be part of the registration statement at the time of effectiveness pursuant to Rule 430B under the Act, is hereinafter referred to as the "Registration Statement," and the related prospectus (including the Incorporated Documents) dated May 2, 2006 relating to the Shelf Securities is hereinafter referred to as the "Basic Prospectus." The Basic Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, in the form first used to confirm sales of the Notes (or in the form first made available by the Company to the Underwriters to meet requests of purchasers of the Notes under Rule 173 under the Act), is hereinafter referred to as the "Prospectus."
We have assumed the conformity of the documents filed with the Commission via the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval System ("EDGAR"), except for required EDGAR formatting changes, to physical copies of the documents submitted for our examination.
Based upon the foregoing, we are of the opinion that:
1. The Indenture has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, and assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by the Company, the Indenture is a valid and binding agreement of the Company, enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and equitable principles of general applicability.
2. Assuming the due authorization of the Notes by the Company, the Notes, when executed and authenticated in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture and delivered to and paid for by the Underwriters pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, will be valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and equitable principles of general applicability, and will be entitled to the benefits of the Indenture pursuant to which such Notes are to be issued.
3. No consent, approval, authorization, or order of, or qualification with, any governmental body or agency under the laws of the State of New York or any federal law of the United States of America that in our experience is normally applicable to transactions of the type contemplated by the Indenture, the Notes and the Underwriting Agreement (collectively, the "Documents") is
required for the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of its obligations under the Documents, except such as may be required under federal or state securities or Blue Sky laws as to which we express no opinion in this paragraph (3).
4. Any required filing of the Prospectus pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Act has been made in the manner and within the time period required by Rule 424(b); any required filing of the Issuer Free Writing Prospectus pursuant to Rule 433 under the Act has been made in the manner and within the time period required by Rule 433(d); and, to our knowledge, no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued under the Act and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or are pending or threatened by the Commission.
We have considered the statements included in the Prospectus under the captions "Description of Notes" and "Description of Debt Securities" insofar as they summarize provisions of the Indenture and the Notes (the "Offering Summary") and under the caption "Material United States Federal Tax Considerations" (the "Tax Considerations Summary"). In our opinion, the Offering Summary fairly summarizes the above-mentioned provisions in all material respects and the Tax Considerations Summary is accurate, subject to the conditions and limitations set forth therein.
In rendering the opinions in paragraphs (1) through (3) above, we have assumed that each party to the Documents has been duly incorporated and is validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization. In addition, we have assumed that the execution, delivery and performance by each party thereto of each Document to which it is a party, (i) are within its corporate powers, (ii) do not contravene, or constitute a default under, the certificate of incorporation or bylaws or other constitutive documents of such party, (iii) other than as expressly covered in paragraph (3) above in respect of the Company, require no action by or in respect of, or filing with, any governmental body, agency or official and (iv) do not contravene, or constitute a default under, any provision of applicable law or regulation or any judgment, injunction, order or decree or any agreement or other instrument binding upon such party, and that each Document is a valid, binding and enforceable agreement of each party thereto, other than the Company.
We are members of the Bar of the State of New York, and the foregoing opinion is limited to the laws of the State of New York and the federal laws of the United States of America. Insofar as the foregoing opinion involves matters governed by the laws of the State of North Carolina, we have relied without independent investigation on the opinion of Womble Carlyle Sandridge & Rice, PLLC delivered to you today pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement.
This opinion is rendered solely to you and the other several Underwriters in connection with the Underwriting Agreement. This opinion may not be relied upon by you for any other purpose or relied upon by any other person (including any person acquiring Notes from the several Underwriters) or furnished to any other person without our prior written consent.

Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated
UBS Securities LLC
as Representatives of the several Underwriters named in the Underwriting Agreement referred to below
 
1585 Broadway
New York, New York 10036
Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have acted as special counsel for PepsiCo, Inc. (the "Company"), a North Carolina corporation, in connection with the Terms Agreement dated November 29, 2007 (incorporating the Underwriting Agreement Standard Provisions dated November 29, 2007) (the "Terms Agreement" and together with the Standard Provisions, the "Underwriting Agreement") among the Company and you, as representatives of the several underwriters named therein (the "Underwriters"), under which you and the other Underwriters have severally agreed to purchase from the Company $1,000,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 4.65% Senior Notes due 2013 (the "Notes"). The Notes are to be issued pursuant to the provisions of an Indenture dated as of May 21, 2007 (the "Indenture") between the Company and The Bank of New York, as Trustee (the "Trustee"). This opinion is furnished to you at the request of the Company pursuant to Section 5(a) of the Underwriting Agreement.
We have participated in the preparation of the Company's registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-133735) (other than the documents incorporated by reference therein (the "Incorporated Documents")) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") pursuant to the provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), relating to the registration of securities (the "Shelf Securities") to be issued from time to time by the Company, the preliminary prospectus supplement dated November 29, 2007 (the "Preliminary Prospectus Supplement") relating to the Notes, the free writing prospectus set forth in Schedule II to the Underwriting Agreement and the prospectus supplement dated November 29, 2007 relating to the Notes (the
"Prospectus Supplement"), and have reviewed the Incorporated Documents. The registration statement became effective under the Act upon the filing of the registration statement with the Commission on May 2, 2006 pursuant to Rule 462(e) under the Act. The registration statement at the date of the Underwriting Agreement, including the Incorporated Documents and the information deemed to be part of the registration statement at the time of effectiveness pursuant to Rule 430B under the Act, is hereinafter referred to as the "Registration Statement," and the related prospectus (including the Incorporated Documents) dated May 2, 2006 relating to the Shelf Securities is hereinafter referred to as the "Basic Prospectus." The Basic Prospectus, as supplemented by the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement, together with the free writing prospectus set forth in Schedule II to the Underwriting Agreement for the Notes are hereinafter referred to as the "Disclosure Package." The Basic Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, in the form first used to confirm sales of the Notes (or in the form first made available by the Company to the Underwriters to meet requests of purchasers of the Notes under Rule 173 under the Act), is hereinafter referred to as the "Prospectus."
We have assumed the conformity of the documents filed with the Commission via the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval System ("EDGAR"), except for required EDGAR formatting changes, to physical copies of the documents submitted for our examination.
We note that many determinations involved in the preparation of the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus are of a wholly or partially non-legal character or relate to legal matters outside the scope of our opinion separately delivered to you today in respect of certain matters under the laws of the State of New York and the federal laws of the United States of America. As a result, we are not passing upon, and do not assume any responsibility for, the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, and we have not ourselves checked the accuracy, completeness or fairness of, or otherwise verified, the information furnished in such documents (except to the extent expressly set forth in our opinion letter separately delivered to you today as to statements included in the Prospectus under the captions "Description of Notes," "Material United States Federal Tax Considerations" and "Description of Debt Securities"). However, in the course of our acting as counsel to the Company in connection with the preparation of the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, we have generally reviewed and discussed with your representatives and your counsel and with certain officers and employees of, and independent public accountants for, the Company the information furnished, whether or not subject to our check and verification. We have also reviewed and relied upon certain corporate records and documents, letters from counsel and accountants and oral and written statements of officers and other representatives of the Company and others as to the existence and consequence of certain factual and other matters.
On the basis of the information gained in the course of the performance of the services rendered above, but without independent check or verification except as stated above:
(i) the Registration Statement and the Prospectus appear on their face to be appropriately responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the Act and the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder; and
(ii) nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that, insofar as relevant to the offering of the Notes:

I have examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to my satisfaction, of such documents, corporate records, certificates of public officials and other instruments as I have deemed necessary for the purposes of rendering this opinion. I have assumed the capacity of all natural persons and the genuineness of all signatures.
Based upon the foregoing, I am of the opinion that:
1. The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of its obligations under the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture and the Notes will not contravene any provision of the Restated Charter or By-Laws of the Company, or of any agreement or other instrument binding upon the Company or any of its subsidiaries that is material to the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, or, to my knowledge, of any judgment, order, or decree of any governmental body, agency, or court having
jurisdiction over the Company or any of its subsidiaries, in each of the foregoing cases except as would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole.
2. To my knowledge, there is no legal or governmental proceeding pending or threatened to which the Company or any of its significant subsidiaries is a party, or by which any of the properties of the Company or its significant subsidiaries is bound, which would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole; and to my knowledge, there is no agreement or other document that is required to be described in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus, or that is required to be filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement, that is not so described or filed.
In rendering such opinion, I may rely, as to matters of fact, to the extent I deem proper, on certificates of responsible officers of the Company and public officials. Such opinion will be limited to the laws of the State of New York and the federal laws of the United States of America. Insofar as such opinion involves matters governed by the laws of North Carolina, I am relying, with your permission without independent investigation, on the opinion of North Carolina counsel for the Company.
This opinion is rendered solely to you in connection with the above matter at the request of the Company. This opinion may not be relied upon by you for any other purpose or relied upon by or furnished to any other person without our prior written consent.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have acted as special North Carolina counsel to PepsiCo, Inc., a North Carolina corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the Terms Agreement dated November 29, 2007 (incorporating by reference the Underwriting Agreement Standard Provisions (the "Standard Provisions") dated November 29, 2007) (the "Terms Agreement" and, together with the Standard Provisions, the "Underwriting Agreement") between the Company and you, as representatives of the several underwriters named in the Underwriting Agreement (the "Underwriters"), under which you and the other Underwriters have severally agreed to purchase from the Company $1,000,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 4.65% Senior Notes Due 2013 (the "Notes"). The Notes are to be issued pursuant to the provisions of an indenture dated as of May 21, 2007 between the Company and The Bank of New York, as trustee (the "Indenture"). This opinion is delivered to you pursuant to Section 5(a) of the Standard Provisions. Capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined in this opinion have the meanings given to them in the Underwriting Agreement.
As the Company's special North Carolina counsel, we have reviewed the Company's articles of incorporation and by-laws, each as amended to date, and the Underwriting Agreement, and have examined the originals, or copies certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of corporate records, certificates of public officials and of representatives of the Company, statutes and other instruments and documents, as a basis for the opinions hereinafter expressed. In rendering this opinion, we have relied upon certificates of public officials and representatives of the Company with respect to the accuracy of the factual matters contained in such certificates.
In connection with such review, we have assumed with your permission (a) that the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture and all other documents that are the subject of this opinion or on which this opinion is based (the "Transaction Documents") have been properly authorized, executed and delivered by each of the respective parties thereto other than the Company; (b) the genuineness of all signatures and the legal capacity of all signatories; (c) the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals and the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as certified or photostatic copies; (d) the proper issuance and accuracy of certificates of public officials and representatives of the Company; (e) the due authentication of the Notes in accordance with the Indenture and payment by the Underwriters of the purchase price for the Notes in accordance with the Underwriting Agreement; and (f) the truth and accuracy of the representations, warranties and covenants of the Underwriters set forth in the Underwriting Agreement.
This opinion is limited to the laws of the State of North Carolina, excluding local laws of the State of North Carolina (, the statutes and ordinances, the administrative decisions and the rules and regulations of counties, towns, municipalities and special political subdivisions of, or authorities or quasi-governmental bodies constituted under the laws of, the State of North Carolina and judicial decisions to the extent they deal with any of the foregoing) and the securities or Blue Sky laws of the State of North Carolina, and we are expressing no opinion as to the effect of the laws of any other jurisdiction.
i.e.
The opinion in paragraph 1 relating to the existence of the Company in the State of North Carolina is given solely in reliance on a certificate of existence issued by the Secretary of State of the State of North Carolina dated December 4, 2007.
Based on and subject to the foregoing and the qualifications and limitations set forth below, and having regard for such legal considerations as we deem relevant, it is our opinion that:
1. The Company is a corporation in existence under the laws of the State of North Carolina, with corporate power to conduct its business as described in the Time of Sale Prospectus and the Prospectus.
2. The Company has authorized by all necessary corporate action the execution and delivery of the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture and the Notes.
3. The Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture and the Notes have been duly executed by the Company.
4. The execution and delivery of and performance by the Company of its obligations under the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture and the Notes do not violate any provision of the articles of incorporation or by-laws of the Company.
5. No consent, approval, authorization, or order of or qualification with any North Carolina governmental body or agency is required to be obtained or made by the Company for the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Underwriting Agreement or the issuance of the Notes, except as may be required by the
Blue Sky or other securities laws if the Notes are offered or sold in North Carolina and except for consents, approvals, authorizations, actions, filings and registrations which, if not obtained or made, are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole.
Nothing contained in this opinion letter shall be construed as an opinion as to the enforceability of the Transaction Documents or as an opinion as to whether the authorization of the delivery and execution of the Indenture and the Notes, and the execution of the Indenture and the Notes, comply with applicable provisions of such instruments and of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended. This opinion letter is delivered solely for your benefit in connection with the Underwriting Agreement and the transactions provided for therein and may not be quoted in whole or in part, referred to, filed with any governmental agency or otherwise used or relied upon by any other person or for any other purpose without our prior written consent.
This opinion is rendered as of the date hereof, and we undertake no obligation to advise you of any changes in applicable law or any other matters that may come to our attention after the date hereof.
