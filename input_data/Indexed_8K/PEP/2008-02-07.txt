Exhibit 10.1
These Terms and Conditions, along with the PepsiCo Annual Long-Term Incentive Award Summary (the "Award Summary") delivered herewith and signed by the individual named on the Award Summary (the "Participant") shall constitute an Agreement made as of the Grant Date (as indicated on the Award Summary), by and between PepsiCo, Inc., a North Carolina corporation having its principal office at 700 Anderson Hill Road, Purchase, New York 10577 ("PepsiCo," and with its divisions and direct and indirect subsidiaries, the "Company"), and the Participant.
WHEREAS, the Board of Directors and shareholders of PepsiCo have approved the PepsiCo, Inc. 2007 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "Plan"), for the purposes and subject to the provisions set forth in the Plan; and
WHEREAS, pursuant to the authority granted to it in the Plan, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of PepsiCo (the "Committee"), by resolution duly adopted at a meeting held on or prior to the Grant Date, authorized the grant to the Participant of the stock options and/or restricted stock units set forth on the Award Summary; and
WHEREAS, awards granted under the Plan are to be evidenced by an Agreement in such form and containing such terms and conditions as the Committee shall determine.
NOW, THEREFORE, it is mutually agreed as follows:
A. . These terms and conditions shall apply with respect to the stock options, if any, granted to the Participant as indicated on the Award Summary.
Terms and Conditions Applicable to Stock Options
1. . In consideration of the Participant remaining in the employ of the Company, PepsiCo hereby grants to the Participant, on the terms and conditions set forth herein, the right and option to purchase the number of shares of PepsiCo Common Stock, par value $.0167 per share, indicated on the Award Summary, at the Grant/Exercise Price per share indicated on the Award Summary (the "Option Exercise Price"), which was the Fair Market Value (as defined below) of PepsiCo Common Stock on the Grant Date. The right to purchase each such share is referred to herein as an "Option." All Options granted hereunder shall be "Non-Qualified Stock Options" as defined in the Plan.
Grant
2.  . Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Options shall become fully vested on the vesting date set forth in the Award Summary (the "Vesting Date") and shall be exercisable from the Vesting Date through the expiration date set forth in the Award Summary (the "Expiration Date"). Options may vest only while the Participant is actively employed by the Company. Once vested and exercisable, and until terminated, all or any portion of the Options may be exercised from time to time and at any time under procedures that the Committee or its delegate shall establish from time to time, including, without limitation, procedures regarding the frequency of exercise and the minimum number of Options which may be exercised at any time.
Vesting and Exercisability
3. . Subject to terms and conditions set forth herein, Options may be exercised by giving written notice of exercise to PepsiCo in the manner specified from time to time by PepsiCo. The aggregate Option Exercise Price for the shares being purchased, together with any amount which the Company may be required to withhold upon such exercise in respect of applicable foreign, federal (including FICA), state and local taxes, must be paid in full at the time of issuance of such shares.
Exercise Procedure
4. .
Effect of Termination of Employment, Death, Retirement and Total Disability
(a) . Options may vest only while the Participant is actively employed by the Company. Thus, no vesting shall occur following the termination of the Participant's active employment with the Company, and all unvested Options shall automatically be forfeited and cancelled upon the date that the Participant's active employment with the Company terminates. Only vested Options may be exercised. Subject to subparagraphs 4(b), 4(c) and 4(d), vested Options shall be exercisable until, and shall automatically be forfeited and cancelled upon, the earlier of the Expiration Date and the date that is the last trading day on the New York Stock Exchange during the 90-calendar day period after the date the Participant's employment with the Company terminates. It is intended that an authorized leave of absence may extend employment for purposes of determining the period when vested Options may be exercised. However, an authorized leave of absence will not be treated as active employment, and, as a result, vesting of unvested Options will not be extended by any such period.
Termination of Employment
(b) . If the Participant's employment terminates prior to the Vesting Date, by reason of the Participant's Retirement (as defined below) prior to attaining at least age 62, then: (i) a portion of the Options shall vest on the Participant's last day of active employment with the Company, with such portion determined in proportion to the Participant's active service (measured in calendar days) during the period commencing on the Grant Date and ending on the Vesting Date; (ii) the Options shall continue to become exercisable in accordance with Paragraph A.2 of this Agreement, with no change in the earliest date of exercise as a result of the vesting provided by this subparagraph 4(b); and (iii) the Options may be exercised by the Participant prior to the Expiration Date in accordance with this Agreement.
Retirement Prior to Age 62
(c) . If the Participant's employment terminates by reason of the Participant's death, Total Disability (as defined below), or Retirement after attaining at least age 62, then: (i) the Options shall become fully vested on the Participant's last day of active employment with the Company (which, for purposes of Total Disability, means the effective date of Total Disability); (ii) the Options shall continue to become exercisable in accordance with Paragraph A.2 of this Agreement, with no change in the earliest date of exercise as a result of the vesting provided by this subparagraph 4(c); and (iii) the Options may be exercised by the Participant's legal representative (or any person to whom the Options may be transferred by will or the applicable laws of descent and distribution), in the event of death, or the Participant, in the event of Retirement or Total Disability, prior to the Expiration Date in accordance with this Agreement.
Death, Total Disability, or Retirement on or After Age 62
(d) . In the event the Participant transfers to a Related Entity (as defined below), as a result of actions by PepsiCo, the Options shall become fully vested on the date of such transfer and shall become exercisable as soon as practicable thereafter and shall otherwise remain outstanding and be exercisable in accordance with this Agreement.
Transfers to a Related Entity
5. . Except as provided in Paragraph C.3, at any time after any Option becomes exercisable, the Committee shall have the right, in its sole discretion and without the consent of the Participant, to cancel such Option and to cause PepsiCo to pay to the Participant the excess of the Fair Market Value of the shares of Common Stock covered by such Option over the Option Exercise Price of such Option as of the date the Committee provides written notice (the "Buy Out Notice") of its intention to exercise such right. Payments of such buy out amounts pursuant to this provision shall be effected by PepsiCo as promptly as possible after the date of the Buy Out Notice and shall be made in shares of Common Stock. The number of shares shall be determined by dividing the amount of the payment to be made by the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock at the date of the Buy Out Notice, and by rounding up any fractional share to a whole share. Payments of any such buy out amounts shall be made net of the minimum applicable foreign, federal (including FICA), state and local withholding taxes, if any.
Buy-Out of Option Gains
6. . The Participant shall have no rights as a holder of PepsiCo Common Stock with respect to the Options granted hereunder unless and until such Options are exercised and the shares have been registered in the Participant's name as owner.
No Rights as Shareholder
B. . These terms and conditions shall apply with respect to the restricted stock units, if any, granted to the Participant as indicated on the Award Summary.
Terms and Conditions Applicable to Restricted Stock Units
1. . In consideration of the Participant remaining in the employ of the Company, PepsiCo hereby grants to the Participant, on the terms and conditions set forth herein, the number of restricted stock units indicated on the Award Summary (the "Restricted Stock Units").
Grant
2. . Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein and subparagraphs 2(a) and (b) below, the Restricted Stock Units shall become fully vested on the Vesting Date and shall be payable as soon as practicable after that date. Restricted Stock Units may vest only while the Participant is actively employed by the Company. The Restricted Stock Units payable pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be reduced by any Restricted Stock Units that are paid pursuant to subparagraphs (a) and (b) below.
Vesting
(a) . A Participant shall be vested in 33% of his Restricted Stock Units on the first February 1 that follows the Grant Date if on such February 1 the Participant: (i) is eligible for Retirement, (ii) is not yet age 62, and (iii) has been actively employed by the Company continuously since the Grant Date. This vested portion shall be paid as soon as practicable after this February 1. A Participant shall be vested in 66% of his Restricted Stock Units on the second February 1 that follows the Grant Date if on such February 1 the conditions in (i), (ii) and (iii) of this Paragraph B.2(a) are satisfied. This vested portion shall be paid as soon as practicable after this second February 1 (net of any Restricted Stock Units previously paid out).
Eligibility for Retirement Prior to Age 62
(b) . A Participant shall be fully vested in his Restricted Stock Units on the first February 1 that follows the Grant Date if on such February 1 the Participant: (i) is eligible for Retirement, (ii) is at least age 62, and (iii) has been actively employed by the Company continuously since the Grant Date. The Participant's Restricted Stock Units shall be payable as soon as practicable after this February 1. A Participant shall be fully vested in his Restricted Stock Units on the second February 1 that follows the Grant Date if on such February 1 the conditions in (i), (ii) and (iii) of this Paragraph B.2(b) are satisfied. The Participant's Restricted Stock Units shall be payable as soon as practicable after this second February 1 (net of any Restricted Stock Units previously paid out).
Eligibility for Retirement on or After Age 62
3. . Restricted Stock Units that vest and become payable shall be settled in shares of PepsiCo Common Stock with the Participant receiving one share of PepsiCo Common Stock for each vested Restricted Stock Unit. No fractional shares shall be delivered under this Agreement, and so any fractional share that may be payable shall be rounded to the nearest whole share. Any amount that the Company may be required to withhold upon the settlement of Restricted Stock Units and/or the payment of dividend equivalents (see Section B.5 below) in respect of applicable foreign, federal (including FICA), state and local taxes, must be paid in full at the time of the issuance of shares or payment of cash. Unless the Participant makes other arrangements to satisfy this withholding obligation in accordance with procedures approved by the Company in its discretion, the Company shall withhold shares to satisfy the required withholding obligation related to the settlement of Restricted Stock Units.
Payment
4. .
Effect of Termination of Employment, Death, Retirement and Total Disability
(a) . Restricted Stock Units may vest and become payable only while the Participant is actively employed by the Company. Thus, vesting ceases upon the termination of the Participant's active employment with the Company. Subject to subparagraphs 4(b), 4(c) and 4(d), all unvested Restricted Stock Units shall automatically be forfeited and canceled upon the date that the Participant's active employment with the Company terminates. An authorized leave of absence will not be treated as active employment, and, as a result, the vesting of Restricted Stock Units will not be extended by any such period.
Termination of Employment
(b) . If the Participant's employment terminates prior to the Vesting Date, by reason of the Participant's Retirement prior to attaining age 62, then a whole number of Restricted Stock Units shall vest on the Participant's last day of active employment with the Company, with such number determined in proportion to the Participant's active service (measured in calendar days) during the period commencing on the Grant Date and ending on the Vesting Date, and shall be payable as soon as practicable after that date (net of any Restricted Stock Units previously paid out).
Retirement Prior to Age 62
(c) . If the Participant's employment terminates by reason of the Participant's death, Total Disability (as defined below), or Retirement after attaining at least age 62, then the Restricted Stock Units shall become fully vested on the Participant's last day of active employment with the Company (which, for purposes of Total Disability, means the effective date of Total Disability) and will be payable as soon as practicable after that date (net of any Restricted Stock Units previously paid out).
Death, Total Disability, or Retirement on or After Age 62
(d) . In the event the Participant transfers to a Related Entity (as defined below), as a result of actions by PepsiCo, the Restricted Stock Units shall become fully vested on the date of such transfer and shall be payable as soon as practicable after that date (net of any Restricted Stock Units previously paid out).
Transfers to a Related Entity
5. . During the vesting period, the Participant shall accumulate dividend equivalents with respect to the Restricted Stock Units, which dividend equivalents shall be paid in cash (without interest) to the Participant only if and when the applicable Restricted Stock Units vest and become payable. Dividend equivalents shall equal the dividends actually paid with respect to PepsiCo Common Stock during the vesting period while (and to the extent) the Restricted Stock Units remain outstanding and unpaid.
Dividend Equivalents
6. . The Participant shall have no rights as a holder of PepsiCo Common Stock with respect to the Restricted Stock Units granted hereunder unless and until such Restricted Stock Units have been settled in shares of Common Stock that have been registered in the Participant's name as owner.
No Rights as Shareholder
C. .

(1) . Participant shall not accept any employment, assignment, position or responsibility, or acquire any ownership interest, which involves the Participant's Participation in a business entity that markets, sells, distributes or produces Covered Products, unless such business entity makes retail sales or consumes Covered Products without in any way competing with the Company.
Non-Competition

Raiding Employees
(3) . Participant shall not use or disclose to anyone any confidential information regarding the Company other than as necessary in his or her position with the Company. Such confidential information shall include all non-public information the Participant acquired as a result of his or her positions with the Company which might be of any value to a competitor of the Company, or which might cause any economic loss or substantial embarrassment to the Company or its customers, bottlers, distributors or suppliers if used or disclosed. Examples of such confidential information include, without limitation, non-public information about the Company's customers, suppliers, distributors and potential acquisition targets; its business operations and structure; its product lines, formulas and pricing; its processes, machines and inventions; its research and know-how; its financial data; and its plans and strategies.
Non-Disclosure
(4) . Participant shall not engage in any acts that are considered to be contrary to the Company's best interests, including, but not limited to, violating the Company's Code of Conduct, engaging in unlawful trading in the securities of PepsiCo or of any other company based on information gained as a result of his or her employment with the Company, or engaging in any other activity which constitutes gross misconduct.
Misconduct
(b) In the event the Company determines that the Participant has breached any term of Paragraph C.1(a), in addition to any other remedies the Company may have available to it, the Company may in its sole discretion:
(1) Cancel any unexercised Options or unvested Restricted Stock Units granted hereunder;
(2) Require the Participant to pay to the Company all gains realized from the exercise of any Options granted hereunder, which have been exercised within the twelve-month period immediately preceding the date as of which the Participant has breached a provision of Paragraph C.1(a), as determined by the Company; and/or
(3) Require the Participant to pay to the Company the value (determined as of the date the forfeiture restrictions on the Restricted Stock Units lapse) of any Restricted Stock Units, which have been paid within the twelve-month period immediately preceding the date as of which the Participant has breached a provision of Paragraph C.1(a), as determined by the Company.
2. . In the event of any change in the outstanding shares of PepsiCo Common Stock by reason of any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, reorganization, merger, consolidation, combination or exchange of shares, spin-off or other similar corporate change, (a) the number and type of shares which the Participant may purchase pursuant to the Options and the Option Exercise Price at which the Participant may purchase such shares shall be adjusted, and (b) the number and type of shares to which the Restricted Stock Units held by the Participant relate shall be adjusted, in the case of (a) and (b), as may be, and to such extent (if any), determined to be appropriate and equitable by the Committee.
Adjustment for Change in Common Stock
3. . In the event of a Change in Control (as defined in the Plan), the following provisions shall apply:
Effect of Change in Control
(a) If the successor corporation (or affiliate thereto) (1) assumes the outstanding Options and Restricted Stock Units granted hereunder or (2) replaces the outstanding Options and Restricted Stock Units with equity awards that preserve the existing value of such Options and Restricted Stock Units at the time of the Change in Control and provide for subsequent payout in accordance with a vesting schedule that is the same or more favorable to the Participant than the vesting schedule applicable to such Options and Restricted Stock Units, then the outstanding Options and Restricted Stock Units or such substitutes thereof shall remain outstanding and be governed by their respective terms and the provisions of the Plan, subject to Paragraph C.3(c) below.
(b) If the outstanding Options and Restricted Stock Units granted hereunder are not assumed or replaced in accordance with Paragraph C.3(a) above, then upon the Change in Control, (1) the outstanding Options granted hereunder shall immediately vest and become exercisable and shall remain outstanding in accordance with their terms and the outstanding Restricted Stock Units granted hereunder shall immediately vest and shall be payable immediately in accordance with their terms or, if later, as of the earliest permissible date under Code Section 409A and (2), notwithstanding Paragraph C.3(b)(1) but after taking into account the accelerated vesting set forth therein, the Board may, in its sole discretion, provide for cancellation of the outstanding Options and Restricted Stock Units at the time of the Change in Control in which case a payment of cash, property or a combination thereof shall be made to the Participant that is determined by the Board in its sole discretion and that, in the case of the Restricted Stock Units, is at least equal to the value of the consideration that would be received in such Change in Control by the holders of PepsiCo's securities relating to such awards and, in the case of the outstanding Options, is at least equal to the excess, if any, of the value of such consideration over the Option Exercise Price for such Options.
(c) If the outstanding Options and Restricted Stock Units granted hereunder are assumed or replaced in accordance with Paragraph C.3(a) and the Participant's employment with the Company is terminated by the Company for any reasons other than Cause or by the Participant for Good Reason, in each case, within the two-year period commencing on the Change in Control, then, as of the date of the Participant's termination, (1) the outstanding Options granted hereunder shall immediately vest and become exercisable and shall remain outstanding until the Expiration Date and (2) the outstanding Restricted Stock Units granted hereunder shall immediately vest and shall be payable immediately in accordance with their terms or, if later, as of the earliest permissible date under Code Section 409A. For purposes of this Paragraph C.3, "Cause" and "Good Reason" are defined in the Plan and a termination for Cause or Good Reason is subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Plan.
4. . Unless the Committee specifically determines otherwise: (a) the Options and Restricted Stock Units are personal to the Participant and, with respect to Options, during the Participant's lifetime, such Options may be exercised only by the Participant, and (b) the Options and Restricted Stock Units shall not be transferable or assignable, other than in the case of the Participant's death by will, the laws of descent and distribution.

Participant Acknowledgement.
(a) the Option and/or Restricted Stock Unit grant will be exclusively governed by the terms of the Plan, including the right reserved by the Company to amend or cancel the Plan at any time without the Company incurring liability to the Participant (except for Options and Restricted Stock Units already granted under the Plan);
(b) stock options and restricted stock units are not a constituent part of the Participant's salary and that the Participant is not entitled, under the terms and conditions of his/her employment, or by accepting or being awarded the Options and/or Restricted Stock Units pursuant to this Agreement to require options, restricted stock units or other awards to be granted to him/her in the future under the Plan or any other plan;
(c) upon exercise of the Options or vesting of Restricted Stock Units the Participant will arrange for payment to the Company an estimated amount to cover employee payroll taxes resulting from the exercise and/or, to the extent necessary, any balance may be withheld from the Participant's wages;
(d) benefits received under the Plan will be excluded from the calculation of termination indemnities or other severance payments;
(e) in the event of termination of the Participant's employment, a severance or notice period to which the Participant may be entitled under local law and which follows the date of termination specified in a notice of termination will not be treated as active employment for purposes of this Agreement and, as a result, vesting of unvested Options or Restricted Stock Units will not be extended by any such period;
(f) the Participant will seek all necessary approval under, make all required notifications under and comply with all laws, rules and regulations applicable to the ownership of stock options and stock and the exercise of stock options, including, without limitation, currency and exchange laws, rules and regulations; and, in the event that any of the Participant's Options or Restricted Stock Units, including any such awards previously granted, become subject to the Indian fringe benefit tax ("FBT"), the Participant will be responsible for the FBT imposed on such awards and consents to provide payment to the Company of the applicable FBT at the time such FBT is due in accordance with the procedures specified from time to time by the Company; and
(g) this Agreement will be interpreted and applied so that the Options and Restricted Stock Units will not be subject to Code Section 409A. If notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the Restricted Stock Units become subject to Code Section 409A, then the specified time of payment of the Restricted Stock Units for purposes of Code Section 409A shall be the calendar year in which the short-term deferral period expires with respect to the Restricted Stock Unit (or by such later time as may be permitted by Code Section 409A under the circumstances).
15. . This Agreement shall be governed by, construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of North Carolina, without giving effect to conflict of laws principles.

These Terms and Conditions, along with the PepsiCo Performance-Based Long-Term Incentive Award Summary (the "Award Summary") delivered herewith and signed by the individual named on the Award Summary (the "Participant") shall constitute an Agreement made as of the Grant Date (as indicated on the Award Summary), by and between PepsiCo, Inc., a North Carolina corporation having its principal office at 700 Anderson Hill Road, Purchase, New York 10577 ("PepsiCo," and with its divisions and direct and indirect subsidiaries, the "Company"), and the Participant.
WHEREAS, the Board of Directors and shareholders of PepsiCo have approved the PepsiCo, Inc. 2007 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "Plan"), for the purposes and subject to the provisions set forth in the Plan; and
WHEREAS, pursuant to the authority granted to it in the Plan, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of PepsiCo (the "Committee"), by resolution duly adopted at a meeting held on or prior to the Grant Date, authorized the grant to the Participant of the stock options and restricted stock units set forth on the Award Summary; and
WHEREAS, awards granted under the Plan are to be evidenced by an Agreement in such form and containing such terms and conditions as the Committee shall determine;
NOW, THEREFORE, it is mutually agreed as follows:
A. . These terms and conditions shall apply with respect to the stock options granted to the Participant as indicated on the Award Summary.
Terms and Conditions Applicable to Stock Options
1. . In consideration of the Participant remaining in the employ of the Company, PepsiCo hereby grants to the Participant, on the terms and conditions set forth herein, the right and option to purchase the number of shares of PepsiCo Common Stock, par value $.0167 per share, indicated on the Award Summary, at the Grant/Exercise Price per share indicated on the Award Summary (the "Option Exercise Price"), which was the Fair Market Value (as defined below) of PepsiCo Common Stock on the Grant Date. The right to purchase each such share is referred to herein as an "Option." All Options granted hereunder shall be "Non-Qualified Stock Options" as defined in the Plan.
Grant
2. . Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Options shall become fully vested on the vesting date set forth in the Award Summary (the "Vesting Date") and shall be exercisable from the Vesting Date through the expiration date set forth in the Award Summary (the "Expiration Date"). Options may vest only while the Participant is actively employed by the Company. Once vested and exercisable, and until terminated, all or any portion of the Options may be exercised from time to time and at any time under procedures that the Committee or its delegate shall establish from time to time, including, without limitation, procedures regarding the frequency of exercise and the minimum number of Options which may be exercised at any time.
Vesting and Exercisability
3. . Subject to terms and conditions set forth herein, Options may be exercised by giving written notice of exercise to PepsiCo in the manner specified from time to time by PepsiCo. The aggregate Option Exercise Price for the shares being purchased, together with any amount which the Company may be required to withhold upon such exercise in respect of applicable foreign, federal (including FICA), state and local taxes, must be paid in full at the time of issuance of such shares.
Exercise Procedure
4. .
Effect of Termination of Employment, Death, Retirement and Total Disability
(a) . Options may vest only while the Participant is actively employed by the Company. Thus, no vesting shall occur following the termination of the Participant's active employment with the Company, and all unvested Options shall automatically be forfeited and cancelled upon the date that the Participant's active employment with the Company terminates. Only vested Options may be exercised. Subject to subparagraphs 4(b), 4(c) and 4(d), vested Options shall be exercisable until, and shall automatically be forfeited and cancelled upon, the earlier of the Expiration Date and the date that is the last trading day on the New York Stock Exchange during the 90-calendar day period after the date the Participant's employment with the Company terminates. It is intended that an authorized leave of absence may extend employment for purposes of determining the period when vested Options may be exercised. However, an authorized leave of absence will not be treated as active employment, and, as a result, vesting of unvested Options will not be extended by any such period.
Termination of Employment
(b) . If the Participant's employment terminates prior to the Vesting Date, by reason of the Participant's Retirement (as defined below) prior to attaining at least age 62, then: (i) a portion of the Options shall vest on the Participant's last day of active employment with the Company, with such portion determined in proportion to the Participant's active service (measured in calendar days) during the period commencing on the Grant Date and ending on the Vesting Date; (ii) the Options shall continue to become exercisable in accordance with Paragraph A.2 of this Agreement, with no change in the earliest date of exercise as a result of the vesting provided by this subparagraph 4(b); and (iii) the Options may be exercised by the Participant prior to the Expiration Date in accordance with this Agreement.
Retirement Prior to Age 62
(c) . If the Participant's employment terminates by reason of the Participant's death, Total Disability (as defined below), or Retirement after attaining at least age 62, then: (i) the Options shall become fully vested on the Participant's last day of active employment with the Company (which, for purposes of Total Disability, means the effective date of Total Disability); (ii) the Options shall continue to become exercisable in accordance with Paragraph A.2 of this Agreement, with no change in the earliest date of exercise as a result of the vesting provided by this subparagraph 4(c); and (iii) the Options may be exercised by the Participant's legal representative (or any person to whom the Options may be transferred by will or the applicable laws of descent and distribution), in the event of death, or the Participant, in the event of Retirement or Total Disability, prior to the Expiration Date in accordance with this Agreement.
Death, Total Disability, or Retirement on or After Age 62
(d) . In the event the Participant transfers to a Related Entity (as defined below), as a result of actions by PepsiCo, the Options shall become fully vested on the date of such transfer and shall become exercisable as soon as practicable thereafter and shall otherwise remain outstanding and be exercisable in accordance with this Agreement.
Transfers to a Related Entity
5. . Except as provided in Paragraph C.3, at any time after any Option becomes exercisable, the Committee shall have the right, in its sole discretion and without the consent of the Participant, to cancel such Option and to cause PepsiCo to pay to the Participant the excess of the Fair Market Value of the shares of Common Stock covered by such Option over the Option Exercise Price of such Option as of the date the Committee provides written notice (the "Buy Out Notice") of its intention to exercise such right. Payments of such buy out amounts pursuant to this provision shall be effected by PepsiCo as promptly as possible after the date of the Buy Out Notice and shall be made in shares of Common Stock. The number of shares shall be determined by dividing the amount of the payment to be made by the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock at the date of the Buy Out Notice, and by rounding up any fractional share to a whole share. Payments of any such buy out amounts shall be made net of the minimum applicable foreign, federal (including FICA), state and local withholding taxes, if any.
Buy-Out of Option Gains
6. . The Participant shall have no rights as a holder of PepsiCo Common Stock with respect to the Options granted hereunder unless and until such Options are exercised and the shares have been registered in the Participant's name as owner.
No Rights as Shareholder
B. . These terms and conditions shall apply with respect to the restricted stock units granted to the Participant as indicated on the Award Summary.
Terms and Conditions Applicable to Restricted Stock Units
1. . In consideration of the Participant remaining in the employ of the Company, PepsiCo hereby grants to the Participant, on the terms and conditions set forth herein, the number of restricted stock units indicated on the Award Summary (the "Restricted Stock Units"). All Restricted Stock Units granted hereunder are intended to be Performance Awards (as defined in the Plan) that satisfy the conditions for the Performance Based Exception (as defined in the Plan) under Section 162(m) of the Code.
Grant
2. . Subject to Paragraphs B.3 and B.4 below, the Restricted Stock Units shall vest on the Vesting Date and be payable as soon as practicable after such date (the "Payment Date"). Restricted Stock Units that become payable shall be settled in shares of PepsiCo Common Stock with the Participant receiving one share of PepsiCo Common Stock for each Restricted Stock Unit. No fractional shares shall be delivered under this Agreement, and so any fractional share that may be payable shall be rounded to the nearest whole share. Any amount that the Company may be required to withhold upon the settlement of Restricted Stock Units and/or the payment of dividend equivalents (see Paragraph B.5 below) in respect of applicable foreign, federal (including FICA), state and local taxes, must be paid in full at the time of the issuance of shares or payment of cash. Unless the Participant makes other arrangements to satisfy this withholding obligation in accordance with procedures approved by the Company in its discretion, the Company will withhold shares to satisfy the required withholding obligation related to the settlement of Restricted Stock Units.
Payment
3. . The number of Restricted Stock Units that are payable shall be determined based on the achievement of performance targets. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Restricted Stock Units shall be subject to forfeiture as follows:
Forfeiture of Restricted Stock Units
(a) The payment of one-third of the Restricted Stock Units shall be determined based on the achievement of specific {Year} performance targets. The specific performance targets and the percentage of the one-third of the Restricted Stock Units that shall be forfeited if such targets are not achieved shall be established by the Committee in the first ninety (90) days of {Year}.
(b) The payment of one-third of the Restricted Stock Units shall be determined based on the achievement of specific {Year+1} performance targets. The specific performance targets and the percentage of the one-third of the Restricted Stock Units that shall be forfeited if such targets are not achieved shall be established by the Committee in the first ninety (90) days of {Year+1}.
(c) The payment of one-third of the Restricted Stock Units shall be determined based on the achievement of specific {Year+2} performance targets. The specific performance targets and the percentage of the one-third of the Restricted Stock Units that shall be forfeited if such targets are not achieved shall be established by the Committee in the first ninety (90) days of {Year+2}.
(d) Notwithstanding the achievement of any performance targets established under Paragraphs B.3(a), (b) and (c) above, the Committee has the discretion to reduce the number of Restricted Stock Units paid, subject to and in accordance with the Plan. In the case of a Participant's death or Total Disability (as defined below), the Committee's right to exercise this discretion shall expire with respect to each one-third of the Restricted Stock Units at the later of: (i) the Participant's death or Total Disability (whichever applies), or (ii) the date the Committee certifies the results for the specific performance targets that relate to such one-third of the Restricted Stock Units. In all other cases, the Committee's right to exercise this discretion with respect to 100% of the Restricted Stock Units shall continue until the Payment Date. Accordingly, except in the case of death or Total Disability, the Restricted Stock Units for which a Participant has satisfied the performance criteria will be payable in one payment on the Payment Date.
4. .
Effect of Termination of Employment, Death, Retirement and Total Disability
(a) . Restricted Stock Units may vest and become payable only while the Participant is actively employed by the Company. Thus, vesting ceases upon the termination of the Participant's active employment with the Company. Subject to subparagraphs 4(b), 4(c) and 4(d), all unvested Restricted Stock Units shall automatically be forfeited and canceled upon the date that the Participant's active employment with the Company terminates. An authorized leave of absence will not be treated as active employment, and, as a result, the vesting of Restricted Stock Units will not be extended by any such period.
Termination of Employment
(b) . If the Participant's employment terminates prior to the Vesting Date, by reason of the Participant's Retirement (as defined below) prior to attaining at least age 62, then a whole number of Restricted Stock Units shall vest on the Participant's last day of active employment with the Company, with such number determined in proportion to the Participant's active service (measured in calendar days) during the period commencing on the Grant Date and ending on the Vesting Date. All Restricted Stock Units that vest in accordance with the foregoing sentence shall remain subject to the payment and forfeiture provisions of Paragraphs B.2 and B.3.
Retirement Prior to Age 62
(c) . If the Participant's employment terminates by reason of the Participant's death, Total Disability (as defined below), or Retirement after attaining at least age 62, then the Restricted Stock Units shall become fully vested on the Participant's last day of active employment with the Company (which, for purposes of Total Disability, means the effective date of Total Disability). All such vested Restricted Stock Units shall remain subject to the payment and forfeiture provisions of Paragraphs B.2 and B.3, except that in the case of death or Total Disability payment of each one-third of the Restricted Stock Units will be made as soon as practicable after the Committee's right to exercise discretion with respect to such one-third expires in accordance with Paragraph B.3(d).
Death, Total Disability, or Retirement on or After Age 62
(d) . In the event the Participant transfers to a Related Entity (as defined below), as a result of actions by PepsiCo, the Restricted Stock Units shall become fully vested on the Participant's last day of active employment with the Company. All such vested Restricted Stock Units shall remain subject to the payment and forfeiture provisions of Paragraphs B.2 and B.3.
Transfers to a Related Entity
5. . During the vesting period, the Participant shall accumulate dividend equivalents with respect to the Restricted Stock Units, which dividend equivalents shall be paid in cash (without interest) to the Participant only if and when the applicable Restricted Stock Units vest and become payable. Dividend equivalents shall equal the dividends actually paid with respect to PepsiCo Common Stock during the vesting period while (and to the extent) the Restricted Stock Units remain outstanding and unpaid.
Dividend Equivalents
6. . The Participant shall have no rights as a holder of PepsiCo Common Stock with respect to the Restricted Stock Units granted hereunder unless and until such Restricted Stock Units have been settled in shares of Common Stock that have been registered in the Participant's name as owner.
No Rights as Shareholder
C. .
Terms and Conditions Applicable to Stock Options and Restricted Stock Units
1. .

(a) The Participant agrees that, at any time prior to the exercise of the Options or payment of the Restricted Stock Units granted hereunder, and for a period of twelve months after the later of (i) completion of all such exercises of Stock Options, (ii) payment of Restricted Stock Units or (iii) termination of the Participant's employment with the Company for any reason whatsoever (including Retirement or Total Disability), he or she will not engage in any of the following activities anywhere in the world:
(1) . Participant shall not accept any employment, assignment, position or responsibility, or acquire any ownership interest, which involves the Participant's Participation in a business entity that markets, sells, distributes or produces Covered Products, unless such business entity makes retail sales or consumes Covered Products without in any way competing with the Company.
Non-Competition
(2) . Participant shall not in any way, directly or indirectly (including through someone else acting on the Participant's recommendation, suggestion, identification or advice), solicit any Company employee to leave the Company's employment or to accept any position with any other entity.
Raiding Employees
(3) . Participant shall not use or disclose to anyone any confidential information regarding the Company other than as necessary in his or her position with the Company. Such confidential information shall include all non-public information the Participant acquired as a result of his or her positions with the Company which might be of any value to a competitor of the Company, or which might cause any economic loss or substantial embarrassment to the Company or its customers, bottlers, distributors or suppliers if used or disclosed. Examples of such confidential information include, without limitation, non-public information about the Company's customers, suppliers, distributors and potential acquisition targets; its business operations and structure; its product lines, formulas and pricing; its processes, machines and inventions; its research and know-how; its financial data; and its plans and strategies.
Non-Disclosure
(4) . Participant shall not engage in any acts that are considered to be contrary to the Company's best interests, including, but not limited to, violating the Company's Code of Conduct, engaging in unlawful trading in the securities of PepsiCo or of any other company based on information gained as a result of his or her employment with the Company, or engaging in any other activity which constitutes gross misconduct.
Misconduct
(b) In the event the Company determines that the Participant has breached any term of Paragraph C.1(a), in addition to any other remedies the Company may have available to it, the Company may in its sole discretion:
(1) Cancel any unexercised Options or unpaid Restricted Stock Units granted hereunder;
(2) Require the Participant to pay to the Company all gains realized from the exercise of any Options granted hereunder, which have been exercised within the twelve-month period immediately preceding the date as of which the Participant has breached a provision of Paragraph C.1(a), as determined by the Company; and/or
(3) Require the Participant to pay to the Company the value (determined as of the date the forfeiture restrictions on the Restricted Stock Units lapse) of any Restricted Stock Units, which have been paid within the twelve-month period immediately preceding the date as of which the Participant has breached a provision of Paragraph C.1(a), as determined by the Company.
2. . In the event of any change in the outstanding shares of PepsiCo Common Stock by reason of any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, reorganization, merger, consolidation, combination or exchange of shares, spin-off or other similar corporate change, (a) the number and type of shares which the Participant may purchase pursuant to the Options and the Option Exercise Price at which the Participant may purchase such shares shall be adjusted, and (b) the number and type of shares to which the Restricted Stock Units held by the Participant relate shall be adjusted, in the case of (a) and (b), as may be, and to such extent (if any), determined to be appropriate and equitable by the Committee.
Adjustment for Change in Common Stock
3. . In the event of a Change in Control (as defined in the Plan), the following provisions shall apply:
Effect of Change in Control
(a) If the successor corporation (or affiliate thereto) (1) assumes the outstanding Options and Restricted Stock Units granted hereunder or (2) replaces the outstanding Options and Restricted Stock Units with equity awards that preserve the existing value of such Options and Restricted Stock Units at the time of the Change in Control and provide for subsequent payout in accordance with a vesting schedule and performance targets, as applicable, that are the same or more favorable to the Participant than the vesting schedule and performance targets applicable to such Options and Restricted Stock Units, then the outstanding Options and Restricted Stock Units or such substitutes thereof shall remain outstanding and be governed by their respective terms and the provisions of the Plan, subject to Paragraph C.3(c) below.
(b) If the outstanding Options and Restricted Stock Units granted hereunder are not assumed or replaced in accordance with Paragraph C.3(a) above, then upon the Change in Control, (1) the outstanding Options granted hereunder shall immediately vest and become exercisable and shall remain outstanding in accordance with their terms and the outstanding Restricted Stock Units granted hereunder shall immediately vest and shall be payable, as if 100% of the performance targets have been achieved, immediately in accordance with their terms or, if later, as of the earliest permissible date under Code Section 409A and (2), notwithstanding Paragraph C.3(b)(1) but after taking into account the accelerated vesting set forth therein, the Board may, in its sole discretion, provide for cancellation of the outstanding Options and Restricted Stock Units at the time of the Change in Control in which case a payment of cash, property or a combination thereof shall be made to the Participant that is determined by the Board in its sole discretion and that, in the case of the Restricted Stock Units, is at least equal to the value of the consideration that would be received in such Change in Control by the holders of PepsiCo's securities relating to such awards and, in the case of the outstanding Options, is at least equal to the excess, if any, of the value of such consideration over the Option Exercise Price for such Options.
(c) If the outstanding Options and Restricted Stock Units granted hereunder are assumed or replaced in accordance with Paragraph C.3(a) and the Participant's employment with the Company is terminated by the Company for any reasons other than Cause or by the Participant for Good Reason, in each case, within the two-year period commencing on the Change in Control, then, as of the date of the Participant's termination, (1) the outstanding Options granted hereunder shall immediately vest and become exercisable and shall remain outstanding until the Expiration Date and (2) the outstanding Restricted Stock Units granted hereunder shall immediately vest and shall be payable, as if 100% of the performance targets have been achieved, immediately in accordance with their terms or, if later, as of the earliest permissible date under Code Section 409A. For purposes of this Paragraph C.3, "Cause" and "Good Reason" are defined in the Plan and a termination for Cause or Good Reason is subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Plan.
4. . Unless the Committee specifically determines otherwise: (a) the Options and Restricted Stock Units are personal to the Participant and, with respect to Options, during the Participant's lifetime, such Options may be exercised only by the Participant, and (b) the Options and Restricted Stock Units shall not be transferable or assignable, other than in the case of the Participant's death by will, the laws of descent and distribution.

Plan Controls
14.  By entering into this Agreement, the Participant acknowledges and agrees that:
Participant Acknowledgement.
(a) the Option and/or Restricted Stock Unit grant will be exclusively governed by the terms of the Plan, including the right reserved by the Company to amend or cancel the Plan at any time without the Company incurring liability to the Participant (except for Options and Restricted Stock Units already granted under the Plan);
(b) stock options and restricted stock units are not a constituent part of the Participant's salary and that the Participant is not entitled, under the terms and conditions of his/her employment, or by accepting or being awarded the Options and/or Restricted Stock Units pursuant to this Agreement to require options, restricted stock units or other awards to be granted to him/her in the future under the Plan or any other plan;
(c) upon exercise of the Options or vesting of Restricted Stock Units the Participant will arrange for payment to the Company an estimated amount to cover employee payroll taxes resulting from the exercise and/or, to the extent necessary, any balance may be withheld from the Participant's wages;
(d) benefits received under the Plan will be excluded from the calculation of termination indemnities or other severance payments;
(e) in the event of termination of the Participant's employment, a severance or notice period to which the Participant may be entitled under local law and which follows the date of termination specified in a notice of termination will not be treated as active employment for purposes of this Agreement and, as a result, vesting of unvested Options or Restricted Stock Units will not be extended by any such period;
(f) the Participant will seek all necessary approval under, make all required notifications under and comply with all laws, rules and regulations applicable to the ownership of stock options and stock and the exercise of stock options, including, without limitation, currency and exchange laws, rules and regulations; and, in the event that any of the Participant's Options or Restricted Stock Units, including any such awards previously granted, become subject to the Indian fringe benefit tax ("FBT"), the Participant will be responsible for the FBT imposed on such awards and consents to provide payment to the Company of the applicable FBT at the time such FBT is due in accordance with the procedures specified from time to time by the Company; and
(g) this Agreement will be interpreted and applied so that the Options and Restricted Stock Units will not be subject to Code Section 409A. If notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the Restricted Stock Units become subject to Code Section 409A, then the specified time of payment of the Restricted Stock Units for purposes of Code Section 409A shall be the calendar year in which the short-term deferral period expires with respect to the Restricted Stock Unit (or by such later time as may be permitted by Code Section 409A under the circumstances).
