Section 9
. Agreements.
     (a) The Company covenants with the Underwriters as follows:
     (i) Prior to the filing by the Company of any amendment to the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Prospectus or of any prospectus supplement that shall name the Underwriters or the filing or use of any free writing prospectus, the Company will afford the Underwriters or their counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the same, , that the foregoing requirement will not apply to any of the Company's filings with the Commission required to be filed pursuant to Sections 13(a), 13(c), 14, or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. Subject to the foregoing sentence, the Company will promptly cause each applicable prospectus supplement and free writing prospectus to be filed with or transmitted for filing with the Commission in accordance with Rule 424(b) or 424(c) under the Securities Act or Rule 433 under the Securities Act, respectively, or pursuant to such other rule or regulation of the Commission as then deemed appropriate by the Company. The Company will promptly advise the Underwriters of (A) the filing and effectiveness of any amendment to the Registration Statement other than by virtue of the Company's filing any report required to be filed under the Exchange Act, (B) any request by the Commission for any amendment to the Registration Statement, for any amendment or supplement to the Time of Sale Prospectus or the Prospectus, or for any information from the Company, (C) the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or the institution or threatening of any proceeding for that purpose, and (D) the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of the

The Company will use reasonable efforts to prevent the issuance of any such stop order or notice of suspension of qualification and, if issued, to obtain as soon as reasonably possible the withdrawal thereof.
     (ii) If the Time of Sale Prospectus is being used to solicit offers to buy the Underwritten Securities at a time when the Prospectus is not yet available to prospective purchasers and any event shall occur or condition exist as a result of which it is necessary to amend or supplement the Time of Sale Prospectus in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances, not misleading, or if any event shall occur or condition exist as a result of which the Time of Sale Prospectus conflicts with the information contained in the Registration Statement then on file, or if, in the opinion of counsel for the Underwriters, it is necessary to amend or supplement the Time of Sale Prospectus to comply with applicable law, forthwith to prepare, file with the Commission and furnish, at its own expense, to the Underwriters and to any dealer upon request, either amendments or supplements to the Time of Sale Prospectus so that the statements in the Time of Sale Prospectus as so amended or supplemented will not, in the light of the circumstances when delivered to a prospective purchaser, be misleading or so that the Time of Sale Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, will no longer conflict with the Registration Statement, or so that the Time of Sale Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, will comply with applicable law.
     (iii) If, at any time when a Prospectus (or in lieu thereof the notice referred to in Rule 173(a) under the Securities Act) relating to any Underwritten Securities is required to be delivered under the Securities Act, any event occurs or condition exists as a result of which the Prospectus would include an untrue statement of a material fact, or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or if it is necessary to amend or supplement the Prospectus in order to comply with the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the respective rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder, or any other applicable law, the Company will promptly notify the Underwriters, by telephone or by facsimile (in either case with written confirmation from the Company by mail), to cease use and distribution of the Prospectus (and all then existing supplements thereto) and to suspend all efforts to resell the Underwritten Securities in its capacity as underwriter or dealer, as the case may be, and the Underwriters will promptly comply with the terms of such notice. The Company will forthwith prepare and cause to be filed with the Commission an amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, as the case may be, satisfactory in the reasonable judgment of the Underwriters to correct such statement or omission or to effect such compliance, and the Company will supply the Underwriters with one signed copy of such amended Registration Statement and as many copies of such amended or supplemented Prospectus as the Underwriters may reasonably request, , that the expense of preparing, filing, and supplying copies to the Underwriters of any such amendment or supplement will be borne by the Company only for the nine-month period immediately following the purchase of such Underwritten Securities by the Underwriters and thereafter will be borne by the Underwriters.
provided, however
     (iv) The Company will furnish to the Underwriters, without charge, as many copies of the Time of Sale Prospectus, the Prospectus, each preliminary prospectus, any documents incorporated by reference therein, and any supplements and amendments thereto and any free writing prospectus as the Underwriters may reasonably request.
     (v) The Company will, with such assistance from the Underwriters as the Company may reasonably request, endeavor to qualify the Securities for offer and sale under the Blue Sky laws or other securities laws of such jurisdictions as the Underwriters shall reasonably request and will maintain such qualifications for as long as required with respect to the offer, sale, and distribution of the Securities.
     (vi) The Company will make generally available to its security holders earnings statements that satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act and Rule 158 promulgated thereunder.
     (b) Each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, covenants with the Company as follows:
     (i) It has not and will not use, authorize use of, refer to, or participate in the planning for use of, any "free writing prospectus," as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act (which term includes use of any written information furnished to the Commission by the Company and not incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement and any press release issued by the Company) (each such

     (ii) It has not and will not distribute any Underwriter Free Writing Prospectus referred to in Section 9(b)(i)(A) above in a manner reasonably designed to lead to its broad unrestricted dissemination.

     (iv) It is not subject to any pending proceeding under Section 8A of the Securities Act with respect to the offering (and will promptly notify the Company if any such proceeding against it is initiated during the "", which means such period of time beginning on the first date of the public offering of the Underwritten Securities and ending on the later of the Closing Date or such date, as in the opinion of counsel for the Underwriters a prospectus relating to the Underwritten Securities is required by law to be delivered (or required to be delivered but for Rule 172 under the Securities Act) in connection with sales of the Underwritten Securities by any Underwriter or dealer).
Prospectus Delivery Period
     (v) Notwithstanding any of the above, each of the Underwriters may use one or more term sheets relating to the Underwritten Securities containing customary information, including Bloomberg email announcement, price talk guidance, comparable bond pricing and final pricing terms, not inconsistent with the form of the final term sheet set forth in the Terms Agreement, without the prior consent of the Company, so long as such term sheet is not required to be filed as a "free writing prospectus" with the Commission pursuant to Rule 433 under the Securities Act.
     . . The Company will pay all costs, fees, and expenses arising in connection with the sale of any Underwritten Securities through the Underwriters and in connection with the performance by the Company of its obligations hereunder and under any Terms Agreement, including the following: (i) expenses incident to the preparation and filing of the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus, the Prospectus, any free writing prospectus prepared by or on behalf of, used by, or referred to by the Company, and all amendments and supplements thereto, (ii) expenses incident to the issuance and delivery of such Underwritten Securities, (iii) the fees and disbursements of counsel for the Company and the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, (iv) if approved by the Company in advance and in writing, expenses incident to the qualification of such Underwritten Securities under Blue Sky laws and other applicable state securities laws in accordance with the provisions of Section 9(a)(v) hereof, including related filing fees and the reasonable fees and disbursements of the Underwriters' counsel in connection therewith and in connection with the preparation of any survey of Blue Sky laws, (v) expenses incident to the printing and delivery to the Underwriters, in the quantities hereinabove stated, of copies of the Registration Statement and all amendments thereto and of the Prospectus, each preliminary prospectus, and all amendments and supplements thereto, (vi) the fees and expenses, if any, incurred with respect to any applicable filing with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, (vii) the fees and expenses incurred in connection with the listing of any Underwritten Securities on the NYSE and (viii) if applicable, the fees and expenses of the trustee under the applicable Indenture.

Section 12
. Indemnification and Contribution.
     (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold each Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, harmless from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, or liabilities to which such Underwriter come subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, or any other federal or state law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages, or liabilities (and actions in respect thereof) arise out of, are based upon, or are caused by any untrue statement or allegedly untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus, the Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of, are based upon or are caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and the Company agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party for any reasonable legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability, or action; , that the Company will not be liable to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of, are based upon, or are caused by any such untrue statement or omission or allegedly untrue statement or omission included in or omitted from the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished by the Underwriters in writing expressly for use in the Registration Statement or such preliminary prospectus or the Time of Sale Prospectus or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto.
provided, however
     (b) Each Underwriter severally agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers who sign the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to the Underwriters, but only with respect to such losses, claims, damages, and liabilities (and actions in respect thereof) that arise out of, are based upon, or are caused by any untrue statement or omission of a material fact or allegedly untrue statement or omission of a material fact included in or omitted from the Registration Statement, or any preliminary prospectus or the Time of Sale Prospectus or the Prospectus in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished by the Underwriters in writing expressly for use in the Registration Statement or such preliminary prospectus or the Time of Sale Prospectus or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto.
     (c) In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to either paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 12, such person (the "") will promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "") in writing and the indemnifying party, upon request of the indemnified party, will retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent
indemnified party
indemnifying party
 
the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and will pay the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party will have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel will be borne by the indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and, in the judgment of the indemnified party, representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood that the indemnifying party will not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified parties and that all such reasonable fees and expenses will be reimbursed as they are incurred. Such firm will be designated in writing by the Underwriters (in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section 12) or by the Company (in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section 12), as the case may be. The indemnifying party will not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent, or if there shall be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. No indemnifying party will, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding. Any provision of this paragraph (c) to the contrary notwithstanding, no failure by an indemnified party to notify the indemnifying party as required hereunder will relieve the indemnifying party from any liability it may have had to an indemnified party otherwise than under this Section 12 to the extent the indemnifying party is not materially prejudiced as a result thereof and in any event shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement.
     (d) If the indemnification provided for in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 12 is unavailable to an indemnified party or is insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages, or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying the indemnified party thereunder, will contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages, or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other, from the offering of the Underwritten Securities pursuant to the applicable Terms Agreement, or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other, in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages, or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other, in connection with the offering of the Underwritten Securities pursuant to the applicable Terms Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of such Underwritten Securities (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total underwriting discount received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate initial public offering price of such Underwritten Securities as set forth on such cover. The relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and of the Underwriters, on the other, will be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or allegedly untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied or to be supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information, and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 12(d) are several in proportion to the number of Underwritten Securities set forth opposite their respective names in the applicable Terms Agreement, and not joint.
     (e) The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to paragraph (d) above were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to therein. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, and liabilities referred to in paragraph (d) above will be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any reasonable legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or
 
defending any such action or claim. Any other provisions of this Section 12 to the contrary notwithstanding, (i) the Underwriters will not be required to contribute to the Company any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Underwritten Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission (other than in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished to the Company by the Underwriters in writing expressly for use in the Registration Statement, the preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto), and (ii) no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) will be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
     (f) The remedies provided for in this Section 12 are not exclusive and will not limit any rights or remedies that may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.
     The applicable Terms Agreement will automatically terminate upon the expiration of the offering to which the Prospectus relates. The applicable Terms Agreement may not be terminated by the Underwriters prior to delivery of and payment for such Securities except upon the failure of any of the conditions precedent described in Section 6 hereof.

as Representatives of the several Underwriters named in the Underwriting Agreement referred to below
Ladies and Gentlemen:
          We have acted as special counsel for PepsiCo, Inc. (the "Company"), a North Carolina corporation, in connection with the Terms Agreement dated October 21, 2008 (together with the incorporated Underwriting Agreement Standard Provisions dated October 21, 2008, the "Underwriting Agreement") among the Company and you, as representatives of the several underwriters named therein (the "Underwriters"), under which you and the other Underwriters have severally agreed to purchase from the Company $2,000,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 7.90% Senior Notes due 2018 (the "Notes"). The Notes are to be issued pursuant to the provisions of an Indenture dated as of May 21, 2007 (the "Indenture") between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon, as Trustee. This opinion is furnished to you at the request of the Company pursuant to Section 5(a) of the Underwriting Agreement.
          We have examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of such documents, corporate records, certificates of public officials and other instruments as we have deemed necessary or advisable for the purpose of rendering this opinion.
          We have participated in the preparation of the Company's registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-154314) (other than the documents incorporated by reference therein (the "Incorporated Documents")) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") pursuant to the provisions of the Securities Act of
 
1933, as amended (the "Act"), relating to the registration of securities (the "Shelf Securities") to be issued from time to time by the Company, the preliminary prospectus supplement dated October 21, 2008 relating to the Notes, the free writing prospectus set forth in Schedule II to the Underwriting Agreement (the "Issuer Free Writing Prospectus") and the prospectus supplement dated October 21, 2008 relating to the Notes (the "Prospectus Supplement"), and have reviewed the Incorporated Documents. The registration statement became effective under the Act upon the filing of the registration statement with the Commission on October 15, 2008 pursuant to Rule 462(e) under the Act. The registration statement at the date of the Underwriting Agreement, including the Incorporated Documents and the information deemed to be part of the registration statement at the time of effectiveness pursuant to Rule 430B under the Act, is hereinafter referred to as the "Registration Statement," and the related prospectus (including the Incorporated Documents) dated October 15, 2008 relating to the Shelf Securities is hereinafter referred to as the "Basic Prospectus." The Basic Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, in the form first used to confirm sales of the Notes (or in the form first made available by the Company to the Underwriters to meet requests of purchasers of the Notes under Rule 173 under the Act), is hereinafter referred to as the "Prospectus."
          We have assumed the conformity of the documents filed with the Commission via the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval System ("EDGAR"), except for required EDGAR formatting changes, to physical copies of the documents submitted for our examination.
          Based upon the foregoing, we are of the opinion that:
     1.  The Indenture was duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, upon the filing of the Registration Statement with the Commission on October 15, 2008 pursuant to Rule 462(e) under the Act, and assuming due authorization, execution and delivery thereof by the Company, the Indenture is a valid and binding agreement of the Company, enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally, concepts of reasonableness and equitable principles of general applicability, that counsel need not express any opinion as to (w) the enforceability of any waiver of rights under any usury or stay law, (x) the applicability (and if applicable, the effect) of Section 548 of the United States Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provision of state law to the questions addressed above or on the conclusions expressed with respect thereto, or (y) the validity, legally binding effect or enforceability of any provision that permits holders to collect any portion of stated principal amount upon acceleration of the Notes to the extent determined to constitute unearned interest.
provided
     2.  Assuming the due authorization of the Notes by the Company, the Notes, when executed and authenticated in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture and delivered to and paid for by the Underwriters pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, will be valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally, concepts of
 
reasonableness and equitable principles of general applicability, and will be entitled to the benefits of the Indenture pursuant to which such Notes are to be issued, that counsel need not express any opinion as to (w) the enforceability of any waiver of rights under any usury or stay law, (x) the applicability (and if applicable, the effect) of Section 548 of the United States Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provision of state law to the questions addressed above or on the conclusions expressed with respect thereto, or (y) the validity, legally binding effect or enforceability of any provision that permits holders to collect any portion of stated principal amount upon acceleration of the Notes to the extent determined to constitute unearned interest.
provided
      3.  No consent, approval, authorization, or order of, or qualification with, any state governmental body or agency under the laws of the State of New York or any federal law of the United States of America that in our experience is normally applicable to general business corporations in relation to transactions of the type contemplated by the Indenture, the Notes and the Underwriting Agreement (collectively, the "Documents") is required for the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of its obligations under the Documents, except such as may be required under federal or state securities or Blue Sky laws as to which we express no opinion in this paragraph (3).
     4.  Any required filing of the Prospectus pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Act has been made in the manner and within the time period required by Rule 424(b); any required filing of the Issuer Free Writing Prospectus pursuant to Rule 433 under the Act has been made in the manner and within the time period required by Rule 433(d); and, to our knowledge, no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued under the Act and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or are pending or threatened by the Commission.
     5.  We have considered the statements included in the Prospectus under the captions "Description of Debt Securities" and "Description of Notes" insofar as they summarize provisions of the Indenture and the Notes. In our opinion, such statements fairly summarize these provisions in all material respects.
     6.  The statements included in the Prospectus under the caption "Material United States Federal Tax Considerations," insofar as they purport to describe provisions of U.S. federal income tax laws or legal conclusions with respect thereto, fairly and accurately summarize the matters referred to therein in all material respects.
           In rendering the opinions in paragraphs (1) through (3) above, we have assumed that each party to the Documents has been duly incorporated and is validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization. In addition, we have assumed that the execution, delivery and performance by each party thereto of each Document to which it is a party, (i) are within its corporate powers, (ii) do not contravene, or constitute a default under, the certificate of incorporation or bylaws or other constitutive documents of such party, (iii) other than as expressly covered in
 
paragraph (3) above in respect of the Company, require no action by or in respect of, or filing with, any governmental body, agency or official and (iv) do not contravene, or constitute a default under, any provision of applicable law or regulation or any judgment, injunction, order or decree or any agreement or other instrument binding upon such party, and that each Document is a valid, binding and enforceable agreement of each party thereto, other than the Company.
          We are members of the Bar of the State of New York, and the foregoing opinion is limited to the laws of the State of New York and the federal laws of the United States of America. Insofar as the foregoing opinion involves matters governed by the laws of the State of North Carolina, we have relied without independent investigation on the opinion of Womble Carlyle Sandridge & Rice, PLLC delivered to you today pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement.
          This opinion is rendered solely to you and the other several Underwriters in connection with the Underwriting Agreement. This opinion may not be relied upon by you for any other purpose or relied upon by any other person (including any person acquiring Notes from the several Underwriters) or furnished to any other person without our prior written consent.

Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated UBS Securities LLC The Williams Capital Group, L.P.
   as Representatives of the several Underwriters named in the Underwriting Agreement referred to below
Ladies and Gentlemen:
          We have acted as special counsel for PepsiCo, Inc. (the "Company"), a North Carolina corporation, in connection with the Terms Agreement dated October 21, 2008 (together with the incorporated Underwriting Agreement Standard Provisions dated October 21, 2008, the "Underwriting Agreement") among the Company and you, as representatives of the several underwriters named therein (the "Underwriters"), under which you and the other Underwriters have severally agreed to purchase from the Company $2,000,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 7.90% Senior Notes due 2018 (the "Notes"). The Notes are to be issued pursuant to the provisions of an Indenture dated as of May 21, 2007 (the "Indenture") between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon, as Trustee (the "Trustee"). This opinion is furnished to you at the request of the Company pursuant to Section 5(a) of the Underwriting Agreement.
          We have participated in the preparation of the Company's registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-154314) (other than the documents incorporated by reference therein (the "Incorporated Documents")) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") pursuant to the provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), relating to the registration of securities (the "Shelf Securities") to be issued from time to time by the Company, the preliminary prospectus supplement dated October 21, 2008 (the "Preliminary Prospectus Supplement") relating to the Notes, the free writing prospectus set forth in Schedule II to the Underwriting Agreement and the prospectus supplement dated October 21, 2008 relating to the Notes
 
(the "Prospectus Supplement"), and have reviewed the Incorporated Documents. The registration statement became effective under the Act upon the filing of the registration statement with the Commission on October 15, 2008 pursuant to Rule 462(e) under the Act. The registration statement at the date of the Underwriting Agreement, including the Incorporated Documents and the information deemed to be part of the registration statement at the time of effectiveness pursuant to Rule 430B under the Act, is hereinafter referred to as the "Registration Statement," and the related prospectus (including the Incorporated Documents) dated October 15, 2008 relating to the Shelf Securities is hereinafter referred to as the "Basic Prospectus." The Basic Prospectus, as supplemented by the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement, together with the free writing prospectus set forth in Schedule II to the Underwriting Agreement for the Notes are hereinafter referred to as the "Disclosure Package." The Basic Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, in the form first used to confirm sales of the Notes (or in the form first made available by the Company to the Underwriters to meet requests of purchasers of the Notes under Rule 173 under the Act), is hereinafter referred to as the "Prospectus."
          We have assumed the conformity of the documents filed with the Commission via the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval System ("EDGAR"), except for required EDGAR formatting changes, to physical copies of the documents submitted for our examination.
          We note that many determinations involved in the preparation of the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus are of a wholly or partially non-legal character or relate to legal matters outside the scope of our opinion separately delivered to you today in respect of certain matters under the laws of the State of New York and the federal laws of the United States of America. As a result, we are not passing upon, and do not assume any responsibility for, the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, and we have not ourselves checked the accuracy, completeness or fairness of, or otherwise verified, the information furnished in such documents (except to the extent expressly set forth in our opinion letter separately delivered to you today as to statements included in the Prospectus under the captions "Description of Notes," "Material United States Federal Tax Considerations" and "Description of Debt Securities"). However, in the course of our acting as counsel to the Company in connection with the preparation of the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, we have generally reviewed and discussed with your representatives and your counsel and with certain officers and employees of, and independent public accountants for, the Company the information furnished, whether or not subject to our check and verification. We have also reviewed and relied upon certain corporate records and documents, letters from counsel and accountants and oral and written statements of officers and other representatives of the Company and others as to the existence and consequence of certain factual and other matters.
          On the basis of the information gained in the course of the performance of the services rendered above, but without independent check or verification except as stated above:
 
          (i) the Registration Statement and the Prospectus appear on their face to be appropriately responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the Act and the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder; and
          (ii) nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that, insofar as relevant to the offering of the Notes:
     (a) on the date of the Underwriting Agreement, the Registration Statement contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading,
     (b) at the Time of Sale, the Time of Sale Prospectus contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or
     (c) the Prospectus as of the date of the Underwriting Agreement or as of the Closing Date contained or contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
           In providing this letter to you and the other several Underwriters, we have not been called to pass upon, and we express no view regarding, the financial statements or financial schedules or other financial or accounting data included in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Prospectus, the Prospectus, or the Statement of Eligibility of the Trustee on Form T-1. In addition, we express no view as to the conveyance of the Time of Sale Prospectus or the information contained therein to investors.
          This letter is delivered solely to you and the other several Underwriters in connection with the Underwriting Agreement. This letter may not be relied upon by you for any other purpose or relied upon by any other person (including any person acquiring Notes from the several Underwriters) or furnished to any other person without our prior written consent.

          I have examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to my satisfaction, of such documents, corporate records, certificates of public officials and other instruments as I have deemed necessary for the purposes of rendering this opinion. I have assumed the capacity of all natural persons and the genuineness of all signatures.
          Based upon the foregoing, I am of the opinion that:
     1. The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of its obligations under the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture and the Notes will not contravene any
 
provision of the Restated Charter or By-Laws of the Company, or of any agreement or other instrument binding upon the Company or any of its subsidiaries that is material to the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, or, to counsel's knowledge, of any judgment, order, or decree of any governmental body, agency, or court having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its subsidiaries, in each of the foregoing cases except as would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole.
      2. To counsel's knowledge, there is no legal or governmental proceeding pending or threatened to which the Company or any of its significant subsidiaries is a party, or by which any of the properties of the Company or its significant subsidiaries is bound, which would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole; and to counsel's knowledge, there is no agreement or other document that is required to be described in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or the Time of Sale Prospectus, or that is required to be filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement, that is not so described or filed.
     In rendering such opinion, I may rely, as to matters of fact, to the extent I deem proper, on certificates of responsible officers of the Company and public officials. Such opinion will be limited to the laws of the State of New York and the federal laws of the United States of America. Insofar as such opinion involves matters governed by the laws of North Carolina, I am relying, with your permission without independent investigation, on the opinion of North Carolina counsel for the Company.
          This opinion is rendered solely to you in connection with the above matter at the request of the Company. This opinion may not be relied upon by you for any other purpose or relied upon by or furnished to any other person without my prior written consent.

          as Representatives of the several Underwriters named in the Underwriting Agreement
Ladies and Gentlemen:
          We have acted as special North Carolina counsel to PepsiCo, Inc., a North Carolina corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the Terms Agreement dated October 21, 2008 (incorporating by reference the Underwriting Agreement Standard Provisions (the "Standard Provisions") dated October 21, 2008) (the "Terms Agreement" and, together with the Standard Provisions, the "Underwriting Agreement") between the Company and you, as representatives of the several underwriters named in the Underwriting Agreement (the "Underwriters"), under which you and the other Underwriters have severally agreed to purchase from the Company $2,000,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 7.90% Senior Notes Due 2018 (the "Notes").

This opinion is delivered to you pursuant to Section 5(a) of the Standard Provisions. Capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined in this opinion have the meanings given to them in the Underwriting Agreement.
          As the Company's special North Carolina counsel, we have reviewed the Company's articles of incorporation and by-laws, each as amended to date, and the Underwriting Agreement, and have examined the originals, or copies certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of corporate records, certificates of public
 
officials and of representatives of the Company, statutes and other instruments and documents, as a basis for the opinions hereinafter expressed. In rendering this opinion, we have relied upon certificates of public officials and representatives of the Company with respect to the accuracy of the factual matters contained in such certificates.
          In connection with such review, we have assumed with your permission (a) that the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture and all other documents that are the subject of this opinion or on which this opinion is based (the "Transaction Documents") have been properly authorized, executed and delivered by each of the respective parties thereto other than the Company; (b) the genuineness of all signatures and the legal capacity of all signatories; (c) the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals and the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as certified or photostatic copies; (d) the proper issuance and accuracy of certificates of public officials and representatives of the Company; (e) the due authentication of the Notes in accordance with the Indenture and payment by the Underwriters of the purchase price for the Notes in accordance with the Underwriting Agreement; and (f) the truth and accuracy of the representations, warranties and covenants of the Underwriters set forth in the Underwriting Agreement.
          This opinion is limited to the laws of the State of North Carolina, excluding local laws of the State of North Carolina (, the statutes and ordinances, the administrative decisions and the rules and regulations of counties, towns, municipalities and special political subdivisions of, or authorities or quasi-governmental bodies constituted under the laws of, the State of North Carolina and judicial decisions to the extent they deal with any of the foregoing) and the securities or Blue Sky laws of the State of North Carolina, and we are expressing no opinion as to the effect of the laws of any other jurisdiction.

          The opinion in paragraph 1 relating to the existence of the Company in the State of North Carolina is given solely in reliance on a certificate of existence issued by the Secretary of State of the State of North Carolina dated October 24, 2008.
          Based on and subject to the foregoing and the qualifications and limitations set forth below, and having regard for such legal considerations as we deem relevant, it is our opinion that:
          1. The Company is a corporation in existence under the laws of the State of North Carolina, with corporate power to conduct its business as described in the Time of Sale Prospectus and the Prospectus.
          2. The Company has authorized by all necessary corporate action the execution and delivery of the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture and the Notes.
          3. The Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture and the Notes have been duly executed by the Company.
          4. The execution and delivery of and performance by the Company of its obligations under the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture and the Notes do not violate any provision of the articles of incorporation or by-laws of the Company.
 
          5. No consent, approval, authorization, or order of or qualification with any North Carolina governmental body or agency is required to be obtained or made by the Company for the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Underwriting Agreement or the issuance of the Notes, except as may be required by the Blue Sky or other securities laws if the Notes are offered or sold in North Carolina and except for consents, approvals, authorizations, actions, filings and registrations which, if not obtained or made, are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole.
          Nothing contained in this opinion letter shall be construed as an opinion as to the enforceability of the Transaction Documents or as an opinion as to whether the execution and delivery of the Indenture and the Notes, or the authorization thereof, comply with applicable provisions of such instruments and of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended. This opinion letter is delivered solely for your benefit in connection with the Underwriting Agreement and the transactions provided for therein and may not be quoted in whole or in part, referred to, filed with any governmental agency or otherwise used or relied upon by any other person or for any other purpose without our prior written consent.
          This opinion is rendered as of the date hereof, and we undertake no obligation to advise you of any changes in applicable law or any other matters that may come to our attention after the date hereof.

No stop order suspending the effectiveness of either the Company Registration Statement, the Guarantor Registration Statement or of any part thereof shall have been issued and no proceedings for that purpose shall have been instituted or, to the knowledge of the Company, the Guarantor or any Underwriter, shall be contemplated by the Commission.
          (d) Subsequent to the execution of the Terms Agreement, there shall not have occurred (i) any change, or any development or event involving a prospective change, in the condition (financial or other), business, properties or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole or the Guarantor and its subsidiaries taken
 
as a whole which, in the judgment of a majority in interest of the Underwriters including the Representatives, if any, is material and adverse and makes it impractical or inadvisable to proceed with completion of the offering or the sale of and payment for the Offered Securities; (ii) any downgrading in the rating of any debt securities of the Company or the Guarantor by Moody's Investors Service ("Moody's") or Standard & Poor's Ratings Services, a division of the McGraw-Hill Companies ("S&P"), or any public announcement that Moody's or S&P has under surveillance or review its rating of any debt securities of the Company or the Guarantor (other than an announcement with positive implications of a possible upgrading, and no implication of a possible downgrading, of such rating); (iii) any change in U.S. or international financial, political or economic conditions or currency exchange rates or exchange controls as would, in the judgment of a majority in interest of the Underwriters including the Representatives, if any, be likely to prejudice materially the success of the proposed issue, sale or distribution of the Offered Securities, whether in the primary market or in respect of dealings in the secondary market; (iv) any material suspension or material limitation of trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange, or any setting of minimum prices for trading on such exchange; (v) any suspension of trading of any securities of the Company or the Guarantor on any exchange or in the over-the-counter market; (vi) any banking moratorium declared by U.S. Federal or New York authorities; (vii) any major disruption of settlements of securities or clearance services in the United States; or (viii) any attack on, outbreak or escalation of hostilities or act of terrorism involving the United States, any declaration of war by Congress or any other national or international calamity or emergency if, in the judgment of a majority in interest of the Underwriters including the Representatives, if any, the effect of any such attack, outbreak, escalation, act, declaration, calamity or emergency makes it impractical or inadvisable to proceed with completion of the offering or the sale of and payment for the Offered Securities.
          (e) The Representatives shall have received an opinion, dated the Closing Date, of Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP, special counsel to the Company, substantially to the effect that:
(i) The Company is a limited liability company validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware.
(ii) The Terms Agreement (including the provisions of this Agreement) has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company.
(iii) The Indenture has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act, has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company, and (assuming due authorization, valid execution and delivery thereof by the Guarantor and the Trustee) constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms (subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer and other similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally from time to time in effect and to general principles of equity, including, without limitation, concepts of materiality,
 
reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing, regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).
(iv) The Registered Securities have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and, when authenticated in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture and delivered to and paid for by the Underwriters pursuant to the Terms Agreement (including the provisions of this Agreement), will constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company entitled to the benefits of the Indenture and enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms (subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer and other similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally from time to time in effect and to general principles of equity, including, without limitation, concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing, regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).
(v) No consent, approval, authorization or order of, or filing with, any United States federal, New York State or Delaware governmental agency or body or any court is required for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Terms Agreement (including the provisions of this Agreement), the Indenture or the Offered Securities in connection with the issuance and sale of the Offered Securities by the Company, except as required under the Act, the Trust Indenture Act, applicable state securities or Blue Sky laws.
(vi) The Offered Securities and the Indenture conform in all material respects to the description thereof contained in the Company Prospectus and the Company General Disclosure Package.
(vii) The issue and sale by the Company of the Offered Securities and the consummation of the other transactions contemplated by the Terms Agreement (including the provisions of this Agreement) will not violate any law, rule or regulation of the United States of America or the State of New York or the Limited Liability Company Act of the State of Delaware or, to our knowledge, any order or decree of any court or government agency or instrumentality binding on the Company.
(viii) Based on the certificate dated the date of such counsel's opinion from an officer of the Company, the Company is not and, after giving effect to the offering and sale of the Offered Securities and the application of the proceeds thereof as described in the Company Prospectus and the Company General Disclosure Package, will not be required to register as an "investment company" as such term is defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940.
(ix) The Company Registration Statement initially became effective under the Act on March 24, 2006 and no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Company Registration Statement has been issued and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or are pending or contemplated under the Act.
 
(x) To such counsel's knowledge, there is no contract, indenture, mortgage, loan agreement, note, lease or other document entered into by the Company or any of its subsidiaries of a character required to be described in the Company Registration Statement or Company Prospectus, or to be filed as an exhibit, which is not described or filed as required.
(xi) The statements made in the Company Prospectus and the Company General Disclosure Package under the caption "Certain United States Federal Income Tax Consequences," insofar as they purport to describe material tax consequences of an investment in the Offered Securities, fairly summarize the matters therein described.
          (f) The Representatives shall have received a disclosure letter, dated the Closing Date, of Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP, special counsel to the Company. Such disclosure letter shall state that, although such counsel has made certain inquiries and investigations in connection with the preparation of the Company Registration Statement, the Company General Disclosure Package and the Company Prospectus, the limitations inherent in the role of outside counsel are such that such counsel cannot and does not assume responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of the statements made in the Company Registration Statement, the Company General Disclosure Package and the Company Prospectus (except to the extent expressly set forth in counsel's opinion letter separately delivered to you as of its date). Subject to the foregoing and on the basis of information gained in the course of the performance of the services rendered by such counsel, such counsel shall confirm in its disclosure letter that each of the Company Registration Statement, at the time it was last amended or deemed to be amended, and the Company Prospectus, as of its date, appeared on its face to be appropriately responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the Act and the Trust Indenture Act and the applicable rules and regulations thereunder, except that such counsel does not express any view as to the financial statements and other information of an accounting or financial nature included therein or any Statement of Eligibility (Form T-1) included as an exhibit to the Company Registration Statement. Furthermore, such disclosure letter shall state that such counsel's work in connection with the offering did not disclose any information that gave such counsel reason to believe: (i) the Company Registration Statement (insofar as relevant to the offering contemplated by the Company Prospectus) as of the date of the Terms Agreement (the ""), contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, (ii) the Company Prospectus, as of its date or at the date of such counsel's disclosure letter, included or includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or (iii) the Company General Disclosure Package, considered together as of the Applicable Time on the Applicable Date, included an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except that, in each case, such counsel does not express any view as to the financial statements and other information of an accounting or financial nature included therein. In providing the above letter, counsel may further note
Applicable Date
 
that such counsel has not been called to pass upon, and expresses no view regarding the Guarantor's Information included in the Company Registration Statement, the Company General Disclosure Package or the Company Prospectus, and counsel shall be entitled to assume the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Guarantor set forth in Section 1(B). In addition, counsel need express no view as to the conveyance of the Disclosure Package or the information contained therein to investors.
          (g) The Representatives shall have received an opinion, dated the Closing Date, of David Yawman, Managing Director-Delegatee of the Company and Vice President, Associate General Counsel and Assistant Secretary of The Pepsi Bottling Group, Inc., substantially to the effect that:
(i) The Company has been duly formed and is validly existing as a limited liability company in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware; the Company has the limited liability company power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and conduct its business as described in the Company Prospectus and the Company General Disclosure Package and to enter into and perform its obligations under the Terms Agreement (including the provisions of this Agreement), the Indenture and the Offered Securities; and the Company is duly qualified as a foreign limited liability company to transact business and is in good standing in each other jurisdiction in which such qualification is required, whether by reason of the ownership or leasing of property or the conduct of business, except where the failure so to qualify or to be in good standing would not result in a Company Material Adverse Effect.
(ii) All of the issued limited liability company membership interests of the Company have been duly and validly authorized and issued and are owned directly or indirectly by the Guarantor and The Pepsi Bottling Group, Inc., and, to the best of such counsel's knowledge, free and clear of all liens, encumbrances, equities, or claims.
(iii) The Company is not (A) in violation of its certificate of formation or limited liability company agreement or (B) in default in the performance or observance of any agreement or instrument, except, in the case of clause (B), for such defaults that would not result in a Company Material Adverse Effect.
(iv) The execution and delivery of and performance by the Company of its obligations under the Terms Agreement (including the provisions of this Agreement), the Indenture and the Offered Securities, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein and therein and compliance by the Company with its obligations hereunder and thereunder have been duly authorized by all necessary limited liability company action and will not contravene any provision of the certificate of formation or limited liability company agreement of the Company or of any contract, indenture, mortgage, loan agreement, note, lease or other agreement or instrument binding upon the Company that is material to the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, or, to such counsel's knowledge
 
after due inquiry, of any judgment, order or decree of any governmental body, agency or court having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its subsidiaries.
(v) No consent, approval, authorization or order of, or filing with, any governmental agency or body or any court is required for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Terms Agreement (including the provisions of this Agreement), the Indenture or the Offered Securities in connection with the issuance and sale of the Offered Securities by the Company, except as required under the Act, the Trust Indenture Act, applicable state securities or Blue Sky laws or from the FINRA.
(vi) There is no legal or governmental proceeding pending or threatened, or to such counsel's knowledge after due inquiry, contemplated, no statute or regulation, and no agreement, instrument or other document to which, in any case, the Company is a party, or by which, in any case, any of the properties of the Company is bound, that is required to be described in the Company Registration Statement, the Company Prospectus or the Company General Disclosure Package that is not so described as required.
          (h) (A) The Representatives shall have received an opinion, dated the Closing Date, of Womble Carlyle Sandridge & Rice, PLLC, special North Carolina counsel to the Guarantor, substantially to the effect that:
     (i) The Guarantor is a corporation in existence under the laws of the State of North Carolina.
     (ii) The Guarantor has authorized by all necessary corporate action, the execution and delivery of the Underwriting Agreement (including the Terms Agreement), the Indenture and the Guarantee.
     (iii) The Underwriting Agreement (including the Terms Agreement), the Indenture and the Guarantee have been duly executed by the Guarantor.
          (B) The Representatives shall have received an opinion, dated the Closing Date, of Davis Polk & Wardwell, special New York counsel to the Guarantor, substantially to the effect that:
(i) The Indenture has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act, and assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by the Guarantor, the Company and the Trustee, the Indenture is a valid and binding agreement of the Guarantor, enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally, concepts of reasonableness and equitable principles of general applicability, provided that counsel need express no opinion as to the (x) enforceability of any waiver of rights under any usury or stay law, and (y) applicability (and if applicable, the effect) of Section 548 of the United States Bankruptcy Code or any
 
comparable provision of state law to the questions addressed above or on the conclusions expressed with respect thereto.
(ii) Assuming due authorization by the Guarantor of the Guarantee, when the Offered Securities, with the Guarantee endorsed thereon, have been issued, executed and authenticated in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture and delivered to and paid for by the Underwriters in accordance with the provisions of the Terms Agreement (including the provisions of this Agreement), the Guarantee will constitute the valid and binding obligation of the Guarantor, enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally, concepts of reasonableness and equitable principles of general applicability, provided that counsel need express no opinion as to the (x) enforceability of any waiver of rights under any usury or stay law, and (y) applicability (and if applicable, the effect) of Section 548 of the United States Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provision of state law to the questions addressed above or on the conclusions expressed with respect thereto.
(iii) No consent, approval, authorization, or order of, or qualification with, any governmental body or agency under the laws of the State of New York or any federal law of the United States of America that in counsel's experience is normally applicable to transactions of the type contemplated by the Terms Agreement, the Indenture or the Guarantee is required for the execution, delivery and performance by the Guarantor of its obligations under the Terms Agreement or the Indenture, except such as may be required under federal or state securities or Blue Sky laws as to which counsel need express no opinion.
(iv) Counsel has considered the statements included in the Guarantor Prospectus under the captions "Description of the Notes and the Guarantee" and "Description of Guarantees of Debt Securities" insofar as they summarize provisions of the Guarantee. In counsel's opinion, such statements fairly summarize these provisions in all material respects.
(v) The execution and delivery by the Guarantor of, and the performance by the Guarantor of its obligations under, the Indenture, the Guarantee and the Terms Agreement (collectively, the "Documents") will not contravene any provision of the laws of the State of New York or any federal law of the United States of America that in our experience is normally applicable to general business corporations in relation to transactions of the type contemplated by the Documents, provided that we express no opinion as to (x) federal or state securities laws or (y) any law, rule or regulation that is applicable to the Guarantor, the Documents or such transactions solely because such law, rule or regulation is part of a regulatory regime applicable to any party to any of the Documents or any of its affiliates due to the specific assets or business of such party or such affiliate.
 
(vi) The Guarantor is not, and after giving effect to the offering and sale of the Offered Securities and the application of the proceeds thereof as described in the Guarantor Prospectus will not be, required to register as an "investment company" as such term is defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
(vii) The Guarantor Registration Statement initially became effective under the Act on October 15, 2008 and, to counsel's knowledge, no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Guarantor Registration Statement has been issued and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or are pending or threatened by the Commission.
          (C) The Representatives shall have received a disclosure letter, dated the Closing Date, of Davis Polk & Wardwell, special New York counsel to the Guarantor. Such disclosure letter shall state that many determinations involved in the preparation of the Guarantor Registration Statement, the Guarantor General Disclosure Package and the Guarantor Prospectus are of a wholly or partially non-legal character or relate to legal matters outside the scope of counsel's opinion separately delivered in respect of certain matters under the laws of the State of New York and the federal laws of the United States of America. As a result, counsel are not passing upon, and do not assume any responsibility for, the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Guarantor Registration Statement, the Guarantor General Disclosure Package and the Guarantor Prospectus, and counsel have not themselves checked the accuracy, completeness or fairness of, or otherwise verified, the information furnished in such documents (except to the extent expressly set forth in counsel's opinion letter separately delivered to you today as to statements included in the Guarantor Prospectus under the captions "Description of the Notes and the Guarantee" and "Description of Guarantees of Debt Securities"). However, in the course of acting as counsel to the Guarantor in connection with the preparation of the Guarantor Registration Statement, the Guarantor General Disclosure Package and the Guarantor Prospectus, counsel has generally reviewed and discussed with the Underwriters' representatives and counsel and with certain officers and employees of, and independent public accountants for, the Guarantor the information furnished, whether or not subject to counsel's check and verification. Counsel has also reviewed and relied upon certain corporate records and documents, letters from counsel and accountants and oral and written statements of officers and other representatives of the Guarantor and others as to the existence and consequence of certain factual and other matters.
          On the basis of the information gained in the course of the performance of the services rendered above, but without independent check or verification except as stated above:
          (i) the Guarantor Registration Statement and the Guarantor Prospectus appear on their face to be appropriately responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the Act and the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder; and
 
          (ii) nothing has come to counsel's attention that causes us to believe that, insofar as relevant to the offering of the Offered Securities:
     (a) on the date of the Terms Agreement, the Guarantor Registration Statement contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading,
     (b) at the Applicable Time, the Guarantor General Disclosure Package contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or
     (c) the Guarantor Prospectus as of the date of the Terms Agreement or as of the Closing Date contained or contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
In providing the above letter, counsel may note that they have not been called to pass upon, and they express no view regarding, (i) the financial statements or financial schedules or other financial or accounting data included in the Guarantor Registration Statement, the Guarantor General Disclosure Package or the Guarantor Prospectus, (ii) any Statement of Eligibility of the Trustee on Form T-1 or (iii) the Company's Information included in the Guarantor Registration Statement, the Guarantor General Disclosure Package or the Guarantor Prospectus, and counsel shall be entitled to assume the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in Section 1(A). In addition, counsel need express no view as to the conveyance of the Disclosure Package or the information contained therein to investors.
          (i) The Representatives shall have received an opinion, dated the Closing Date, of Thomas H. Tamoney, Jr., Senior Vice President, Deputy General Counsel and Assistant Secretary of the Guarantor, substantially to the effect that:
     (i) The execution, delivery and performance by the Guarantor of its obligations under the Terms Agreement, the Indenture and the Guarantee will not contravene any provision of the Restated Charter or By-Laws of the Guarantor, or of any agreement or other instrument binding upon the Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries that is material to the Guarantor and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, or, to counsel's knowledge, of any judgment, order, or decree of any governmental body, agency, or court having jurisdiction over the Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries, in each of the foregoing cases except as would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition or results of operations of the Guarantor and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole.
 
     (ii) To counsel's knowledge, there is no legal or governmental proceeding pending or threatened to which the Guarantor or any of its significant subsidiaries is a party, or by which any of the properties of the Guarantor or its significant subsidiaries is bound, which would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition or results of operations of the Guarantor and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole; and to counsel's knowledge, there is no agreement or other document that is required to be described in the Guarantor Registration Statement, the Guarantor Prospectus, or the Guarantor General Disclosure Package, or that is required to be filed as an exhibit to the Guarantor Registration Statement, that is not so described or filed.
          (j) The Representatives shall have received from Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP, counsel for the Underwriters, such opinions or letters, dated the Closing Date, with respect to the validity of the Offered Securities, the Company Registration Statement, the Guarantor Registration Statement, the Company Prospectus, the Guarantor Prospectus, the Company General Disclosure Package, the Guarantor General Disclosure Package and other related matters as the Representatives may reasonably require, and the Company and the Guarantor shall have furnished to such counsel such documents as they request for the purpose of enabling them to pass upon such matters.
          (k) The Representatives shall have received a certificate, dated the Closing Date, of a Managing Director or Managing Director-Delegatee of the Company stating that:

          (l) The Representatives shall have received a certificate, dated the Closing Date, of the Senior Vice President and the Treasurer of the Guarantor, or other officer of the Guarantor reasonably acceptable to the Representatives, stating that:
(i) The representations, warranties and agreements of the Guarantor in Section 1.B. are true and correct as of the Closing Date, and the Guarantor has complied in all material respects with all its agreements contained herein;
 
(ii) To the best of his or her knowledge, no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Guarantor Registration Statement or any part thereof has been issued and no proceedings for such purpose have been instituted or are pending or are contemplated or threatened by the Commission under the Act; and
(iii) To the best of his or her knowledge, there has not been any Guarantor Material Adverse Effect, except as described in the Guarantor Prospectus and the Guarantor General Disclosure Package.
          (m) The Representatives shall have received a letter, dated the Closing Date, of Deloitte & Touche LLP, which meets the requirements of subsection (a) of this Section, except that the specified date referred to in such subsection will be a date not more than three days prior to the Closing Date for the purposes of this subsection (l).
          (n) The Representatives shall have received a letter, dated the Closing Date, of KPMG LLP, which meets the requirements of subsection (b) of this Section, except that the specified date referred to in such subsection will be a date not more than three days prior to the Closing Date for the purposes of this subsection (m).
     Each of the Company and the Guarantor will furnish the Representatives with such conformed copies of such opinions, certificates, letters and documents applicable to it as the Representatives may reasonably request. The Lead Underwriter may in its sole discretion waive on behalf of the Underwriters compliance with any conditions to the obligations of the Underwriters under this Agreement and the Terms Agreement.

     (e) If the indemnification provided for in this Section is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a), (b) or (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in subsection (a), (b) or (c) above (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company or the Guarantor on the one hand, as applicable, and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Offered Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company or the Guarantor on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company or the Guarantor on the one hand, as applicable, and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters from the Company under this Agreement. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Guarantor on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The amount paid by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in the first sentence of this subsection (e) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim which is the subject of this subsection (e). Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (e), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Offered Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations in this subsection (e) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.
 
     (f) The several obligations of the Company and the Guarantor under this Section shall be in addition to any liability which the Company or the Guarantor may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each managing director and director of the Company and the Guarantor, to each officer of the Company and the Guarantor who has signed the Company Registration Statement or the Guarantor Registration Statement, to their affiliates, and to each person, if any, who controls the Company or the Guarantor within the meaning of the Act.
     8. If any Underwriter or Underwriters default in their obligations to purchase Offered Securities under the Terms Agreement and the aggregate principal amount of Offered Securities that such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase does not exceed 10% of the total principal amount of Offered Securities, the Lead Underwriter may make arrangements satisfactory to the Company for the purchase of such Offered Securities by other persons, including any of the Underwriters, but if no such arrangements are made by the Closing Date, the non-defaulting Underwriters shall be obligated severally, in proportion to their respective commitments under the Terms Agreement (including the provisions of this Agreement), to purchase the Offered Securities that such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase. If any Underwriter or Underwriters so default and the aggregate principal amount of Offered Securities with respect to which such default or defaults occur exceeds 10% of the total principal amount of Offered Securities and arrangements satisfactory to the Lead Underwriter and the Company for the purchase of such Offered Securities by other persons are not made within 36 hours after such default, the Terms Agreement will terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter, the Company or the Guarantor, except as provided in Section 9. As used in this Agreement, the term "Underwriter" includes any person substituted for an Underwriter under this Section. Nothing herein will relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.

If the Terms Agreement is terminated or if for any reason the purchase of the Offered Securities by the Underwriters is not consummated, each of the Company and the Guarantor shall remain responsible for the expenses to be paid or reimbursed by it pursuant to Section 3 and Section 5, as the case may be, and the respective obligations of the Company, the Guarantor and the Underwriters pursuant to Section 7 shall remain in effect.

Execution and Authentication.
     (1) At any time and from time to time after the execution and delivery of this Indenture, the Obligor may deliver Notes of any series executed on behalf of the Obligor by any two Officers to the Trustee for authentication, and the Trustee, upon receipt of a written order of the Obligor signed by an Officer of the Obligor and acknowledged by an

The signature of any of the Officers on the Notes may be manual or facsimile.

In authenticating such Notes and accepting the additional responsibilities under this Indenture in relation to such Notes, the Trustee shall receive, and (subject to Section 5.01) shall be fully protected in relying upon:
Authentication Order
     (a) a copy of (i) the Managing Directors Resolution of the Obligor and (ii) the Board Resolution of the Guarantor relating to such series;
     (b) an executed supplemental indenture, if any, and the documentation required to be delivered pursuant to Section 8.06;

     (ii) such Notes, when executed and issued by the Obligor, guaranteed by the Guarantor and authenticated and delivered by the Trustee in the manner and subject to any conditions specified in such Opinion of Counsel, will constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the Obligor and Guarantor enforceable against each of them in accordance with their terms except as any rights thereunder may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency and other similar laws affecting the enforceability of creditors rights' generally and by general equity principles. The Trustee shall have the right to decline to authenticate and deliver any Notes under this Section 2.02 if the Trustee, being advised by counsel, determines that such action may not lawfully be taken by the Obligor or the Guarantor or if the Trustee in good faith by its board of directors or board of trustees, executive committee, or a trust committee of directors or trustees or Responsible Officers shall determine that such action would expose the Trustee to personal liability. If the Obligor and the Guarantor shall establish pursuant to Section 2.01(1) that the Notes of a series or a portion thereof are to be issued in the form of one or more Global Notes, then the Obligor and the Guarantor shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and make available for delivery one or more Global Notes as provided in Section 2.01(2)(i).

Definitive Notes
     (i) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Indenture or the Notes, a Global Note may be exchanged for Notes of the same series registered in the names of any Person designated by the Depositary in the event that (a) the Depositary has notified the Obligor that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for such Global Note or such Depositary has ceased to be a "clearing agency" registered under the Exchange Act, at a time when the Depositary is required to be so registered in order to act as depositary, and the Obligor has not appointed a successor Depositary within 90 days of receiving such notice or of becoming aware of such cessation, (b) an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing with respect to the applicable Notes, or (c) the Obligor, in its sole discretion, determines that the applicable Notes issued in the form of Global Notes shall no longer be represented by such Global Notes as evidenced by a Company Order delivered to the Trustee. Any Global Note exchanged pursuant to clause (a) or (c) above shall be so exchanged in whole and not in part and any Global Note exchanged pursuant to clause (b) above may be exchanged in whole or from time to time in part as directed by the Depositary. Any Note issued in exchange for a Global Note of the same series or any portion thereof shall be a Global Note, provided that any such Note so issued that is registered in the name of a Person other than the Depositary or a nominee thereof shall not be a Global Note.
     (ii) If at any time the Depositary for the Notes of any series notifies the Obligor that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for such Notes or if the Depositary has ceased to be a "clearing agency" registered under the Exchange Act at a time when the Depositary is required to be so registered in order to act as depositary, the Obligor may within 90 days of receiving such notice or of becoming aware of such cessation appoint a successor Depositary with respect to such Notes.
     (iii) If, in accordance with this Section 2.04(4), Notes of any series in global form will no longer be represented by Global Notes, the Obligor will execute, and the Trustee, upon receipt of an Authentication Order, will authenticate and make available for delivery, Definitive Notes of such series in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Global Notes of such series, in exchange for such Global Notes.
     (iv) If a Definitive Note is issued in exchange for any portion of a Global Note after the close of business at the office or agency where such exchange occurs on any Record Date for the payment of interest and before the opening of business at such office or agency on the next succeeding Interest Payment Date, interest shall not be payable on such Interest Payment Date in respect of such Definitive Notes, but shall be payable on such Interest Payment Date only to the Person to whom interest in respect of such portion of such Global Note is payable in accordance with the provisions of this Indenture.
 
     (v) Definitive Notes issued in exchange for a Global Note pursuant to this Section 2.04(4) shall be registered in such names and in such authorized denominations as the Depositary, pursuant to instructions from its direct or indirect participants or otherwise, shall instruct the Trustee. Upon execution and authentication, the Trustee shall deliver such Definitive Notes to the Persons in whose names such Notes are so registered. To permit registrations of transfers and exchanges, the Obligor shall execute and the Trustee (or an Authenticating Agent appointed pursuant to this Indenture) shall authenticate and make available for delivery Definitive Notes at the Registrar's request, and upon direction of the Obligor. No service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or exchange, but the Obligor or the Trustee may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any transfer tax or other governmental charge payable in connection with any registration of transfer or exchange.
     (vi) When Definitive Notes are presented to the Trustee with a request to register the transfer of such Definitive Notes or to exchange such Definitive Notes for an equal principal amount of Definitive Notes of other authorized denominations of the same series, the Trustee shall register the transfer or make the exchange as requested if its requirements for such transaction are met; provided, however, that the Definitive Notes surrendered for transfer or exchange shall be duly endorsed or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form reasonably satisfactory to the Obligor and the Trustee, duly executed by the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing.
     (vii) At such time as all interests in Global Notes of any series have either been exchanged for Definitive Notes of such series or cancelled, such Global Notes shall be cancelled by the Trustee in accordance with the standing procedures and instructions existing between the Depositary and the Custodian. At any time prior to such cancellation, if any interest in a Global Note of any series is exchanged for Definitive Notes of such series or cancelled, the principal amount of such Global Note shall, in accordance with the standing procedures and instructions existing between the Depositary and the Custodian, be reduced and an endorsement shall be made on such Global Note, by the Trustee or the Custodian, at the direction of the Trustee, to reflect such reduction.
     (5) Notwithstanding anything in this Indenture to the contrary, (i) all Notes issued upon any registration of transfer or exchange of Notes shall be the valid obligations of the Obligor, evidencing the same debt, and entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture, as the Notes surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange, (ii) all transfers and exchanges of the Notes may be made only in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Indenture, and (iii) the transfer and exchange of a beneficial interest in a Global Note may only be effected through the Depositary in accordance with the procedures promulgated by the Depositary.
     (6) The Obligor shall not be required to (i) issue, register the transfer of, or exchange any Note during a period beginning at the opening of business 15 days before the day of the mailing of a notice of redemption of Notes under Section 10.03 and ending at the close of business on the date of such mailing or (ii) register the transfer of or exchange any Note so selected for redemption in whole or in part, except, in the case of any Note to be redeemed in part, the portion thereof not to be redeemed.
 
     (7) The Trustee shall have no obligation or duty to monitor, determine or inquire as to compliance with any restrictions on transfer imposed under this Indenture or under applicable law with respect to any transfer of any interest in any Note (including any transfers between or among Depositary participants or beneficial owners of interests in any Global Note) other than to require delivery of such certificates and other documentation or evidence as are expressly required by, and to do so if and when expressly required by the terms of, this Indenture, and to examine the same to determine substantial compliance as to form with the express requirements hereof.
               None of the Trustee, Registrar, Paying Agent or any Authenticating Agent shall have any responsibility for any actions taken or not taken by the Depositary.

     (2) In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Note has become or is about to become due and payable, the Obligor in its discretion may, instead of issuing a new Note, pay such Note.
     (3) Upon the issuance of any new Note under this Section 2.05, the Obligor may require the payment by the Holder thereof of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected therewith.
     (4) Every new Note issued pursuant to this Section 2.05 in lieu of any mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Note shall constitute an original contractual obligation of the Obligor, whether or not the mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Note shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Notes duly issued hereunder.
     (5) The provisions of this Section 2.05 are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes.

the close of business on the applicable Record Date, notwithstanding any transfer or exchange of such Note subsequent to such Record Date and prior to such Interest Payment Date (unless, if so provided in such Note, such Interest Payment Date is also the Maturity Date, in which case such interest shall be payable to the Person to whom principal is payable).
     (2) Any interest on any Note which is payable, but is not punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date (herein called "Defaulted Interest") shall forthwith cease to be payable to the registered Holder on the applicable Record Date by virtue of his having been such Holder; and, except as hereinafter provided, such Defaulted Interest may be paid by the Obligor, at its election in each case, as provided in clause (i) or (ii) below:
     (i) The Obligor may elect to make payment of any Defaulted Interest to the Persons in whose names any such Notes (or their respective Predecessor Notes) are registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest, which shall be fixed in the following manner. The Obligor shall notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of Defaulted Interest proposed to be paid on each such Note and the date of the proposed payment, and at the same time the Obligor shall deposit with the Trustee an amount of money equal to the aggregate amount proposed to be paid in respect of such Defaulted Interest or shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for such deposit prior to the date of the proposed payment, such money when deposited to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such Defaulted Interest as in this clause provided. Thereupon the Trustee shall fix a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest which shall be not more than 15 nor less than 10 days prior to the date of the proposed payment and not less than 10 days after the receipt by the Trustee of the notice of the proposed payment. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Obligor of such Special Record Date and, in the name and at the expense of the Obligor, shall cause notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor to be mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to the Holder of each such Note at his address as it appears in the Security Register, not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date. Notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor having been mailed as aforesaid, such Defaulted Interest shall be paid to the Persons in whose names such Notes (or their respective Predecessor Notes) are registered on such Special Record Date and shall no longer be payable pursuant to the following clause (ii).
     (ii) The Obligor may make payment of any Defaulted Interest in any other lawful manner if, after notice given by the Obligor to the Trustee of the proposed payment pursuant to this clause (ii), such manner of payment shall be deemed practicable by the Trustee.
     (3) If any installment of interest on any Note called for redemption pursuant to Article X is due and payable on or prior to the Redemption Date and is not paid or duly provided for on or prior to the Redemption Date in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.06, such interest shall be payable as part of the Redemption Price of such Notes.
 
     (4) Interest on Notes may be paid at the office or agency maintained by the Obligor in New York City pursuant to Section 9.02 or, at the Obligor's option, through DTC, to the Person entitled thereto or by such other means as may be specified in the form of such Note.
     (5) Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.06 and the provisions of Section 2.04, each Note delivered under this Indenture upon registration of transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of any other Note shall carry the rights to interest accrued and unpaid, and to accrue, which were carried by such other Note.

     (1) Prior to due presentment of a Note for registration of transfer, the Obligor, the Guarantor, the Trustee, and any agent of the Obligor, the Guarantor or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name any Note is registered on the Security Register as the owner of such Note for the purpose of receiving payment of principal, premium, if any, and (subject to Section 2.06) interest, and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not such Note is overdue and neither the Obligor, the Guarantor, the Trustee, nor any agent of the Obligor, the Guarantor or the Trustee shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
     (2) None of the Obligor, the Guarantor, the Trustee, any Authenticating Agent, any Paying Agent, the Registrar or any Co-Registrar will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests of a Global Note or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interests and each of them may act or refrain from acting without liability on any information relating to such records provided by the Depositary.
          SECTION 2.08. . All Notes surrendered for payment, redemption, registration of transfer or exchange shall, if surrendered to any Person other than the Trustee, be delivered to the Trustee and, if not already cancelled, shall be promptly cancelled by it. The Obligor may at any time deliver to the Trustee for cancellation any Notes previously authenticated and delivered hereunder which the Obligor may have acquired in any manner whatsoever, and all Notes so delivered shall be promptly cancelled by the Trustee. Acquisition of such Notes by the Obligor shall not operate as a redemption or satisfaction of the indebtedness represented by such Notes unless and until the same are delivered to the Trustee for cancellation. No Note shall be authenticated in lieu of or in exchange for any Notes cancelled as provided in this Section 2.08, except as expressly permitted by this Indenture. The Trustee shall dispose of all cancelled Notes in accordance with its customary procedures and, upon written request, deliver a certificate of such disposition to the Obligor.

Acceleration of Maturity; Rescission and Annulment
     (1) If any Event of Default (other than an Event of Default specified in clause (iv) or (v) of Section 4.01(1)) with respect to the Notes of any series occurs and is continuing, then either the Trustee or the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Notes of such series may declare the principal of all Outstanding Notes of such series, and the interest, if any, accrued thereon, to be immediately due and payable by notice in writing to the Obligor (and to the Trustee if given by Holders). If an Event of Default described in clause (iv) or (v) of Section 4.01(1) occurs, then the principal amount of all the Notes then outstanding and interest accrued thereon, if any, will become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or the Holders of the Notes, to the full extent permitted by applicable law.

     (a) all overdue installments of interest, if any, on such series of Notes,
     (b) the principal of (and premium, if any, on) any such series of Notes which have become due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration, and interest thereon at the rate prescribed therefor by the Notes of such series, to the extent that payment of such interest is lawful,
     (c) interest on overdue installments of interest at the rate prescribed therefor by the Notes of such series to the extent that payment of such interest is lawful, and
     (d) the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee and its agents and counsel, and all other amounts due the Trustee under Section 5.07; and
     (ii) all Events of Default, other than the nonpayment of the principal of the Notes of such series which have become due solely by such acceleration, have been cured or waived as provided in Section 4.13.
     (3) No such rescission shall affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereon.
     SECTION 4.03. .
Collection of Indebtedness and Suits for Enforcement
     (1) The Obligor covenants that if:
     (i) default is made in the payment of any installment of interest on any Note of any series when such interest becomes due and payable, or
     (ii) default is made in the payment of (or premium, if any, on) the principal of any Note of any series at the Maturity thereof, and
     (iii) any such default continues for any period of grace provided in relation to such default pursuant to Section 4.01,
then, with respect to such series of Notes, the Obligor will, upon demand of the Trustee, pay to it, for the benefit of the Holders of the Notes of such series, the whole amount then due and payable on all Notes of such series for principal (and premium, if any) and interest, together with interest (to the extent that payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable) upon the overdue principal (and premium, if any) and upon overdue installments of interest at the rate of interest prescribed therefor by the Notes of such series; and, in addition thereto, such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of collection, including the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel and all other amounts due the Trustee under Section 5.07.
 
     (2) If the Obligor fails to pay such amounts forthwith upon such demand, the Trustee, in its own name and as trustee of an express trust, may institute a judicial proceeding for the collection of the sums so due and unpaid, and may prosecute such proceeding to judgment or final decree, and may enforce the same against the Obligor or any other obligor upon such Notes and collect the money adjudged or decreed to be payable in the manner provided by law out of the property of the Obligor or any other obligor upon such Notes, wherever situated.
     (3) If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing with respect to any series of Notes, the Trustee may in its discretion proceed to protect and enforce its rights and the rights of the Holders of such series of Notes by such appropriate judicial proceedings as the Trustee shall deem most effectual to protect and enforce any such rights, whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement in this Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any power granted herein, or to enforce any other proper remedy.
          SECTION 4.04. .
Trustee May File Proofs of Claim
     (1) In case of the pendency of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition, or other judicial proceeding relative to the Obligor or any obligor upon the Notes or the property of the Obligor or of such other obligor or their creditors, the Trustee (irrespective of whether the principal of the Notes shall then be due and payable as therein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Trustee shall have made any demand on the Obligor for the payment of overdue principal or interest) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceedings or otherwise,
     (i) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of principal, premium, if any, and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Notes, and to file such other papers or documents as may be necessary and advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements, and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and all other amounts due the Trustee under Section 5.07) and of the Holders allowed in such judicial proceedings, and
     (ii) to collect and receive any moneys or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same; and any receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator (or other similar official) in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder to make such payments to the Trustee, and in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders, to pay to the Trustee any amount due to it for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee and its agent and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 5.07.
     (2) Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Notes or the rights of any Holder thereof, or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder in any such proceeding.
 
          SECTION 4.05. . All rights of action and claims under this Indenture or the Notes of any series may be prosecuted and enforced by the Trustee without the possession of any of the Notes of such series or the production thereof in any proceeding relating thereto, and any such proceeding instituted by the Trustee shall be brought in its own name as trustee of an express trust, and any recovery of judgment shall, after provision for the payment of the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee and its agents and counsel, be for the ratable benefit of the Holders of the Notes of such series.

Upon request of the Obligor and the Guarantor and, in the case of Section 8.02, upon filing with the Trustee of evidence of an Act of Holders as aforementioned, the Trustee shall join with the Obligor and the Guarantor in the execution of such supplemental indenture unless such supplemental indenture affects the Trustee's own rights, powers, trusts, duties or immunities under this Indenture or otherwise, in which case the Trustee may in its discretion, but shall not be obligated to, enter into such supplemental indenture.
