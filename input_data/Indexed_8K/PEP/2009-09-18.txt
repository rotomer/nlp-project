If any shareholder delivers to the Corporation a written notice setting forth the shareholder's current address, the requirement that notice be given to the shareholder shall be reinstated.

Except as otherwise prescribed by statute, notice of any adjourned meeting of shareholders need not be given.
Notice of Meetings
Section 2.6 All shares of one or more classes or series that under the Articles of Incorporation or the North Carolina Business Corporation Act are entitled to vote and be counted together collectively on a matter at a meeting of shareholders constitute a voting group within the meaning of the North Carolina Business Corporation Act. All shares entitled by the Articles of Incorporation or the North Carolina Business Corporation Act to vote generally on a matter are for that purpose a single voting group. Classes or series of shares shall not be entitled to vote separately by voting group unless expressly authorized by the Articles of Incorporation or specifically required by law. At any meeting of the shareholders of the Corporation, each shareholder entitled to vote may vote in person or by proxy provided that no proxy shall be voted after eleven (11) months from its date unless said proxy provides for a longer period. Unless otherwise provided by the Articles of Incorporation or By-laws, action on a matter by a voting group for which a quorum is present is approved if the votes cast within the voting group favoring the action exceed the votes cast opposing the action. The vote for the election of directors, other matters expressly prescribed by statute, and, upon the direction of the presiding officer of the meeting, the vote on any other question before the meeting, shall be by ballot. At all meetings of shareholders, the polls shall be opened and closed, the proxies and ballots shall be received, taken in charge and examined, and all questions concerning the qualifications of voters, the validity of proxies and the acceptance or rejection of proxies and of votes shall be decided by three (3) inspectors of election. Such inspectors of election, together with one alternate, to serve in the event of death, inability or refusal by any of said inspectors of election to serve at the meeting, none of whom need be a shareholder of the Corporation, shall be appointed by the Board,
Voting, Inspectors of Election.
 
or, if no such appointment or appointments shall have been made, then by the presiding officer at the meeting. If, for any reason, any inspector of election so appointed shall fail to attend, or refuse or be unable to serve, a substitute shall be appointed to serve as inspector of election, in his place or stead, by the presiding officer at the meeting. No director or candidate for the office of director shall be appointed as an inspector. Each inspector shall take and subscribe an oath or affirmation to execute faithfully the duties of inspector at such meeting with strict impartiality and according to the best of his ability. After the balloting, the inspectors shall make a certificate of the result of the vote taken.
Section 2.7 . Except as otherwise prescribed by statute, the Articles of Incorporation or in a By-Law approved by the shareholders, at any meeting of the shareholders of the Corporation, shares entitled to vote as a separate voting group may take action on a matter at the meeting only if a quorum of that voting group exists. The presence in person or by proxy of the holders record of a majority of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter by the voting group constitutes a quorum of that voting group for action on that matter. Once a share is represented for any purpose at a meeting, it is deemed present for quorum purposes for the remainder of the meeting and for any adjournment of that meeting unless a new record date is or must be set for that adjourned meeting. In the absence of a quorum at such meeting or any adjournment or adjournments thereof, the holders of record of a majority of such shares so present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote thereat may adjourn the meeting from time to time until a quorum shall be present. At any such adjourned meeting at which a quorum is present, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally called. Meetings of the shareholders shall be presided over by the Chairman of the Board, or, if the Chairman is not present, by another officer or director who shall be designated to serve in such event by the Board. The Secretary of the Corporation, or an Assistant Secretary designated by the officer presiding at the meeting, shall act as Secretary of the meeting.
Quorum, Presiding Officer
Section 2.8 . It shall be the duty of the officer of the Corporation who shall have charge of the stock ledger of the Corporation, either directly or through another officer designated by him or through a transfer agent or transfer clerk appointed by the Board, to prepare and make a complete list of shareholders entitled to notice of a shareholders' meeting, arranged in alphabetical order by voting group, and showing the address of and number of shares held by each shareholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of any shareholder at the place where said election is to be held beginning two (2) business days after notice of the meeting is given for which the list was prepared, and shall be produced and kept at the time and place of election, during the whole time thereof, subject to the inspection of any shareholder who may be present.
Lists of Shareholders
 
Section 3.1 . The property, business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by the Board. The Board shall consist of fourteen (14) directors, but the number of directors may be increased, and may be decreased to any number not less than three (3), by resolution adopted by three-fourths of the whole Board; provided, however, that the number of directors which shall constitute the whole Board shall not be reduced to a number less than the number of directors then in office, unless such reduction shall become effective only at and after the next ensuing meeting of shareholders for the election of directors, or upon the resignation of an incumbent director. Each director shall hold office from the time of his election and qualification until the annual meeting of shareholders next succeeding his election and until his successor shall have been duly elected and shall have qualified, or until his death, resignation or removal. The term of a director elected to fill a vacancy expires at the next shareholders' meeting at which directors are elected. A decrease in the number of directors does not shorten an incumbent director's term. No director need be a shareholder. Except as provided in Section 6.4, the directors shall be elected at the annual meeting of shareholders. Those persons who receive the highest number of votes at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall be deemed to have been elected. Only persons who are nominated in accordance with the provisions set forth in these By-Laws shall be eligible to be elected as directors at an annual or special meeting of shareholders called for that purpose. Nomination for election to the Board shall be made by or at the direction of the Board or a nominating committee appointed by the Board. Nomination for election of any person to the Board may also be made by a shareholder at any annual meeting, in accordance with Section 2.2, and at a special meeting of shareholders called for that purpose, if made by the close of business on the seventh day following the date on which notice of such special meeting is first given to shareholders and otherwise made in accordance with Section 2.2.

Except as otherwise prescribed by statute, the Articles of Incorporation or these By-Laws, and except in the case of a special meeting of the Board called for the purpose of removing an officer or officers of the Corporation or the filling of a vacancy or vacancies in the Board or of amending the By-Laws, notice or waivers of notice of any meeting of the Board need not set forth the purpose or purposes of the meeting.

Except as otherwise prescribed by statute or by these By-Laws, the presence of a majority of the full Board shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at any meeting, and the act of a majority of the directors present at a meeting at which a quorum shall be present shall be the act of the Board. Any meeting of the Board may be adjourned by a majority vote of the directors present at such meeting. In the absence of a quorum, the Chairman of the Board or a majority of the directors present may adjourn such meeting until a quorum shall be present. Notice of any adjourned meeting need not be given. The directors shall act only as a board and the individual directors shall have no power as such.
Quorum
Section 3.7 . Unless the Board of Directors shall determine otherwise, the Corporation shall indemnify, to the full extent permitted by law, any person who was or is, or who is threatened to be made, a party to an action, suit or proceeding (and any appeal therein), whether civil, criminal, administrative, investigative or arbitrative, by reason of the fact that he, his testator or intestate, is or was a director, officer or employee of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer or employee of another enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with such action, suit or proceeding. Such indemnification may, in the discretion of the Board, include advances of a director's, officer's or employee's expenses prior to final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding. The right of indemnification provided for in this Section 3.7 shall not exclude any rights to which such persons may otherwise be entitled by contract or as a matter of law. The Board shall take all such action as may be necessary and appropriate to authorize the Corporation to pay the indemnification required by this By-Law, including, without limitation, making a determination that indemnification is permissible in the circumstances and a good faith evaluation of the manner in which the claimant for indemnity acted and of the reasonable amount of indemnity due him.
