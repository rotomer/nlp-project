Once vested and exercisable, and until terminated or expired, all or any portion of the Options may be exercised from time to time and at any time under procedures that the Committee or its delegate shall establish from time to time, including, without limitation, procedures regarding the frequency of exercise and the minimum number of Options which may be exercised at any time.

3. . Subject to terms and conditions set forth herein, Options may be exercised by giving written notice of exercise to PepsiCo in the manner specified from time to time by PepsiCo. The aggregate Option Exercise Price for the shares being purchased, together with any amount which the Company may be required to withhold upon such exercise in respect of applicable foreign, federal (including FICA), state and local taxes, must be paid in full at the time of issuance of such shares.
Exercise Procedure
 4. .  
Effect of Termination of Employment, Retirement, Death and Total Disability
(a) . Options may vest only while the Participant is actively employed by the Company. Thus, no vesting shall occur following the termination of the Participant's active employment with the Company, and, subject to subparagraphs 4(b) and 4(c), all unvested Options shall automatically be forfeited and cancelled upon the date that the Participant's active employment with the Company terminates. Only vested Options may be exercised. Subject to subparagraphs 4(b) and 4(c), vested Options shall be exercisable until, and shall automatically be forfeited and cancelled upon, the earlier of the Expiration Date and the date that is the last trading day on the New York Stock Exchange during the 90-calendar day period after the date the Participant's employment with the Company terminates. It is intended that an authorized severance leave of absence may extend employment for purposes of determining the period when vested Options may be exercised. However, an authorized severance leave of absence will not be treated as active employment, and, as a result, vesting of unvested Options will not be extended by any such period.
Termination of Employment
(b) . If the Participant's employment terminates prior to the Vesting Date, by reason of the Participant's Retirement (as defined below) prior to attaining at least age 62, then: (i) a portion of the Options shall vest on the Participant's last day of active employment with the Company, with such portion determined in proportion to the Participant's active service (measured in calendar days) during the period commencing on the Grant Date and ending on the Vesting Date (the ""); (ii) such Options shall continue to become exercisable in accordance with Paragraph A.2 of this Agreement, with no change in the earliest date of exercise as a result of the vesting provided by this subparagraph 4(b); and (iii) the Options may be exercised by the Participant prior to the Expiration Date in accordance with this Agreement.  
Retirement Prior to Age 62
Vesting Period
(c) . If the Participant's employment terminates by reason of the Participant's Retirement after attaining at least age 62, death or Total Disability (as defined below), then: (i) the Options shall become fully vested on the Participant's last day of active employment with the Company (which, for purposes of Total Disability, means the effective date of Total Disability); (ii) the Options shall continue to become exercisable in accordance with Paragraph A.2 of this Agreement, with no change in the earliest date of exercise as a result of the vesting provided by this subparagraph 4(c); and (iii) the Options may be exercised by the Participant's legal representative (or any person to whom the Options may be transferred by will or the applicable laws of descent and distribution), in the event of death, or the Participant, in the event of Retirement or Total Disability, prior to the Expiration Date in accordance with this Agreement.
Retirement on or After Age 62, Death or Total Disability
5. . At any time after any Option becomes exercisable, the Committee shall have the right, in its sole discretion and without the consent of the Participant, to cancel such Option and to cause PepsiCo to pay to the Participant the excess of the Fair Market Value of the shares of Common Stock covered by such Option over the Option Exercise Price of such Option as of the date the Committee provides written notice (the "") of its intention to exercise such right. Payments of such buy out amounts pursuant to this provision shall be effected by PepsiCo as promptly as possible after the date of the Buy Out Notice and shall be made in shares of Common Stock. The number of shares shall be the greatest number of whole shares determined by dividing the amount of the payment to be made by the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock at the date of the Buy Out Notice. Payments of any such buy out amounts shall be made net of the minimum applicable foreign, federal (including FICA), state and local withholding taxes, if any.

Performance Stock Units
Code
2. . Performance Stock Units may only vest while the Participant is actively employed by the Company. Subject to Paragraphs B.3 and B.4 below, the Performance Stock Units earned in accordance with Paragraph B.3 shall vest on the Vesting Date and be paid as soon as practicable after such date (the ""). Performance Stock Units that become earned and payable shall be settled in shares of PepsiCo Common Stock with the Participant receiving one share of PepsiCo Common Stock for each Performance Stock Unit earned. No fractional shares shall be delivered under this Agreement, and so any fractional share that may be payable shall be rounded to the nearest whole share. Any amount that the Company may be required to withhold upon the settlement of Performance Stock Units and/or the payment of dividend equivalents (see Paragraph B.5 below) in respect of applicable foreign, federal (including FICA), state and local taxes, must be paid in full at the time of the issuance of shares or payment of cash.

Vesting and Payment
Payment Date
3. . The Participant can earn between 0% and 125% of the target number of Performance Stock Units granted hereunder. The number of Performance Stock Units that are earned shall be determined based on the achievement of performance targets. Any Performance Stock Units that are not earned in accordance with this Paragraph B.3 shall be forfeited and cancelled. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Performance Stock Units shall be earned as follows:
Earning and Forfeiture of Performance Stock Units
(a) One-half of the Performance Stock Units shall be earned based on and subject to the level of achievement of the 2010-2011 two-year average PepsiCo core constant currency earnings per share growth target pursuant to the performance scale previously established by the Committee and communicated to the Participant. The Committee shall determine and certify the results of the level of achievement of such target.
(b) One-half of the Performance Stock Units shall be earned based on and subject to the level of achievement of the 2010-2011 two-year average PepsiCo constant currency international net revenue growth as a multiple of PepsiCo constant currency North America net revenue growth target pursuant to the performance scale previously established by the Committee and communicated to the Participant. The Compensation Committee shall determine and certify the results of the level of achievement of such target.
(c)  Notwithstanding the achievement of any performance targets established under Paragraphs B.3(a) and (b) above, the Committee has the discretion to reduce the number of Performance Stock Units paid. In the case of a Participant's death or Total Disability (as defined below), the Committee's right to exercise this discretion shall expire with respect to each one-half of the Performance Stock Units at the later of: (i) the Participant's death or Total Disability (whichever applies), or (ii) the date the Committee certifies the results for the specific performance targets that relate to such one-half of the Performance Stock Units, which certification shall occur within sixty (60) days of the end of 2011. In all other cases, the Committee's right to exercise this discretion with respect to all of the Performance Stock Units earned shall continue until the date on which the Performance Stock Units are paid to the Participant. Except in the case of death or Total Disability, the Performance Stock Units for which a Participant has satisfied the performance criteria will be payable in one payment on the Payment Date.
(a) . Performance Stock Units may vest and become payable only while the Participant is actively employed by the Company. Thus, vesting ceases upon the termination of the Participant's active employment with the Company. Subject to subparagraphs 4(b) and 4(c), all unvested Performance Stock Units shall automatically be forfeited and canceled upon the date that the Participant's active employment with the Company terminates regardless of whether any such Performance Stock Units have previously been earned in accordance with Paragraph B.3 above. An authorized severance leave of absence will not be treated as active employment, and, as a result, the vesting of Performance Stock Units will not be extended by any such period.
Termination of Employment
(b) . If the Participant's employment terminates prior to the Vesting Date, by reason of the Participant's Retirement (as defined below) prior to attaining at least age 62, then a whole number of the target Performance Stock Units granted hereunder shall vest on the Participant's last day of active employment with the Company, with such number determined in proportion to the Participant's active service (measured in calendar days) during the Vesting Period. All Performance Stock Units that vest in accordance with the foregoing sentence shall remain subject to the earning and forfeiture provisions of Paragraphs B.2 and B.3 (with subparagraphs 3(a) and 3(b) of Paragraph B each being applied to one-half of the Performance Stock Units that vest in accordance with the foregoing sentence and with subparagraph 3(c) being applied to all such Performance Stock Units).
Retirement Prior to Age 62
(c) . If the Participant's employment terminates by reason of the Participant's Retirement after attaining at least age 62, death or Total Disability (as defined below), then the Performance Stock Units granted hereunder shall become fully vested on the Participant's last day of active employment with the Company (which, for purposes of Total Disability, means the effective date of Total Disability). All such vested Performance Stock Units shall remain subject to the earning and forfeiture provisions of Paragraphs B.2 and B.3, except that, in the case of death or Total Disability, payment of each one half of the Performance Stock Units granted hereunder will be made within fourteen (14) days after the Committee's right to exercise discretion with respect to such one half expires in accordance with Paragraph B.3(c).
Retirement on or After Age 62, Death or Total Disability
5. . During the Vesting Period, the Participant shall accumulate dividend equivalents with respect to the Performance Stock Units, which dividend equivalents shall be paid in cash (without interest) to the Participant only if and when the applicable Performance Stock Units vest and become payable. Dividend equivalents shall equal the dividends actually paid with respect to PepsiCo Common Stock during the Vesting Period while (and to the extent) the Performance Stock Units remain outstanding and unpaid. For purposes of determining the dividend equivalents accumulated under this Paragraph B.5, any Performance Stock Units that become payable hereunder shall be considered to have been outstanding from the Grant Date. Upon the forfeiture of Performance Stock Units, any accumulated dividend equivalents attributable to such Performance Stock Units shall also be forfeited.
Dividend Equivalents
6. . The Participant shall have no rights as a holder of PepsiCo Common Stock with respect to the Performance Stock Units granted hereunder unless and until such Performance Stock Units have been settled in shares of Common Stock that have been registered in the Participant's name as owner.
No Rights as Shareholder
. In consideration of the Company disclosing and providing access to Confidential Information, as more fully described in Paragraph C.2 below, after the date hereof, the grant by the Company of the Options and Performance Stock Units, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Participant and the Company, intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as follows.  
C. 
Prohibited Conduct
1. . The Participant hereby covenants and agrees that at all times during his or her employment with the Company and for a period of twelve months after the termination of the Participant's employment with the Company for any reason whatsoever (including a termination due to the Participant's Retirement), he or she will not, without the prior written consent of PepsiCo's chief personnel officer or chief legal officer, either directly or indirectly, for himself/herself or on behalf of or in conjunction with any other person, partnership, corporation or other entity, engage in any activities prohibited in the following Paragraphs C.1(a) through (c):  
Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation
(a) The Participant shall not, in any country in which the Company operates, accept any employment, assignment, position or responsibility, provide services in any capacity or acquire any ownership interest that involves the Participant's Participation in an entity that markets, sells, distributes or produces Covered Products, unless such entity makes retail sales or consumes Covered Products without in any way competing with the Company;  
(b) With respect to Covered Products, the Participant shall not directly or indirectly solicit for competitive business purposes any customer or Prospective Customer of the Company called on, serviced by, or contacted by the Participant in any capacity during his or her employment; or

Notwithstanding anything in this Paragraph C.1, the Participant shall not be considered to be in violation of Paragraph C.1(a) solely by reason of owning, directly or indirectly, up to five percent (5%) in the aggregate of any class of securities of any publicly traded corporation engaged in the prohibited activities described in Paragraph C.1(a).
2. . In order to assist the Participant with his or her duties, the Company shall continue to provide the Participant with access to confidential and proprietary operational information and other confidential information which is either information not known by actual or potential competitors, customers and third parties of the Company or is proprietary information of the Company (""). Such Confidential Information shall include all non-public information the Participant acquired as a result of his or her positions with the Company which might be of any value to a competitor of the Company, or which might cause any economic loss or substantial embarrassment to the Company or its customers, bottlers, distributors or suppliers if used or disclosed. Examples of such Confidential Information include, without limitation, non-public information about the Company's customers, suppliers, distributors and potential acquisition targets; its business operations, structure and methods of operation; its product lines, formulae and pricing; its processes, machines and inventions; its research and know-how; its production techniques; its financial data; its advertising and promotional ideas and strategy; information maintained in its computer systems; devices, processes, compilations of information and records; and its plans and strategies.  The Participant agrees that such Confidential Information remains confidential even if committed to the Participant's memory.  The Participant agrees, during the term of his or her employment and at all times thereafter, not to use, divulge, or furnish or make accessible to any third party, company, corporation or other organization (including but not limited to, customers, competitors, or governmental agencies), without the Company's prior written consent, any Confidential Information of the Company, except as necessary in his or her position with the Company.

During the term of his or her employment with the Company, the Participant shall not engage in any of the following acts that are considered to be contrary to the Company's best interests: (a) breaching any contract with or violating any obligation to the Company, including the Company's Code of Conduct, Insider Trading Policy or any other written policies of the Company, (b) unlawfully trading in the securities of PepsiCo or of any other company based on information gained as a result of his or her employment with the Company, (c) committing a felony or other serious crime, (d) engaging in any activity that constitutes gross misconduct in the performance of his or her employment duties, or (e) engaging in any action that constitutes gross negligence or misconduct and that causes or contributes to the need for an accounting adjustment to PepsiCo's financial results.  
Misconduct
5. . The Participant agrees that: (a) the terms and provisions of this Agreement are reasonable and constitute an otherwise enforceable agreement to which the terms and provisions of this Paragraph C are ancillary or a part of; (b) the consideration provided by the Company under this Agreement is not illusory; (c) the restrictions contained in this Paragraph C are necessary and reasonable for the protection of the legitimate business interests and goodwill of the Company; and (d) the consideration given by the Company under this Agreement, including, without limitation, the provision by the Company of Confidential Information to the Participant, gives rise to the Company's interest in the covenants set forth in this Paragraph C.  
Reasonableness of Provisions
6. . The Participant specifically recognizes and affirms that each of the covenants contained in Paragraphs C.1 through C.4 of this Agreement is a material and important term of this Agreement which has induced the Company to provide for the award of the Options and/or Performance Stock Units granted hereunder, the disclosure of Confidential Information referenced herein, and the other promises made by the Company herein.  The Participant further agrees that in the event that (i) the Company determines that the Participant has breached any term of Paragraphs C.1 through C.4 or (ii) all or any part of Paragraph C is held or found invalid or unenforceable for any reason whatsoever by a court of competent jurisdiction in an action between the Participant and the Company, in addition to any other remedies at law or in equity the Company may have available to it, the Company may in its sole discretion:  
Repayment and Forfeiture
(a) cancel any unexercised Options or unpaid Performance Stock Units granted hereunder;  
(b) require the Participant to pay to the Company all gains realized from the exercise of any Options granted hereunder; and/or  
(c) require the Participant to pay to the Company the value (determined as of the date paid) of any Performance Stock Units granted hereunder that have been paid out.  
7. . In the event the Company determines that the Participant has breached or attempted or threatened to breach any term of Paragraph C, in addition to any other remedies at law or in equity the Company may have available to it, it is agreed that the Company shall be entitled, upon application to any court of proper jurisdiction, to a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction (without the necessity of (a) proving irreparable harm, (b) establishing that monetary damages are inadequate or (c) posting any bond with respect thereto) against the Participant prohibiting such breach or attempted or threatened breach by proving only the existence of such breach or attempted or threatened breach.
Equitable Relief
8. . The Participant agrees that the period during which the covenants contained in this Paragraph C shall be effective shall be computed by excluding from such computation any time during which the Participant is in violation of any provision of Paragraph C.
Extension of Restrictive Period
9. . The Company and the Participant agree that it was their intent to enter into a valid and enforceable agreement.  The Participant and the Company thereby acknowledge the reasonableness of the restrictions set forth in Paragraph C, including the reasonableness of the geographic area, duration as to time and scope of activity restrained.  The Participant further acknowledges that his or her skills are such that he or she can be gainfully employed in noncompetitive employment and that the agreement not to compete will not prevent him or her from earning a living.  The Participant agrees that if any covenant contained in Paragraph C of this Agreement is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to contain limitations as to time, geographical area, or scope of activity that are not reasonable and impose a greater restraint than is necessary to protect the goodwill or other business interest of the Company, then the court shall reform the covenant to the extent necessary to cause the limitations contained in the covenant as to time, geographical area, and scope of activity to be restrained to be reasonable and to impose a restraint that is not greater than necessary to protect the goodwill and other business interests of the Company and to enforce the covenants as reformed.
Acknowledgments
10. . The covenants on the part of the Participant in this Paragraph C shall be construed as an agreement independent of any other agreement, including any employee benefit agreement, and independent of any other provision of this Agreement, and the existence of any claim or cause of action of the Participant against the Company, whether predicated upon this Agreement or otherwise, shall not constitute a defense to the enforcement by the Company of such covenants.
Provisions Independent
11. . The Participant agrees that the Company may notify any person or entity employing the Participant or evidencing an intention of employing the Participant of the existence and provisions of this Agreement.
Notification of Subsequent Employer

Participant Acknowledgements.
(a) the Option and/or Performance Stock Unit grant will be exclusively governed by the terms of the Plan, including the right reserved by the Company to amend or cancel the Plan at any time without the Company incurring liability to the Participant (except for Options and Performance Stock Units already granted under the Plan);  
(b) the Participant has been provided a copy of PepsiCo's Prospectus relating to the Plan, the Options, Performance Stock Units and the shares covered thereby;  
(c) stock options, restricted stock units and performance stock units are not a constituent part of the Participant's salary and that the Participant is not entitled, under the terms and conditions of his/her employment, or by accepting or being awarded the Options and/or Performance Stock Units pursuant to this Agreement to require options, restricted stock units or other awards to be granted to him/her in the future under the Plan or any other plan;
(d) upon exercise of the Options or payment of Performance Stock Units the Participant will arrange for payment to the Company an estimated amount to cover employee payroll taxes resulting from the exercise and/or, to the extent necessary, any balance may be withheld from the Participant's wages;
(e) benefits received under the Plan will be excluded from the calculation of termination indemnities or other severance payments;
(f) in the event of termination of the Participant's employment, a severance or notice period to which the Participant may be entitled under local law and which follows the date of termination specified in a notice of termination or other document evidencing the termination of the Participant's employment will not be treated as active employment for purposes of this Agreement and, as a result, vesting of unvested Options or Performance Stock Units will not be extended by any such period;
(g) the Participant will seek all necessary approval under, make all required notifications under and comply with all laws, rules and regulations applicable to the ownership of stock options and stock and the exercise of stock options, including, without limitation, currency and exchange laws, rules and regulations; and  
(g) this Agreement will be interpreted and applied so that the Options, in all cases, and Performance Stock Units, to the extent possible, will not be subject to Code Section 409A. To the extent the Performance Stock Units are subject to Code Section 409A because of the Participant's eligibility for Retirement, then payments limited to the earliest permissible payment date under Code Section 409A shall be made following a Change in Control only (i) upon a Change in Control if it qualifies under Code Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(v) (a ""), and (ii) upon a termination of employment if it occurs after a 409A CIC and it constitutes a Section 409A separation from service (and in this case, the six-month delay of Code Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) shall apply to "specified employees," determined under the default rules of Section 409A or such other rules as apply generally under the Company's Section 409A plans).
