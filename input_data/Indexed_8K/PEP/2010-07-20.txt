EXHIBIT 99.1
Q2 Financial Highlights
PURCHASE, N.Y., July 20 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/  PepsiCo, Inc. (NYSE: PEP) today reported solid top- and bottom-line results for the second quarter of 2010, driven by the acquisition of its two anchor bottlers, broad-based gains across its snack and beverage portfolio in key international markets, disciplined investments in strategic initiatives and prudent cost controls.
"We posted a solid second quarter, exceeding our core constant currency EPS growth target for the first half of the year," said PepsiCo Chairman and CEO Indra Nooyi. "Our results reflect our ability to generate sustainable growth across a global snack and beverage portfolio despite continued macroeconomic challenges. In line with our plan, our bottler integration is on track and unlocking opportunities and efficiencies. We continue to make investments in near- and long-term opportunities across both our developed and emerging markets, and I'm very pleased that we've taken a disciplined approach to our activities in North America. All of these things give us confidence that we can generate strong, sustainable growth in the second half of 2010 and beyond."
 
 
PepsiCo Chief Financial Officer Hugh Johnston said: "We are benefiting from both the acquisition of our anchor bottlers earlier this year and from improving trends across our global business. As planned, we have stepped up incremental investments around the world to capitalize on untapped consumer demand, including investments in marketplace infrastructure to support both our expanding China beverage business and innovation across our global snacks portfolio. We remain confident in our ability to meet our full-year core constant currency EPS target of 11 to 13 percent."
 
 
All references below to net revenue and core operating profit are on a constant currency basis.
In PepsiCo Americas Foods (PAF):
volume, net revenue and operating profit results were driven by the favorable impact of the bottling acquisitions, improving sequential organic volume trends across the product portfolio and synergies.
PepsiCo Americas Beverages (PAB)
volume, net revenue and operating profit growth were driven by improved sequential performance and broad-based gains across the region in both snacks and beverages, the favorable impact of the bottling acquisitions and successful implementation of growth and productivity initiatives.
Europe
 
broad-based volume gains in both snacks and beverages drove strong top-line performance. As planned, core profit growth decelerated versus the first quarter of 2010 as the region made significant investments to expand its footprint in key growth markets such as China and India. A strong productivity agenda and tight cost controls helped to offset cost pressures. Acquisitions had a nominal impact on net revenue growth and a half-percentage-point unfavorable impact on profit growth.
AMEA's
Tax Rate
PepsiCo's reported tax rate was 29.9 percent in the second quarter, versus 25.4 percent in the prior-year period. The increase in the rate was primarily driven by the resolution of certain tax matters in the prior year and the impact of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) in the current quarter. PepsiCo's core tax rate was 28.9 percent for the second quarter. The company expects its full-year reported tax rate to be roughly 23 to 24 percent, which reflects a benefit of about 4 percentage points from non-core items.
Cash Flow
Year-to-date cash flow from operating activities was $2.4 billion. Management operating cash flow, which is net of capital expenditures, was $1.5 billion and included: $0.2 billion of merger and integration payments associated with our bottling acquisitions, $0.6 billion ($0.4 billion, net of tax) related to a discretionary contribution to PepsiCo's pension funds, $28 million related to 2009 restructuring charges and $100 million ($64 million, net of tax) related to a donation to the PepsiCo Foundation. Management operating cash flow, excluding these items, was $2.2 billion.
In the third quarter the company plans to make a $600 million discretionary contribution to PepsiCo's pension funds.
For the year, the company expects cash flow from operating activities to be about $7.9 billion and management operating cash flow, which is net of capital expenditures, to be about $4.3 billion, including: discretionary contributions to PepsiCo's pension funds of $1.2 billion, about $0.4 billion of merger and integration payments associated with our bottling acquisitions, the $100 million donation to the Foundation, $28 million related to 2009 restructuring charges, about $200 million in capital investments related to the bottler integration, and about $600 million of cash tax benefits related to these items. Management operating cash flow, excluding these items, is expected to be approximately $5.6 billion. The company expects to invest about $3.6 billion in net capital spending in 2010.
 
Guidance
For fiscal 2010, the company is targeting an 11 to 13 percent growth rate for core constant currency EPS from its fiscal 2009 core EPS of $3.71. Based on current spot rates, foreign exchange translation would represent a one percentage point unfavorable impact on the company's full-year, core EPS. As a result, growth in core EPS for the year is expected to be in the 10 to 12 percent range.
Synergies
The company is targeting pre-tax annualized synergies from the bottling acquisitions of approximately $400 million once fully implemented by 2012, with one-time costs of approximately $650 million to achieve these synergies. Of the approximate $650 million in costs, roughly $225 million is non-cash and represents the impact of the consolidation and rationalization of certain manufacturing assets. Synergies to be realized in 2010 are expected to total approximately $125 million to $150 million.
Uses of Cash
In the second quarter, the company repurchased $2.6 billion in common stock, or 39 million shares. The company also spent $739 million on dividends in the quarter. The company plans to make a $600 million discretionary contribution to PepsiCo's pension funds in the third quarter, and it anticipates that share repurchases will total approximately $4.4 billion in 2010.
Impact of Venezuelan Devaluation
As of the beginning of the company's 2010 fiscal year, Venezuela is accounted for under hyperinflationary accounting rules, and the functional currency of our Venezuelan entities has changed from the Bolivar to the U.S. dollar. Effective January 11, 2010, the Venezuelan government devalued the Bolivar by resetting the official exchange rate from 2.15 Bolivars per dollar to 4.3 Bolivars per dollar, with certain activities permitted to access an exchange rate of 2.6 Bolivars per dollar.
In 2010, the company expects that the majority of its Venezuelan foreign exchange transactions will be re-measured at the 4.3 exchange rate. As a result of the change to hyperinflationary accounting and the devaluation of the Bolivar, the company recorded a one-time net charge in the first quarter of 2010 of $120 million.
Please refer to the Glossary for more information about the items excluded from the company's fiscal 2010 core constant currency EPS guidance.
At 8 a.m. (Eastern Time) today, the company will host a conference call with investors to discuss second quarter results and the outlook for full-year 2010. Further details, including a slide presentation accompanying the call, will be accessible on the company's website at www.pepsico.com/investors in advance of the call.

:
Constant currency: Financial results (historical and projected) assuming constant foreign currency exchange rates used for translation based on the rates in effect for the comparable prior-year period. In addition, the impact on EPS growth is computed by adjusting core EPS growth by the after-tax foreign currency translation impact on core operating profit growth using PepsiCo's core effective tax rate.
Division operating profit: The aggregation of the operating profit for each of our reportable segments, which excludes the impact of corporate unallocated expenses.
Effective net pricing: The combined impact of mix and price.
Management operating cash flow: Net cash provided by operating activities less capital spending plus sales of property, plant and equipment. This non-GAAP financial measure is our primary measure used to monitor cash flow performance. See the attached exhibits for a reconciliation of this measure to the most directly comparable financial measure in accordance with GAAP (operating cash flow).
 
Management operating cash flow, excluding certain items: Management operating cash flow, excluding: (1) discretionary pension contributions in both 2010 and 2009, (2) restructuring payments in connection with our Productivity for Growth initiative in 2009, (3) acquisition and integration payments paid in 2010 in connection with our PBG and PAS acquisitions, (4) a contribution to The PepsiCo Foundation in 2010, and (5) the tax impacts associated with each of these items, as applicable. See the attached exhibits for a reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure in accordance with GAAP (operating cash flow).
Mark-to-market gain or loss or net impact: Change in market value for commodity contracts that we purchase to mitigate the volatility in costs of energy and raw materials that we consume. The market value is determined based on average prices on national exchanges and recently reported transactions in the marketplace.
Net pricing: The combined impact of list price changes, weight changes per package, discounts and allowances.
Net capital spending: Capital spending less cash proceeds from sales of property, plant and equipment.
Pricing: The impact of list price changes and weight changes per package.
Transaction foreign exchange: The foreign exchange impact on our financial results of transactions, such as purchases of imported raw materials, commodities, or services, occurring in currencies other than the local, functional currency.

Division operating profit, core results and core constant currency results are non-GAAP financial measures as they exclude certain items noted below. However, we believe investors should consider these measures as they are more indicative of our ongoing performance and with how management evaluates our operational results and trends.
Commodity mark-to-market net impact
In the 12 weeks ended June 12, 2010, we recognized $4 million of mark-to-market net losses on commodity hedges in corporate unallocated expenses. In the 24 weeks ended June 12, 2010, we recognized $42 million of mark-to-market net gains on commodity hedges in corporate unallocated expenses. In the 12 and 24 weeks ended June 13, 2009, we recognized $100 million and $162 million, respectively, of mark-to-market net gains on commodity hedges in corporate unallocated expenses. In the year ended December 26, 2009, we recognized $274 million of mark-to-market net gains on commodity hedges in corporate unallocated expenses. We centrally manage commodity derivatives on behalf of our divisions. Certain of these commodity derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and are marked to market with the resulting gains and losses recognized in corporate unallocated expenses. These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions take delivery of the underlying commodity.
PBG/PAS merger and integration charges
In the 12 weeks ended June 12, 2010, we incurred merger and integration charges of $155 million related to our acquisitions of PBG and PAS, including $103 million recorded in the PAB segment, $28 million recorded in the Europe segment and $24 million recorded in corporate unallocated expenses. In the 24 weeks ended June 12, 2010, we incurred merger and integration charges of $467 million related to our acquisitions of PBG and PAS, including $296 million recorded in the PAB segment, $29 million recorded in the Europe segment, $112 million recorded in corporate unallocated expenses and $30 million recorded in interest expense. These charges are being incurred to help create a more fully integrated supply chain and go-to-market business model, to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the distribution of our brands and to enhance our revenue growth. These charges also include closing costs, one-time financing costs and advisory fees related to the acquisitions. In addition, in the 24 weeks ended June 12, 2010 we recorded $9 million of charges, representing our share of the respective merger costs of PBG and PAS, recorded in bottling equity income. In the year ended December 26, 2009, we incurred $50 million of costs associated with these acquisitions, as well as an additional $11 million of costs representing our share of the respective merger costs of PBG and PAS, recorded in bottling equity income.
2009 restructuring and impairment charges
As a result of our previously initiated Productivity for Growth program, in the 12 and 24 weeks ended June 13, 2009 we recorded $11 million and $36 million, respectively, of restructuring and impairment charges. The program includes actions in all segments of the business, including the closure of six plants that we believe will increase cost competitiveness across the supply chain, upgrade and streamline our product portfolio and simplify the organization for more effective and timely decision-making.
Gain on previously held equity interests in PBG and PAS
In the first quarter of 2010, in connection with our acquisitions of PBG and PAS, we recorded a gain on our previously held equity interests of $958 million, comprising $735 million which is non-taxable and recorded in bottling equity income and $223 million related to the reversal of deferred tax liabilities associated with these previously held equity interests.
Inventory fair value adjustments
In the 12 weeks ended June 12, 2010, we recorded $76 million of incremental costs, substantially all in cost of sales, related to fair value adjustments to the acquired inventory and other related hedging contracts included in PBG's and PAS's balance sheets at the acquisition date, including $36 million recorded in the PAB segment and $40 million recorded in the Europe segment. In the 24 weeks ended June 12, 2010, we recorded $357 million of incremental costs, substantially all in cost of sales, related to fair value adjustments to the acquired inventory and other related hedging contracts included in PBG's and PAS's balance sheets at the acquisition date, including $317 million recorded in the PAB segment and $40 million recorded in the Europe segment.
Venezuela currency devaluation
As of the beginning of our 2010 fiscal year, we recorded a one-time $120 million net charge related to our change to hyperinflationary accounting for our Venezuelan businesses and the related devaluation of the bolivar fuerte (bolivar). $129 million of this net charge was recorded in corporate unallocated expenses, with the balance (income of $9 million) recorded in our PAB segment.
 
Asset write-off for SAP software
In the first quarter of 2010, we recorded a $145 million charge related to a change in scope of one release in our ongoing migration to SAP software. This change was driven, in part, by a review of our North America systems strategy following our acquisitions of PBG and PAS. This change does not impact our overall commitment to continue our implementation of SAP across our global operations over the next few years.
Foundation contribution
In the first quarter of 2010, we made a $100 million contribution to The PepsiCo Foundation, Inc. (Foundation), in order to fund charitable and social programs over the next several years. This contribution was recorded in corporate unallocated expenses.
Additionally, management operating cash flow is the primary measure management uses to monitor cash flow performance. This is not a measure defined by GAAP. Since net capital spending is essential to our product innovation initiatives and maintaining our operational capabilities, we believe that it is a recurring and necessary use of cash. As such, we believe investors should also consider net capital spending when evaluating our cash from operating activities.
We are not able to reconcile our full-year projected 2010 core constant currency EPS to our full-year projected 2010 reported results because we are unable to predict the 2010 full-year impact of foreign exchange or the mark-to-market net gains or losses on commodity hedges due to the unpredictability of future changes in foreign exchange rates and commodity prices. Therefore, we are unable to provide a reconciliation of these measures.
