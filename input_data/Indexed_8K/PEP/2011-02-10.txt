EXHIBIT 99.1
 PepsiCo, Inc. (NYSE: PEP) today reported volume, revenue and profit growth for the fourth quarter and full year of 2010 driven by gains across its worldwide snacks and beverage businesses, and from the acquisitions of its anchor bottlers earlier in the year. Full-year reported earnings per share increased 4 percent to $3.91, core earnings per share increased 12 percent to $4.13 and core constant currency earnings per share grew 12 percent. For the quarter, reported EPS declined 6 percent to $0.85, core EPS grew 17 percent to $1.05, and core constant currency EPS grew 19 percent.
PURCHASE, N.Y.  February 10, 2011
"We are pleased with PepsiCo's performance in the fourth quarter and for the full year. The underlying performance of our businesses remained solid despite a challenging macroeconomic environment," said PepsiCo Chairman and CEO Indra Nooyi. "We posted broad-based worldwide gains in both snacks and beverages, our businesses deftly balanced a delicate price-value consumer equation, and we aggressively managed costs and productivity to deliver top-tier financial results."
Ms. Nooyi continued, "Importantly, we are entering 2011 an even-stronger, more-capable organization:
 
 
"We are encouraged by the momentum of our businesses as we enter 2011, and are mindful of three realities:
"Our earnings outlook reflects our considered perspective on the marketplace and the macroeconomic picture, and we are confident we have the operating capability, portfolio strength and financial flexibility to effectively compete in this environment."
PepsiCo Chief Financial Officer Hugh Johnston said, "In addition to our strong fundamental operating performance in 2010, our businesses also generated strong cash flow. The company generated $6.9 billion of management operating cash flow, excluding certain items, representing a 23 percent increase over 2009."
"We delivered more than $150 million in synergies from the bottler acquisitions in 2010, above our target for the year. The strong pace of synergy realization and the identification of additional synergies have led us to increase our expectation for total synergies through 2012 to more than $550 million."

Division Operating Summaries
PepsiCo Americas Foods (PAF)
Frito-Lay North America (FLNA)
FLNA increased its dollar share leadership position in measured channels in salty snacks for the full year and grew operating profit 8 percent for the full year, its strongest profit growth performance in a decade. Profit growth in the quarter and for the full year benefited from lower input costs and from strong productivity gains and cost control.
Volume grew slightly in the fourth quarter and units grew 1 percent. Volume growth continued to be impacted by cycling the "20% More Free" promotion from 2009. Lay's performance led growth, with strong consumer response to the activation of Lay's All-Natural Ingredients, and continued strong double-digit growth in Sabra dips and spreads.
For the full year, volume declined 1 percent, with unit growth up more than 1 percent. Volume growth was adversely impacted by cycling the "20% More Free" promotion. Net revenue growth for the quarter and full year reflected the impacts of volume performance and effective net pricing.
Latin America Foods (LAF)
Strong performance for the quarter and full year benefited from broad-based volume gains, especially in LAF's largest businesses in Mexico and in Brazil. Volume, revenue and operating profit growth in both the quarter and full year were driven by strong innovation, price-pack management and marketplace execution.
Quaker Foods North America (QFNA)
Performance for the quarter and full year reflected declines in the hot cereals and ready-to-eat cereals categories, and a competitive pricing environment. QFNA invested in improving its quality and in innovation launched in the second half of 2010 that will continue to receive marketing support in 2011.
PepsiCo Americas Beverages (PAB)
In a highly competitive environment, North America volume (excluding the impact of incremental volume from the agreement with Dr Pepper Snapple Group) grew 1 percent in the quarter behind strong performance of the company's advantaged non-carbonated beverage portfolio. The fourth quarter of 2010 marks the company's fifth consecutive quarter of sequential improvement in organic volume performance in North America. PAB widened its liquid refreshment beverage volume share advantage versus its primary competitor in the U.S. in measured channels for the quarter and the full year.
Volume, revenue and operating profit growth for the quarter and full year benefited from the impact of the anchor bottler acquisitions.
Europe
Snacks performance in the quarter was driven by double-digit gains in Russia and broad gains across much of Europe. Performance in Eastern Europe was generally stronger than in the developed markets of Western Europe where macroeconomic conditions remained challenged.
Beverage volume grew 5 percent in the quarter and for the full year, excluding the impact of the anchor bottler acquisitions. Gains were broad based, and particularly strong in Eastern Europe where the company posted double-digit gains in Russia, Turkey, the Ukraine and Poland in the quarter. Growth for the full year was also driven by strong performance in Russia, Turkey and Poland.
Growth in snack and beverage volumes, revenue and operating profit was supported by delivering differentiated value through promotion and price-pack management, innovative marketing and broadening the portfolio into adjacencies. Operating profit in the fourth quarter was adversely impacted by higher costs
 
related to potato crop shortages in Russia. Volume, revenue and operating profit growth in beverages for the quarter and the full year benefited from the impact of the anchor bottler acquisitions.
For the year, the company gained value share in snacks and CSDs in Europe with particularly strong snack gains in the key emerging market of Russia.
Asia, Middle East & Africa (AMEA)
Snack and beverage volume gains for the quarter and full year were led by strong performance in key emerging markets.
The Middle East, India and China each grew snack volumes strong double digits, and acquisitions contributed two points of snacks volume growth in the quarter and for the full year.
Beverage performance for the quarter was led by high-single-digit growth in the Middle East, 9 percent growth in China and double-digit growth in India. For the full year, beverage volume was led by double-digit growth in India and China.
The company gained one CSD share point in China, and gained relative share versus its closest competitor in India in the most recent quarter. The company further strengthened its position in India through the formation of a joint venture with Tata Global Beverages to develop and market hydration beverages for the India market.
Full-year operating profit was negatively impacted by the lapping of the gain from the formation of a joint venture with Calbee in Japan in the third quarter of 2009 as well as from marketplace investment spending.
Tax Rate
PepsiCo's reported tax rate was 23.0 percent for the full year versus 26.0 percent in 2009. PepsiCo's core tax rate was 26.9 percent which compares to a core tax rate of 25.6 percent in 2009.
Cash Flow
Full-year cash flow from operating activities was $8.4 billion. Management operating cash flow, which is net of capital expenditures, was $5.3 billion and included: after-tax merger and integration payments of $0.3 billion; $1.0 billion of after-tax discretionary contributions to PepsiCo's pension and retiree medical plans; capital expenditures of $0.1 billion related to the bottler integration; after-tax interest costs related to a debt repurchase of $0.1 billion; and other items as set out in the attached financial schedules. Management operating cash flow excluding these items was $6.9 billion, an increase of 23 percent from 2009.
The company returned $8 billion of cash to shareholders in 2010 through share repurchases of $5 billion and dividends of $3 billion, bringing the cash returned to shareholders over the past three years through share repurchases and dividends to $18 billion.
Guidance
For 2011, the company is targeting earnings per share growth of 7 to 8 percent on a 52-week, core constant currency basis from its fiscal 2010 core EPS of $4.13. The company's outlook for 2011 anticipates high global commodity cost inflation, difficult macroeconomic conditions in developed markets and ongoing strategic investments in emerging markets and in brand-building activities. The company expects to benefit from synergies from the bottling acquisitions and the acquisition of Wimm-Bill-Dann. In addition, the company expects higher net interest expense and a core tax rate of approximately 27 percent. Based on current spot rates, foreign exchange translation would have between a one and two point favorable impact on the company's full-year, core EPS growth. The company anticipates share repurchases of approximately $2.5 billion in 2011. Beyond 2011, the company expects high-single-digit core constant currency EPS growth reflecting, in part, its outlook for commodity cost inflation and macroeconomic uncertainty.
Please refer to the glossary for more information about the items excluded from the company's fiscal 2011 core tax rate guidance and fiscal 2011 and longer-term core constant currency EPS guidance.
 
Anchor Bottler Synergies
The company expects total synergies of more than $550 million from the acquisitions of its anchor bottlers through 2012, with one-time costs of approximately $925 million, of which approximately $250 million is non-cash.
The above estimates compare to the company's prior synergy targets of $400 million once fully implemented by 2012 and one-time costs of approximately $650 million.

At 8 a.m. (Eastern Time) today, the company will host a conference call with investors to discuss fourth-quarter results and the outlook for full-years 2011 and beyond. Further details, including a slide presentation accompanying the call, will be accessible on the company's website at www.pepsico.com/investors in advance of the call.

Division operating profit, core results and core constant currency results are non-GAAP financial measures as they exclude certain items noted below. However, we believe investors should consider these measures as they are more indicative of our ongoing performance and with how management evaluates our operational results and trends.
Commodity mark-to-market net impact
In the quarter and year ended December 25, 2010, we recognized $33 million and $91 million, respectively, of mark-to-market net gains on commodity hedges in corporate unallocated expenses. In the quarter and year ended December 26, 2009, we recognized $83 million and $274 million, respectively, of mark-to-market net gains on commodity hedges in corporate unallocated expenses. We centrally manage commodity derivatives on behalf of our divisions. Certain of these commodity derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and are marked to market with the resulting gains and losses recognized in corporate unallocated expenses. These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions take delivery of the underlying commodity.
Merger and integration charges
In the quarter ended December 25, 2010, we incurred merger and integration charges of $263 million related to our acquisitions of PBG and PAS, as well as advisory fees in connection with our acquisition of WBD, including $133 million recorded in the PAB segment, $67 million recorded in the Europe segment and $63 million recorded in corporate unallocated expenses. In the year ended December 25, 2010, we incurred merger and integration charges of $799 million related to our acquisitions of PBG and PAS, as well as advisory fees in connection with our pending acquisition of WBD, including $467 million recorded in the PAB segment, $111 million recorded in the Europe segment, $191 million recorded in corporate unallocated expenses and $30 million recorded in interest expense. These charges also include closing costs, one-time financing costs and advisory fees related to the acquisitions. In addition, in the year ended December 25, 2010, we recorded $9 million of charges, representing our share of the respective merger costs of PBG and PAS, recorded in bottling equity income. In the quarter and year ended December 26, 2009, we incurred $49 million and $50 million, respectively, of costs associated with the mergers with PBG and PAS, as well as an additional $3 million and $11 million of costs in the quarter and year ended December 26, 2009, respectively, representing our share of the respective merger costs of PBG and PAS, recorded in bottling equity income.
Restructuring and impairment charges
As a result of our previously initiated Productivity for Growth program, in the year ended December 26, 2009, we recorded $36 million of restructuring and impairment charges.
Gain on previously held equity interests in PBG and PAS
In the first quarter of 2010, in connection with our acquisitions of PBG and PAS, we recorded a gain on our previously held equity interests of $958 million, comprising $735 million which is non-taxable and recorded in bottling equity income and $223 million related to the reversal of deferred tax liabilities associated with these previously held equity interests.
Inventory fair value adjustments
In the quarter ended December 25, 2010, in the PAB segment, we recorded $24 million of incremental costs, substantially all in cost of sales, related to hedging contracts included in PBG's and PAS's balance sheets at the acquisition date. In the year ended December 25, 2010, we recorded $398 million of incremental costs, substantially all in cost of sales, related to fair value adjustments to the acquired inventory and other related hedging contracts included in PBG's and PAS's balance sheets at the acquisition date, including $358 million recorded in the PAB segment and $40 million recorded in the Europe segment.
Venezuela currency devaluation
As of the beginning of our 2010 fiscal year, we recorded a one-time $120 million net charge related to our change to hyperinflationary accounting for our Venezuelan businesses and the related devaluation of the bolivar fuerte (bolivar). $129 million of this net charge was recorded in corporate unallocated expenses, with the balance (income of $9 million) recorded in our PAB segment.
 
Asset write-off for SAP software
In the first quarter of 2010, we recorded a $145 million charge related to a change in scope of one release in our ongoing migration to SAP software. This change was driven, in part, by a review of our North America systems strategy following our acquisitions of PBG and PAS. This change does not impact our overall commitment to continue our implementation of SAP across our global operations over the next few years.
Foundation contribution
In the first quarter of 2010, we made a $100 million contribution to The PepsiCo Foundation, Inc. (Foundation), in order to fund charitable and social programs over the next several years. This contribution was recorded in corporate unallocated expenses.
Interest expense incurred in connection with debt repurchase
In the quarter and year ended December 25, 2010, we paid $672 million in a cash tender offer to repurchase $500 million (aggregate principal amount) of our 7.90% senior unsecured notes maturing in 2018. As a result of this debt repurchase, we recorded a $178 million charge to interest expense, primarily representing the premium paid in the tender offer.
Management operating cash flow
Additionally, management operating cash flow is the primary measure management uses to monitor cash flow performance. This is not a measure defined by GAAP. Since net capital spending is essential to our product innovation initiatives and maintaining our operational capabilities, we believe that it is a recurring and necessary use of cash. As such, we believe investors should also consider net capital spending when evaluating our cash from operating activities.
2011 and longer-term guidance
Our 2011 core tax rate guidance and our 2011 and longer-term core constant currency EPS guidance exclude the commodity mark-to-market net impact included in corporate unallocated expenses; merger and integration charges related to PBG, PAS and WBD; and the impact of the 53 week in 2011. We are not able to reconcile our full-year projected 2011 core tax rate to our full-year projected 2011 reported tax rate or our full-year projected 2011 and longer-term core constant currency EPS to our full-year projected 2011 and longer-term reported results because we are unable to predict the 2011 and longer-term impacts of foreign exchange or the mark-to-market net gains or losses on commodity hedges due to the unpredictability of future changes in foreign exchange rates and commodity prices. Therefore, we are unable to provide a reconciliation of these measures.
