As previously disclosed, beginning in the first quarter of 2011, PepsiCo, Inc. (PepsiCo) realigned certain of its reportable segments to reflect changes in management responsibility. As a result, as of the beginning of PepsiCo's 2011 fiscal year, its Quaker snacks business in North America will be reported within its Quaker Foods North America (QFNA) segment. Prior to this change, Quaker snacks in North America was reported as part of PepsiCo's Frito-Lay North America (FLNA) segment. Additionally, as of the beginning of the first quarter of 2011, PepsiCo's South Africa snacks business will be reported within its Europe segment. Prior to this change, this business was reported as part of PepsiCo's Asia, Middle East & Africa (AMEA) segment. These changes did not impact PepsiCo's other existing reportable segments.
PepsiCo is filing this Current Report on Form 8-K to reclassify historical segment information to correspond with PepsiCo's current segment structure.
Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K, each of which is included herein, provide certain summarized reported, core and core constant currency financial results reflecting the above reportable segment changes. For further information about PepsiCo's core and core constant currency results, including a description of items excluded from these results, please refer to the Glossary and Exhibit 99.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
The changes in the reportable segment structure discussed above, as reflected in the information included in this Current Report on Form 8-K, affect only the manner in which the results for the QFNA, FLNA, Europe and AMEA segments were previously reported. This Current Report on Form 8-K does not reclassify nor restate PepsiCo's previously reported consolidated financial statements for any period. Beginning in 2011, PepsiCo's financial statements will reflect the realignment of its reportable segments with prior periods adjusted accordingly.
Glossary

EXHIBIT 99.2
Core results and core constant currency results are non-GAAP financial measures as they exclude certain items noted below. However, we believe investors should consider these measures as they are more indicative of our ongoing performance and with how management evaluates our operational results and trends.
Commodity mark-to-market net impact
In 2009 and 2010, we recognized mark-to-market net gains and losses on commodity hedges in corporate unallocated expenses. We centrally manage commodity derivatives on behalf of our divisions. Certain of these commodity derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and are marked to market with the resulting gains and losses recognized in corporate unallocated expenses. These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions take delivery of the underlying commodity.
Merger and integration charges
In 2009 and 2010, we incurred merger and integration charges (including closing costs, one-time financing costs and advisory fees) related to our acquisitions of PBG and PAS, as well as advisory fees, in 2010, in connection with our acquisition of Wimm-Bill-Dann Foods OJSC (WBD).
Restructuring and impairment charges
As a result of our previously initiated Productivity for Growth program, in 2009, we recorded restructuring and impairment charges.
Inventory fair value adjustments
In 2010, we recorded incremental costs, substantially all in cost of sales, related to fair value adjustments to the acquired inventory and other related hedging contracts included in PBG's and PAS's balance sheets at the acquisition date.
Venezuela currency devaluation
As of the beginning of our 2010 fiscal year, we recorded a one-time net charge related to our change to hyperinflationary accounting for our Venezuelan businesses and the related devaluation of the bolivar fuerte (bolivar).
Asset write-off for SAP software
In 2010, we recorded a charge related to a change in scope of one release in our ongoing migration to SAP software. This change was driven, in part, by a review of our North America systems strategy following our acquisitions of PBG and PAS. This change does not impact our overall commitment to continue our implementation of SAP across our global operations over the next few years.
Foundation contribution
In 2010, we made a contribution to The PepsiCo Foundation, Inc. (Foundation), in order to fund charitable and social programs over the next several years. This contribution was recorded in corporate unallocated expenses.
