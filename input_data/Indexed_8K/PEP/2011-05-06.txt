PepsiCo Senior Notes Offering
     On May 3, 2011, PepsiCo, Inc. ("PepsiCo") announced an offering of $750,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its floating rate notes due 2013 (the "2013 Floating Rate Notes") and $1,000,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 2.500% senior notes due 2016 (the "2016 Notes" and together with the 2013 Floating Rate Notes, the "Notes"). Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and RBS Securities Inc. were joint bookrunners for the offering of the Notes.
     The public offering price of the 2013 Floating Rate Notes was 100% of the principal amount and the public offering price of the 2016 Notes was 99.907% of the principal amount. PepsiCo is expected to receive net proceeds of approximately $1,740,000,000, after deducting underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses payable by PepsiCo after reimbursement. PepsiCo intends to use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes. The Notes were offered and sold pursuant to a Terms Agreement (the "Terms Agreement") dated May 3, 2011 (incorporating the Underwriting Agreement Standard Provisions dated May 3, 2011) among PepsiCo and the representatives of the several underwriters, under PepsiCo's automatic shelf registration statement (the "Registration Statement") on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-154314), filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on October 15, 2008. PepsiCo has filed with the SEC a prospectus supplement, dated May 3, 2011, together with the accompanying prospectus, dated October 15, 2008, relating to the offer and sale of the Notes.
     The Notes are expected to be issued on May 10, 2011 pursuant to an Indenture (the "Indenture") dated as of May 21, 2007 between PepsiCo and The Bank of New York Mellon, as Trustee. The 2013 Floating Rate Notes will bear interest at the rate of LIBOR plus 8 basis points, with interest payable on February 10, May 10, August 10 and November 10 of each year, beginning on August 10, 2011, and will mature on May 10, 2013. The 2016 Notes will bear interest at the rate of 2.500% per year, with interest payable on May 10 and November 10 of each year, beginning on November 10, 2011, and will mature on May 10, 2016. PepsiCo will be able to redeem some or all of the 2016 Notes at any time and from time to time at the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the Notes being redeemed and the discounted present value of such Notes, discounted at the corresponding U.S. Treasury rate plus 10 basis points. The Notes will be unsecured obligations of PepsiCo and will rank equally with all of PepsiCo's other unsecured senior indebtedness. The Indenture also contains customary event of default provisions.
     The above description of the Terms Agreement, the Indenture and the Notes is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Terms Agreement, the Indenture and the forms of Notes. Each of the Terms Agreement and the forms of 2013 Floating Rate Notes and 2016 Notes is incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement and is attached to this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 1.1, Exhibit 4.1 and Exhibit 4.2, respectively. The Board of Directors resolutions authorizing PepsiCo's officers to establish the terms of the Notes are attached as Exhibit 4.3 hereto. The Indenture was previously filed as Exhibit 4.3 to the Registration Statement.

     (iii) If, at any time when a Prospectus (or in lieu thereof the notice referred to in Rule 173(a) under the Securities Act) relating to any Underwritten Securities is required to be delivered under the Securities Act, any event occurs or condition exists as a result of which the Prospectus would include an untrue statement of a material fact, or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or if it is necessary to amend or supplement the Prospectus in order to comply with the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the respective rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder, or any other applicable law, the Company will promptly notify the Underwriters, by telephone or by facsimile (in either case with written confirmation from the Company by mail), to cease use and distribution of the Prospectus (and all then existing supplements thereto) and to suspend all efforts to resell the Underwritten Securities in its capacity as underwriter or dealer, as the case may be, and the Underwriters will promptly comply with the terms of such notice. The Company will forthwith prepare and cause to be filed with the Commission an amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, as the case may be, satisfactory in the reasonable judgment of the Underwriters to correct such statement or omission or to effect such compliance, and the Company will supply the Underwriters with one signed copy of such amended Registration Statement and as many copies of such amended or supplemented Prospectus as the Underwriters may reasonably request, , that the expense of preparing, filing, and supplying copies to the Underwriters of any such amendment or supplement will be borne by the Company only for the nine-month period immediately following the purchase of such Underwritten Securities by the Underwriters and thereafter will be borne by the Underwriters.
provided, however
     (iv) The Company will furnish to the Underwriters, without charge, as many copies of the Time of Sale Prospectus, the Prospectus, each preliminary prospectus, any documents incorporated by reference therein, and any supplements and amendments thereto and any free writing prospectus as the Underwriters may reasonably request.
 
     (v) The Company will, with such assistance from the Underwriters as the Company may reasonably request, endeavor to qualify the Securities for offer and sale under the Blue Sky laws or other securities laws of such jurisdictions as the Underwriters shall reasonably request and will maintain such qualifications for as long as required with respect to the offer, sale, and distribution of the Securities.
     (vi) The Company will make generally available to its security holders earnings statements that satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act and Rule 158 promulgated thereunder.
(b) Each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, covenants with the Company as follows:
     (i) It has not and will not use, authorize use of, refer to, or participate in the planning for use of, any "free writing prospectus," as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act (which term includes use of any written information furnished to the Commission by the Company and not incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement and any press release issued by the Company) (each such communication by the Company or its agents or representatives (excluding any Underwriter) an "") other than (A) a free writing prospectus that contains no "issuer information" (as defined in Rule 433(h)(2) under the Securities Act) that was not included (including through incorporation by reference) in the preliminary prospectus or a previously filed Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, (B) any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus listed on Schedule I to the applicable Terms Agreement or (C) any free writing prospectus prepared by such Underwriter and approved by the Company in advance in writing (each such free writing prospectus referred to in clauses (A) or (C), an "").

     (ii) It has not and will not distribute any Underwriter Free Writing Prospectus referred to in Section 9(b)(i)(A) above in a manner reasonably designed to lead to its broad unrestricted dissemination.
     (iii) It has not and will not, without the prior written consent of the Company, use any free writing prospectus that contains the final terms of the Underwritten Securities unless such terms have previously been included in a free writing prospectus filed with the Commission.
     (iv) It is not subject to any pending proceeding under Section 8A of the Securities Act with respect to the offering (and will promptly notify the Company if any such proceeding against it is initiated during the "", which means such period of time beginning on the first date of the public offering of the Underwritten Securities and ending on the later of the Closing Date or such date, as in the opinion of counsel for the Underwriters a prospectus relating to the Underwritten Securities is required by law to be delivered (or required to be delivered but for Rule 172 under the Securities Act) in connection with sales of the Underwritten Securities by any Underwriter or dealer).
Prospectus Delivery Period
     (v) Notwithstanding any of the above, each of the Underwriters may use one or more term sheets relating to the Underwritten Securities containing customary information, including Bloomberg email announcement, price talk guidance, comparable bond pricing and final pricing terms, not inconsistent with the form of the final term sheet referred to in the Terms Agreement, without the prior consent of the Company, so long as such term sheet is not required to be filed as a "free writing prospectus" with the Commission pursuant to Rule 433 under the Securities Act.
     . . (a) Except as provided in Section 10(b), the Company will pay all costs, fees, and expenses arising in connection with the sale of any Underwritten Securities through the Underwriters and in connection with the performance by the Company of its obligations hereunder and under any Terms Agreement, including the following: (i) expenses incident to the preparation and filing of the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus, the Prospectus, any free writing prospectus prepared by or on behalf of, used by, or referred to by the Company, and all amendments and supplements thereto, (ii) expenses incident to the issuance and delivery of such Underwritten Securities, (iii) the fees and disbursements of counsel for the Company and the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, (iv) if approved by the Company in advance and in writing, expenses incident to the qualification of such Underwritten Securities under Blue Sky laws and other applicable state securities laws in accordance with the provisions of Section 9(a)(v) hereof, including related filing fees and the reasonable fees and disbursements of the Underwriters' counsel in connection therewith and in connection with the preparation of any survey of Blue Sky laws, (v) expenses incident to the printing and delivery to the Underwriters, in the quantities hereinabove stated, of copies of the

The Representative, individually and not as representative of the Underwriters, may (but shall not be obligated to) make payment of the purchase price for the Underwritten Securities to be purchased by any Underwriter whose funds have not been received by the Closing Time, but such payment shall not relieve such Underwriter from its obligations hereunder.

Section 12
. Indemnification and Contribution.
     (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold each Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, harmless from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, or liabilities to which such Underwriter may become subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, or any other federal or state law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages, or liabilities (and actions in respect thereof) arise out of, are based upon, or are caused by any untrue statement or allegedly untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus, the Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of, are based upon or are caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and the Company agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party for any reasonable legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability, or action; , that the Company will not be liable to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of, are based upon, or are caused by any such untrue statement or omission or allegedly untrue statement or omission included in or omitted from the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished by the Underwriters in writing expressly for use in the Registration Statement or such preliminary prospectus or the Time of Sale Prospectus or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto.
provided, however
 
     (b) Each Underwriter severally agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers who sign the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to the Underwriters, but only with respect to such losses, claims, damages, and liabilities (and actions in respect thereof) that arise out of, are based upon, or are caused by any untrue statement or omission of a material fact or allegedly untrue statement or omission of a material fact included in or omitted from the Registration Statement, or any preliminary prospectus or the Time of Sale Prospectus or the Prospectus in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished by the Underwriters in writing expressly for use in the Registration Statement or such preliminary prospectus or the Time of Sale Prospectus or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto.
     (c) In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to either paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 12, such person (the "") will promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "") in writing and the indemnifying party, upon request of the indemnified party, will retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and will pay the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party will have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel will be borne by the indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and, in the judgment of the indemnified party, representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood that the indemnifying party will not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified parties and that all such reasonable fees and expenses will be reimbursed as they are incurred. Such firm will be designated in writing by the Underwriters (in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section 12) or by the Company (in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section 12), as the case may be. The indemnifying party will not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent, or if there shall be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. No indemnifying party will, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding. Any provision of this paragraph (c) to the contrary notwithstanding, no failure by an indemnified party to notify the indemnifying party as required hereunder will relieve the indemnifying party from any liability it may have had to an indemnified party otherwise than under this Section 12 to the extent the indemnifying party is not materially prejudiced as a result thereof and in any event shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement.

indemnifying party
     (d) If the indemnification provided for in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 12 is unavailable to an indemnified party or is insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages, or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying the indemnified party thereunder, will contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages, or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other, from the offering of the Underwritten Securities pursuant to the applicable Terms Agreement, or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other, in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages, or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other, in connection with the offering of the Underwritten Securities pursuant to the applicable Terms Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of such Underwritten Securities (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total underwriting discount
 
received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate initial public offering price of such Underwritten Securities as set forth on such cover. The relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and of the Underwriters, on the other, will be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or allegedly untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied or to be supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information, and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 12(d) are several in proportion to the number of Underwritten Securities set forth opposite their respective names in the applicable Terms Agreement, and not joint.
     (e) The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to paragraph (d) above were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to therein. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, and liabilities referred to in paragraph (d) above will be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any reasonable legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Any other provisions of this Section 12 to the contrary notwithstanding, (i) the Underwriters will not be required to contribute to the Company any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Underwritten Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission (other than in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished to the Company by the Underwriters in writing expressly for use in the Registration Statement, the preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto), and (ii) no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) will be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
     (f) The remedies provided for in this Section 12 are not exclusive and will not limit any rights or remedies that may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.
     The applicable Terms Agreement will automatically terminate upon the expiration of the offering to which the Prospectus relates. The applicable Terms Agreement may not be terminated by the Underwriters prior to delivery of and payment for such Securities except upon the failure of any of the conditions precedent described in Section 6 hereof.

Re:       PepsiCo, Inc.
Citigroup Global Markets Inc. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith       Incorporated RBS Securities Inc.     as Representatives of the several Underwriters named in the Underwriting Agreement referred to below
c/o Citigroup Global Markets Inc.     388 Greenwich Street     New York, New York 10013
Ladies and Gentlemen:
     We have acted as special counsel for PepsiCo, Inc. (the "Company"), a North Carolina corporation, in connection with the Terms Agreement dated May 3, 2011 (together with the PepsiCo, Inc. Underwriting Agreement Standard Provisions (the "Standard Provisions") dated May 3, 2011 incorporated therein, the "Underwriting Agreement") among you, as the representatives of the several underwriters named in the Underwriting Agreement (the "Underwriters"), and the Company, under which you and the other Underwriters have severally agreed to purchase from the Company $750,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its Floating Rate Notes due 2013 (the "Floating Rate Notes") and $1,000,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 2.500% Senior Notes due 2016 (the "2016 Notes" and, together with the Floating Rate Notes, the "Notes"). The Notes are to be issued pursuant to the provisions of an Indenture dated as of May 21, 2007 (the "Indenture") between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon, as Trustee. This opinion is being delivered to you at the request of the Company pursuant to Section 5(a) of the Standard Provisions.
     We have examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of such documents, corporate records, certificates of public officials and other instruments as we have deemed necessary or advisable for the purpose of rendering this opinion.
     We have participated in the preparation of the Company's registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-154314) (other than the documents incorporated by reference therein (the "Incorporated Documents")) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") pursuant to the provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), relating to the registration of securities (the "Shelf Securities") to be issued from time to time by the Company, the preliminary prospectus supplement dated May 3, 2011 relating to the Notes, the final term sheet dated May 3, 2011 describing certain terms of the Notes filed by the Company with the Commission pursuant to Rule 433 under the Act (the "Issuer Free Writing Prospectus") and the prospectus supplement dated May 3, 2011 relating to the Notes (the "Prospectus Supplement"), and have reviewed the Incorporated Documents. The registration statement became effective under the Act upon the filing thereof with the Commission on October 15, 2008 pursuant to Rule 462(e) under the Act. The registration statement at the date of the Underwriting Agreement, including the Incorporated Documents and the information deemed to be part of the registration statement at the time of effectiveness pursuant to Rule 430B under the Act, is hereinafter referred to as the "Registration Statement," and the related prospectus (including the Incorporated Documents) dated October 15, 2008 relating to the Shelf Securities is hereinafter referred to as the "Basic Prospectus." The Basic Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, in the form first used
 
to confirm sales of the Notes (or in the form first made available by the Company to the Underwriters to meet requests of purchasers of the Notes under Rule 173 under the Act), is hereinafter referred to as the "Prospectus."
     We have assumed the conformity of the documents filed with the Commission via the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval System ("EDGAR"), except for required EDGAR formatting changes, to physical copies of the documents submitted for our examination.
     Based upon the foregoing, we are of the opinion that:
     1. The Indenture was duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, and assuming due authorization, execution and delivery thereof by the Company, the Indenture is a valid and binding agreement of the Company, enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally, concepts of reasonableness and equitable principles of general applicability, provided that we express no opinion as to (x) the enforceability of any waiver of rights under any usury or stay law or (y) the effect of fraudulent conveyance, fraudulent transfer or similar provision of applicable law on the conclusions expressed above.
     2. Assuming the due authorization of the Notes by the Company, the Notes, when executed and authenticated in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture and delivered to and paid for by the Underwriters pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, will be valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally, concepts of reasonableness and equitable principles of general applicability, and will be entitled to the benefits of the Indenture pursuant to which such Notes are to be issued, provided that we express no opinion as to (x) the enforceability of any waiver of rights under any usury or stay law or (y) the effect of fraudulent conveyance, fraudulent transfer or similar provision of applicable law on the conclusions expressed above.
     3. No consent, approval, authorization, or order of, or qualification with, any governmental body or agency under the laws of the State of New York or any federal law of the United States of America that in our experience is normally applicable to general business corporations in relation to transactions of the type contemplated by the Indenture, the Notes and the Underwriting Agreement (collectively, the "Documents") is required for the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of its obligations under the Documents, except such as may be required under federal or state securities or Blue Sky laws as to which we express no opinion in this paragraph (3).
     4. Any required filing of the Prospectus pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Act has been made in the manner and within the time period required by Rule 424(b) under the Act; any required filing of the Issuer Free Writing Prospectus pursuant to Rule 433 under the Act has been made in the manner and within the time period required by Rule 433(d) under the Act; and, to our knowledge, no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued under the Act and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or are pending or threatened by the Commission.
     5. We have considered the statements included in the Prospectus under the captions "Description of Notes" and "Description of Debt Securities" insofar as they summarize provisions of the Indenture and the Notes. In our opinion, such statements fairly summarize these provisions in all material respects.
     6. The statements included in the Prospectus under the caption "Material United States Federal Tax Considerations," insofar as they purport to describe provisions of U.S. federal income tax laws or legal conclusions with respect thereto, fairly and accurately summarize the matters referred to therein in all material respects.

c/o Citigroup Global Markets Inc.       388 Greenwich Street       New York, New York 10013
Ladies and Gentlemen:
     We have acted as special counsel for PepsiCo, Inc. (the "Company"), a North Carolina corporation, in connection with the Terms Agreement dated May 3, 2011 (together with the PepsiCo, Inc. Underwriting Agreement Standard Provisions (the "Standard Provisions") dated May 3, 2011 incorporated therein, the "Underwriting Agreement") among you, as representatives of the several underwriters named in the Underwriting Agreement (the "Underwriters"), and the Company, under which you and the other Underwriters have severally agreed to purchase from the Company $750,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its Floating Rate Notes due 2013 (the "Floating Rate Notes") and $1,000,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 2.500% Senior Notes due 2016 (the "2016 Notes" and, together with the Floating Rate Notes, the "Notes"). The Notes are to be issued pursuant to the provisions of an Indenture dated as of May 21, 2007 (the "Indenture") between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon, as Trustee. This opinion is being delivered to you at the request of the Company pursuant to Section 5(a) of the Standard Provisions.
     We have participated in the preparation of the Company's registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-154314) (other than the documents incorporated by reference therein (the "Incorporated Documents")) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") pursuant to the provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), relating to the registration of securities (the "Shelf Securities") to be issued from time to time by the Company, the preliminary prospectus supplement dated May 3, 2011 (the "Preliminary Prospectus Supplement") relating to the Notes, the final term sheet dated May 3, 2011 describing the terms of the Notes filed by the Company with the Commission pursuant to Rule 433 under the Act (the "Issuer Free Writing Prospectus") and the prospectus supplement dated May 3, 2011 relating to the Notes (the "Prospectus Supplement"), and have reviewed the Incorporated Documents. The registration statement became effective under the Act upon the filing of the registration statement with the Commission on October 15, 2008 pursuant to Rule 462(e) under the Act. The registration statement at the date of the Underwriting Agreement, including the Incorporated Documents and the information deemed to be part of the registration statement at the time of effectiveness pursuant to Rule 430B under the Act, is hereinafter referred to as the "Registration Statement," and the related prospectus (including the Incorporated Documents) dated October 15, 2008 relating to the Shelf Securities is hereinafter referred to as the "Basic Prospectus." The Basic Prospectus, as supplemented by the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement, together with the Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, are hereinafter referred to as the "Disclosure Package." The Basic Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, in the form first used to confirm sales of the Notes (or in the form first made available by the
 
Company to the Underwriters to meet requests of purchasers of the Notes under Rule 173 under the Act), is hereinafter referred to as the "Prospectus."
     We have assumed the conformity of the documents filed with the Commission via the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval System ("EDGAR"), except for required EDGAR formatting changes, to physical copies of the documents submitted for our examination.
     We note that many determinations involved in the preparation of the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus are of a wholly or partially non-legal character or relate to legal matters outside the scope of our opinion separately delivered to you today in respect of certain matters under the laws of the State of New York and the federal laws of the United States of America. As a result, we are not passing upon, and do not assume any responsibility for, the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, and we have not ourselves checked the accuracy, completeness or fairness of, or otherwise verified, the information furnished in such documents (except to the extent expressly set forth in our opinion letter separately delivered to you today as to statements included in the Prospectus under the captions "Description of Notes," "Material United States Federal Tax Considerations" and "Description of Debt Securities"). However, in the course of our acting as counsel to the Company in connection with the preparation of the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, we have generally reviewed and discussed with your representatives and your counsel and with certain officers and employees of, and independent public accountants for, the Company the information furnished, whether or not subject to our check and verification. We have also reviewed and relied upon certain corporate records and documents, letters from counsel and accountants and oral and written statements of officers and other representatives of the Company and others as to the existence and consequence of certain factual and other matters.
     On the basis of the information gained in the course of the performance of the services rendered above, but without independent check or verification except as stated above:
     (i) the Registration Statement and the Prospectus appear on their face to be appropriately responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the Act and the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder; and
     (ii) nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that, insofar as relevant to the offering of the Notes:
     (a) on the date of the Underwriting Agreement, the Registration Statement contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading,
     (b) at 4:15 p.m. (New York City time) on May 3, 2011, the Disclosure Package contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or
     (c) the Prospectus as of the date of the Underwriting Agreement or as of the date hereof contained or contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
     In providing this letter to you and the other several Underwriters, we have not been called to pass upon, and we express no view regarding, the financial statements or financial schedules or other financial or accounting data included in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, or the Statement of Eligibility of the Trustee on Form T-1. In addition, we express no view as to the conveyance of the Disclosure Package or the information contained therein to investors.
     This letter is delivered solely to you and the other several Underwriters in connection with the Underwriting Agreement. This letter may not be relied upon by you for any other purpose or relied upon

     I have examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to my satisfaction, of such documents, corporate records, certificates of public officials and other instruments as I have deemed necessary for the purposes of rendering this opinion. I have assumed the capacity of all natural persons and the genuineness of all signatures.
     Based upon the foregoing and subject to the limitations set forth below, I am of the opinion that:
     1. The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of its obligations under the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture and the Notes will not contravene any provision of the Restated Articles of Incorporation or By-Laws of the Company, or of any agreement or other instrument binding upon the Company or any of its subsidiaries that is material to the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, or, to my knowledge, of any judgment, order, or decree of any governmental body, agency, or court having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its subsidiaries, in each of the foregoing cases except as would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole.
     2. To my knowledge, there is no legal or governmental proceeding pending or threatened to which the Company or any of its significant subsidiaries is a party, or by which any of the properties of the Company or its significant subsidiaries is bound, which would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole; and to my knowledge, there is no agreement or other document that is required to be described in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or the Time of Sale Prospectus, or that is required to be filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement, that is not so described or filed.
 
     In rendering the foregoing opinion, I have relied, as to matters of fact, to the extent I have deemed proper, on certificates of responsible officers of the Company and public officials. This opinion is limited to the laws of the State of New York and the federal laws of the United States of America. Insofar as this opinion involves matters governed by the laws of the State of North Carolina, I have relied, with your permission and without independent investigation, on the opinion delivered to you today by Womble Carlyle Sandridge & Rice, PLLC, North Carolina counsel for the Company.

           Re:      
PepsiCo, Inc.
Ladies and Gentlemen:
     We have acted as special North Carolina counsel to PepsiCo, Inc., a North Carolina corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the Terms Agreement dated May 3, 2011 (incorporating by reference the Underwriting Agreement Standard Provisions (the "Standard Provisions") dated May 3, 2011) (the "Terms Agreement" and, together with the Standard Provisions, the "Underwriting Agreement") between the Company and you, as representatives of the several underwriters named in the Underwriting Agreement (the "Underwriters"), under which you and the other Underwriters have severally agreed to purchase from the Company $750,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its Floating Rate Notes due 2013 (the "Floating Rate Notes") and $1,000,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 2.500% Senior Notes due 2016 (the "2016 Notes" and, together with the Floating Rate Notes, the "Notes"). The Notes are to be issued pursuant to the provisions of an indenture dated as of May 21, 2007 between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee (the "Indenture"). This opinion is delivered to you pursuant to Section 5(a) of the Standard Provisions. Capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined in this opinion have the meanings given to them in the Underwriting Agreement.
     As the Company's special North Carolina counsel, we have reviewed the Company's articles of incorporation and by-laws, each as amended to date, and the Underwriting Agreement, and have examined the originals, or copies certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of corporate records, certificates of public officials and of representatives of the Company, statutes and other instruments and documents, as a basis for the opinions hereinafter expressed. In rendering this opinion, we have relied upon certificates of public officials and representatives of the Company with respect to the accuracy of the factual matters contained in such certificates.
     In connection with such review, we have assumed with your permission: (a) that the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture and all other documents that are the subject of this opinion or on which this opinion is based (the "Transaction Documents") have been properly authorized, executed and delivered by each of the respective parties thereto other than the Company; (b) the genuineness of all signatures and the legal capacity of all signatories; (c) the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals and the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as certified or photostatic copies; (d) the proper issuance and accuracy of certificates of public officials and representatives of the Company; (e) the due authentication of the Notes in accordance with the Indenture and payment by the Underwriters of the purchase price for the Notes in accordance with the Underwriting Agreement; and (f) the truth and
 
accuracy of the representations, warranties and covenants of the Underwriters set forth in the Underwriting Agreement.
     This opinion is limited to the laws of the State of North Carolina, excluding local laws of the State of North Carolina (, the statutes and ordinances, the administrative decisions and the rules and regulations of counties, towns, municipalities and special political subdivisions of, or authorities or quasi-governmental bodies constituted under the laws of, the State of North Carolina and judicial decisions to the extent they deal with any of the foregoing) and the securities or Blue Sky laws of the State of North Carolina, and we are expressing no opinion as to the effect of the laws of any other jurisdiction.
i.e.
     The opinion in paragraph 1 relating to the existence of the Company in the State of North Carolina is given solely in reliance on a certificate of existence issued by the Secretary of State of the State of North Carolina dated May 10, 2011.
     Based on and subject to the foregoing and the qualifications and limitations set forth below, and having regard for such legal considerations as we deem relevant, it is our opinion that:
     1. The Company is a corporation in existence under the laws of the State of North Carolina, with corporate power to conduct its business as described in the Time of Sale Prospectus and the Prospectus.
     2. The Company has authorized by all necessary corporate action the execution and delivery of the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture and the Notes.
     3. The Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture and the Notes have been duly executed by the Company.
     4. The execution and delivery of and performance by the Company of its obligations under the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture and the Notes do not violate any provision of the articles of incorporation or by-laws of the Company.
     5. No consent, approval, authorization, or order of or qualification with any North Carolina governmental body or agency is required to be obtained or made by the Company for the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Underwriting Agreement or the issuance of the Notes, except as may be required by the Blue Sky or other securities laws if the Notes are offered or sold in North Carolina and except for consents, approvals, authorizations, actions, filings and registrations which, if not obtained or made, are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole.
     Nothing contained in this opinion letter shall be construed as an opinion as to the enforceability of the Transaction Documents or as an opinion as to whether the execution and delivery of the Indenture and the Notes, or the authorization thereof, comply with applicable provisions of such instruments and of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended. This opinion letter is delivered solely for your benefit in connection with the Underwriting Agreement and the transactions provided for therein and may not be quoted in whole or in part, referred to, filed with any governmental agency or otherwise used or relied upon by any other person or for any other purpose without our prior written consent.
     This opinion is rendered as of the date hereof, and we undertake no obligation to advise you of any changes in applicable law or any other matters that may come to our attention after the date hereof.

The interest rate in effect during the initial interest period will be equal to LIBOR plus 8 basis points, determined two London Business Days (as defined below) prior to May 10, 2011.

Calculation Agent
Interest Determination Date
     LIBOR, with respect to any Interest Determination Date, will be the offered rate for deposits of U.S. dollars having a maturity of three months that appears on "Reuters Page LIBOR01" at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on such Interest Determination Date. If on an Interest Determination Date, such rate does not appear on the "Reuters Page LIBOR01" as of 11:00 a.m., London time, or if "Reuters Page LIBOR01" is not available on such date, the Calculation Agent will obtain such rate from Bloomberg L.P. page "BBAM."
 
     If no offered rate appears on "Reuters Page LIBOR01" or Bloomberg L.P. page "BBAM" on an Interest Determination Date, LIBOR will be determined for such Interest Determination Date on the basis of the rates at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on such Interest Determination Date at which deposits in U.S. dollars are offered to prime banks in the London inter-bank market by four major banks in such market selected by the Company, for a term of three months commencing on the applicable Interest Reset Date and in a principal amount equal to an amount that in the judgment of the Calculation Agent is representative for a single transaction in U.S. dollars in such market at such time. The Calculation Agent will request the principal London office of each of such banks to provide a quotation of its rate. If at least two such quotations are provided, LIBOR for such Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of such quotations. If fewer than two such quotations are provided, LIBOR for such Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of the rates quoted at approximately 11:00 a.m. in New York City on such Interest Determination Date by three major banks in New York City, selected by the Company, for loans in U.S. dollars to leading European banks, for a term of three months commencing on the applicable Interest Reset Date and in a principal amount equal to an amount that in the judgment of the Calculation Agent is representative for a single transaction in U.S. dollars in such market at such time; provided, however, that if the banks so selected are not quoting as mentioned above, the then-existing LIBOR rate will remain in effect for such Interest Period, or, if none, the interest rate will be the initial interest rate.
     All percentages resulting from any calculation of any interest rate for the Securities will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred thousandth of a percentage point, with five one-millionths of a percentage point rounded upward (e.g., 5.876545% (or .05876545) would be rounded to 5.87655% (or .0587655)), and all U.S. dollar amounts will be rounded to the nearest cent, with one-half cent being rounded upward. Each calculation of the interest rate on the Securities by the Calculation Agent will (in the absence of manifest error) be final and binding on the Holders of the Securities and the Company.
     Accrued interest on the Securities will be calculated by multiplying the principal amount of the Securities by an accrued interest factor. This accrued interest factor will be computed by adding the interest factors calculated for each day in the Interest Period for which interest is being paid. The interest factor for each day is computed by dividing the interest rate applicable to that day by 360. For these calculations, the interest rate in effect on any Interest Reset Date will be the applicable rate as reset on that date. The interest rate applicable to any other day is the interest rate from the immediately preceding Interest Reset Date or, if none, the initial interest rate.
     The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each series under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the time
