In advance of The Barclays Capital Back-to-School Consumer Conference in Boston, Massachusetts, PepsiCo, Inc. ("PepsiCo" or "we") today stated that, consistent with its previous guidance for 2012, PepsiCo expects a decline in core constant currency earnings per share of approximately 5 percent from its fiscal 2011 core earnings per share of $4.40. Based on the current foreign exchange market consensus, foreign exchange translation would have an unfavorable impact of approximately three percentage points on PepsiCo's full year core EPS performance in 2012.
Please refer to the glossary for more information about PepsiCo's full-year fiscal 2012 core constant currency EPS guidance.

Glossary
CoreCore results are non-GAAP financial measures which exclude certain items from our historical results. In 2011, core results exclude the commodity mark-to-market net impact included in corporate unallocated expenses, restructuring and impairment charges, as well as merger and integration charges and certain inventory fair value adjustments in connection with our acquisitions of The Pepsi Bottling Group, Inc. (PBG), PepsiAmericas, Inc. (PAS) and Wimm-Bill-Dann Foods OJSC (WBD). In addition, full-year 2011 core results exclude an extra week of results. With respect to our 2012 guidance, our core results exclude the commodity mark-to-market net impact included in corporate unallocated expenses, restructuring and impairment
:
charges, merger and integration charges in connection with our acquisition of WBD, and restructuring and other charges related to the transaction with Tingyi. For more details and reconciliations of our 2011 core results and 2012 core constant currency guidance, see "Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Information" below.
Constant currency: Financial results assuming constant foreign currency exchange rates used for translation based on the rates in effect for the comparable prior-year period. In order to compute our constant currency results, we multiply or divide, as appropriate, our current year U.S. dollar results by the current year average foreign exchange rates and then multiply or divide, as appropriate, those amounts by the prior year average foreign exchange rates.
Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Information
(unaudited)
Core results and core constant currency results are non-GAAP financial measures as they exclude certain items noted below. However, we believe investors should consider these measures as they are more indicative of our ongoing performance and with how management evaluates our operational results and trends.
53rd week impact
In 2011, we had an additional week of results (53rd week). Our fiscal year ends on the last Saturday of each December, resulting in an additional week of results every five or six years. The 53rd week increased net revenue by $623 million and operating profit by $109 million in the year ended December 31, 2011.
Commodity mark-to-market net impact
In the year ended December 31, 2011, we recognized $102 million of mark-to-market net losses on commodity hedges in corporate unallocated expenses. We centrally manage commodity derivatives on behalf of our divisions. Certain of these commodity derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and are marked to market with the resulting gains and losses recognized in corporate unallocated expenses. These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions take delivery of the underlying commodity.
Merger and integration charges
In the year ended December 31, 2011, we incurred merger and integration charges of $329 million related to our acquisitions of PBG, PAS and WBD, including $112 million recorded in the PAB segment, $123 million recorded in the Europe segment, $78 million recorded in corporate unallocated expenses and $16 million recorded in interest expense. These charges also include closing costs and advisory fees related to our acquisition of WBD.
Restructuring and impairment charges
In the year ended December 31, 2011, we incurred charges of $383 million in conjunction with our multi-year productivity plan (Productivity Plan), including $76 million recorded in the FLNA segment, $18 million recorded in the QFNA segment, $48 million recorded in the LAF segment, $81 million recorded in the PAB segment, $77 million recorded in the Europe segment, $9 million recorded in the AMEA segment and $74 million recorded in corporate unallocated expenses. The Productivity Plan includes actions in every aspect of our business that we believe will strengthen our complementary food, snack and beverage businesses by leveraging new technologies and processes across PepsiCo's operations, go-to-market and information systems; heightening the focus on best practice sharing across the globe; consolidating manufacturing, warehouse and sales facilities; and implementing simplified organization structures, with wider spans of control and fewer layers of management.
Inventory fair value adjustments
In the year ended December 31, 2011, we recorded $46 million of incremental costs in cost of sales related to fair value adjustments to the acquired inventory included in WBD's balance sheet at the acquisition date and hedging contracts included in PBG's and PAS's balance sheets at the acquisition date.
2012 guidance
Our 2012 full-year core constant currency EPS guidance excludes the commodity mark-to-market net impact included in corporate unallocated expenses, restructuring and impairment charges, merger and integration charges, and restructuring and other charges related to the transaction with Tingyi. In addition, our 2012 full-year core constant currency EPS guidance excludes the impact of foreign exchange. We are not able to reconcile our full-year projected 2012 core constant currency EPS growth to our full-year projected 2012 reported results because we are unable to predict the 2012 impact of foreign exchange or the mark-to-market net impact on commodity hedges due to the unpredictability of future changes in foreign exchange rates and commodity prices. Therefore, we are unable to provide a reconciliation of this measure.
