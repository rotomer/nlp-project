 PepsiCo, Inc. (NYSE: PEP) today reported a decline in third quarter net revenue of 5 percent, reflecting a negative 5- percentage-point impact from previously announced structural changes (primarily beverage refranchisings in China and Mexico), and a negative 5-percentage-point impact from foreign exchange translation. Excluding these items, third quarter net revenue grew 5 percent on an organic basis.
PURCHASE, N.Y.  October 17, 2012
Reported EPS was $1.21 and core EPS was $1.20. Management reaffirmed both its 2012 core constant currency net revenue and core constant currency EPS guidance and stated that its 2012 strategic initiatives are on track.
"PepsiCo is diligently executing the strategy we set forth at the start of the year, and we remain on track to achieve our full-year targets," said PepsiCo Chairman and CEO Indra Nooyi. "Our disciplined pricing and sustained investment in brand building drove 5 percent organic net revenue
 
growth reflecting 1 percent organic volume growth and 4 percent effective net pricing.
"We remain focused on our five priorities. We will continue to invest aggressively to build our brands, accelerate innovation to drive growth, focus on execution and deliver our productivity agenda while returning cash to shareholders."

Summary of Third Quarter Financial Performance
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
All comparisons are on a core year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted.
Division Operating Summaries
PepsiCo Americas Foods (PAF)
Organic net revenue grew 6 percent in the quarter, and reported net revenue grew 2.5 percent. Net revenue growth was driven by effective net pricing supported by contributions from innovation and increased media support. Core constant currency operating profit declined 1 percent, reflecting higher commodity costs and increased advertising and marketing investments across all PAF divisions, partially offset by productivity initiatives.
Frito-Lay North America (FLNA)
Organic net revenue increased 3 percent driven by a 1 percent increase in volume coupled with 2 percent effective net pricing. Volume was negatively impacted in the quarter by a calendar shift related to the Labor Day holiday. Net revenue growth was driven by the C-store, club, dollar and foodservice channels. Reported net revenue grew 3 percent.
Operating profit growth of 1 percent in the quarter reflected higher commodity costs and a significant increase in advertising and marketing investments offset by effective net pricing and productivity initiatives.
Latin America Foods (LAF)
On an organic basis, LAF net revenue grew 13 percent. Net revenue growth reflected 4 percentage points of organic volume growth and 9 percentage points of effective net pricing. Reported net revenue grew 2 percent, reflecting a 2-percentage-point benefit from acquisitions and divestitures, offset by a 13-percentage-point unfavorable foreign exchange translation impact.
Core constant currency operating profit was even with the prior year quarter reflecting increased advertising and marketing expense and commodity cost inflation.
Quaker Foods North America (QFNA)
Organic net revenue grew modestly. Reported net revenue performance was even with the prior year quarter, reflecting 2 percentage points of volume growth offset by lower pricing and mix.
Core constant currency operating profit in the quarter declined 11 percent driven principally by higher commodity costs and increased advertising and marketing expense.
 
PepsiCo Americas Beverages (PAB)
On an organic basis, net revenue was even with the prior year quarter. Effective net pricing increased by 3 percentage points and bottler case volume declined 3 percent. Volume was negatively impacted by 1 percentage point in the quarter due to a calendar shift related to the Labor Day holiday. Positive volume and pricing trends continued within the convenience and gas channel. Reported net revenue declined 7 percent, primarily reflecting a negative 6-percentage-point impact of the refranchising of the division's Mexican beverage business in the fourth quarter of 2011 and a negative 1-percentage-point impact from foreign exchange translation.
Operating profit declined in the quarter primarily reflecting increased commodity costs and higher advertising and marketing expense, partially offset by favorable effective net pricing and savings resulting from productivity initiatives. The refranchising of the division's Mexican beverage business negatively impacted operating profit performance by more than 2 percentage points.
Europe
On an organic basis, net revenue grew 7 percent with a focus on product mix management to drive margin accretion and healthy growth in Russia partially offset by softer trends in Western Europe. Reported net revenue declined 6 percent, reflecting 6 percentage points of effective net pricing which was more than offset by an unfavorable foreign exchange translation impact of 12 percentage points.
Core constant currency operating profit grew 3 percent in the quarter with significantly higher marketing investments and commodity cost inflation offset by productivity savings. Operating profit performance was negatively impacted by 4 percentage points due to an impairment charge associated with operations in Greece. Operating profit performance was positively impacted by 8 percentage points attributable to net favorable adjustments of certain operating items and favorable comparisons related to timing of concentrate shipments in connection with our global SAP implementation in the third quarter of 2011.
Asia, Middle East & Africa (AMEA)
On an organic basis, net revenue grew 10 percent, led by double-digit organic volume growth in snacks and high-single-digit organic volume growth in beverages. Reported net revenue declined 21 percent reflecting a 27-percentage-point negative impact from structural changes, principally the refranchising of bottling operations in China, and a negative 4-percentage-point impact from foreign exchange translation.
Core constant currency operating profit grew 14 percent, driven by volume growth and effective net pricing partially offset by higher commodity costs. The impact of acquisitions and divestitures reduced operating profit by 5 percent while a favorable comparison related to timing of concentrate shipments in connection with our global SAP implementation in the third quarter of 2011 increased operating profit by 7 percent.
 
Restructuring
As previously announced, the company has committed to a multi-year productivity program. The company incurred pre-tax, non-core restructuring charges of $83 million in the third quarter of 2012 and has incurred $193 million year to date. The company anticipates additional charges of approximately $205 million in the balance of 2012 and $129 million from 2013 through 2015. Charges under this program resulted in cash expenditures of $103 million in the third quarter of 2012 and $243 million year to date. The company anticipates additional cash expenditures of approximately $175 million in the remainder of 2012, with the balance of approximately $287 million of related cash expenditures expected in 2013 through 2015.
2012 Guidance and Outlook
Consistent with its previous guidance for 2012, the company expects a decline in core constant currency EPS of approximately 5 percent from its fiscal 2011 core EPS of $4.40. Based on the current foreign exchange market consensus, foreign exchange translation would have an unfavorable impact of approximately three percentage points on the company's full year core EPS performance in 2012. Consistent with its previous guidance, the company expects core constant currency net revenue growth of low-single-digits reflecting the impact of structural changes, principally refranchisings, which are expected to reduce core constant currency net revenue growth by approximately three percentage points for the full year. Excluding these structural changes, core constant currency net revenue is expected to grow mid-single-digits, consistent with the company's prior guidance.
The company is targeting approximately $8 billion in cash flow from operating activities and more than $6 billion in management operating cash flow (excluding certain items) in 2012, which includes the favorable impact of an expected 10 percent reduction in capital spending and improved working capital efficiency. The company also made a pre-tax discretionary pension and retiree medical contribution of $1 billion in the first quarter of 2012.
Reflecting its commitment to return capital to shareholders, the company anticipates more than $3 billion in share repurchases for 2012, and expects to pay $3.3 billion in dividends.

Miscellaneous Disclosures
In discussing financial results and guidance, the company may refer to certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of any such non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable financial measures in accordance with GAAP can be found in the attached exhibits, as well as on the company's website at www.pepsico.com in the "Investors" section under "Investor Presentations." Our non-GAAP measures exclude from reported results those items that management believes are not indicative of our ongoing performance and how management evaluates our operating results and trends.
 
Glossary
Acquisitions and divestitures: All mergers and acquisitions activity, including the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and changes in ownership or control in consolidated subsidiaries and nonconsolidated equity investees.
Beverage volume: Volume shipped to retailers and independent distributors from both PepsiCo and our bottlers.
Core: Core results are non-GAAP financial measures which exclude certain items from our historical results. In 2012, core results exclude the commodity mark-to-market net impact included in corporate unallocated expenses, restructuring and impairment charges, merger and integration charges in connection with our acquisition of WBD and restructuring and other charges related to the transaction with Tingyi. In 2011, core results exclude the commodity mark-to-market net impact included in corporate unallocated expenses, as well as merger and integration charges and certain inventory fair value adjustments in connection with our acquisitions of The Pepsi Bottling Group, Inc. (PBG), PepsiAmericas, Inc. (PAS) and WBD. In addition, full-year 2011 core results exclude an extra week of results and restructuring and impairment charges. See above for reconciliations of this non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure in accordance with GAAP. See "Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Information" below for additional information.
Constant currency: Financial results assuming constant foreign currency exchange rates used for translation based on the rates in effect for the comparable prior-year period. In order to compute our constant currency results, we multiply or divide, as appropriate, our current year U.S. dollar results by the current year average foreign exchange rates and then multiply or divide, as appropriate, those amounts by the prior year average foreign exchange rates.
Division operating profit: The aggregation of the operating profit for each of our reportable segments, which excludes the impact of corporate unallocated expenses.
Effective net pricing: The combined impact of mix and price.
Management operating cash flow: Net cash provided by operating activities less capital spending plus sales of property, plant and equipment. See above for a reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure in accordance with GAAP (operating cash flow).
Management operating cash flow, excluding certain items: Management operating cash flow, excluding: (1) discretionary pension and post-retirement contributions, (2) restructuring payments, (3) merger and integration payments in connection with the PBG, PAS and WBD acquisitions, (4) capital investments related to the bottling integration, (5) capital investments related to the productivity plan, (6) payments for restructuring and other charges related to the transaction with Tingyi and (7) the tax impacts associated with each of these items, as applicable. This
 
non-GAAP financial measure is our primary measure used to monitor cash flow performance. See above for a reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure in accordance with GAAP (operating cash flow). See "Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Information" below for additional information.
Mark-to-market gain or loss or net impact: Change in market value for commodity contracts that we purchase to mitigate the volatility in costs of energy and raw materials that we consume. The market value is determined based on average prices on national exchanges and recently reported transactions in the marketplace.
Net pricing: The combined impact of list price changes, weight changes per package, discounts and allowances.
Net capital spending: Capital spending less cash proceeds from sales of property, plant and equipment.
Organic: A measure that excludes the impact of acquisitions and divestitures and, beginning with the second quarter 2012 results, foreign exchange translation. In excluding the impact of foreign exchange translation, we assume constant foreign exchange rates used for translation based on the rates in effect for the comparable prior-year period. See the definition of "constant currency" above for additional information.
Pricing: The impact of list price changes and weight changes per package.
 
Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Information (unaudited)
Core results, core constant currency results, organic results and division operating profit are non-GAAP financial measures as they exclude certain items noted below. However, we believe investors should consider these measures as they are more indicative of our ongoing performance and with how management evaluates our operational results and trends.
53rd week impact
In 2011, we had an additional week of results (53rd week). Our fiscal year ends on the last Saturday of each December, resulting in an additional week of results every five or six years. The 53rd week increased net revenue by $623 million and operating profit by $109 million in the quarter and year ended December 31, 2011.
Commodity mark-to-market net impact
In the 12 and 36 weeks ended September 8, 2012, we recognized $121 million and $126 million, respectively, of mark-to-market net gains on commodity hedges in corporate unallocated expenses. In the 12 and 36 weeks ended September 3, 2011, we recognized $53 million and $31 million, respectively, of mark-to-market net losses on commodity hedges in corporate unallocated expenses. In the year ended December 31, 2011, we recognized $102 million of mark-to-market net losses on commodity hedges in corporate unallocated expenses. We centrally manage commodity derivatives on behalf of our divisions. Certain of these commodity derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and are marked to market with the resulting gains and losses recognized in corporate unallocated expenses. These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions take delivery of the underlying commodity.
Restructuring and impairment charges
In the 12 weeks ended September 8, 2012, we incurred restructuring and impairment charges of $83 million in conjunction with our multi-year productivity plan (Productivity Plan), including $8 million recorded in the FLNA segment, $1 million recorded in the QFNA segment, $29 million recorded in the LAF segment, $33 million recorded in the PAB segment, $6 million recorded in the AMEA segment, $7 million recorded in corporate unallocated expenses and income of $1 million recorded in the Europe segment representing adjustments of previously recorded amounts. In the 36 weeks ended September 8, 2012 we incurred restructuring and impairment charges of $193 million in conjunction with our Productivity Plan, including $40 million recorded in the FLNA segment, $7 million recorded in the QFNA segment, $41 million recorded in the LAF segment, $76 million recorded in the PAB segment, $23 million recorded in the AMEA segment, $8 million recorded in corporate unallocated expenses and income of $2 million recorded in the Europe segment representing adjustments of previously recorded amounts. In the year ended December 31, 2011, we incurred charges of $383 million in conjunction with our Productivity Plan, including $76 million recorded in the FLNA segment, $18 million recorded in the QFNA segment, $48 million recorded in the LAF segment, $81 million recorded in the PAB segment, $77
 
million recorded in the Europe segment, $9 million recorded in the AMEA segment and $74 million recorded in corporate unallocated expenses. The Productivity Plan includes actions in every aspect of our business that we believe will strengthen our complementary food, snack and beverage businesses by leveraging new technologies and processes across PepsiCo's operations, go-to-market and information systems; heightening the focus on best practice sharing across the globe; consolidating manufacturing, warehouse and sales facilities; and implementing simplified organization structures, with wider spans of control and fewer layers of management.
Merger and integration charges
In the 12 weeks ended September 8, 2012, we incurred merger and integration charges of $2 million related to our acquisition of WBD, including $4 million recorded in the Europe segment and income of $2 million recorded in corporate unallocated expenses representing adjustments of previously recorded amounts. In the 36 weeks ended September 8, 2012, we incurred merger and integration charges of $7 million related to our acquisition of WBD, all of which were recorded in the Europe segment. In the 12 weeks ended September 3, 2011, we incurred merger and integration charges of $61 million related to our acquisitions of PBG, PAS and WBD, including $24 million recorded in the PAB segment, $11 million recorded in the Europe segment, $10 million recorded in corporate unallocated expenses and $16 million recorded in interest expense. In the 36 weeks ended September 3, 2011, we incurred merger and integration charges of $174 million related to our acquisitions of PBG, PAS and WBD, including $77 million recorded in the PAB segment, $17 million recorded in the Europe segment, $64 million recorded in corporate unallocated expenses and $16 million recorded in interest expense. These charges also include closing costs and advisory fees related to our acquisition of WBD. In the year ended December 31, 2011, we incurred merger and integration charges of $329 million related to our acquisitions of PBG, PAS and WBD, including $112 million recorded in the PAB segment, $123 million recorded in the Europe segment, $78 million recorded in corporate unallocated expenses and $16 million recorded in interest expense. These charges also included closing costs and advisory fees related to our acquisition of WBD.
Restructuring and other charges related to the transaction with Tingyi
In the 36 weeks ended September 8, 2012 we recorded restructuring and other charges of $137 million related to the transaction with Tingyi.
Inventory fair value adjustments
In the 12 and 36 weeks ended September 3, 2011, we recorded $3 million and $41 million, respectively, of incremental costs in cost of sales related to fair value adjustments to the acquired inventory included in WBD's balance sheet at the acquisition date and other related hedging contracts included in PBG's and PAS's balance sheets at the acquisition date. In the year ended December 31, 2011, we recorded $46 million of incremental costs in cost of sales related to fair value adjustments to the acquired inventory included in WBD's balance sheet at the acquisition date and hedging contracts included in PBG's and PAS's balance sheets at the acquisition date.
 
Management operating cash flow (excluding certain items)
Additionally, management operating cash flow (excluding the items noted in the Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Reconciliation table above) is the primary measure management uses to monitor cash flow performance. This is not a measure defined by GAAP. Since net capital spending is essential to our product innovation initiatives and maintaining our operational capabilities, we believe that it is a recurring and necessary use of cash. As such, we believe investors should also consider net capital spending when evaluating our cash from operating activities. Additionally, we consider certain other items (included in the Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Reconciliation table above) in evaluating management operating cash flow which we believe investors should consider in evaluating our management operating cash flow results.
2012 guidance
Our 2012 full-year core constant currency EPS guidance excludes the commodity mark-to-market net impact included in corporate unallocated expenses, restructuring and impairment charges, merger and integration charges, and restructuring and other charges related to the transaction with Tingyi. In addition, our 2012 full-year core constant currency net revenue and EPS guidance exclude the impact of foreign exchange. We are not able to reconcile our full-year projected 2012 core constant currency EPS growth to our full-year projected 2012 results because we are unable to predict the 2012 impact of foreign exchange or the mark-to-market net gains or losses on commodity hedges due to the unpredictability of future changes in foreign exchange rates and commodity prices. In addition, we are unable to reconcile our full-year projected 2012 core constant currency net revenue growth to our full-year projected 2012 reported net revenue growth because we are unable to predict the 2012 impact of foreign exchange due to the unpredictability of future changes in foreign exchange rates. Therefore, we are unable to provide a reconciliation of these measures.
