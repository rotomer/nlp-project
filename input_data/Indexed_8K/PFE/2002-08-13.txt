I, Henry A. McKinnell, state and attest that:
(1) To the best of my knowledge, based upon a review of the covered reports of Pfizer Inc., and, except as corrected or supplemented in a subsequent covered report:
no covered report contained an untrue statement of a material fact as of the end of the period covered by such report (or in the case of a report on Form 8-K or definitive proxy materials, as of the date on which it was filed); and
no covered report omitted to state a material fact necessary to make the statements in the covered report, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading as of the end of the period covered by such report (or in the case of a report on Form 8-K or definitive proxy materials, as of the date on which it was filed).
(2) I have reviewed the contents of this statement with the Company's audit committee.
(3) In this statement under oath, each of the following, if filed on or before the date of this statement, is a "covered report":
Form 10-K for year ending December 31, 2001 of Pfizer Inc.;
all reports on Form 10-Q, all reports on Form 8-K, and all definitive proxy materials of Pfizer Inc. filed with the Commission subsequent to the filing of the Form 10-K identified above; and
any amendments to any of the foregoing.
 
                                                     Subscribed and sworn to                                                                                           before me this 13th day of August 2002. Henry A. McKinnell August 13, 2002                                                                                                                                                            Notary Public                                                                                           My Commission Expires: May 31, 2003
