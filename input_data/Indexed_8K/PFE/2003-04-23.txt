Item 4. Changes in Registrant's Certifying Accountants On April 16, 2003, Pfizer Inc. ("Pfizer") completed its merger with Pharmacia Corporation ("Pharmacia"). As a result of the merger, Pfizer has engaged KPMG LLP as its independent auditors to audit the financial statements of the Pharmacia Corporation Savings and Investment Plan ("Plan") for the year ended December 31, 2002. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PWC"), independent auditors of Pharmacia prior to its acquisition by Pfizer, will no longer audit the Plan. The reports of PWC regarding the Plan's financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 did not contain any adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion or any qualification or modification as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure which, if not resolved to the satisfaction of PWC, would have caused it to make reference to the matter in its reports. PWC has been provided with a copy of this Current Report on Form 8-K and has been requested to furnish a letter stating whether or not it agrees with the foregoing statements. Such letter will be filed by amendment to this Form 8-K. The Plan engaged KPMG LLP as its independent accountants to audit the Plan's financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2002. During the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 and through the filing date of this Current Report on Form 8-K, the Plan did not consult with KPMG LLP on any accounting or auditing matter.
