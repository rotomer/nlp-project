Changes in Registrant's Certifying Accountants On April 16, 2003, Pfizer Inc. ("Pfizer") completed its merger with Pharmacia Corporation ("Pharmacia"). As a result of the merger, Pfizer has engaged KPMG LLP as its independent auditors to audit the financial statements of the Pharmacia Savings Plan ("Plan") for the year ended December 31, 2002. As of April 16, 2003, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PWC"), independent auditors of Pharmacia prior to its acquisition by Pfizer, were dismissed as auditors of the Plan; the Registrant's Audit Committee was involved in the decision to change auditors for the Plan. The reports of PWC regarding the Plan's financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 did not contain any adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion or any qualification or modification as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles. In connection with its audits for the two most recent fiscal years and through April 16, 2003, there have been no disagreements with PWC on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure which, if not resolved to the satisfaction of PWC, would have caused it to make reference to the matter in its reports. PWC has been provided with a copy of the foregoing statements. Attached as Exhibit 16 is a copy of PWC's letter dated April 28, 2003 stating its agreement with such statements. The Plan engaged KPMG LLP as its independent accountants to audit the Plan's financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2002. During the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 and through the filing date of this Current Report on Form 8-K/A, the Plan did not consult with KPMG LLP on any accounting or auditing matter.
