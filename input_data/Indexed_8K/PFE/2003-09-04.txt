Exhibit 99 For immediate release: Contact: Paul Fitzhenry September 3, 2003 (212) 733-4637 PFIZER PROVIDES EARNINGS PROJECTIONS ON ADJUSTED AND GAAP BASIS FOR 2003 AND 2004 IN CONJUNCTION WITH UPCOMING INVESTOR CONFERENCE PRESENTATIONS NEW YORK, Sept. 3 -- In conjunction with presentations at four upcoming investor conferences, Pfizer today reconfirmed its expectations of the Company's adjusted earnings* and adjusted diluted earnings per share* for 2003 and 2004 as discussed in its second quarter earnings release on July 25, 2003. In that release, the company said, "Our expectations for adjusted diluted EPS* for 2003 and 2004 are unchanged. We continue to anticipate adjusted diluted EPS* in 2003 of $1.73 and of $2.13 in 2004." We anticipate diluted EPS on a GAAP basis in 2003 of $.70 and in 2004 of $1.77. The change in anticipated diluted EPS on a GAAP basis for 2003 from previous estimates primarily reflects a change in the value attributable to purchased inventory in connection with the Pharmacia acquisition, which is then charged to cost of sales when sold. The four investor conference presentations will occur during September as follows: Pfizer Inc Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer David L. Shedlarz will present on September 4, at the Thomas Weisel Partners Healthcare Tailwinds 2003 Conference in Boston; Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Hank McKinnell will present on September 8, at the Bear Stearns Healthcare Conference in New York; Shedlarz will present on September 18, at the Banc of America 33rd Annual Investment Conference in San Francisco and on September 22 at the UBS Global Life Sciences Conference in New York. Dr. McKinnell and Mr. Shedlarz are expected to discuss the Company's performance and prospects, as well as the acquisition of Pharmacia completed earlier this year. * "Adjusted earnings" and "adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS)" are defined as reported earnings/loss and diluted earnings/loss per share excluding the impact of purchase accounting of the Pharmacia acquisition, certain significant items, merger-related costs, and the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. For reconciliation of adjusted earnings to GAAP earnings, see Appendix I. # # # # # DISCLOSURE NOTICE: The information contained in this document is as of September 3, 2003.
