NEW YORK, June 23  The Board of Directors of Pfizer Inc today authorized a new program to purchase up to $5 billion of the companys common stock. The company said it expects the purchases to be made from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.
Common stock acquired through the buyback program will be available for general corporate purposes. The company recently completed a $5 billion share repurchase program authorized by the Board of Directors in October 2004.
This new buyback program capitalizes on Pfizers financial and operational strength to increase shareholder value, said Hank McKinnell, Pfizers chairman and chief executive officer.
Separately, the Board declared a dividend on the companys common stock of 19 cents per share for the third quarter of 2005 payable on September 6, 2005 to shareholders of record on August 12, 2005. The third-quarter 2005 cash dividend will be the 267th consecutive quarterly dividend paid by Pfizer, and 2005 marks the 38th consecutive year of quarterly dividend increases for Pfizer shareholders.
 

NEW YORK, June 23 -- The board of directors of Pfizer Inc today approved the repatriation, pursuant to the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, of an additional $8.6 billion in foreign earnings beyond the initial $28.3 billion previously announced by the company. Through our repatriation of foreign earnings this year, we are strengthening Pfizers ability to pursue strategic opportunities while enhancing the companys flexibility to invest in our R&D pipeline and new product potential in the U.S., said Hank McKinnell, chairman and chief executive officer.
In connection with this additional repatriation, Pfizer estimates a tax charge of about $365 million (5 cents per share) in the second quarter. In addition, Pfizer will record a reversal of at least $850 million of the $2.19 billion tax charge recorded in the first quarter in connection with the original $28.3 billion repatriation, principally as a result of recent guidance issued by the US Treasury.
