Exhibit 99 For immediate release: Contact: Paul Fitzhenry (Media) 212-733-4637 July 17, 2006 Ron Aldridge (Investors) 212-573-3685 PFIZER TO HOLD CONFERENCE CALL WITH ANALYSTS TO REVIEW RECLASSIFIED QUARTERLY 2005 AND 2006 CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME REFLECTING CONSUMER HEALTHCARE BUSINESS AS DISCONTINUED OPERATION NEW YORK, July 17 - In advance of the release of its Second Quarter 2006 Business Performance Report on July 20, Pfizer Inc (1)will hold a conference call at 4 p.m. EDT today to review reclassified historical financial information reflecting Pfizer's Consumer Healthcare business as a Discontinued Operation. Pfizer invites investors and the general public to listen to a webcast of the conference call. During today's conference call, led by Pfizer's financial leadership, analysts will have the opportunity to discuss the attached financial statements and schedules: 1) quarterly 2005 and First Quarter 2006 Consolidated Statements of Income and 2) quarterly 2005 and First Quarter 2006 Reconciliations from Reported Net Income and Reported Diluted Earnings Per Share to Adjusted Income(1) and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share(1) for Pfizer Inc, both reflecting the reclassification of Pfizer's Consumer Healthcare (PCH) business as a Discontinued Operation. On June 26, 2006, Pfizer announced that it had reached an agreement to sell its Consumer Healthcare business to Johnson & Johnson for approximately $16.6 billion. The transaction is expected to close by the end of 2006. The Company is now required to reflect its Consumer Healthcare business as a discontinued operation under generally accepted accounting principles. The reclassified financial statements and schedules reflect no change in Reported Net Income and Reported Diluted Earnings Per Share compared to previous disclosures. Rather, the financial results of PCH previously required to be reflected in various line items on the Consolidated Statement of Income (adjusted to reflect the business as defined by the sale agreement) are now captured on a single line -- Discontinued Operations. The conference call is intended solely to assist analysts in modeling Pfizer's financial performance on this new basis in advance of the Company's release of its second quarter 2006 earnings on July 20. Pfizer management will host a conference call on July 20 at 10:30 a.m. EDT to respond to investor queries with respect to its financial results for the second quarter.
To listen to today's webcast, analysts, investors, and the general public should visit the Pfizer web site homepage at www.pfizer.com and click on the "Pfizer Consumer Healthcare P&L Reclassification Webcast" link. Information about accessing, and pre-registering for, the webcast will be available at www.pfizer.com later today. Participants are advised to pre-register in advance of the conference call. Visitors to www.pfizer.com will be able to listen to an archived copy of the webcast of the conference call through 12 Noon, Monday, July 24. # # # # # - ---------- (1) "Adjusted income" and "adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS)" are defined as reported net income and reported diluted EPS excluding purchase-accounting adjustments, merger-related costs, discontinued operations, and certain significant items. As described under Adjusted Income in the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of Pfizer's Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended April 2, 2006, management uses adjusted income, among other factors, to set performance goals and to measure the performance of the overall company. We believe that investors' understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing this measure. Reconciliations of first quarter 2006 and quarterly 2005 adjusted income and adjusted diluted EPS to reported net income and reported diluted EPS are provided in the materials accompanying this report. The adjusted income and adjusted diluted EPS measures are not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for U.S. GAAP net income and diluted EPS. 2
