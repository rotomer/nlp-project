Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement. Pfizer Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), Wagner Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and direct wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and Wyeth, a Delaware corporation, entered into a definitive Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of January 25, 2009 (the "Merger"). Also on January 25, 2009, the Company entered into a bridge term facility commitment letter pursuant to which a syndicate of lenders comprised of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. ("JP Morgan Chase"), Bank of America, N.A., Barclays Bank PLC, Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Goldman Sachs Credit Partners L.P. committed to provide $22.5 billion to finance a portion of the consideration to be paid in the Merger. On March 12, 2009, the bridge term facility was syndicated to twenty-nine additional lenders in addition to the five initial bridge lenders. The maximum exposure for any single lender under the bridge term facility will not exceed $1.5 billion. Also on March 12, 2009, the Company entered into a 364-day bridge loan credit agreement, under which JPMorgan Chase is the administrative agent, J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., Banc of America Securities LLC, Barclays Capital, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., and Goldman Sachs Credit Partners L.P. are joint lead arrangers, and Banc of America Securities LLC, Barclays Capital, Citibank, N.A., and Goldman Sachs Capital Partners L.P. are joint syndication agents. The bridge term facility provides the Company with unsecured financing in an aggregate principal amount of up to $22.5 billion. The term of a portion of the bridge term facility may be extended, at the option of the Company, for up to 180 days following expiration of its initial term, subject to certain conditions, including payment by the Company of certain applicable fees to the lenders. Amounts outstanding under the bridge term facility will bear interest, at the Company's option, either (a) at the base rate (defined as the highest of (1) JPMorgan Chase's prime rate, (2) the federal funds rate plus 0.50% and (3) the adjusted LIBO rate for a one month interest period beginning on such day plus 1.00%) or (b) at the reserve adjusted eurodollar rate plus, in each case, an applicable margin. The Company may voluntarily prepay the loans at anytime without premium or penalty. The bridge term facility requires mandatory prepayments with the net cash proceeds of certain liquidating events. The bridge loan agreement also contains certain events of default, upon the occurrence of which, and so long as such event of default is continuing, the amounts outstanding will accrue interest at an increased rate and payments of such outstanding amounts could be accelerated by the lenders. In addition, the Company will be subject to certain affirmative and negative covenants under the bridge loan agreement. The lenders or their affiliates have in the past engaged, and may in the future engage, in transactions with and perform services, including commercial banking, financial advisory and investment banking services, for the Company and its affiliates in the ordinary course of business for which they have received or will receive customary fees and expenses. In addition, affiliates of certain of the lenders are providing advisory services to the Company in connection with the Merger. The description of the bridge loan agreement above is a summary and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the bridge loan agreement, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 10.1 to this report and incorporated herein by reference.

(New York City time) three Business Days before the date of the proposed Borrowing, in each case by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent, which shall give to each Lender prompt notice thereof on the same Business Day by facsimile transmission or electronic messaging system.

Each Lender shall, before 12:00 Noon (New York City time) on the date of the Borrowing, make available to the Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agent's Account, in same day funds, such Lender's ratable portion of the Borrowing. After the Administrative Agent's receipt of such funds and upon fulfillment of the applicable conditions set forth in Section 3, the Administrative Agent will make such funds available to the Borrower by promptly crediting the amounts so received, in like funds, to an account of the Borrower or maintained with the Administrative Agent in New York City and designated by the Borrower in the Notice of Borrowing.

(ii) Eurodollar Loans. During such periods as such Loan is a Eurodollar Loan, a rate per annum equal at all times during each Interest Period for such Loan to the sum of (x) the Adjusted LIBO Rate for such Interest Period for such Loan plus (y) the Applicable Margin, payable in arrears on the last day of such Interest Period and, if such Interest Period has a duration of more than three months, on each day that occurs during such Interest Period every three months from the first day of such Interest Period and, without duplication, on the date such Eurodollar Loan shall be Converted or paid in full. (b) Default Interest. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, the Borrower shall pay interest on the aggregate unpaid principal amount of the Loans and the amount of all other Obligations then due and payable, from the date such amount shall be due until such amount shall be paid in full, payable in arrears on the date such aggregate amount shall be paid in full and on demand, at a rate per annum equal at all times to 2.00% per annum above the rate per annum required to be paid on Base Rate Loans pursuant to clause (a)(i) above. 2.08 Interest Rate Determination. (a) Each determination by the Administrative Agent of an interest rate hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error. (b) If, with respect to Eurodollar Loans, the Required Lenders notify the Administrative Agent that the LIBO Rate for any Interest Period for such Loans will not adequately reflect the cost to such Required Lenders of making, funding or maintaining their respective Eurodollar Loans for such Interest Period, the Administrative Agent shall forthwith so notify the Borrower and the Lenders, whereupon (i) each such Loan will automatically, on the last day of the then existing Interest Period therefor, Convert into a Base Rate Loan, and (ii) the obligation of the Lenders to make, or to Convert Loans into, such Loans shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist as determined by the Required Lenders, which notice shall be given promptly after such circumstances cease to exist as determined by the Required Lenders. (c) If the Borrower shall fail to select the duration of any Interest Period for any Eurodollar Loans in accordance with the provisions contained in the definition of "Interest Period" in Section 1.01, such Interest Period shall have a duration of one month. (d) Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default under Section 8(a), (i) each Eurodollar Loan will automatically, on the last day of the then existing Interest Period therefor, Convert into a Base Rate Loan and (ii) the obligation of the Lenders to make, or to Convert Loans into, Eurodollar Loans shall be suspended. 2.09 Optional Conversion of Loans. The Borrower may on any Business Day, upon notice given to the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the third Business Day prior to the date of the proposed Conversion and subject to the provisions of Sections 2.08 and 2.15, Convert all Loans of one Type or any portion thereof into Loans of the other Type; provided that any Conversion of Eurodollar Loans into Base Rate Loans shall be made only on the last day of an Interest Period for such Eurodollar Loans; provided further that the aggregate amount of Eurodollar Loans for each Interest Period must be in the amount of at least $25,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof. Each such notice of a Conversion shall, within the restrictions specified above, specify (i) the date of such Conversion (ii) the Loans to be Converted and (iii) if such Conversion is into Eurodollar Loans, the duration of the initial Interest Period for each such Loan. Each notice of Conversion shall be irrevocable and binding on the Borrower. 2.10 Optional Prepayments. The Borrower may, upon notice to the Administrative Agent stating the proposed date and aggregate principal amount of the prepayment, given not later than 10:00 A.M. (New York City time) (a) three Business Days before such proposed prepayment in the case of Eurodollar Loans and (b) on the day of such proposed prepayment in the case of Base Rate Loans, and, if such notice is given, the Borrower shall, prepay without penalty the outstanding principal amount of the Loans in whole or ratably in part, together with accrued interest to the date of such prepayment on the principal amount prepaid, provided that in the event of any such prepayment of a Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, the Borrower shall be obligated to reimburse the Lenders in respect thereof pursuant to Section 10.04(b). Each prepayment hereunder shall be in a minimum amount of $25,000,000 or any whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof. 2.11 Mandatory Prepayments and Commitment Reductions. (a) (i) Subject to the terms of this Section 2.11(a), after the occurrence of any Specified Asset Sale or Property Loss Event, the Borrower shall ratably prepay the Loans, and if the Funding Date has not occurred, permanently reduce the Commitments outstanding as of the date of such Specified Asset Sale or Property Loss Event, in each case, in an aggregate amount equal to 100% of the Net Cash Proceeds thereof. The Borrower shall effect such prepayment or reduction within ten Business Days (if such Net Cash Proceeds are received by the Borrower or a Domestic Subsidiary), or twenty Business Days (if such Net Cash Proceeds are received by a Foreign Subsidiary), after the consummation of such Specified Asset Sale or such Property Loss Event; provided that if the Funding Date occurs prior to such period, such Commitment reduction shall be effective immediately prior to the Funding Date. (ii) Upon any Equity Issuance (other than any Designated Equity Issuance) or Debt Incurrence (other than any Permitted Debt Issuance), the Borrower shall ratably prepay the Loans, and if the Funding Date has not occurred the Commitments shall be subject to automatic ratable reduction, in an aggregate amount equal to 100% of the Net Cash Proceeds thereof, such reduction to be effective immediately and any such prepayment to be effected within five Business Days (if such Equity Issuance or Debt Incurrence is by the Borrower or a Domestic Subsidiary) or ten Business Days (if such Equity Issuance or Debt Incurrence is by a Foreign Subsidiary) after such Equity Issuance or Debt Incurrence. (b) Notices. Prepayments pursuant to this Section 2.11 shall be made upon notice to the Administrative Agent not later than 10:00 A.M. (New York City time) on any Business Day for Base Rate Loans, and upon at least three Business Days' notice for Eurodollar Loans, stating the proposed date and aggregate principal amount of the applicable prepayment. Upon receipt of a notice of prepayment pursuant to this clause (b), the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of the contents thereof on the same Business Day and of such Lender's ratable share of such prepayment and such notice shall not thereafter be revocable. (c) Other Amounts. All prepayments pursuant to this Section 2.11 shall be accompanied by interest on the principal amount prepaid accrued to the date of such prepayment. In the event of any prepayment of Eurodollar Loans pursuant to this Section 2.11, the Borrower shall be obligated to reimburse the Lenders in respect thereof pursuant to Section 10.04(b). 2.12 Payments and Computations. (a) The Borrower shall make each payment hereunder and under the Notes to the Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agent's Account without set-off or counterclaim, not later than 12:00 noon New York City time on the due date of such payment (each such payment made after such time on such date to be deemed to have been made on the next Business Day). The Administrative Agent will promptly thereafter cause to be distributed funds relating to the payment of principal or interest or fees ratably (other than amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.14, 2.16 or 10.04(b)) to the Lenders, and like funds relating to the payment of any other amount payable to any Lender to such Lender, in each case to be applied in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Upon its acceptance of an Assignment and Acceptance and recording of the information contained therein in the Register pursuant to Section 10.06(e), from and after the effective date specified in such Assignment and Acceptance, the Administrative Agent shall make all payments hereunder and under the Notes in respect of the interest assigned thereby to the Lender assignee thereunder, and the parties to such Assignment and Acceptance (which shall not include the Borrower) shall make all appropriate adjustments in such payments for periods prior to such effective date directly between themselves. (b) All interest hereunder and the fees payable under Section 2.05(a) shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days, except that interest computed by reference to the Base Rate at times when the Base Rate is based on the Prime Rate shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year), and in each case shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). The applicable Base Rate, Adjusted LIBO Rate or LIBO Rate shall be determined by the Administrative Agent, and such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error. (c) Whenever any payment hereunder or under the Notes shall be stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day; provided that, if such extension would cause payment of interest on or principal of Eurodollar Loans to be made in the next following calendar month, such payment shall be made on the next preceding Business Day. (d) All amounts payable under this Agreement shall be paid in U.S. Dollars. (e) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Lenders hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment in full, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent on such date and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each Lender on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Lender. If and to the extent the Borrower shall not have so made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent, each Lender shall repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Lender together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such Lender until the date such Lender repays such amount to the Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Effective Rate. 2.13 Sharing of Payments Etc. (a) If any Lender shall obtain any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of set-off, or otherwise) on account of the Loans owing to it (other than pursuant to Section 2.14, 2.16 or 10.04(b)) in excess of its ratable share of payments on account of the Loans obtained by all the Lenders, such Lender shall forthwith purchase from the other Lenders such participations in the Loans owing to such other Lenders as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment ratably with each of them; provided that if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from such purchasing Lender, such purchase from each Lender shall be rescinded and such Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the purchase price to the extent of such recovery together with an amount equal to such Lender's ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such Lender's required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered. The Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender pursuant to this Section 2.13 may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation. (b) Nothing contained herein shall require any Lender to exercise any such right or shall affect the right of any Lender to exercise, and retain the benefits of exercising, any such right with respect to any other indebtedness or obligation of the Borrower. 2.14 Additional Costs. (a) The Borrower shall, within 30 days following demand by a Lender (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent), pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender from time to time such amounts as such Lender may reasonably determine to be necessary to compensate it for any costs that such Lender determines are attributable to its making, funding or maintaining any Eurodollar Loans or its obligation to make any Eurodollar Loans hereunder, or any reduction in any amount receivable by such Lender hereunder in respect of any such Loans or such obligation (excluding amounts attributable to Taxes, which shall be governed solely and exclusively by Section 2.16) (such increases in costs and reductions in amounts receivable being herein called "Additional Costs"), resulting from any Regulatory Change: (i) that imposes or modifies any reserve, special deposit, minimum capital, capital ratio or similar requirements (other than the Reserve Requirement utilized in the determination of the LIBO Rate for such Loans) relating to any extensions of credit or other assets of, or any deposits with or other liabilities of, such Lender (including any such Loans or any deposits of the type referred to in the definition of "LIBO Rate" in Section 1.01), or the Commitment of such Lender; or (ii) imposes any other condition affecting this Agreement or such Lender's Notes (or any of such extensions of credit or liabilities) or the Commitment of such Lender; provided that the Borrower shall not be obligated to pay to such Lender such Additional Costs unless such Lender at such time shall be generally assessing such amounts on a non discriminatory basis against borrowers under agreements having provisions similar to this paragraph; and provided further that any such Additional Costs allocated to any Loans or the Commitment of such Lender shall not exceed the Borrower's pro rata share of all costs attributable to all loans or advances or commitments to all borrowers by such Lender that collectively result in the consequences for which such Lender is to be compensated by the Borrower. Any Lender seeking compensation hereunder shall make reasonable efforts to notify the Borrower of the enactment of any Regulatory Change that would entitle such Lender to compensation pursuant to this Section 2.14(a) as promptly as practicable after obtaining knowledge thereof and the date of effectiveness of such Regulatory Change; provided that failure to provide such notice shall not in any way reduce the Borrower's liability therefor. As soon thereafter as such Lender shall have determined to request such compensation, such Lender shall notify the Borrower thereof and shall use reasonable efforts (consistent with its internal policy and legal and regulatory restrictions) to designate a different Applicable Lending Office for the Loans of such Lender affected by such Regulatory Change if such designation will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, such compensation, and will not, in the opinion of such Lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 2.14(a) to the contrary, the Borrower's obligation to reimburse such Lender for Additional Costs pursuant to this Section 2.14(a) shall be limited as follows: (x) In the event of a Regulatory Change with an effective date occurring on or after its date of enactment, the Borrower shall be obligated to pay to such Lender only such amounts attributable to the period commencing on the later of the effective date of such Regulatory Change or the date of such Lender's notice of determination to request compensation hereunder; and (y) In the event of a Regulatory Change with an effective date retroactive from its date of enactment, the Borrower shall be obligated to pay only such amounts attributable to a period commencing up to 60 days prior to such Lender's notice of enactment of the Regulatory Change and its request for compensation hereunder. (b) Without limiting the effect of the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.14 (but without duplication), the Borrower shall, within 30 days following a demand by a Lender (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent), pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender from time to time such amounts as such Lender may reasonably determine to be necessary to compensate such Lender for any costs (excluding amounts attributable to Taxes, which shall be governed solely and exclusively by Section 2.16) that it determines are attributable to the maintenance by such Lender, pursuant to any law or regulation or any interpretation, directive or request (whether or not having the force of law) of any court or governmental or monetary authority following any Regulatory Change, of capital in respect of its Commitment (such compensation to include, without limitation, an amount equal to any reduction of the rate of return on assets or equity of such Lender to a level below that which such Lender could have achieved but for such Law, regulation, interpretation, directive or request); provided that (i) the Borrower shall not be obligated to pay to such Lender such additional amounts unless such Lender at such time shall be generally assessing such amounts on a nondiscriminatory basis against borrowers under agreements having provisions similar to this paragraph; and (ii) any such additional amounts allocated to the Commitment of such Lender shall not exceed the Borrower's pro rata share of all costs attributable to all commitments to all borrowers by such Lender that collectively result in the consequences for which such Lender is to be compensated by the Borrower. Each Lender will notify the Borrower that it is entitled to compensation pursuant to this Section 2.14(b) as promptly as practicable after it determines to request such compensation; provided the Borrower shall be obligated to pay such Lender only such amounts attributable to the period commencing 60 days after the date of such Lender's notice. (c) Determinations and allocations by a Lender for purposes of this Section 2.14 of the effect of any Regulatory Change pursuant to Section 2.14(a), or of the effect of capital maintained pursuant to Section 2.14(b), on its costs or rate of return of maintaining Loans or its obligation to make Loans, or on amounts receivable by it in respect of Loans, and of the amounts required to compensate such Lender under this Section 2.14, shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, provided that such determinations and allocations are made on a reasonable basis. Any Lender requesting compensation under this Section 2.14 will furnish the Borrower with a certificate setting forth the basis and amount of such request for compensation. 2.15 Illegality. (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if any Lender shall notify the Administrative Agent that the introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation of any Law or regulation makes it unlawful, or any central bank or other Governmental Authority asserts that it is unlawful, for any Lender to perform its obligations hereunder to make Eurodollar Loans or to fund or maintain Eurodollar Loans hereunder, (i) each Eurodollar Loan will automatically, upon such demand, Convert into a Base Rate Loan and (ii) the obligation of the Lenders to make Eurodollar Loans or to Convert Loans into Eurodollar Loans shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist, which notice shall be given promptly after such circumstances cease to exist. (b) Each Lender agrees that, before making a demand under subsection (a) above, it shall (i) use reasonable efforts (consistent with its internal policy and legal and regulatory restrictions) to designate a different Lending Office for the Eurodollar Loans of such Lender, if such designation will avoid the need for the Conversion of or for the suspension of the obligation of any Lender or Lenders to make Eurodollar Loans as described in subsection (a) above and will not, in the opinion of such Lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender and (ii) failing such efforts and if legally permissible, cause such demand to be made on the last day of the applicable Interest Period for each Eurodollar Loan, as the case may be, then outstanding. 2.16 Taxes. (a) Any and all payments by or on account of any Obligation of the Borrower hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes; provided that if the Borrower shall be required by Law to deduct any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes from such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.16) the Administrative Agent and each Lender (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Borrower shall make such deductions and (iii) the Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Law. (b) In addition, the Borrower shall pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Law. (c) The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Lender, within 10 days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section 2.16) paid by the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by a Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender, or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be presumptive evidence of such payment or liability absent manifest error. (d) As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by the Borrower to any Governmental Authority, and in any event within 60 days of such payment, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent. (e) The Administrative Agent and each Lender, including any Foreign Lender, that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax under the Law of the jurisdiction in which the Borrower is located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments under this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), such properly completed and executed documentation (including Internal Revenue Service forms W-8 and W-9) as reasonably requested by the Borrower or Administrative Agent (as applicable) and as may be necessary or appropriate to permit the Borrower to make payments under this Agreement or any Loan Document without withholding Tax or at a reduced withholding Tax rate unless the Administrative Agent or the Lender is exempt from backup withholding based on the indicators in Treasury Regulation Section 1.6049-4(c)(1)(ii), in which case no such documentation shall be delivered. The Administrative Agent and each Lender shall provide the appropriate documentation described in the preceding sentence at the following times (i) prior to the first payment date after becoming a party to this Agreement, (ii) Upon a change in circumstance or, upon reasonable request by the Company, upon a change in Law, in each case requiring or making appropriate a new or additional form, certificate or documentation, (iii) upon reasonable request by the Borrower upon or before the expiration, obsolescence or invalidity of any documentation previously provided to the Borrower or the Administrative Agent (as applicable) and (iv) upon reasonable request by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent (as applicable). (f) Each Lender agrees that, before making a demand under this Section 2.16, it shall use reasonable efforts (consistent with its legal and regulatory restrictions) to designate a different Eurodollar Lending Office if the making of such a designation will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, any additional amounts that would otherwise thereafter accrue and will not, in the judgment of such Lender, require such Lender to incur a loss and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to the Lender. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment. Upon any such change in any Applicable Lending Office, such Lender shall provide to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower the appropriate form specified in Section 2.16(e). 2.17 Defaulting Lender. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the following provisions shall apply for so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender: (a) on the date that such Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, fees under Section 2.05(a) shall cease to accrue on the Commitment of such Defaulting Lender; provided that if such Defaulting Lender complies with its obligation to make the Loans on the Funding Date as provided in this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a Defaulting Lender and such fees shall be deemed to have accrued during the period from the date that such Lender became a Defaulting Lender until the Funding Date and any such unpaid fees under Section 2.05(a) shall be due and payable on the Funding Date; and (b) the Commitment of such Defaulting Lender shall not be included in determining whether all Lenders or the Required Lenders have taken or may take any action hereunder (including any consent to any amendment or waiver pursuant to Section 10.03), provided that any waiver, amendment or modification requiring the consent of all Lenders or each affected Lender which affects such Defaulting Lender differently than other affected Lenders shall require the consent of such Defaulting Lender.

or any such Debt aggregating the Requisite Amount shall be declared due and payable or any other event shall occur or condition shall exist under any agreement or instrument relating to any such Debt aggregating the Requisite Amount and shall continue after the applicable grace period, if any, specified in such agreement or instrument, if the effect of such event or condition is to enable or permit the holder or holders of such Debt or any trustee or agent on its or their behalf to accelerate the maturity of such Debt;

Section 9. The Administrative Agent. 9.01 Authorization and Action. Each Lender hereby appoints and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such action as administrative agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. As to any matters not expressly provided for by this Agreement and the other Loan Documents (including, without limitation, enforcement or collection of the Notes), the Administrative Agent shall not be required to exercise any discretion or take any action, but shall be required to act or to refrain from acting (and shall be fully protected in so acting or refraining from acting) upon the instructions of the Required Lenders, and such instructions shall be binding upon all Lenders and all holders of Notes; provided, however, that the Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action that exposes the Administrative Agent to personal liability or that is contrary to this Agreement or applicable law. The Administrative Agent agrees to give to each Lender prompt notice of each notice given to it by the Borrower pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. 9.02 Administrative Agent's Reliance, Etc. Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its directors, officers, agents or employees shall be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it or them under or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, except for its or their own gross negligence or willful misconduct. Without limitation of the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent: (i) may treat the payee of any Note as the holder thereof until the Administrative Agent receives and accepts an Assignment and Acceptance entered into by the Lender that is the payee of such Note, as assignor, and an Eligible Assignee, as assignee, as provided in Section 10.06; (ii) may consult with legal counsel (including counsel for the Borrower), independent public accountants and other experts selected by it and shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken in good faith by it in accordance with the advice of such counsel, accountants or experts; (iii) makes no warranty or representation to any Lender and shall not be responsible to any Lender for any statements, warranties or representations (whether written or oral) made in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document; (iv) shall not have any duty to ascertain or to inquire as to the performance or observance of any of the terms, covenants or conditions of this Agreement or any other Loan Document on the part of the Borrower or to inspect the property or assets (including the books and records) of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries; (v) shall not be responsible to any Lender for the due execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of this Agreement or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto; and (vi) shall incur no liability under or in respect of this Agreement or any other Loan Document by acting upon any notice, consent, certificate or other instrument or writing (which may be by facsimile transmission, telex, telegram or electronic messaging system) believed by it to be genuine and signed or sent by the proper party or parties. 9.03 JPMorgan and Affiliates. With respect to its Commitment, the Loans made by it and the Note issued to it, JPMorgan shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent; and the term "Lender" or "Lenders" shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated, include JPMorgan in its individual capacity. JPMorgan and its Affiliates (including, without limitation, their respective directors, officers, agents or employees) may accept deposits from, lend money to, act as trustee under indentures of, and generally engage in any kind of business with, the Borrower, any Subsidiary, the Acquired Business and any Person who may do business with or own securities of the Borrower, any Subsidiary or the Acquired Business, all as if JPMorgan were not the Administrative Agent and without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders. 9.04 Lender Credit Decision. Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on the financial statements referred to in Section 3.01(b) and such other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement. 9.05 Indemnification. The Lenders agree to indemnify the Administrative Agent (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrower), ratably according to the respective amounts of their Commitments, from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever that may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against the Administrative Agent in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any action taken or omitted by the Administrative Agent under this Agreement, provided that no Lender shall be liable for any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from the Administrative Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct. Without limitation of the foregoing, each Lender agrees to reimburse the Administrative Agent promptly upon demand for its ratable share of any out of pocket expenses (including counsel fees) incurred by the Administrative Agent in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration, modification, amendment or enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice in respect of rights or responsibilities under, this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, to the extent that the Administrative Agent is not reimbursed for such expenses by the Borrower. The parties agree than no party identified on the cover page as a Joint Lead Arranger or as Joint Syndication Agent shall, in such capacity, have any liability or responsibility hereunder or in connection herewith. 9.06 Successor Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent may resign at any time by giving ten days' advance written notice thereof to the Lenders and the Borrower and may be removed at any time with or without cause by the Required Lenders and, if no Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Borrower (acting together with the Required Lenders). Upon any such resignation or removal, the Required Lenders shall have the right to appoint a successor Administrative Agent, subject to, if no Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the approval of the Borrower (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld). If no successor Administrative Agent shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders, and shall have accepted such appointment, within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent's giving of notice of resignation or the Required Lenders' removal of the retiring Administrative Agent, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent, which shall be a commercial bank organized or licensed under the laws of the United States of America or of any State thereof and having a combined capital and surplus of at least $500,000,000, subject to, if no Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the approval of the Borrower (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld). Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor Administrative Agent, such successor Administrative Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, discretion, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations under this Agreement. After any retiring Administrative Agent's resignation or removal hereunder as Administrative Agent, the provisions of this Section 9 shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Administrative Agent under this Agreement. Section 10. Miscellaneous. 10.01 No Waiver; Remedies. No failure to exercise or delay in exercising any right, power or privilege in respect of this Agreement or any other Loan Document will be presumed to operate as a waiver, and no single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege in respect of this Agreement or any other Loan Document will be presumed to preclude any subsequent or further exercise, of that right, power or privilege or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The making of the Loans on the Funding Date shall not be presumed to operate as a waiver of any Default resulting from inaccurate representations and warranties made on the Funding Date unless expressly so waived by the Administrative Agent acting on behalf of the Required Lenders or all Lenders as the case may require. The remedies provided herein are cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies provided by Law. 10.02 Notices, Etc. (a) Notices Generally.

Nothing in this Section 10.02 shall prejudice the right of the Administrative Agent to make the Communications available to the Lenders in any other manner specified in this Agreement. (iii) E-mail Notification to Lenders. Each Lender agrees (unless separate arrangements have been made with the Administrative Agent) that e-mail notice to it (at the address provided pursuant to the next sentence and deemed delivered as provided in the next paragraph) specifying that Communications have been posted to the Platform shall constitute effective delivery of such Communications to such Lender for purposes of this Agreement.

No amendment or waiver of any provision of this Agreement (except Section 3.02(j)) or the other Loan Documents (except the Commitment Documents), nor consent to any departure by the Borrower therefrom, shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the Required Lenders, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given; provided that no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by all the Lenders affected thereby, do any of the following: (a) waive or amend any of the conditions specified in Section 3, (b) increase the Commitments of any Lender or subject any Lender to any additional obligations, (c) reduce the principal of, or interest on, the Loans or any fees or other amounts payable hereunder, (d) amend Section 2.11(a) or the definitions of Equity Issuance, Debt Incurrence, Specified Asset Sale, Property Loss Event or Net Cash Proceeds, (e) release all or substantially all of the Guarantors from the Guaranty Agreement, except as provided in Section 10.15, (f) alter the manner in which Commitment reductions or payments or prepayments of principal, interest or other amounts hereunder shall be applied as among the Lenders, (g) postpone any date fixed for any payment of principal of, or interest on, the Loans or any fees or other amounts payable hereunder, (h) change the percentage of the Commitments or of the aggregate unpaid principal amount of the Loans, or the number of Lenders, that shall be required for the Lenders or any of them to take any action hereunder, (i) amend this Section 10.03 or (j) extend the commitment period of any Lender or amend the definition of "Commitment Termination Date"; and provided further that no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by the Administrative Agent in addition to the Lenders required above to take such action, affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent under this Agreement or any other Loan Document; and provided further, that the Administrative Agent may, with the written consent of the Borrower, amend, modify or supplement this Agreement to cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency, so long as such amendment, modification or supplement does not adversely affect the rights of any Lender. No amendment or waiver of Section 3.02(j), nor consent to any departure by the Borrower therefrom, shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the Joint Lead Arrangers, and notwithstanding any terms herein to the contrary no such waiver or consent shall require the consent or approval of the other Lenders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Joint Lead Arrangers may, in consultation with the Borrower, amend this Agreement and the other Loan Documents (other than the Commitment Documents) to the extent permitted pursuant to the provisions of the Commitment Documents without consent of the Borrower or any Lender (and to the extent requested by the Joint Lead Arrangers, the Borrower and each Lender agree to execute all such amendments and any other documents reasonably requested in connection therewith); provided that no such amendment shall materially and adversely affect any Lender, unless consented to in writing and signed by all such Lenders affected thereby. 10.04 Costs and Expenses; Indemnity.

Determinations by a Lender for purposes of this Section 10.04(b) of any loss, cost or expense shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, provided that such determinations are made on a reasonable basis.

(c) The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, each Joint Lead Arranger, and each Lender, and each Related Party of any of the foregoing Persons (each such Person being called an "Indemnitee") on demand against, and hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses, including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for any Indemnitee, incurred by or asserted against any Indemnitee arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of (i) the execution or delivery of this Agreement or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the performance by the parties hereto of their respective obligations hereunder or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby including the Acquisition, (ii) any Loan or the use of the proceeds therefrom, or (iii) any actual or prospective claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing (including any such action proceeding or investigation brought by or against any person, including stockholders, partners or other equity holders of the Borrower or the Acquired Business), whether based on contract, tort or any other theory and in any capacity regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto, in each case, whether or not such investigation, litigation, claim or proceeding is brought by the Borrower, the Acquired Business, any equity holders or creditors of the Borrower or the Acquired Business or an Indemnitee and whether or not any such Indemnitee is otherwise a party thereto; provided that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee in the performance of its obligations under the Loan Documents; provided, however, that in no event will such Indemnitee or such other parties have any liability for any indirect, consequential, special or punitive damages in connection with or as a result of such Indemnitee's or such other parties' activities related to the Loan Documents and the Borrower hereby waives, releases and agrees not to sue upon such claim or any such damages whether or not accrued or not known or suspected to exist in its favor. If for any reason the foregoing indemnification is unavailable to any Indemnitee or insufficient to hold it harmless, then the Borrower will contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnitee, as the case may be, as a result of such loss, claim, damage, liability and related expenses in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative economic interests of (i) the Borrower and the Acquired Business and their respective Affiliates, stockholders, partners or other equity holders on the one hand and (ii) such Indemnitee on the other hand in the matters contemplated by the Loan Documents (including the Acquisition) as well as the relative fault of (i) the Borrower and the Acquired Business and their respective Affiliates, stockholders, partners or other equity holders and (ii) such Indemnitee with respect to such loss, claim, damage or liability and any other relevant equitable considerations. (d) Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement of the Borrower or the Lenders hereunder, the agreements and obligations of the Borrower contained in Sections 2.14, 2.16 and this Section, and the agreements and obligations of each Lender under Section 10.11, shall survive the payment in full of principal, interest and all other amounts payable hereunder and under the Notes. 10.05 Binding Effect.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, until the earlier of (1) the date that the syndication of the Commitments and Loans is terminated (as determined by the Joint Lead Arrangers) and (2) the date that is 90 days after the Funding Date, no assignments or other transfers will be permitted (other than by the Joint Lead Arrangers or their Affiliates) without the prior written consent of the Joint Lead Arrangers (provided that during such period the consent of the Borrower shall not be required), except that any Lender may assign its Loans or Commitments to any Affiliate of such Lender with written consent of the Administrative Agent. Upon such execution, delivery, acceptance and recording, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Acceptance, (x) the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent that rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned to it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance, have the rights and obligations of a Lender hereunder and (y) the Lender assignor thereunder shall, to the extent that rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned by it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance, relinquish its rights and be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering all or the remaining portion of an assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto) but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.14, 2.16 and 10.04 with respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment. (b) By executing and delivering an Assignment and Acceptance, the Lender assignor thereunder and the assignee thereunder confirm to and agree with each other and the other parties hereto as follows: (i) other than as provided in such Assignment and Acceptance, such assigning Lender makes no representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to any statements, warranties or representations made in or in connection with this Agreement or the execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of this Agreement or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto; (ii) such assigning Lender makes no representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to the financial condition of the Borrower or any Guarantor or the performance or observance by the Borrower or any Guarantor of any of its obligations under this Agreement or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto; (iii) such assignee confirms that it has received a copy of this Agreement, together with copies of the financial statements referred to in Section 4.04 and such other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate to make its own credit analysis and decision to enter into such Assignment and Acceptance; (iv) such assignee will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, such assigning Lender or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement; (v) such assignee confirms that it is an Eligible Assignee; (vi) such assignee appoints and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such action as agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers and discretion under this Agreement as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof, together with such powers and discretion as are reasonably incidental thereto; and (vii) such assignee agrees that it will perform in accordance with their terms all of the obligations that by the terms of this Agreement are required to be performed by it as a Lender. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the Borrower shall not be obligated to pay to any assignee any amounts under Sections 2.14 or 2.16 in excess of the amount the Borrower would have been obligated to pay thereunder to the assigning Lender in the absence of such assignment, unless such assignment is made at a time when the circumstances giving rise to such greater payments did not exist. (c) Following (i) a demand by any Lender pursuant to, or the incurrence by the Borrower of an obligation to make a payment pursuant to, Section 2.14, 2.15 or 2.16, (ii) any Lender becoming a Defaulting Lender or (iii) in connection with any proposed amendment, modification, waiver or termination requiring the consent of all the Lenders or all affected Lenders, for which the consent of the Required Lenders has been obtained, the failure of any Lender whose consent is required but not obtained to vote in favor of such amendment, modification, waiver or termination, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 10.06(a)), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); provided that (w) the Borrower shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, (x) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees (other than fees accrued pursuant to Section 2.05(a) in the event such Lender is a Defaulting Lender) and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts), (y) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim or obligations under Sections 2.14, 2.15 or 2.16, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments and (z) no Default shall have occurred and be continuing. A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply. (d) Upon its receipt of an Assignment and Acceptance executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee representing that it is an Eligible Assignee, together with any Notes subject to such assignment, the Administrative Agent shall, if such Assignment and Acceptance has been completed and is in substantially the form of Exhibit C hereto, (i) accept such Assignment and Acceptance, (ii) record the information contained therein in the Register and (iii) give prompt notice thereof to the Borrower. Within five Business Days after its receipt of such notice, the Borrower at its own expense, shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent in exchange for the surrendered Note (which shall be marked "cancelled" by the assigning Lender) a new Note to the order of such Eligible Assignee in an amount equal to the Commitment or Loan, as applicable, assumed by it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance and, if the assigning Lender has retained a Commitment or Loan, as applicable, hereunder, a new Note to the order of the assigning Lender in an amount equal to the Commitment or Loan, as applicable, retained by it hereunder. Such new Notes shall be in an aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of such surrendered Notes, shall be dated the effective date of such Assignment and Acceptance and shall otherwise be in substantially the form of Exhibit A hereto. (e) The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as the agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at its address referred to in Section 10.02 a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to and accepted by it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders and the Commitment of, and principal amount and interest of the Loans owing to, each Lender from time to time (the "Register"). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower or any Lender at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. (f) Each Lender may sell participations to one or more banks or other entities (other than the Borrower or any of its Affiliates) in or to all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including, without limitation, all or a portion of its Commitment, the Loans owing to it and the Notes held by it); provided that (i) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement (including, without limitation, its Commitment to the Borrower hereunder) shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, (iii) such Lender shall remain the holder of any such Note for all purposes of this Agreement, (iv) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement and (v) no participant under any such participation shall have any right to approve any amendment or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any Note, or any consent to any departure by the Borrower therefrom, except to the extent that such amendment, waiver or consent would reduce the principal of, or interest on, the Notes or any fees or other amounts payable hereunder, in each case to the extent subject to such participation, or postpone any date fixed for any payment of principal of, or interest on, the Notes or any fees or other amounts payable hereunder, in each case to the extent subject to such participation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, until the earlier of (1) the date that the syndication of the Commitments and Loans is terminated (as determined by the Joint Lead Arrangers) and (2) the date that is 90 days after the Funding Date, no participations or other transfers will be permitted (other than by the Joint Lead Arrangers) without the prior written consent of the Joint Lead Arrangers, except that any Lender may sell participations in or to its Loans or Commitments to any Affiliate of such Lender with written consent of the Administrative Agent. (g) Any Lender may, in connection with any assignment or participation or proposed assignment or participation pursuant to this Section 10.06, disclose to the assignee or participant or proposed assignee or participant the existence of (and facts and information related to) an Event of Default or any publicly available information concerning the Borrower, any Subsidiary or the Acquired Business in the possession of such Lender from time to time; provided that, prior to any such disclosure of the existence of (and facts and information related to) an Event of Default, the assignee or participant or proposed assignee or participant shall agree to preserve the confidentiality of the existence of (and facts and information related to) such Event of Default, which agreement shall be on the same terms as those set forth in Section 10.11. The disclosure permitted by this Section 10.06(g) shall be in addition to any disclosure permitted by Section 10.11. (h) Notwithstanding any other provision set forth in this Agreement, any Lender may at any time create a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement (including, without limitation, the Loans owing to it and the Notes held by it) in favor of any Federal Reserve Bank or other Governmental Authority in accordance with any regulation of the Federal Reserve or other Governmental Authority. No such assignment shall release any Lender from its obligations hereunder. 10.07 Governing Law. This Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the law of the State of New York without regard to conflict of laws principles thereof. 10.08 Execution in Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts and by different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when so executed shall be deemed to be an original and all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by telecopier or electronic mail shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement. 10.09 Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assignees. 10.10 Captions. Captions and section headings appearing herein are included solely for convenience of reference and are not intended to affect the interpretation of any provision of this Agreement. 10.11 Confidentiality. The Administrative Agent, each Joint Lead Arranger and each Lender shall hold all non-public information regarding the Borrower and its Subsidiaries and their business identified as such by the Borrower and obtained by the Administrative Agent or such Joint Lead Arranger or Lender, as the case may be, pursuant to the requirements hereof in accordance with such Person's customary procedures for handling confidential information of such nature, provided that nothing herein contained shall be construed to prevent the Administrative Agent or such Lender or Joint Lead Arranger from disclosing such information (i) to any Affiliate of the Administrative Agent or such Lender or Joint Lead Arranger or any officer, director, employee or agent or any attorney or accountant for the Administrative Agent or such Lender or Joint Lead Arranger that agrees to be similarly bound, (ii) to any bona fide or potential assignee, transferee or participant in connection with the contemplated assignment, transfer or participation of any Commitments or Loans or any participations therein or by any direct or indirect contractual counterparties (or the professional advisors thereto) to any swap or derivative transaction relating to the Borrower and its obligations that agrees to be bound by the provisions of this Section 10.11, (iii) pursuant to any subpoena or upon the Order of any court or administrative agency or upon the request or demand of, or in connection with any investigation, examination or audit by, any governmental agency or authority, whether or not such request or demand shall have the force of Law, upon notice to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders of such subpoena, Order, request or demand (unless such notice is not legally permissible), provided that, except with respect to any audit or examination conducted in the ordinary course by bank accountants or by any governmental bank regulatory authority exercising examination or supervisory authority, the Administrative Agent or such Lender or Joint Lead Arranger (as the case may be) shall have used its best efforts to provide prompt notice to the Borrower (unless such notice is not legally permissible) of such subpoena, Order, request or demand or such investigation, examination or audit so as to enable the Borrower to seek a protective Order or other appropriate remedy and thereafter discloses only the minimum information required to be disclosed in order to comply with such subpoena, order, request or demand of, or in connection with such investigation, examination or audit, (iv) that has been obtained from any Person that is not a party to this Agreement or an Affiliate of any such party and who was not similarly bound so far as such Person was aware, (v) to any rating agency when required by it, provided that, prior to any disclosure, such rating agency shall undertake in writing to preserve the confidentiality of any confidential information relating to Borrower received by it from the Administrative Agent, any Joint Lead Arranger or any Lender, and (vi) in connection with the exercise of any remedy hereunder. Said authorization to disclose is subject to any federal or state securities laws that reasonably require the parties to keep some or all aspects of the transaction contemplated herein confidential. Furthermore, nothing in this Section 10.11 shall be construed as a waiver of any applicable attorney client privilege or any privilege arising under section 7525 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or any duty of confidentiality on the part of any attorney or accountant under any code of professional conduct that, in each case, relates to communications with respect to the transactions contemplated herein or the execution thereof. 10.12 Jurisdiction, Etc. (a) Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its property and assets, to the exclusive jurisdiction of any New York State court or Federal court of the United States of America, in each case sitting in New York County, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment, and each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that all claims in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in any such New York State court or, to the extent permitted by Law, in such Federal court. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law. (b) Each of the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents in any New York State or Federal court. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court. 10.13 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH OF THE BORROWER, THE GUARANTORS, THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND THE LENDERS HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS OR THE ACTIONS OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT OR ANY LENDER IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE OR ENFORCEMENT THEREOF. 10.14 USA Patriot Act. Each Lender hereby notifies the Borrower that pursuant to the requirements of the Patriot Act, it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies the Borrower, which information includes the names and addresses of the Borrower and other information that will allow such Lender to identify the Borrower in accordance with said Act. 10.15 Release of Guarantors. (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in any other Loan Document, upon request of the Borrower in connection with any Disposition of a Subsidiary that is a Guarantor as permitted by the Loan Documents and immediately following such Disposition such Subsidiary will no longer be a Subsidiary of the Borrower, the Administrative Agent shall (without notice to, or vote or consent of, any Lender) take such actions as shall be required to release any Guarantee under any Loan Document of any Guarantor (including releasing such Guarantor from the Guaranty Agreement) being disposed of in such Disposition, to the extent necessary to permit consummation of such Disposition in accordance with the Loan Documents, provided that no Default would result from such release. (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or any other Loan Document, when the principal and interest with respect to all Loans and all other monetary payment Obligations which are then due and payable have been paid in full and all Commitments have terminated or expired, upon request of the Borrower, the Administrative Agent shall (without notice to, or vote or consent of, any Lender) take such actions as shall be required to release all Guarantees under any Loan Document of any Guarantor. Any such release of guarantee obligations shall be deemed subject to the provision that such Guarantees shall be reinstated if within 90 days after such release (or such longer period under any Federal, state or foreign bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or similar Law now or hereafter in effect during which any payment in respect of the Obligations guaranteed thereby can be annulled, avoided, set aside, rescinded, invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential or otherwise required to be refunded or repaid) any portion of any payment in respect of the Obligations guaranteed thereby shall be rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned upon the insolvency, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation or reorganization of any Loan Party, or upon or as a result of the appointment of a receiver, intervenor or conservator of, or trustee or similar officer for, any Loan Party or any substantial part of its property or assets, or otherwise, all as though such payment had not been made. 10.16 No Fiduciary Duty. The Administrative Agent, each Joint Lead Arranger, each Arranger referred to on the cover page of this Agreement, each Lender and their Affiliates (collectively, solely for purposes of this paragraph, the "Lenders"), may have economic interests that conflict with those of Borrower. Borrower agrees that nothing in the Loan Documents or otherwise will be deemed to create an advisory, fiduciary or agency relationship or fiduciary or other implied duty between the Lenders and Borrower, its stockholders or its affiliates. The Borrower acknowledges and agrees that (i) the transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents are arm's-length commercial transactions between the Lenders, on the one hand, and Borrower, on the other, (ii) in connection therewith and with the process leading to such transaction each of the Lenders is acting solely as a principal and not the agent or fiduciary of Borrower, its management, stockholders, creditors or any other person, (iii) no Lender has assumed an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in favor of Borrower with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether any Lender or any of its affiliates has advised or is currently advising Borrower on other matters) or any other obligation to Borrower except the obligations expressly set forth in the Loan Documents and (iv) Borrower has consulted its own legal and financial advisors to the extent it deemed appropriate. Borrower further acknowledges and agrees that it is responsible for making its own independent judgment with respect to such transactions and the process leading thereto. Borrower agrees that it will not claim that any Lender has rendered advisory services of any nature or respect, or owes a fiduciary or similar duty to Borrower, in connection with such transaction or the process leading thereto. 10.17 Right of Set-off. Upon (i) the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default and (ii) the making of the request or the granting of the consent specified in Section 8 by the Required Lenders to authorize the Administrative Agent to declare the Loans due and payable pursuant to the provisions of Section 8 and notice to the Borrower as required under Section 8, each Lender and each Affiliate of a Lender is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other Debt at any time owing by such Lender or its Affiliates to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower or any Guarantor against any and all of the Obligations now or hereafter existing whether or not such Lender shall have made any demand under this Agreement or any other Loan Document and even though such Obligations may be unmatured. Each Lender agrees promptly to notify the Borrower after any such set-off and application made by such Lender or its Affiliates; provided, however, that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application. The rights of each Lender under this Section 10.17 are in addition to the other rights and remedies (including other rights of set-off) that such Lender may have. [SIGNATURE PAGES FOLLOW]
