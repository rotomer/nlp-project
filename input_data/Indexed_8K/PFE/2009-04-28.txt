Continues to Execute on Strategic and Financial Commitments While Planning for the Pending Wyeth Acquisition Remains On-Track
NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 28, 2009--Pfizer Inc (NYSE: PFE):
Pfizer Inc (NYSE: PFE) today reported financial results for first-quarter 2009. Revenues were $10.9 billion, a decrease of 8% compared with the year-ago quarter. Foreign exchange unfavorably impacted revenues by approximately $640 million or 5%. For first-quarter 2009, U.S. revenues were $5.0 billion, a decrease of 10% compared with the year-ago quarter. International revenues were $5.9 billion, a decrease of 7% compared with the prior-year quarter, and reflected operational growth of 3%, which was more than offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of 10%. U.S. revenues represented 46%, while international revenues represented 54%, of total revenues, comparable with the year-ago quarter. In addition to foreign exchange, other factors that negatively impacted first-quarter 2009 revenues in comparison with the year-ago quarter included the loss of U.S. exclusivity for Zyrtec in January 2008 and Camptosar in February 2008 as well as the revenue declines for Lipitor, as a result of continued intense competition, and for Chantix, mainly due to label changes.
Business Revenues
Effective January 1, 2009, Pfizer expanded its new operating model within the Pharmaceutical business, which is now comprised of five customer-focused units with clear, single points of accountability to enable the Company to more effectively anticipate and respond to the diverse needs of physicians, customers and patients: Primary Care, Specialty Care, Oncology, Established Products and Emerging Markets. In addition to the pharmaceutical business, the Company has a significant Animal Health business.
Primary Care revenues for first-quarter 2009 were $5.3 billion, an 8% decline compared with $5.8 billion in the year-ago quarter. In addition to the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, the decline in revenues compared with the same period last year was primarily driven by continued pressure on Lipitor from generic competition and by the negative impact of the Chantix label changes, as well as by the loss of U.S. exclusivity for Zyrtec in January 2008.
Specialty Care revenues for first-quarter 2009 were $1.5 billion, a 7% increase compared with $1.4 billion in the same period last year. Despite the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, revenues increased, primarily driven by the solid operational performance in both the U.S. and international markets from certain products, including Xalatan, Zyvox, Vfend and Revatio.
Oncology revenues for first-quarter 2009 were $350 million, a 17% decrease compared with $421 million in the prior-year quarter. In addition to the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, revenues were unfavorably impacted by the loss of U.S. exclusivity for Camptosar in February 2008, which was partially offset by strong international performance, largely driven by Sutent.
Established Products revenues for first-quarter 2009 were $1.6 billion, a 12% decline compared with $1.8 billion in the year-ago quarter. Since the products in this unit generally have lost patent protection or marketing exclusivity, revenues have declined. This unit was created in 2008 with the goal of recapturing value for these products in developed market geographies by progressively slowing the erosion of, and ultimately stabilizing, revenue and profit from established products. Supporting initiatives within the unit include programs designed to expand patient and payor access to this portfolio, to develop product enhancements, to expand the portfolio and to increase promotional efforts for targeted products.
Emerging Markets revenues for first-quarter 2009 were $1.4 billion, a 9% decrease compared with $1.5 billion in first-quarter 2008. Revenues in Emerging Markets, which also includes revenues from established products sold in these geographies, were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange, which was partially offset by solid operational growth, led by expansion efforts in China.
Animal Health revenues for first-quarter 2009 were $537 million, a 13% decline compared with $619 million in the year-ago quarter. In addition to the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, revenues were impacted by global macroeconomic conditions, which negatively affected global spending on veterinary care, as well as by a planned change in terms with U.S. distributors resulting in an anticipated, one-time reduction in U.S. distributor inventories.
Reported Net Income

and Reported Diluted EPS
(2)
For first-quarter 2009, Pfizer posted reported net income of $2.7 billion, a decline of 2% compared with $2.8 billion in the prior-year quarter, and reported diluted EPS of $0.40, a decline of 2% compared with $0.41 in the prior-year quarter. First-quarter 2009 results were unfavorably impacted by the decrease in total revenues and other income, the increase in the effective tax rate as well as costs incurred in connection with the pending Wyeth acquisition. These factors were partially offset by savings from cost-reduction initiatives and the elimination of in-process research and development charges in 2009. The increase in the effective tax rate on reported results to 28% from 22% in the year-ago quarter was primarily due to the increased tax cost associated with certain business decisions executed to finance the pending Wyeth acquisition.

Adjusted Income and Adjusted Diluted EPS
(1)
(1)
First-quarter 2009 adjusted income was $3.7 billion, a decrease of 11% compared with $4.1 billion in the year-ago quarter, and adjusted diluted EPS was $0.54, a decrease of 11% compared with $0.61 in the year-ago quarter. Both adjusted income and adjusted diluted EPS were negatively impacted by the decrease in total revenues and the increase in the effective tax rate on adjusted income to approximately 30% from 22% in the prior-year quarter, which were partially offset by savings from cost-reduction initiatives.

In first-quarter 2009, adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenues was 12.1% compared with 15.3% in first-quarter 2008. This improvement reflects the benefits from cost-reduction initiatives and foreign exchange. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenues was 14.4% in first-quarter 2009.
(1)
(1)
Adjusted selling, informational and administrative (SI&A) expenses were $2.8 billion in first-quarter 2009, a decrease of 17% compared with $3.4 billion in the prior-year quarter. The decrease was due to the favorable impact of cost-reduction initiatives and, to a lesser extent, certain insurance recoveries. Also, foreign exchange reduced first-quarter 2009 adjusted SI&A expenses by approximately $140 million compared with the year-ago quarter.
(1)
(1)
Adjusted research and development (R&D) expenses were $1.7 billion in first-quarter 2009, an increase of 2% compared with $1.6 billion in the prior-year period. The increase was due to a $150 million milestone payment to Bristol-Myers Squibb in this years first quarter in connection with the collaboration on apixaban, partially offset by the favorable impact of cost-reduction initiatives. Foreign exchange reduced first-quarter 2009 adjusted R&D expenses by approximately $60 million compared with the year-ago quarter.
(1)
(1)
Overall, operational improvements resulting from cost-reduction initiatives and, to a much lesser extent, certain insurance recoveries decreased adjusted total costs by approximately $500 million or 7% in first-quarter 2009 compared with the prior-year period, and foreign exchange decreased adjusted total costs by approximately $540 million or 8%. The operational improvements were driven partially by the reduction in workforce to approximately 80,250 colleagues at the end of first-quarter 2009, a decline of 1,650 compared with year-end 2008, and a decline of 6,350 since the beginning of 2008, as well as manufacturing and research and development site exits. The decline of 1,650 colleagues in first-quarter 2009 was net of new colleagues hired in expanding areas across the Company, primarily in emerging markets.

Executive Commentary
During the quarter, we continued our ongoing efforts to reshape our operating model, made substantial progress in planning for the Wyeth integration, and faced a challenging and dynamic economic and competitive environment. Yet, we remained focused on meeting our commitments - generating revenues consistent with our expectations and continuing to streamline our cost structure. We remain on-track to deliver on our full-year 2009 guidance for revenues and adjusted results, stated Jeff Kindler, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
(1)
Kindler continued, Even as we achieve our short-term objectives, we continue to lay the groundwork to increase long-term shareholder value through the pending combination with Wyeth. Our recent announcement on the planned leadership and organizational structure for the companys combined research and commercial operations demonstrates our intention to advance strong scientific capabilities and to retain top scientific and commercial talent from both organizations as we build the worlds premier biopharmaceutical company.
Frank DAmelio, Chief Financial Officer, stated, We achieved several significant milestones in this quarter in planning for the Wyeth acquisition, making substantial progress in a short period of time. We remain committed to a rapid and successful integration, while at the same time delivering on our 2009 financial goals, which remains a top priority. Today, were reaffirming our full-year 2009 financial guidance for revenues and adjusted results, and updating our reported diluted EPS guidance to include certain costs associated with the pending acquisition of Wyeth.

Financial Guidance
For full-year 2009, Pfizers financial guidance, at current exchange rates is summarized below. This guidance is unchanged from the guidance provided on January 26, 2009, except for reported diluted EPS, which has been reduced to a range of $1.20 to $1.35 from $1.34 to $1.49 to reflect certain costs incurred and expected to be incurred in connection with the pending Wyeth acquisition. These costs include, but are not limited to, transaction costs, pre-integration costs and financing costs. We also continue to expect to achieve net savings compared to 2008 adjusted total costs of $2 billion by the end of 2011 at 2008 foreign exchange rates.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
1) Impact of Foreign Exchange on Revenues
The strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies, primarily the euro, UK pound and Canadian dollar, unfavorably impacted our revenues by approximately $640 million, or 5%, in first-quarter 2009, compared to the same period in 2008.
2) Change in Cost of Sales
Reported cost of sales decreased 29% in first-quarter 2009, compared to the same period in 2008. The decrease primarily reflects the favorable impact of foreign exchange, the savings impact of our cost-reduction initiatives and lower implementation costs associated with our cost-reduction initiatives.
Reported cost of sales included implementation charges related to our cost-reduction initiatives of $76 million for the first quarter of 2009 and $138 million for the first quarter of 2008.
Reported cost of sales as a percentage of revenues decreased 3.8 percentage points to 13.0% in first-quarter 2009, reflecting the favorable impact of our cost-reduction initiatives, the impact of foreign exchange, as well as lower implementation costs associated with our cost-reduction initiatives, compared to first-quarter 2008.
3) Change in Selling, Informational & Administrative (SI&A) Expenses, Research & Development (R&D) Expenses and In-Process R&D Charges (IPR&D)
Reported SI&A expenses in first-quarter 2009 decreased 18% compared to the same period in 2008, reflecting the savings associated with our cost-reduction initiatives, the favorable impact of foreign exchange, lower implementation costs associated with our cost-reduction initiatives and certain insurance recoveries related to legal defense costs.
Reported SI&A expenses included implementation charges related to our cost-reduction initiatives of $46 million for first quarter 2009 and $75 million for first-quarter 2008.
Reported R&D expenses, excluding IPR&D, decreased 5% in first-quarter 2009, compared to the same period in 2008. The decrease is primarily due to the favorable impact of foreign exchange on expenses, the realization of savings associated with our cost-reduction initiatives and lower implementation costs associated with our cost-reduction initiatives, partially offset by a $150 million milestone payment to Bristol-Myers Squibb in first-quarter 2009 in connection with the collaboration on apixaban.
Reported R&D expenses included implementation charges related to our cost-reduction initiatives of $41 million for first-quarter 2009 and $146 million for first-quarter 2008.
IPR&D charges in first-quarter 2008 of $398 million primarily related to the acquisitions of CovX and Coley Pharmaceutical Group, Inc. As a result of adopting Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141R, beginning January 1, 2009, IPR&D related to future acquisitions will be recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as indefinite-lived intangible assets. We made no acquisitions in the first quarter of 2009.
Business Combinations,
4) Other Income and Other Deductions
(a) The decrease in net interest income in first-quarter 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 was due primarily to lower interest rates, partially offset by higher cash balances in first-quarter 2009, and $23 million of net interest expense in first-quarter 2009 associated with our issuance of $13.5 billion of senior unsecured notes related to the pending Wyeth acquisition.
5) Effective Tax Rate
The effective tax rate on reported for first-quarter 2009 was 28.2% compared to 21.5% in first-quarter 2008. The higher tax rate in the first quarter of 2009 is primarily due to the increased tax costs associated with certain business decisions executed to finance the pending Wyeth acquisition, partially offset by the change in geographic mix of expenses incurred to execute our cost-reduction initiatives, as well as the elimination of IPR&D charges, which generally are not deductible for tax purposes.
Income from continuing operations before provision for taxes on income
The effective tax rate on adjusted income was 29.7% in first-quarter 2009 compared to 21.9% in first-quarter 2008. The higher tax rate in the first quarter of 2009 is primarily due to the increased tax costs associated with certain business decisions executed to finance the pending Wyeth acquisition.

Guidance to 2009 Reported Net Income Attributable to Pfizer Inc and Reported Diluted EPS Attributable to Pfizer Inc Common Shareholders Guidance
________________
Adjusted income and adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS) are defined as reported net income attributable to Pfizer Inc and reported diluted EPS attributable to Pfizer Inc common shareholders excluding purchase-accounting adjustments, acquisition-related costs, discontinued operations and certain significant items. As described under in the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of Pfizers Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2008, management uses adjusted income, among other factors, to set performance goals and to measure the performance of the overall company. We believe that investors understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing this measure. The adjusted income and adjusted diluted EPS measures are not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for U.S. GAAP net income and diluted EPS.
