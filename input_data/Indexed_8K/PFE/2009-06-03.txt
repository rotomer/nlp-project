This temporary Global Security is issued in respect of the 3.625 per cent. notes due 2013 (the "Euro Notes due 2013") of Pfizer Inc. (the "Company"). The Euro Notes due 2013 are issued subject to and with the benefit of an indenture, dated as of January 30, 2001 (the "Base Indenture") as supplemented by the Second Supplemental Indenture dated as of June 2, 2009 (the "Second Supplemental Indenture" and, together with the Base Indenture, the "Indenture"), which then shall have the meaning assigned to it in such instrument), between, among others, the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon as Trustee (the "Trustee").
Subject as provided in this temporary Global Security, the Company, for value received, promises to pay the bearer of this temporary Global Security the sum of 1,850,000,000 (one billion and eight hundred and fifty million Euros) or such lesser sum as is equal to the principal amount of the Euro Notes due 2013 represented by this temporary Global Security on June 3, 2013 or on such earlier date as the principal in respect of this temporary Global Security may become due under the Indenture and to pay interest on the principal sum for the time being outstanding at the rate of 3.625 per cent. per annum from and including June 3, 2009 payable annually in arrear on each Interest Payment Date (as defined in the Indenture) until payment of the principal sum has been made or duly provided for in full together with any other amounts as may be payable, all subject to and under the Indenture. The principal amount of Euro Notes due 2013 represented by this temporary Global Security shall be the aggregate amount from time to time entered in the records of both Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V. and Clearstream Banking, socit anonyme (together the "relevant
 
Clearing Systems"). The records of the relevant Clearing Systems (which expression in this temporary Global Security means the records that each relevant Clearing System holds for its customers which reflect the amount of such customer's interest in the Euro Notes due 2013) shall be conclusive evidence of the principal amount of Euro Notes due 2013 represented by this temporary Global Security and, for these purposes, a statement issued by a relevant Clearing System (which statement shall be made available to the bearer upon request) stating the nominal amount of Euro Notes due 2013 represented by this temporary Global Security at any time shall be conclusive evidence of the records of the relevant Clearing System at that time.
The permanent Global Security to be issued on exchange for interests in this temporary Global Security will be substantially in the form set out in Exhibit B of the Second Supplemental Indenture. Subject as provided below, the permanent Global Security will only have an entry made to represent definitive Bearer Securities after the date which is forty (40) days after the closing date for the Euro Notes due 2013 (the "Exchange Date"). Interests in this temporary Global Security may be exchanged for interests recorded in the records of the relevant Clearing Systems in a duly executed and authenticated permanent Global Security without charge, in full or partial exchange for this temporary Global Security, in order that the permanent Global Security represents an aggregate principal amount of Euro Notes due 2013 equal to the principal amount of this temporary Global Security submitted for exchange. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such exchange shall be made unless there shall have been presented to the Principal Paying Agent or such other person as the Principal Paying Agent may direct (the "Exchange Agent") by a relevant Clearing System a certificate to the effect that it has received from or in respect of a person entitled to a beneficial interest in a particular principal amount of the Euro Notes due 2013 (as shown by its records) a certificate of non-US beneficial ownership in the form required by it and substantially in the form set out in Exhibit A of the Base Indenture, from such person in the form required by it and substantially in the form set out in Exhibit B of the Base Indenture unless such certification has already been made. Notwithstanding the foregoing, where this temporary Global Security has been exchanged in part for the permanent Global Security pursuant to the foregoing and definitive Bearer Securities have been issued in exchange for the total amount of Euro Notes due 2013 represented by the permanent Global Security pursuant to its terms, then interests in this temporary Global Security will no longer be exchangeable for interests in the permanent Global Security but will be exchangeable, in full or partial exchange, for duly executed and authenticated definitive Bearer Securities, without charge, in the denomination of 50,000 each with Coupons attached, such definitive Bearer Securities to be substantially in the form set out in the Second Supplemental Indenture. Notwithstanding the foregoing, definitive Bearer Securities shall not be so issued and delivered unless there shall have been presented to the Exchange
Agent by a relevant Clearing System a certificate to the effect that it has received from or in respect of a person entitled to a beneficial interest in a particular principal amount of Euro Notes due 2013 (as shown by its records) a certificate of non-US beneficial ownership in the form required by it and substantially in the form set out in Exhibit A of the Base Indenture, from such person in the form required by it and substantially in the form set out in Exhibit B of the Base Indenture unless such certification has already been made. Any person who would, but for the provisions of this temporary Global Security and of the Indenture, otherwise be entitled to receive either (a) an interest in the permanent Global Security or (b) definitive Bearer Securities shall not be entitled to require the exchange of an appropriate part of this temporary Global Security for an interest in the permanent Global Security or definitive Bearer Securities unless and until he shall have delivered or caused to be delivered to a relevant Clearing System a certificate of non-US beneficial ownership in the form required by it and substantially in the form set out in Exhibit A of the Base Indenture. Presentation of this temporary Global Security for exchange shall be made by the bearer hereof on any day (other than a Saturday or Sunday) on which banks are open for general business in London. The aggregate principal amount of interests in the permanent Global Security recorded in the records of the relevant Clearing Systems or, as the case may be, definitive Bearer Securities issued upon an exchange of this temporary Global Security will, subject to the terms hereof, be equal to the aggregate principal amount of this temporary Global Security submitted by the bearer for exchange (to the extent that such principal amount does not exceed the aggregate principal amount of this temporary Global Security). Upon (a) any exchange of a part of this temporary Global Security for an interest in the permanent Global Security or for a definitive Bearer Security, (b) receipt of instructions from a relevant Clearing System that, following the purchase by or on behalf of the Company of a part of this temporary Global Security, part is to be cancelled or (c) any redemption of a part of this temporary Global Security, the Company shall procure that the portion of the principal amount of this temporary Global Security so exchanged, cancelled or redeemed shall be entered pro rata in the records of the relevant Clearing Systems. On an exchange in whole of this temporary Global Security, this temporary Global Security shall be surrendered to or to the order of the Paying Agent.
Until the entire principal amount of this temporary Global Security has been extinguished in exchange for the permanent Global Security and/or definitive Bearer Securities, the bearer of this temporary Global Security shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits as if he were the bearer of the definitive Bearer Securities referred to above, except that the bearer of this temporary Global Security shall only be entitled to receive any payment on this temporary Global Security on presentation of certificates as provided below. Accordingly, except as ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction or as required by law or applicable regulation, the Company, Trustee and any Paying Agent may deem and treat the holder of this
temporary Global Security as the absolute owner of this temporary Global Security for all purposes. All payments of any amounts payable and paid to such holder shall, to the extent of the sums so paid, discharge the liability for the moneys payable on this temporary Global Security and on the relevant definitive Bearer Securities and/or Coupons.
Payments due in respect of Euro Notes due 2013 for the time being represented by this temporary Global Security shall be made to the bearer of this temporary Global Security only upon presentation by a relevant Clearing System to the Paying Agent at its specified office of a certificate to the effect that it has received from or in respect of a person entitled to a particular principal amount of the Euro Notes due 2013 (as shown on its records) a certificate of non-US beneficial ownership in the form required by it and substantially in the form set forth in Exhibit A of the Base Indenture. Each payment so made will discharge the Company's obligations in respect thereof. The bearer of this temporary Global Security will not be entitled to receive any payment of interest due on or after the Exchange Date unless, upon due certification, exchange of this temporary Global Security is improperly withheld or refused. Upon any payment in respect of the Euro Notes due 2013 represented by this temporary Global Security, the Company shall procure that the amount so paid shall be entered pro rata in the records of the relevant Clearing Systems. In the case of any payment of principal the Company shall procure that the amount so paid shall be entered pro rata in the records of the relevant Clearing Systems and, upon such entry being made, the principal amount of the Euro Notes due 2013 recorded in the records of the relevant Clearing Systems and represented by this temporary Global Security shall be reduced by the amount so paid. Any failure to make such entries shall not affect the discharge referred to in the first paragraph above.
For so long as any of the Euro Notes due 2013 is represented by this temporary Global Security or by this temporary Global Security and the permanent Global Security and such Global Security(s) is/are held on behalf of the relevant Clearing Systems, each person (other than a relevant Clearing System) who is for the time being shown in the records of a relevant Clearing System as the holder of a particular principal amount of Euro Notes due 2013 (each an "Accountholder") (in which regard any certificate or other document issued by a relevant Clearing System as to the principal amount of such Euro Notes due 2013 standing to the account of any person shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive and binding for all purposes) shall be treated as the holder of such principal amount of such Euro Notes due 2013 for all purposes (including but not limited to, for the purposes of any quorum requirements of, or the right to demand a poll at, meetings of the Holders and giving notice to the Company pursuant to Section 501 of the Base Indenture) other than with respect to the payment of principal amount and interest of such Euro Notes due 2013, the right to which shall be vested, as against the Company, solely in the bearer of this temporary Global Security in accordance with and subject to its terms and the terms of the Indenture. The Trustee will look solely to the relevant Clearing Systems for the determination of who may be treated as an Accountholder for all purposes under the Indenture (including but not limited to, for the purposes of any quorum requirements of, or the right to demand a poll at, meetings of the Holders and giving notice to the Company pursuant
to Section 501 of the Base Indenture) other than with respect to the payment of principal amount and interest of such Euro Notes due 2013, the right to which shall be vested, as against the Company, solely in the bearer of this temporary Global Security in accordance with and subject to its terms and the terms of the Indenture. Each Accountholder must look solely to the relevant Clearing Systems, for its share of each payment made to the bearer of this temporary Global Security. With respect to this temporary Global Security, the "records" of the relevant Clearing Systems shall mean the records that each of the relevant Clearing Systems holds for its customers which reflect the amount of such customer's interest in the Euro Notes due 2013. The Company covenants in favor of each Accountholder that it will make all payments in respect of the principal amount of Euro Notes due 2013 for the time being shown in the records of the relevant Clearing Systems as being held by the Accountholder and represented by this temporary Global Security to the bearer of this temporary Global Security in accordance with Article One hereof and acknowledges that each Accountholder may take proceedings to enforce this covenant and any of the other rights which it has under the first paragraph of this clause directly against the Company.
For so long as all of the Euro Notes due 2013 are represented by this temporary Global Security or by this temporary Global Security and the permanent Global Security and such Global Security(s) is/are held on behalf of a relevant Clearing System, notices to Holders may be given by delivery of the relevant notice to the relevant Clearing Systems for communication to the relative Accountholders rather than by publication as required by Section 1203 of the Second Supplemental Indenture; provided that, so long as the Euro Notes due 2013 are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, notice will also be given by filing with the Companies Announcement Office of the Irish Stock Exchange if and to the extent that the guidelines of the Irish Stock Exchange so require. Any such notice shall be deemed to have been given to the Holders on the second day after the day on which such notice is delivered to the relevant Clearing Systems as aforesaid.
Claims against the Company in respect of principal and interest on the Euro Notes due 2013 represented by this temporary Global Security will be prescribed after ten (10) years
(in the case of principal and five (5) years (in the case of interest) from the Relevant Date (as defined in Article Ten of the Second Supplemental Indenture).
For so long as all of the Euro Notes due 2013 are represented by this temporary Global Security or by this temporary Global Security and the permanent Global Security and such Global Security(s) is/are held on behalf of a relevant Clearing System, no drawing of Euro Notes due 2013 to be redeemed will be required under Section 703 of the Second Supplemental Indenture in the event that the Company exercises its option pursuant to Section 702 of the Second Supplemental Indenture in respect of less than the aggregate principal amount of the Euro Notes due 2013 outstanding at such time. In such event, the partial redemption will be effected in accordance with the rules and procedures of the relevant Clearing Systems (to be reflected in the records of the relevant Clearing Systems as either a pool factor or a reduction in nominal amount, at their discretion).
The Euro Notes due 2013 represented by this temporary Global Security are transferable in accordance with the rules and procedures of the relevant Clearing Systems.
This temporary Global Security shall not become valid or enforceable for any purpose unless and until it has been authenticated by or on behalf of the Trustee referred to herein and effectuated by the entity appointed as common safe-keeper by the relevant Clearing Systems.

This permanent Global Security is issued in respect of the 3.625 per cent. notes due 2013 (the "Euro Notes due 2013") of Pfizer Inc. (the "Company"). The Euro Notes due 2013 are initially represented by a temporary Global Security interests in which will be exchanged in accordance with the terms of the temporary Global Security for interests in this permanent Global Security and, if applicable, definitive Bearer Securities. The Euro Notes due 2013 are issued subject to and with the benefit of an indenture, dated as of January 30, 2001 (the "Base Indenture") as supplemented by the Second Supplemental Indenture dated as of June 2, 2009 (the "Second Supplemental Indenture" and, together with the Base Indenture, the "Indenture", which then shall have the meaning assigned to it in such instrument), between, among others, the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon as Trustee (the "Trustee").
Subject as provided in this permanent Global Security, the Company, for value received, promises to pay the bearer of this permanent Global Security the sum of 1,850,000,000 (one billion and eight hundred and fifty million Euros) or such lesser sum as is equal to the principal amount of the Euro Notes due 2013 represented by this permanent Global Security on June 3, 2013 or on such earlier date as the principal in respect of this permanent Global Security may become due under the Indenture and to pay interest on the principal sum for
the time being outstanding at the rate of 3.625 per cent. per annum from and including June 3, 2009 payable annually in arrear on each Interest Payment Date (as defined in the Indenture) until payment of the principal sum has been made or duly provided for in full together with any other amounts as may be payable, all subject to and under the Indenture. The principal amount of Euro Notes due 2013 represented by this permanent Global Security shall be the aggregate amount from time to time entered in the records of both Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V. and Clearstream Banking, socit anonyme (together the "relevant Clearing Systems"). The records of the relevant Clearing Systems (which expression in this permanent Global Security means the records that each relevant Clearing System holds for its customers which reflect the amount of such customer's interest in the Euro Notes due 2013) shall be conclusive evidence of the principal amount of Euro Notes due 2013 represented by this permanent Global Security and, for these purposes, a statement issued by a relevant Clearing System (which statement shall be made available to the bearer upon request) stating the nominal amount of Euro Notes due 2013 represented by this permanent Global Security at any time shall be conclusive evidence of the records of the relevant Clearing System at that time.
Upon any exchange of an interest recorded in the records of the relevant Clearing Systems in the temporary Global Security representing the Euro Notes due 2013 for an interest recorded in the records of the relevant Clearing Systems in this permanent Global Security, the Company shall procure that details of such exchange shall be entered pro rata in the records of the relevant Clearing Systems.
The permanent Global Security will be exchangeable in whole but not in part (free of charge to the holder) for definitive Bearer Securities only: (a) upon the happening of any of the events defined in the Indenture as "Events of Default"; (b) if either Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg is closed for business for a continuous period of fourteen (14) days (other than by reason of holiday, statutory or otherwise) or announces an intention permanently to cease business or does in fact do so and no alternative clearing system satisfactory to the Trustee is available; or (c) if the Company would suffer a disadvantage as a result of a change in laws or regulations (taxation or otherwise) or as a result of a change in the practice of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg which would not be suffered were the Euro Notes due 2013 in
 
definitive form and a certificate to such effect signed by two current directors of the Company is given to the Trustee; or (d) upon not less than sixty (60) days' written notice from Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg (acting on the instructions of any holder of an interest in such permanent Global Security) to the Principal Paying Agent. Thereupon (in the case of (a), (b) and (c) above) the holder of the permanent Global Security (acting on the instructions of one or more of the Accountholders (as defined below)) or the Trustee may give notice to the Company and (in the case of (c) above) the Company may give notice to the Trustee and the Holders, of its intention to exchange the permanent Global Security for definitive Bearer Securities on or after the Exchange Date (as defined below). On or after the Exchange Date the holder of the permanent Global Security may or, in the case of (c) above, shall surrender the permanent Global Security to or to the order of the Principal Paying Agent.

On exchange of the permanent Global Security, the Company will procure that it is cancelled and, if the holder so requests, returned to the holder together with any relevant definitive Bearer Securities. Definitive Bearer Securities to be delivered on exchange shall be delivered only outside the United States. The definitive Bearer Securities to be issued on exchange will be in bearer form in the denomination of 50,000 each with Coupons attached and will be substantially in the form set out in Exhibit C to the Second Supplemental Indenture.

Until the entire principal amount of this permanent Global Security has been extinguished in exchange for definitive Bearer Securities or in any other manner envisaged by the terms of the Second Supplemental Indenture, the bearer of this permanent Global Security shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits as if he were the bearer of the definitive Bearer Securities referred to above. Accordingly, except as ordered by a court of competent
 
jurisdiction or as required by law or applicable regulation, the Company, the Trustee and any Paying Agent may deem and treat the holder of this permanent Global Security as the absolute owner of this permanent Global Security for all purposes. All payments of any amounts payable and paid to such holder shall, to the extent of the sums so paid, discharge the liability for the moneys payable on this permanent Global Security and on the relevant definitive Bearer Securities and/or Coupons.

Upon any payment in respect of the Euro Notes due 2013 represented by this permanent Global Security, the Company shall procure that the amount so paid shall be entered pro rata in the records of the relevant Clearing Systems. In the case of any payment of principal the Company shall procure that the amount so paid shall be entered pro rata in the records of the relevant Clearing Systems and, upon any such entry being made, the principal amount of the Euro Notes due 2013 recorded in the records of the relevant Clearing Systems and represented by this permanent Global Security shall be reduced by the amount so paid.

This temporary Global Security is issued in respect of the 4.750 per cent. notes due 2016 (the "Euro Notes due 2016") of Pfizer Inc. (the "Company"). The Euro Notes due 2016 are issued subject to and with the benefit of an indenture, dated as of January 30, 2001 (the "Base Indenture") as supplemented by the Second Supplemental Indenture dated as of June 2, 2009 (the "Second Supplemental Indenture" and, together with the Base Indenture, the "Indenture"), which then shall have the meaning assigned to it in such instrument), between, among others, the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon as Trustee (the "Trustee").
Subject as provided in this temporary Global Security, the Company, for value received, promises to pay the bearer of this temporary Global Security the sum of 2,000,000,000 (two billion Euros) or such lesser sum as is equal to the principal amount of the Euro Notes due 2016 represented by this temporary Global Security on June 3, 2016 or on such earlier date as the principal in respect of this temporary Global Security may become due under the Indenture and to pay interest on the principal sum for the time being outstanding at the rate of 4.750 per cent. per annum from and including June 3, 2009 payable annually in arrear on each Interest Payment Date (as defined in the Indenture) until payment of the principal sum has been made or duly provided for in full together with any other amounts as may be payable, all subject to and under the Indenture. The principal amount of Euro Notes due 2016 represented by this temporary Global Security shall be the aggregate amount from time to time entered in the records of both Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V. and Clearstream Banking, socit anonyme (together the "relevant
 
Clearing Systems"). The records of the relevant Clearing Systems (which expression in this temporary Global Security means the records that each relevant Clearing System holds for its customers which reflect the amount of such customer's interest in the Euro Notes due 2016) shall be conclusive evidence of the principal amount of Euro Notes due 2016 represented by this temporary Global Security and, for these purposes, a statement issued by a relevant Clearing System (which statement shall be made available to the bearer upon request) stating the nominal amount of Euro Notes due 2016 represented by this temporary Global Security at any time shall be conclusive evidence of the records of the relevant Clearing System at that time.
The permanent Global Security to be issued on exchange for interests in this temporary Global Security will be substantially in the form set out in Exhibit E of the Second Supplemental Indenture. Subject as provided below, the permanent Global Security will only have an entry made to represent definitive Bearer Securities after the date which is forty (40) days after the closing date for the Euro Notes due 2016 (the "Exchange Date"). Interests in this temporary Global Security may be exchanged for interests recorded in the records of the relevant Clearing Systems in a duly executed and authenticated permanent Global Security without charge, in full or partial exchange for this temporary Global Security, in order that the permanent Global Security represents an aggregate principal amount of Euro Notes due 2016 equal to the principal amount of this temporary Global Security submitted for exchange. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such exchange shall be made unless there shall have been presented to the Principal Paying Agent or such other person as the Principal Paying Agent may direct (the "Exchange Agent") by a relevant Clearing System a certificate to the effect that it has received from or in respect of a person entitled to a beneficial interest in a particular principal amount of the Euro Notes due 2016 (as shown by its records) a certificate of non-US beneficial ownership in the form required by it and substantially in the form set out in Exhibit A of the Base Indenture, from such person in the form required by it and substantially in the form set out in Exhibit B of the Base Indenture unless such certification has already been made. Notwithstanding the foregoing, where this temporary Global Security has been exchanged in part for the permanent Global Security pursuant to the foregoing and definitive Bearer Securities have been issued in exchange for the total amount of Euro Notes due 2016 represented by the permanent Global Security pursuant to its terms, then interests in this temporary Global Security will no longer be exchangeable for interests in the permanent Global Security but will be exchangeable, in full or partial exchange, for duly executed and authenticated definitive Bearer Securities, without charge, in the denomination of 50,000 each with Coupons attached, such definitive Bearer Securities to be substantially in the form set out in the Second Supplemental Indenture. Notwithstanding the foregoing, definitive Bearer Securities shall not be so issued and delivered unless there shall have been presented to the Exchange
Agent by a relevant Clearing System a certificate to the effect that it has received from or in respect of a person entitled to a beneficial interest in a particular principal amount of Euro Notes due 2016 (as shown by its records) a certificate of non-US beneficial ownership in the form required by it and substantially in the form set out in Exhibit A of the Base Indenture, from such person in the form required by it and substantially in the form set out in Exhibit B of the Base Indenture unless such certification has already been made. Any person who would, but for the provisions of this temporary Global Security and of the Indenture, otherwise be entitled to receive either (a) an interest in the permanent Global Security or (b) definitive Bearer Securities shall not be entitled to require the exchange of an appropriate part of this temporary Global Security for an interest in the permanent Global Security or definitive Bearer Securities unless and until he shall have delivered or caused to be delivered to a relevant Clearing System a certificate of non-US beneficial ownership in the form required by it and substantially in the form set out in Exhibit A of the Base Indenture. Presentation of this temporary Global Security for exchange shall be made by the bearer hereof on any day (other than a Saturday or Sunday) on which banks are open for general business in London. The aggregate principal amount of interests in the permanent Global Security recorded in the records of the relevant Clearing Systems or, as the case may be, definitive Bearer Securities issued upon an exchange of this temporary Global Security will, subject to the terms hereof, be equal to the aggregate principal amount of this temporary Global Security submitted by the bearer for exchange (to the extent that such principal amount does not exceed the aggregate principal amount of this temporary Global Security). Upon (a) any exchange of a part of this temporary Global Security for an interest in the permanent Global Security or for a definitive Bearer Security, (b) receipt of instructions from a relevant Clearing System that, following the purchase by or on behalf of the Company of a part of this temporary Global Security, part is to be cancelled or (c) any redemption of a part of this temporary Global Security, the Company shall procure that the portion of the principal amount of this temporary Global Security so exchanged, cancelled or redeemed shall be entered pro rata in the records of the relevant Clearing Systems. On an exchange in whole of this temporary Global Security, this temporary Global Security shall be surrendered to or to the order of the Paying Agent.
Until the entire principal amount of this temporary Global Security has been extinguished in exchange for the permanent Global Security and/or definitive Bearer Securities, the bearer of this temporary Global Security shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits as if he were the bearer of the definitive Bearer Securities referred to above, except that the bearer of this temporary Global Security shall only be entitled to receive any payment on this temporary Global Security on presentation of certificates as provided below. Accordingly, except as ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction or as required by law or applicable regulation, the Company, Trustee and any Paying Agent may deem and treat the holder of this
temporary Global Security as the absolute owner of this temporary Global Security for all purposes. All payments of any amounts payable and paid to such holder shall, to the extent of the sums so paid, discharge the liability for the moneys payable on this temporary Global Security and on the relevant definitive Bearer Securities and/or Coupons.
Payments due in respect of Euro Notes due 2016 for the time being represented by this temporary Global Security shall be made to the bearer of this temporary Global Security only upon presentation by a relevant Clearing System to the Paying Agent at its specified office of a certificate to the effect that it has received from or in respect of a person entitled to a particular principal amount of the Euro Notes due 2016 (as shown on its records) a certificate of non-US beneficial ownership in the form required by it and substantially in the form set forth in Exhibit A of the Base Indenture. Each payment so made will discharge the Company's obligations in respect thereof. The bearer of this temporary Global Security will not be entitled to receive any payment of interest due on or after the Exchange Date unless, upon due certification, exchange of this temporary Global Security is improperly withheld or refused. Upon any payment in respect of the Euro Notes due 2016 represented by this temporary Global Security, the Company shall procure that the amount so paid shall be entered pro rata in the records of the relevant Clearing Systems. In the case of any payment of principal the Company shall procure that the amount so paid shall be entered pro rata in the records of the relevant Clearing Systems and, upon such entry being made, the principal amount of the Euro Notes due 2016 recorded in the records of the relevant Clearing Systems and represented by this temporary Global Security shall be reduced by the amount so paid. Any failure to make such entries shall not affect the discharge referred to in the first paragraph above.
For so long as any of the Euro Notes due 2016 is represented by this temporary Global Security or by this temporary Global Security and the permanent Global Security and such Global Security(s) is/are held on behalf of the relevant Clearing Systems, each person (other than a relevant Clearing System) who is for the time being shown in the records of a relevant Clearing System as the holder of a particular principal amount of Euro Notes due 2016 (each an "Accountholder") (in which regard any certificate or other document issued by a relevant Clearing System as to the principal amount of such Euro Notes due 2016 standing to the account of any person shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive and binding for all purposes) shall be treated as the holder of such principal amount of such Euro Notes due 2016 for all purposes (including but not limited to, for the purposes of any quorum requirements of, or the right to demand a poll at, meetings of the Holders and giving notice to the Company pursuant
to Section 501 of the Base Indenture other than with respect to the payment of principal amount and interest of such Euro Notes 2016, the right to which shall be vested, as against the Company, solely in the bearer of this temporary Global Security in accordance with and subject to its terms and the terms of the Indenture.

Any such notice shall be deemed to have been given to the Holders on the second day after the day on which such notice is delivered to the relevant Clearing Systems as aforesaid.

This permanent Global Security is issued in respect of the 4.750 per cent. Notes due 2016 (the "Euro Notes due 2016") of Pfizer Inc. (the "Company"). The Euro Notes due 2016 are initially represented by a temporary Global Security interests in which will be exchanged in accordance with the terms of the temporary Global Security for interests in this permanent Global Security and, if applicable, definitive Bearer Securities. The Euro Notes due 2016 are issued subject to and with the benefit of an indenture, dated as of January 30, 2001 (the "Base Indenture") as supplemented by the Second Supplemental Indenture dated as of June 2, 2009 (the "Second Supplemental Indenture" and, together with the Base Indenture, the "Indenture", which then shall have the meaning assigned to it in such instrument), between, among others, the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon as Trustee (the "Trustee").
Subject as provided in this permanent Global Security, the Company, for value received, promises to pay the bearer of this permanent Global Security the sum of 2,000,000,000 (two billion Euros) or such lesser sum as is equal to the principal amount of the Euro Notes due 2016 represented by this permanent Global Security on June 3, 2016 or on such earlier date as the principal in respect of this permanent Global Security may become due under the Indenture and to pay interest on the principal sum for the time being outstanding at the rate of
4.750 per cent. Per annum from and including June 3, 2009, payable annually in arrear on each Interest Payment Date (as defined in the Indenture) until payment of the principal sum has been made or duly provided for in full together with any other amounts as may be payable, all subject to and under the Indenture. The principal amount of Euro Notes due 2016 represented by this permanent Global Security shall be the aggregate amount from time to time entered in the records of both Euroclear Bank S.A./NV and Clearstream Banking, socit anonyme (together the "relevant Clearing Systems"). The records of the relevant Clearing Systems (which expression in this permanent Global Security means the records that each relevant Clearing System holds for its customers which reflect the amount of such customer's interest in the Euro Notes due 2016) shall be conclusive evidence of the principal amount of Euro Notes due 2016 represented by this permanent Global Security and, for these purposes, a statement issued by a relevant Clearing System (which statement shall be made available to the bearer upon request) stating the nominal amount of Euro Notes due 2016 represented by this permanent Global Security at any time shall be conclusive evidence of the records of the relevant Clearing System at that time.
Upon any exchange of an interest recorded in the records of the relevant Clearing Systems in the temporary Global Security representing the Euro Notes due 2016 for an interest recorded in the records of the relevant Clearing Systems in this permanent Global Security, the Company shall procure that details of such exchange shall be entered pro rata in the records of the relevant Clearing Systems.
The permanent Global Security will be exchangeable in whole but not in part (free of charge to the holder) for definitive Bearer Securities only: (a) upon the happening of any of the events defined in the Indenture as "Events of Default"; (b) if either Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg is closed for business for a continuous period of fourteen (14) days (other than by reason of holiday, statutory or otherwise) or announces an intention permanently to cease business or does in fact do so and no alternative clearing system satisfactory to the Trustee is available; or (c) if the Company would suffer a disadvantage as a result of a change in laws or regulations (taxation or otherwise) or as a result of a change in the practice of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg which would not be suffered were the Euro Notes due 2016 in
definitive form and a certificate to such effect signed by two current directors of the Company is given to the Trustee; or (d) upon not less than sixty (60) days' written notice from Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg (acting on the instructions of any holder of an interest in such permanent Global Security) to the Principal Paying Agent. Thereupon (in the case of (a), (b) and (c) above) the holder of the permanent Global Security (acting on the instructions of one or more of the Accountholders (as defined below)) or the Trustee may give notice to the Company and (in the case of (c) above) the Company may give notice to the Trustee and the Holders, of its intention to exchange the permanent Global Security for definitive Bearer Securities on or after the Exchange Date (as defined below). On or after the Exchange Date the holder of the permanent Global Security may or, in the case of (c) above, shall surrender the permanent Global Security to or to the order of the Principal Paying Agent.

On exchange of the permanent Global Security, the Company will procure that it is cancelled and, if the holder so requests, returned to the holder together with any relevant definitive Bearer Securities. Definitive Bearer Securities to be delivered on exchange shall be delivered only outside the United States. The definitive Bearer Securities to be issued on exchange will be in bearer form in the denomination of 50,000 each with Coupons attached and will be substantially in the form set out in Exhibit F to the Second Supplemental Indenture.

Accordingly, except as ordered by a court of competent
 
jurisdiction or as required by law or applicable regulation, the Company, the Trustee and any Paying Agent may deem and treat the holder of this permanent Global Security as the absolute owner of this permanent Global Security for all purposes. All payments of any amounts payable and paid to such holder shall, to the extent of the sums so paid, discharge the liability for the moneys payable on this permanent Global Security and on the relevant definitive Bearer Securities and/or Coupons.

Upon any payment in respect of the Euro Notes due 2016 represented by this permanent Global Security, the Company shall procure that the amount so paid shall be entered pro rata in the records of the relevant Clearing Systems. In the case of any payment of principal the Company shall procure that the amount so paid shall be entered pro rata in the records of the relevant Clearing Systems and, upon any such entry being made, the principal amount of the Euro Notes due 2016 recorded in the records of the relevant Clearing Systems and represented by this permanent Global Security shall be reduced by the amount so paid.

giving notice to the Company pursuant to Section 501 of the Base Indenture) other than with respect to the payment of principal amount and interest on such principal amount of such Euro Notes due 2016, the right to which shall be vested, as against the Company, solely in the bearer of this temporary Global Security in accordance with and subject to its terms and the terms of the Indenture.

This temporary Global Security is issued in respect of the 5.750 per cent. Notes due 2021 (the "Euro Notes due 2021") of Pfizer Inc. (the "Company"). The Euro Notes due 2021 are issued subject to and with the benefit of an indenture, dated as of January 30, 2001 (the "Base Indenture") as supplemented by the Second Supplemental Indenture dated as of June 2, 2009 (the "Second Supplemental Indenture" and, together with the Base Indenture, the "Indenture"), which then shall have the meaning assigned to it in such instrument), between, among others, the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon as Trustee (the "Trustee").
Subject as provided in this temporary Global Security, the Company, for value received, promises to pay the bearer of this temporary Global Security the sum of 2,000,000,000 (two billion Euros) or such lesser sum as is equal to the principal amount of the Euro Notes due 2021 represented by this temporary Global Security on June 3, 2021 or on such earlier date as the principal in respect of this temporary Global Security may become due under the Indenture and to pay interest on the principal sum for the time being outstanding at the rate of 5.750 per cent. Per annum from and including June 3, 2009 payable annually in arrear on each Interest Payment Date (as defined in the Indenture) until payment of the principal sum has been made or duly provided for in full together with any other amounts as may be payable, all subject to and under the Indenture. The principal amount of Euro Notes due 2021 represented by this temporary Global Security shall be the aggregate amount from time to time entered in the records of both Euroclear Bank S.A./NV and Clearstream Banking, socit anonyme (together the "relevant
Clearing Systems"). The records of the relevant Clearing Systems (which expression in this temporary Global Security means the records that each relevant Clearing System holds for its customers which reflect the amount of such customer's interest in the Euro Notes due 2021) shall be conclusive evidence of the principal amount of Euro Notes due 2021 represented by this temporary Global Security and, for these purposes, a statement issued by a relevant Clearing System (which statement shall be made available to the bearer upon request) stating the nominal amount of Euro Notes due 2021 represented by this temporary Global Security at any time shall be conclusive evidence of the records of the relevant Clearing System at that time.
The permanent Global Security to be issued on exchange for interests in this temporary Global Security will be substantially in the form set out in Exhibit H of the Second Supplemental Indenture. Subject as provided below, the permanent Global Security will only have an entry made to represent definitive Bearer Securities after the date which is forty (40) days after the closing date for the Euro Notes due 2021 (the "Exchange Date"). Interests in this temporary Global Security may be exchanged for interests recorded in the records of the relevant Clearing Systems in a duly executed and authenticated permanent Global Security without charge, in full or partial exchange for this temporary Global Security, in order that the permanent Global Security represents an aggregate principal amount of Euro Notes due 2021 equal to the principal amount of this temporary Global Security submitted for exchange. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such exchange shall be made unless there shall have been presented to the Principal Paying Agent or such other person as the Principal Paying Agent may direct (the "Exchange Agent") by a relevant Clearing System a certificate to the effect that it has received from or in respect of a person entitled to a beneficial interest in a particular principal amount of the Euro Notes due 2021 (as shown by its records) a certificate of non-US beneficial ownership in the form required by it and substantially in the form set out in Exhibit A of the Base Indenture, from such person in the form required by it and substantially in the form set out in Exhibit B of the Base Indenture unless such certification has already been made. Notwithstanding the foregoing, where this temporary Global Security has been exchanged in part for the permanent Global Security pursuant to the foregoing and definitive Bearer Securities have been issued in exchange for the total amount of Euro Notes due 2021 represented by the permanent Global Security pursuant to its terms, then interests in this temporary Global Security will no longer be exchangeable for interests in the permanent Global Security but will be exchangeable, in full or partial exchange, for duly executed and authenticated definitive Bearer Securities, without charge, in the denomination of 50,000 each with Coupons attached, such definitive Bearer Securities to be substantially in the form set out in the Second Supplemental Indenture. Notwithstanding the foregoing, definitive Bearer Securities shall not be so issued and delivered unless there shall have been presented to the Exchange
Agent by a relevant Clearing System a certificate to the effect that it has received from or in respect of a person entitled to a beneficial interest in a particular principal amount of Euro Notes due 2021 (as shown by its records) a certificate of non-US beneficial ownership in the form required by it and substantially in the form set out in Exhibit A of the Base Indenture, from such person in the form required by it and substantially in the form set out in Exhibit B of the Base Indenture unless such certification has already been made. Any person who would, but for the provisions of this temporary Global Security and of the Indenture, otherwise be entitled to receive either (a) an interest in the permanent Global Security or (b) definitive Bearer Securities shall not be entitled to require the exchange of an appropriate part of this temporary Global Security for an interest in the permanent Global Security or definitive Bearer Securities unless and until he shall have delivered or caused to be delivered to a relevant Clearing System a certificate of non-US beneficial ownership in the form required by it and substantially in the form set out in Exhibit A of the Base Indenture. Presentation of this temporary Global Security for exchange shall be made by the bearer hereof on any day (other than a Saturday or Sunday) on which banks are open for general business in London. The aggregate principal amount of interests in the permanent Global Security recorded in the records of the relevant Clearing Systems or, as the case may be, definitive Bearer Securities issued upon an exchange of this temporary Global Security will, subject to the terms hereof, be equal to the aggregate principal amount of this temporary Global Security submitted by the bearer for exchange (to the extent that such principal amount does not exceed the aggregate principal amount of this temporary Global Security). Upon (a) any exchange of a part of this temporary Global Security for an interest in the permanent Global Security or for a definitive Bearer Security, (b) receipt of instructions from a relevant Clearing System that, following the purchase by or on behalf of the Company of a part of this temporary Global Security, part is to be cancelled or (c) any redemption of a part of this temporary Global Security, the Company shall procure that the portion of the principal amount of this temporary Global Security so exchanged, cancelled or redeemed shall be entered pro rata in the records of the relevant Clearing Systems. On an exchange in whole of this temporary Global Security, this temporary Global Security shall be surrendered to or to the order of the Paying Agent.
Until the entire principal amount of this temporary Global Security has been extinguished in exchange for the permanent Global Security and/or definitive Bearer Securities, the bearer of this temporary Global Security shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits as if he were the bearer of the definitive Bearer Securities referred to above, except that the bearer of this temporary Global Security shall only be entitled to receive any payment on this temporary Global Security on presentation of certificates as provided below. Accordingly, except as ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction or as required by law or applicable regulation, the Company, Trustee and any Paying Agent may deem and treat the holder of this
temporary Global Security as the absolute owner of this temporary Global Security for all purposes. All payments of any amounts payable and paid to such holder shall, to the extent of the sums so paid, discharge the liability for the moneys payable on this temporary Global Security and on the relevant definitive Bearer Securities and/or Coupons.
Payments due in respect of Euro Notes due 2021 for the time being represented by this temporary Global Security shall be made to the bearer of this temporary Global Security only upon presentation by a relevant Clearing System to the Paying Agent at its specified office of a certificate to the effect that it has received from or in respect of a person entitled to a particular principal amount of the Euro Notes due 2021 (as shown on its records) a certificate of non-US beneficial ownership in the form required by it and substantially in the form set forth in Exhibit A of the Base Indenture. Each payment so made will discharge the Company's obligations in respect thereof. The bearer of this temporary Global Security will not be entitled to receive any payment of interest due on or after the Exchange Date unless, upon due certification, exchange of this temporary Global Security is improperly withheld or refused. Upon any payment in respect of the Euro Notes due 2021 represented by this temporary Global Security, the Company shall procure that the amount so paid shall be entered pro rata in the records of the relevant Clearing Systems. In the case of any payment of principal the Company shall procure that the amount so paid shall be entered pro rata in the records of the relevant Clearing Systems and, upon such entry being made, the principal amount of the Euro Notes due 2021 recorded in the records of the relevant Clearing Systems and represented by this temporary Global Security shall be reduced by the amount so paid. Any failure to make such entries shall not affect the discharge referred to in the first paragraph above.
For so long as any of the Euro Notes due 2021 is represented by this temporary Global Security or by this temporary Global Security and the permanent Global Security and such Global Security(s) is/are held on behalf of the relevant Clearing Systems, each person (other than a relevant Clearing System) who is for the time being shown in the records of a relevant Clearing System as the holder of a particular principal amount of Euro Notes due 2021 (each an "Accountholder") (in which regard any certificate or other document issued by a relevant Clearing System as to the principal amount of such Euro Notes due 2021 standing to the account of any person shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive and binding for all purposes) shall be treated as the holder of such principal amount of such Euro Notes due 2021 for all purposes (including but not limited to, for the purposes of any quorum requirements of, or the right to demand a poll at, meetings of the Holders and giving notice to the Company pursuant
to Section 501 of the Base Indenture) other than with respect to the payment of principal amount and interest of such Euro Notes due 2021, the right to which shall be vested, as against the Company, solely in the bearer of this temporary Global Security in accordance with and subject to its terms and the terms of the Indenture. The Trustee will look solely to the relevant Clearing Systems for the determination of who may be treated as an Accountholder for all purposes under the Indenture (including but not limited to, for the purposes of any quorum requirements of, or the right to demand a poll at, meetings of the Holders and giving notice to the Company pursuant to Section 501 of the Base Indenture) other than with respect to the payment of principal amount and interest of such Euro Notes due 2021, the right to which shall be vested, as against the Company, solely in the bearer of this temporary Global Security in accordance with and subject to its terms and the terms of the Indenture. Each Accountholder must look solely to the relevant Clearing Systems, for its share of each payment made to the bearer of this temporary Global Security. With respect to this temporary Global Security, the "records" of the relevant Clearing Systems shall mean the records that each of the relevant Clearing Systems holds for its customers which reflect the amount of such customer's interest in the Euro Notes due 2021. The Company covenants in favor of each Accountholder that it will make all payments in respect of the principal amount of Euro Notes due 2013 for the time being shown in the records of the relevant Clearing Systems as being held by the Accountholder and represented by this temporary Global Security to the bearer of this temporary Global Security in accordance with Article One hereof and acknowledges that each Accountholder may take proceedings to enforce this covenant and any of the other rights which it has under the first paragraph of this clause directly against the Company.

Any such notice shall be deemed to have been given to the Holders on the second day after the day on which such notice is delivered to the relevant Clearing Systems as aforesaid.

ANY UNITED STATES PERSON WHO HOLDS THIS OBLIGATION WILL BE SUBJECT TO LIMITATIONS UNDER THE UNITED STATES INCOME TAX LAWS, INCLUDING THE LIMITATIONS PROVIDED IN SECTIONS 165(j) AND 1287(a) OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE.
This permanent Global Security is issued in respect of the 5.750 per cent. Notes due 2021 (the "Euro Notes due 2021") of Pfizer Inc. (the "Company"). The Euro Notes due 2021 are initially represented by a temporary Global Security interests in which will be exchanged in accordance with the terms of the temporary Global Security for interests in this permanent Global Security and, if applicable, definitive Bearer Securities. The Euro Notes due 2021 are issued subject to and with the benefit of an indenture, dated as of January 30, 2001 (the "Base Indenture") as supplemented by the Second Supplemental Indenture dated as of June 2, 2009 (the "Second Supplemental Indenture" and, together with the Base Indenture, the "Indenture", which then shall have the meaning assigned to it in such instrument), between, among others, the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon as Trustee (the "Trustee").
Subject as provided in this permanent Global Security, the Company, for value received, promises to pay the bearer of this permanent Global Security the sum of 2,000,000,000 (two billion Euros) or such lesser sum as is equal to the principal amount of the Euro Notes due 2021 represented by this permanent Global Security on June 3, 2021 or on such earlier date as the principal in respect of this permanent Global Security may become due under the Indenture and to pay interest on the principal sum for the time being outstanding at the rate of
5.750 per cent. Per annum from and including June 3, 2009, payable annually in arrear on each Interest Payment Date (as defined in the Indenture) until payment of the principal sum has been made or duly provided for in full together with any other amounts as may be payable, all subject to and under the Indenture.
The principal amount of Euro Notes due 2021 represented by this permanent Global Security shall be the aggregate amount from time to time entered in the records of both Euroclear Bank S.A./NV and Clearstream Banking, socit anonyme (together the "relevant Clearing Systems"). The records of the relevant Clearing Systems (which expression in this permanent Global Security means the records that each relevant Clearing System holds for its customers which reflect the amount of such customer's interest in the Euro Notes due 2021) shall be conclusive evidence of the principal amount of Euro Notes due 2021 represented by this permanent Global Security and, for these purposes, a statement issued by a relevant Clearing System (which statement shall be made available to the bearer upon request) stating the nominal amount of Euro Notes due 2021 represented by this permanent Global Security at any time shall be conclusive evidence of the records of the relevant Clearing System at that time.
Upon any exchange of an interest recorded in the records of the relevant Clearing Systems in the temporary Global Security representing the Euro Notes due 2021 for an interest recorded in the records of the relevant Clearing Systems in this permanent Global Security, the Company shall procure that details of such exchange shall be entered pro rata in the records of the relevant Clearing Systems.
The permanent Global Security will be exchangeable in whole but not in part (free of charge to the holder) for definitive Bearer Securities only:
(a) upon the happening of any of the events defined in the Indenture as "Events of Default"; (b) if either Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg is closed for business for a continuous period of fourteen (14) days (other than by reason of holiday, statutory or otherwise) or announces an intention permanently to cease business or does in fact do so and no alternative clearing system satisfactory to the Trustee is available; or (c) if the Company would suffer a disadvantage as a result of a change in laws or regulations (taxation or otherwise) or as a result of a change in the practice of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg which would not be suffered were the Euro Notes due 2021 in
definitive form and a certificate to such effect signed by two current directors of the Company is given to the Trustee; or (d) upon not less than sixty (60) days' written notice from Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg (acting on the instructions of any holder of an interest in such permanent Global Security) to the Principal Paying Agent. Thereupon (in the case of (a), (b) and (c) above) the holder of the permanent Global Security (acting on the instructions of one or more of the Accountholders (as defined below)) or the Trustee may give notice to the Company and (in the case of (c) above) the Company may give notice to the Trustee and the Holders, of its intention to exchange the permanent Global Security for definitive Bearer Securities on or after the Exchange Date (as defined below). On or after the Exchange Date the holder of the permanent Global Security may or, in the case of (c) above, shall surrender the permanent Global Security to or to the order of the Principal Paying Agent.

On exchange of the permanent Global Security, the Company will procure that it is cancelled and, if the holder so requests, returned to the holder together with any relevant definitive Bearer Securities. Definitive Bearer Securities to be delivered on exchange shall be delivered only outside the United States. The definitive Bearer Securities to be issued on exchange will be in bearer form in the denomination of 50,000 each with Coupons attached and will be substantially in the form set out in Exhibit I to the Second Supplemental Indenture. The Company shall deliver to the Trustee sufficient definitive Bearer Securities to give effect to any exchange as set forth in this Article Three. For these purposes, "Exchange Date" means a day specified in the notice requiring exchange falling not less than sixty (60) days after that on which such notice is given and being a day on which banks are open for general business in the place in which the specified office of the Principal Paying Agent is located and, except in the case of exchange pursuant to (b) above, in the place in which the relevant clearing system is located.
Until the entire principal amount of this permanent Global Security has been extinguished in exchange for definitive Bearer Securities or in any other manner envisaged by the terms of the Second Supplemental Indenture, the bearer of this permanent Global Security shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits as if he were the bearer of the definitive Bearer Securities referred to above. Accordingly, except as ordered by a court of competent
jurisdiction or as required by law or applicable regulation, the Company, the Trustee and any Paying Agent may deem and treat the holder of this permanent Global Security as the absolute owner of this permanent Global Security for all purposes. All payments of any amounts payable and paid to such holder shall, to the extent of the sums so paid, discharge the liability for the moneys payable on this permanent Global Security and on the relevant definitive Bearer Securities and/or Coupons.

Upon any payment in respect of the Euro Notes due 2021 represented by this permanent Global Security, the Company shall procure that the amount so paid shall be entered pro rata in the records of the relevant Clearing Systems. In the case of any payment of principal the Company shall procure that the amount so paid shall be entered pro rata in the records of the relevant Clearing Systems and, upon any such entry being made, the principal amount of the Euro Notes due 2021 recorded in the records of the relevant Clearing Systems and represented by this permanent Global Security shall be reduced by the amount so paid.

This temporary Global Security is issued in respect of the 6.500 per cent. Notes due 2038 (the "Sterling Notes") of Pfizer Inc. (the "Company"). The Sterling Notes are issued subject to and with the benefit of an indenture, dated as of January 30, 2001 (the "Base Indenture") as supplemented by the Second Supplemental Indenture dated as of June 2, 2009 (the "Second Supplemental Indenture" and, together with the Base Indenture, the "Indenture"), which then shall have the meaning assigned to it in such instrument), between, among others, the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon as Trustee (the "Trustee").
Subject as provided in this temporary Global Security, the Company, for value received, promises to pay the bearer of this temporary Global Security the sum of 1,500,000,000 (one billion and five hundred million Sterling) or such lesser sum as is equal to the principal amount of the Sterling Notes represented by this temporary Global Security on June 3, 2038 or on such earlier date as the principal in respect of this temporary Global Security may become due under the Indenture and to pay interest on the principal sum for the time being outstanding at the rate of 6.500 per cent. Per annum from and including June 3, 2009 payable annually in arrear on each Interest Payment Date (as defined in the Indenture) until payment of the principal sum has been made or duly provided for in full together with any other amounts as may be payable, all subject to and under the Indenture. The principal amount of Sterling Notes represented by this temporary Global Security shall be the aggregate amount from time to time entered in the records of both Euroclear
Bank S.A./NV and Clearstream Banking, socit anonyme (together the "relevant Clearing Systems"). The records of the relevant Clearing Systems (which expression in this temporary Global Security means the records that each relevant Clearing System holds for its customers which reflect the amount of such customer's interest in the Sterling Notes) shall be conclusive evidence of the principal amount of Sterling Notes represented by this temporary Global Security and, for these purposes, a statement issued by a relevant Clearing System (which statement shall be made available to the bearer upon request) stating the nominal amount of Sterling Notes represented by this temporary Global Security at any time shall be conclusive evidence of the records of the relevant Clearing System at that time.
The permanent Global Security to be issued on exchange for interests in this temporary Global Security will be substantially in the form set out in Exhibit K of the Second Supplemental Indenture. Subject as provided below, the permanent Global Security will only have an entry made to represent definitive Bearer Securities after the date which is forty (40) days after the closing date for the Sterling Notes (the "Exchange Date"). Interests in this temporary Global Security may be exchanged for interests recorded in the records of the relevant Clearing Systems in a duly executed and authenticated permanent Global Security without charge, in full or partial exchange for this temporary Global Security, in order that the permanent Global Security represents an aggregate principal amount of Sterling Notes equal to the principal amount of this temporary Global Security submitted for exchange. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such exchange shall be made unless there shall have been presented to the Principal Paying Agent or such other person as the Principal Paying Agent may direct (the "Exchange Agent") by a relevant Clearing System a certificate to the effect that it has received from or in respect of a person entitled to a beneficial interest in a particular principal amount of the Sterling Notes (as shown by its records) a certificate of non-US beneficial ownership in the form required by it and substantially in the form set out in Exhibit A of the Base Indenture, from such person in the form required by it and substantially in the form set out in Exhibit B of the Base Indenture unless such certification has already been made. Notwithstanding the foregoing, where this temporary Global Security has been exchanged in part for the permanent Global Security pursuant to the foregoing and definitive Bearer Securities have been issued in exchange for the total amount of Sterling Notes represented by the permanent Global Security pursuant to its terms, then interests in this temporary Global Security will no longer be exchangeable for interests in the permanent Global Security but will be exchangeable, in full or partial exchange, for duly executed and authenticated definitive Bearer Securities, without charge, in the denomination of 50,000 each with Coupons attached, such definitive Bearer Securities to be substantially in the form set out in the Second Supplemental Indenture. Notwithstanding the foregoing, definitive Bearer Securities
shall not be so issued and delivered unless there shall have been presented to the Exchange Agent by a relevant Clearing System a certificate to the effect that it has received from or in respect of a person entitled to a beneficial interest in a particular principal amount of Sterling Notes (as shown by its records) a certificate of non-US beneficial ownership in the form required by it and substantially in the form set out in Exhibit A of the Base Indenture, from such person in the form required by it and substantially in the form set out in Exhibit B of the Base Indenture unless such certification has already been made. Any person who would, but for the provisions of this temporary Global Security and of the Indenture, otherwise be entitled to receive either (a) an interest in the permanent Global Security or (b) definitive Bearer Securities shall not be entitled to require the exchange of an appropriate part of this temporary Global Security for an interest in the permanent Global Security or definitive Bearer Securities unless and until he shall have delivered or caused to be delivered to a relevant Clearing System a certificate of non-US beneficial ownership in the form required by it and substantially in the form set out in Exhibit A of the Base Indenture. Presentation of this temporary Global Security for exchange shall be made by the bearer hereof on any day (other than a Saturday or Sunday) on which banks are open for general business in London. The aggregate principal amount of interests in the permanent Global Security recorded in the records of the relevant Clearing Systems or, as the case may be, definitive Bearer Securities issued upon an exchange of this temporary Global Security will, subject to the terms hereof, be equal to the aggregate principal amount of this temporary Global Security submitted by the bearer for exchange (to the extent that such principal amount does not exceed the aggregate principal amount of this temporary Global Security). Upon (a) any exchange of a part of this temporary Global Security for an interest in the permanent Global Security or for a definitive Bearer Security, (b) receipt of instructions from a relevant Clearing System that, following the purchase by or on behalf of the Company of a part of this temporary Global Security, part is to be cancelled or (c) any redemption of a part of this temporary Global Security, the Company shall procure that the portion of the principal amount of this temporary Global Security so exchanged, cancelled or redeemed shall be entered pro rata in the records of the relevant Clearing Systems. On an exchange in whole of this temporary Global Security, this temporary Global Security shall be surrendered to or to the order of the Paying Agent.
Until the entire principal amount of this temporary Global Security has been extinguished in exchange for the permanent Global Security and/or definitive Bearer Securities, the bearer of this temporary Global Security shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits as if he were the bearer of the definitive Bearer Securities referred to above, except that the bearer of this temporary Global Security shall only be entitled to receive any payment on this temporary Global Security on presentation of certificates as provided below. Accordingly, except as ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction or as required by law or applicable
regulation, the Company, Trustee and any Paying Agent may deem and treat the holder of this temporary Global Security as the absolute owner of this temporary Global Security for all purposes. All payments of any amounts payable and paid to such holder shall, to the extent of the sums so paid, discharge the liability for the moneys payable on this temporary Global Security and on the relevant definitive Bearer Securities and/or Coupons.
Payments due in respect of Sterling Notes for the time being represented by this temporary Global Security shall be made to the bearer of this temporary Global Security only upon presentation by a relevant Clearing System to the Paying Agent at its specified office of a certificate to the effect that it has received from or in respect of a person entitled to a particular principal amount of the Sterling Notes (as shown on its records) a certificate of non-US beneficial ownership in the form required by it and substantially in the form set forth in Exhibit A of the Base Indenture. Each payment so made will discharge the Company's obligations in respect thereof. The bearer of this temporary Global Security will not be entitled to receive any payment of interest due on or after the Exchange Date unless, upon due certification, exchange of this temporary Global Security is improperly withheld or refused. Upon any payment in respect of the Sterling Notes represented by this temporary Global Security, the Company shall procure that the amount so paid shall be entered pro rata in the records of the relevant Clearing Systems. In the case of any payment of principal the Company shall procure that the amount so paid shall be entered pro rata in the records of the relevant Clearing Systems and, upon such entry being made, the principal amount of the Sterling Notes recorded in the records of the relevant Clearing Systems and represented by this temporary Global Security shall be reduced by the amount so paid. Any failure to make such entries shall not affect the discharge referred to in the first paragraph above.
For so long as any of the Sterling Notes is represented by this temporary Global Security or by this temporary Global Security and the permanent Global Security and such Global Security(s) is/are held on behalf of the relevant Clearing Systems, each person (other than a relevant Clearing System) who is for the time being shown in the records of a relevant Clearing System as the holder of a particular principal amount of Sterling Notes (each an "Accountholder") (in which regard any certificate or other document issued by a relevant Clearing System as to the principal amount of such Sterling Notes standing to the account of any person shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive and binding for all purposes) shall be treated as the holder of such principal amount of such Sterling Notes for all purposes (including but not limited to, for the purposes of any quorum requirements of, or the right to
demand a poll at, meetings of the Holders and giving notice to the Company pursuant to Section 501 of the Base Indenture other than with respect to the payment of principal amount and interest of such Sterling Notes, the right to which shall be vested, as against the Company, solely in the bearer of this temporary Global Security in accordance with and subject to its terms and the terms of the Indenture. The Trustee will look solely to the relevant Clearing Systems for the determination of who may be treated as an Accountholder for all purposes under the Indenture (including but not limited to, for the purposes of any quorum requirements of, or the right to demand a poll at, meetings of the Holders and giving notice to the Company pursuant to Section 501 of the Base Indenture) other than with respect to the payment of principal amount and interest of such Sterling Notes, the right to which shall be vested, as against the Company, solely in the bearer of this temporary Global Security in accordance with and subject to its terms and the terms of the Indenture.

ANY UNITED STATES PERSON WHO HOLDS THIS OBLIGATION WILL BE SUBJECT TO LIMITATIONS UNDER THE UNITED STATES INCOME TAX LAWS, INCLUDING THE LIMITATIONS PROVIDED IN SECTIONS 165(j) AND 1287(a) OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE.
This permanent Global Security is issued in respect of the 6.500 per cent. Notes due 2038 (the " Sterling Notes") of Pfizer Inc. (the "Company"). The Sterling Notes are initially represented by a temporary Global Security interests in which will be exchanged in accordance with the terms of the temporary Global Security for interests in this permanent Global Security and, if applicable, definitive Bearer Securities. The Sterling Notes are issued subject to and with the benefit of an indenture, dated as of January 30, 2001 (the "Base Indenture") as supplemented by the Second Supplemental Indenture dated as of June 2, 2009 (the "Second Supplemental Indenture" and, together with the Base Indenture, the "Indenture", which then shall have the meaning assigned to it in such instrument), between, among others, the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon as Trustee (the "Trustee").
Subject as provided in this permanent Global Security, the Company, for value received, promises to pay the bearer of this permanent Global Security the sum of 1,500,000,000 (one billion and five hundred million Sterling) or such lesser sum as is equal to the principal amount of the Sterling Notes represented by this permanent Global Security on June 3, 2038 or on such earlier date as the principal in respect of this permanent Global Security may become due under the Indenture and to pay interest on the principal sum for the time being
outstanding at the rate of 6.500 per cent. Per annum from and including June 3, 2009, payable annually in arrear on each Interest Payment Date (as defined in the Indenture) until payment of the principal sum has been made or duly provided for in full together with any other amounts as may be payable, all subject to and under the Indenture. The principal amount of Sterling Notes represented by this permanent Global Security shall be the aggregate amount from time to time entered in the records of both Euroclear Bank S.A./NV and Clearstream Banking, socit anonyme (together the "relevant Clearing Systems"). The records of the relevant Clearing Systems (which expression in this permanent Global Security means the records that each relevant Clearing System holds for its customers which reflect the amount of such customer's interest in the Sterling Notes) shall be conclusive evidence of the principal amount of Sterling Notes represented by this permanent Global Security and, for these purposes, a statement issued by a relevant Clearing System (which statement shall be made available to the bearer upon request) stating the nominal amount of Sterling Notes represented by this permanent Global Security at any time shall be conclusive evidence of the records of the relevant Clearing System at that time.
Upon any exchange of an interest recorded in the records of the relevant Clearing Systems in the temporary Global Security representing the Sterling Notes for an interest recorded in the records of the relevant Clearing Systems in this permanent Global Security, the Company shall procure that details of such exchange shall be entered pro rata in the records of the relevant Clearing Systems.
The permanent Global Security will be exchangeable in whole but not in part (free of charge to the holder) for definitive Bearer Securities only: (a) upon the happening of any of the events defined in the Indenture as "Events of Default"; (b) if either Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg is closed for business for a continuous period of fourteen (14) days (other than by reason of holiday, statutory or otherwise) or announces an intention permanently to cease business or does in fact do so and no alternative clearing system satisfactory to the Trustee is available; or (c) if the Company would suffer a disadvantage as a result of a change in laws or regulations (taxation or otherwise) or as a result of a change in the practice of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg which would not be suffered were the Sterling Notes in
definitive form and a certificate to such effect signed by two current directors of the Company is given to the Trustee; or (d) upon not less than sixty (60) days' written notice from Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg (acting on the instructions of any holder of an interest in such permanent Global Security) to the Principal Paying Agent.

On or after the Exchange Date the holder of the permanent Global Security may or, in the case of (c) above, shall surrender the permanent Global Security to or to the order of the Principal Paying Agent.

Exhibit 99.1
NEW YORK, NY, June 3 - Pfizer Inc today announced the successful completion of its offering of 5.85 billion and 1.50 billion of senior unsecured notes (totaling approximately $10.5 billion). The notes consist of:
1.85 billion of 3.625% notes due 2013
2.00 billion of 4.75% notes due 2016
2.00 billion of 5.75% notes due 2021
1.50 billion of 6.50% notes due 2038
The notes were offered in a private placement pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Pfizer intends to use the net offering proceeds for general corporate purposes, including funding a portion of the purchase price of the pending Wyeth acquisition and the refinancing of existing debt.
As a result of the completion of this offering, the Company's 364-Day Bridge Term Loan Credit Agreement, dated March 12, 2009, which Pfizer had entered into in connection with its financing of the pending Wyeth acquisition, has been terminated. No amount had been drawn down under that facility.
The notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements. This press release does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any of the notes, nor shall there be any sale of the notes, in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of such jurisdiction. Additional Information
In connection with the pending acquisition of Wyeth, Pfizer has filed with the SEC a Registration Statement on Form S-4 that includes a proxy statement of Wyeth that also constitutes a prospectus of Pfizer. Wyeth will mail the proxy statement/prospectus to its stockholders. Pfizer and Wyeth urge investors and security holders to read the proxy statement/prospectus regarding the pending acquisition when it becomes available because it will contain important information. You may obtain copies of all documents filed with the SEC regarding this transaction, free of charge, at the SEC's website (www.sec.gov). You may also obtain these documents, free of charge, from Pfizer's website, www.pfizer.com, under the tab "Investors" and then under the tab "SEC Filings." You may also obtain these documents, free of charge, from Wyeth's website, www.wyeth.com, under the heading "Investor Relations" and then under the tab "Financial Reports/SEC Filings." Pfizer, Wyeth and their respective directors, executive officers and certain other members of management and employees may be soliciting proxies from Wyeth stockholders in favor of the pending acquisition. Information regarding the persons who may, under the rules of the SEC, be deemed participants in the solicitation of the Wyeth stockholders in connection with the pending acquisition is set forth in the proxy statement/prospectus. You can find information about Pfizer's executive officers and directors in its definitive proxy statement filed with the SEC on March 13, 2009. You can find information about Wyeth's executive officers and directors in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2008 and in the proxy statement/prospectus.
