Guidance to Reflect Wyeth Acquisition
NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--October 20, 2009--Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE):
See end of text prior to tables for notes.
Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) today reported financial results for third-quarter 2009. Revenues were $11.6 billion, a decrease of 3% compared with $12.0 billion in the year-ago quarter. Revenues for third-quarter 2009 compared with the year-ago quarter were unfavorably impacted by approximately $610 million, or 5%, due to foreign exchange and were favorably impacted by $217 million, or 2%, due to a one-time adjustment in the year-ago period for prior years liabilities for product returns. For third-quarter 2009, U.S. revenues were $4.8 billion, a decrease of 2% compared with the year-ago quarter. International revenues were $6.8 billion, a decrease of 4% compared with the prior-year quarter, and reflected 5% operational growth and a 9% unfavorable impact of foreign exchange. U.S. revenues represented 41% of the total, while international revenues represented 59% of the total, both comparable with the year-ago quarter.
For the first nine months of 2009, revenues were $33.5 billion, a decrease of 7% compared with $36.0 billion in the same period in 2008. Foreign exchange unfavorably impacted revenues by approximately $2.3 billion or 6%. U.S. revenues were $14.3 billion, a decrease of 6% compared with the first nine months of 2008. International revenues were $19.2 billion, a decrease of 8% compared with the same period last year, and reflected 3% operational growth and an 11% unfavorable impact of foreign exchange. U.S. revenues represented 43% of the total compared with 42% in the year-ago period, and international revenues represented 57% of the total compared with 58% of the total of the first nine months of 2008.
Business Revenues
Effective January 1, 2009, Pfizer expanded its operating model within the Pharmaceutical business to include five customer-focused units, in addition to its Animal Health business. During third-quarter 2009, the Specialty Care, Emerging Markets and Oncology Pharmaceutical units and Animal Health generated revenue growth on a constant currency basis. The Primary Care unit was flat on a constant currency basis while the Established Products unit, which manages a portfolio of products that have generally lost patent protection or marketing exclusivity and that have an expected decline in revenues at this stage in their lifecycle, declined 9% on a constant currency basis.
See end of text prior to tables for notes.
* Calculation not meaningful
Primary Care revenues for third-quarter 2009 were $5.5 billion, a decline of 4% compared with $5.8 billion in the year-ago quarter. Operationally, Primary Care revenues were flat, as the strong international performance of Lyrica and Lipitor was offset primarily by lower Lipitor revenues in the U.S. Operational performance was offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange.
Specialty Care revenues for third-quarter 2009 were $1.6 billion, an increase of 3% compared with $1.5 billion in the same period last year. Operational growth of 6%, largely driven by the solid performance of Rebif and Revatio, was partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange.
Oncology revenues for third-quarter 2009 were $371 million, a decrease of 5% compared with $389 million in the prior-year quarter. Operational growth of 2%, primarily due to the strong performance of Sutent, was partially offset by the unfavorable impact of the loss of exclusivity of Camptosar in Europe in July 2009. The operational growth was more than offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange.
Established Products revenues for third-quarter 2009 were $1.6 billion, a decline of 12% compared with $1.8 billion in the year-ago quarter, comprised of a 9% operational decline and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange.
Emerging Markets revenues for third-quarter 2009 were $1.6 billion, a decrease of 4% compared with $1.7 billion in third-quarter 2008. These results included revenue from both established products and patent-protected products sold in emerging markets. Operational growth of 9%, largely attributable to strong growth in high-priority countries, notably China and India, was more than offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange.
Animal Health revenues for third-quarter 2009 were $678 million, a decline of 4% compared with $708 million in the year-ago quarter. Operational growth of 2%, primarily driven by the solid performance in emerging markets and for certain new products worldwide, was more than offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange.
Reported Net Income
(1)
and Reported Diluted EPS
(1)
For third-quarter 2009, Pfizer posted reported net income of $2.9 billion, an increase of 26% compared with $2.3 billion in the prior-year quarter, and reported diluted EPS of $0.43, an increase of 26% compared with $0.34 in the prior-year quarter. Results for third-quarter 2009 compared with the same period in 2008 were favorably impacted by the non-recurrence of the after-tax charge of $640 million resulting from agreements to resolve certain litigation involving the Companys non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) pain medicines in the year-ago quarter, lower costs associated with our cost-reduction initiatives and savings generated from those initiatives. These factors were partially offset by the decrease in revenues, unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, higher interest expense as a result of the issuance of notes to partially finance the Wyeth acquisition as well as an increase in the effective tax rate on reported results to approximately 28% in third-quarter 2009 from approximately 17% in third-quarter 2008. This increase in the effective tax rate on reported results was primarily due to the increased tax cost associated with certain business decisions executed to finance the Wyeth acquisition.
(1)
(1)
For the first nine months of 2009, Pfizer posted reported net income of $7.9 billion, and reported diluted EPS of $1.16, both comparable with the first nine months of 2008. These results were impacted by the aforementioned factors as well as costs incurred to prepare for the Wyeth acquisition and lower in-process research and development charges. The increase in the effective tax rate on reported results to approximately 27% in the first nine months of 2009 from approximately 14% in the first nine months of 2008 was primarily due to the increased tax cost as discussed above. Additionally, the 2008 effective tax rate was positively impacted by favorable income tax adjustments.

Adjusted Income and Adjusted Diluted EPS
(2)
(2)
Third-quarter 2009 adjusted income was $3.5 billion, a decrease of 17% compared with $4.2 billion in the year-ago quarter, and adjusted diluted EPS was $0.51, a decrease of 18% compared with $0.62 in the year-ago quarter. For the first nine months of 2009, adjusted income was $10.4 billion, a decrease of 13% compared with $12.0 billion in the first nine months of 2008, and adjusted diluted EPS was $1.54, a decrease of 13% compared with $1.77 in the year-ago period. Both adjusted income and adjusted diluted EPS were negatively impacted by lower revenues and by an increase in the effective tax rate on adjusted income to approximately 32% in third-quarter 2009 from approximately 22% in third-quarter 2008, and to approximately 30% in the first nine months of 2009 from approximately 21% in the first nine months of 2008. These increases in the effective tax rate were primarily due to the increased tax cost associated with certain business decisions executed to finance the Wyeth acquisition. In addition, the effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2008 was positively impacted by a favorable income tax adjustment. These factors were partially offset by savings from various cost-reduction initiatives across all aspects of the business, which decreased adjusted total costs by approximately $210 million in third-quarter 2009 and $950 million in the first nine months of 2009.

In third-quarter 2009, adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenues was 15.4% compared with 14.5% in third-quarter 2008. This increase primarily reflects the negative impact of foreign exchange, which was partially offset by the favorable impact of our cost-reduction initiatives. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenues was 14.3% in third-quarter 2009.

(2)
Adjusted selling, informational and administrative (SI&A) expenses were $3.2 billion in third-quarter 2009, a decrease of 6% compared with $3.4 billion in the prior-year quarter. The decrease was attributable to the favorable impact of cost-reduction initiatives as well as the favorable impact of foreign exchange, which reduced third-quarter 2009 adjusted SI&A expenses by $126 million compared with the year-ago quarter.
(2)
(2)
Adjusted research and development (R&D) expenses were $1.6 billion in third-quarter 2009, a decrease of 8% compared with $1.8 billion in the prior-year period. The decrease was due to the favorable impact of cost-reduction initiatives as well as the favorable impact of foreign exchange, which reduced third-quarter 2009 adjusted R&D expenses by $36 million compared with the year-ago quarter.
(2)
(2)
Overall, operational improvements resulting from cost-reduction initiatives decreased adjusted total costs by approximately $210 million, or 3%, in third-quarter 2009 compared with the prior-year period, and foreign exchange decreased adjusted total costs by approximately $120 million, or 2%, in third-quarter 2009 compared with the prior-year period. The operational improvements were driven partially by the reduction in workforce to approximately 75,400 at the end of third-quarter 2009, a decline of 1,100 compared with the end of the second-quarter 2009, and a decline of 11,200 since the beginning of 2008, as well as manufacturing and research and development site exits. In fourth-quarter 2009, a portion of the operational cost reductions achieved in the first nine months of 2009 is expected to be invested in high-growth opportunities.

Executive Commentary
We are pleased with our results this quarter and in our ability to once again deliver solid operational performance in an environment that continues to be challenging. Excluding foreign exchange, our five Pharmaceutical units and Animal Health business continued to perform well enabling us to continue to meet our commitments, stated Jeff Kindler, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
Kindler continued, The completion of the Wyeth acquisition represents a significant milestone in the transformation of Pfizer. We are beginning to implement our integration plan in order to quickly maximize the value of our expanded and more diversified global product portfolio in key high-growth areas. With customer-centric businesses, supported by research organizations, Pfizer is now well positioned to deliver greater value to patients and shareholders.
Frank DAmelio, Chief Financial Officer, stated, During the first nine months of 2009, we have continued to deliver on our 2009 financial commitments and our longer-term cost-reduction target. Completion of both the Wyeth acquisition and associated integration plans is a testament to the hard work and dedication of talented colleagues throughout the organization. Looking ahead, we anticipate that our broad portfolio of products and increased investment in high-growth opportunities will better position us to generate consistent earnings growth and continue to deliver on our commitments.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
1. Impact of Foreign Exchange on Revenues
The strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies, primarily the euro, UK pound, Canadian dollar and Australian dollar, unfavorably impacted our revenues by approximately $610 million, or 5%, in third-quarter 2009, compared to the same period in 2008, and by approximately $2.3 billion, or 6%, in the first nine months of 2009, compared to the same period in 2008.
2. Change in Cost of Sales
Reported cost of sales decreased 16% in the third quarter of 2009, compared to the same period in 2008, and decreased 23% in first nine months of 2009, compared to the same period in 2008. The decreases primarily reflect the savings impact of our cost-reduction initiatives and lower related implementation costs, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange.
Reported cost of sales included implementation charges related to our cost-reduction initiatives of $23 million for the third quarter of 2009, $144 million for the first nine months of 2009, $172 million for the third quarter of 2008, and $520 million for the first nine months of 2008.
Reported cost of sales as a percentage of revenues decreased 2.3 percentage points to 15.4% in third-quarter 2009, reflecting the favorable impact of our cost-reduction initiatives and lower related implementation costs, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, compared to third-quarter 2008.
3. Change in Selling, Informational & Administrative (SI&A) Expenses, Research & Development (R&D) Expenses and In-Process R&D Charges (IPR&D)
Reported SI&A expenses decreased 7% in the third quarter of 2009, compared to the same period in 2008, and decreased 13% in first nine months of 2009, compared to the same period in 2008. The decreases reflect savings associated with our cost-reduction initiatives, lower related implementation costs, and the favorable impact of foreign exchange. In addition, the first nine months of 2009 included certain insurance recoveries related to legal defense costs.
Reported SI&A expenses included implementation charges related to our cost-reduction initiatives of $51 million for third-quarter 2009, $182 million for the first nine months of 2009, $95 million for third-quarter 2008, and $270 million for the first nine months of 2008.
Reported R&D expenses, excluding IPR&D, decreased 13% in the third quarter of 2009, compared to the same period in 2008, and 11% in the first nine months of 2009, compared to the same period in 2008. The decreases were primarily due to the realization of savings associated with our cost-reduction initiatives, lower related implementation costs, and the favorable impact of foreign exchange. The nine-month 2009 decrease was partially offset by a $150 million milestone payment to Bristol-Myers Squibb in first-quarter 2009 in connection with the collaboration on apixaban.
Reported R&D expenses included implementation charges related to our cost-reduction initiatives of $5 million for third-quarter 2009, $78 million for the first nine months of 2009, $108 million for third-quarter 2008, and $348 million for the first nine months of 2008.
IPR&D charges of $20 million for the first nine months of 2009 relate to the resolution of a contingency associated with our 2008 acquisition of CovX. IPR&D charges of $567 million for the first nine months of 2008 primarily relate to the acquisitions of Serenex, Inc., Encysive Pharmaceuticals, Inc., CovX, Coley Pharmaceutical Group, Inc. and two smaller acquisitions related to Animal Health. As a result of adopting the provisions of a new accounting standard for business combinations issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, beginning January 1, 2009, IPR&D related to acquisitions after adoption will be recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as indefinite-lived intangible assets. We made no acquisitions in the first nine months of 2009.
4. Other (Income) and Other Deductions
5. Effective Tax Rate
The effective tax rate on reported for third-quarter 2009 was 27.5%compared to 17.0% in the third quarter of 2008, and in the first nine months of 2009 was 27.3% compared to 13.8% in the first nine months of 2008. The higher tax rates for the third quarter and first nine months of 2009 are primarily due to the increased tax costs associated with certain business decisions executed to finance the Wyeth acquisition and the change in geographic mix of expenses incurred to execute our cost-reduction initiatives, partially offset by a tax benefit of $174 million recorded in the third quarter of 2009 related to the final resolution of a previously disclosed agreement-in-principle with the U.S. Department of Justice to settle investigations of past promotional practices and certain other matters. This resulted in the receipt of information that raised our assessment of the likelihood of prevailing on the technical merits of our tax position. The higher tax rates were also partially offset by the decrease in IPR&D charges, which generally are not deductible for tax purposes. The lower tax rate in the first nine months of 2008 reflects tax benefits of $305 million related to favorable tax settlements for multiple tax years and $426 million related to the sale of one of our biopharmaceutical companies, which were both recorded in the second quarter of 2008.
Income from continuing operations before provision for taxes on income
The effective tax rate on adjusted income was 31.8% in third quarter 2009, 29.9% in the first nine months of 2009, 22.3% in third-quarter 2008, and 21.4% in the first nine months of 2008. The higher tax rates on adjusted income in 2009 are primarily due to the increased tax costs associated with certain business decisions executed to finance the Wyeth acquisition. The lower tax rate in the first nine months of 2008 reflects $305 million in tax benefits related to the resolution of tax issues noted above.

Guidance to 2009 Reported Net Income Attributable to Pfizer Inc. and Reported Diluted EPS Attributable to Pfizer Inc. Common Shareholders Guidance
________________
Adjusted income and adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS) are defined as reported net income attributable to Pfizer Inc. and reported diluted EPS attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders excluding purchase-accounting adjustments, acquisition-related costs, discontinued operations and certain significant items. As described under in the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of Pfizers Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended June 28, 2009, management uses adjusted income, among other factors, to set performance goals and to measure the performance of the overall company. We believe that investors understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing this measure. The adjusted income and adjusted diluted EPS measures are not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for U.S. GAAP net income and diluted EPS.
