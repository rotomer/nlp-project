NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--February 3, 2010--Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE):
See end of text prior to tables for notes.
Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) today reported financial results for fourth-quarter and full-year 2009. On October 15, 2009, Pfizer completed the acquisition of Wyeth and, consequently, fourth-quarter and full-year 2009 results include the legacy Wyeth operations from the acquisition date through Pfizers domestic and international year-ends (see note 16). Fourth-quarter 2009 revenues were $16.5 billion, an increase of 34% compared with $12.3 billion in the year-ago quarter. Revenues for fourth-quarter 2009 compared with the year-ago quarter were favorably impacted by $3.3 billion, or 27%, due to the addition of the legacy Wyeth products, $419 million, or 3%, due to legacy Pfizer products, and $469 million, or 4%, due to foreign exchange. For fourth-quarter 2009, U.S. revenues were $7.4 billion, an increase of 42% compared with the year-ago quarter. International revenues were $9.1 billion, an increase of 28% compared with the prior-year quarter, and reflected 21% operational growth and a 7% favorable impact of foreign exchange. U.S. revenues represented 45% compared with 42% of the total in the year-ago quarter, while international revenues represented 55% compared with 58% of the total in fourth-quarter 2008.
For full-year 2009, revenues were $50.0 billion, an increase of 4% compared with $48.3 billion in the same period in 2008. For full-year 2009, revenues were favorably impacted by approximately $3.3 billion, or 7%, due to the addition of the legacy Wyeth products, $247 million, or 1%, due to legacy Pfizer products, and unfavorably impacted by $1.8 billion, or 4%, due to foreign exchange. U.S. revenues were $21.7 billion, an increase of 7% compared with full-year 2008. International revenues were $28.3 billion, an increase of 1% compared with last year, and reflected 8% operational growth and a 7% unfavorable impact of foreign exchange. U.S. revenues represented 43% compared with 42% of the total last year, and international revenues represented 57% compared with 58% of the total in 2008.
Business Revenues
Since the close of the Wyeth acquisition, Pfizer has operated two distinct commercial organizations: Biopharmaceutical and Diversified. Biopharmaceutical includes the Primary Care, Specialty Care, Established Products, Emerging Markets and Oncology customer-focused units, while Diversified includes Animal Health, Consumer Healthcare, Capsugel and Nutrition.
See end of text prior to tables for notes.
* Calculation not meaningful
For fourth-quarter 2009, revenues from Biopharmaceutical were $14.6 billion, an increase of 30% compared with $11.2 billion in the year-ago quarter. Operationally, revenues increased $2.9 billion, or 26%, of which $2.5 billion, or 22%, was attributable to legacy Wyeth products, primarily Premarin in the Primary Care unit, Enbrel and Prevnar in the Specialty Care unit, Effexor in the Established Products unit as well as Enbrel and Prevenar in the Emerging Markets unit. Additionally, the favorable impact of foreign exchange increased revenues by 4% or $419 million.
For fourth-quarter 2009, revenues from Diversified were $1.8 billion, an increase of 83% compared with $1.0 billion in the year-ago quarter. Operationally, revenues increased $778 million, or 78%, of which $764 million, or 77%, was attributable to legacy Wyeth products, primarily Centrum, Advil and Robitussin in Consumer Healthcare and certain Nutrition products. Additionally, the favorable impact of foreign exchange increased revenues by 5% or $45 million.
Reported Net Income
(1)
and Reported Diluted EPS
(1)
For fourth-quarter 2009, Pfizer posted reported net income of $767 million, an increase of 188% compared with $266 million in the prior-year quarter, and reported diluted EPS of $0.10, an increase of 150% compared with $0.04 in the prior-year quarter. Results for fourth-quarter 2009 compared with the same period in 2008 were favorably impacted by increased revenues as well as the non-recurrence of the pre-tax and after-tax charge of $2.3 billion in the year-ago quarter related to the resolution of certain investigations concerning Bextra and various other products in addition to the favorable impact of lower costs incurred in connection with our cost-reduction initiatives in 2009. These factors were largely offset by significant purchase accounting adjustments and acquisition-related costs associated with the Wyeth acquisition. In addition, the effective tax rate in fourth-quarter 2009 was favorably impacted by the tax benefits related to the sale of one of our biopharmaceutical companies, Vicuron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and the jurisdictional mix of certain expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition of Wyeth. The fourth-quarter 2008 effective tax rate was negatively impacted by the unfavorable tax implications of the aforementioned charge related to Bextra and various other products.

(1)
For full-year 2009, Pfizer posted reported net income of $8.6 billion, an increase of 7% compared with $8.1 billion last year, and reported diluted EPS of $1.23, an increase of 3% compared with $1.20 in 2008. These results were impacted by increased revenues and the aforementioned fourth-quarter factors as well as the non-recurrence of a $640 million after-tax charge related to the resolution of certain litigation involving the Companys non-steroidal anti-inflammatory pain medicines in third-quarter 2008. These factors were partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange and higher net interest expense. Additionally, the effective tax rate on reported results increased to approximately 20% in full-year 2009 from approximately 17% in full-year 2008, primarily due to the increased tax cost associated with certain business decisions executed to finance the Wyeth acquisition.
(1)
(1)
Additionally, reported diluted EPSin fourth-quarter and full-year 2009 was impacted by the increased number of shares outstanding in comparison with the corresponding periods in 2008 resulting primarily from shares issued to partially fund the Wyeth acquisition.

Adjusted Income and Adjusted Diluted EPS
(2)
(2)
Fourth-quarter 2009 adjusted income was $3.8 billion, a decrease of 13% compared with $4.4 billion in the year-ago quarter, and adjusted diluted EPS was $0.49, a decrease of 25% compared with $0.65 in the year-ago quarter. For full-year 2009, adjusted income was $14.2 billion, a decrease of 13% compared with $16.4 billion in full-year 2008, and adjusted diluted EPS was $2.02, a decrease of 17% compared with $2.42 in the prior year. Both adjusted income and adjusted diluted EPS were favorably impacted by higher revenues and negatively impacted by increased expenses, primarily due to the addition of the legacy Wyeth operations and increased investment in high-growth and in-line product opportunities, as well as higher net interest expense and an increase in the effective tax rate on adjusted income.

The effective tax rate on adjusted income increased to approximately 28% in fourth-quarter 2009 from approximately 24% in fourth-quarter 2008, and to approximately 30% in full-year 2009 from approximately 22% in full-year 2008, primarily due to the increased tax cost associated with certain business decisions executed to finance the Wyeth acquisition. In addition, the effective tax rate on adjusted income for full-year 2008 was positively impacted by a favorable income tax adjustment.
(2)
(2)
Additionally, adjusted diluted EPSin fourth-quarter and full-year 2009 was impacted by the increased number of shares outstanding in comparison with the corresponding periods in 2008 resulting primarily from shares issued to partially fund the Wyeth acquisition.
(2)
In fourth-quarter 2009, adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenues was 17.5% compared with 11.7% in fourth-quarter 2008. For full-year 2009, adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenues was 15.4% compared with 14.6% in full-year 2008. These increases primarily reflect the change in the mix of products and businesses as a result of the Wyeth acquisition. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenues was 14.4% in fourth-quarter 2009 and 14.8% in full-year 2009.

(2)
Adjusted SI&A expenses were $5.3 billion in fourth-quarter 2009, an increase of 52% compared with $3.5 billion in the prior-year quarter. Adjusted SI&A expenses were $14.7 billion in full-year 2009, an increase of 4% compared with $14.0 billion in the prior year. These increases were attributable to the addition of the legacy Wyeth operations and increased investment in high-growth and in-line product opportunities. Foreign exchange increased fourth-quarter 2009 adjusted SI&A expenses by $135 million compared with the year-ago quarter, and decreased full-year 2009 adjusted SI&A expenses by $385 million compared with full-year 2008.

Adjusted R&D expenses were $2.8 billion in fourth-quarter 2009, an increase of 27% compared with $2.2 billion in the prior-year period. For full-year 2009, adjusted R&D expenses were $7.7 billion, an increase of 3% compared with $7.5 billion in the prior year. These increases were attributable to the addition of the legacy Wyeth operations, continued investment in the late-stage development portfolio and business-development transactions in the Established Products unit. Foreign exchange increased fourth-quarter 2009 adjusted R&D expenses by $17 million compared with the year-ago quarter, and decreased full-year 2009 adjusted R&D expenses by $145 million compared with full-year 2008.

(2)
Overall, foreign exchange increased adjusted total costs by $720 million, or 10%, in fourth-quarter 2009 compared with the prior-year period. For full-year 2009, foreign exchange decreased adjusted total costs by $520 million, or 2%, compared with the prior year.

(13)
As announced in January 2009, Pfizer implemented a cost-reduction program that is expected to achieve cost savings of approximately $3 billion, at 2008 average foreign exchange rates, compared with 2008 adjusted total costs of $28.6 billion. Approximately $1 billion of these savings is anticipated to be reinvested in the business, resulting in an expected $2 billion net cost reduction. Additionally, as a result of the Wyeth acquisition, Pfizer expects to generate synergies of approximately $4 billion, which is expected to result in $2 to $3 billion in net cost savings after reinvestment in the business. In the aggregate, Pfizer expects to generate gross cost reductions of approximately $7 billion, resulting in net cost reductions of approximately $4 to $5 billion, by the end of 2012, at 2008 average foreign exchange rates, in comparison with the 2008 pro-forma adjusted total costs of Pfizer and the former Wyeth operations. For full-year 2009, operational improvements resulting from the Pfizer stand-alone cost-reduction initiatives resulted in a decrease in adjusted total costs of approximately $200 million, despite significant fourth-quarter 2009 investment in many high-growth and in-line product opportunities, including business-development transactions in the Established Products unit and incremental promotional efforts in the U.S. and emerging markets, among other items. The operational improvements were driven partially by the reduction in workforce as well as manufacturing and research and development site exits. At the closing of the Wyeth acquisition, the combined workforce totaled approximately 120,700, an increase from the Pfizer stand-alone workforce of approximately 75,100. As of year-end 2009, the workforce was approximately 116,500, a decline of 4,200 since the closing on October 15, 2009.

Executive Commentary
During the fourth quarter, we closed the Wyeth acquisition and immediately began the integration of our operations, advancing the transformation of the company, stated Jeff Kindler, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. We are pleased with the rapid pace of the integration and our ability to quickly realize the benefits of our combined organization.
Our results this quarter clearly demonstrate the ability of our colleagues to remain focused and deliver solid operational performance, while working to close the Wyeth acquisition and to ensure a successful integration, Kindler continued. We remain excited about our more diverse in-line product and pipeline portfolio, which we expect will result in improved opportunities for the company in 2010 and beyond.
Frank DAmelio, Chief Financial Officer, stated, Our 2010 financial guidance and 2012 financial targets balance the achievement of our projected cost reductions, including from the integration of Wyeth, with the expected increased investment to drive longer-term, top and bottom line performance. These goals reflect our continued confidence in the business and our ability to capitalize on near- to mid-term growth opportunities through a meaningful reallocation of investment. Additionally, our 2012 targets assume a modest level of planned business-development activities.
2010 Financial Guidance
For full-year 2010, Pfizers financial guidance, at current exchange rates, is summarized below.
(14)
2012 Financial Targets
Pfizer has also provided financial targets for 2012. Given the longer-term nature of these targets, they are subject to greater variability and less certainty as a result of potential material impacts related to foreign exchange fluctuations, macroeconomic activity including inflation, industry-specific challenges including changes to government healthcare policy, among others. In comparison with the targets previously provided on January 26, 2009, these updated targets reflect the impact of the completed and pending divestitures of Animal Health assets as required by regulatory authorities in connection with their approvals of the Wyeth acquisition, the shift in revenues for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) products to the joint venture with GlaxoSmithKline plc (ViiV Healthcare Limited) and the elimination of Relistor revenues due to Wyeths return of its rights to the licensor, which in the aggregate reduced the revenue target by approximately $1.5 billion.
For 2012, at current exchange rates, Pfizer is targeting reported revenue between $66.0 to $68.5 billion, reported diluted EPS between $1.58 and $1.73 and adjusted diluted EPS between $2.25 and $2.35. Adjusted R&D expenses are targeted to be between $8.0 to $8.5 billion, adjusted operating margin is projected to be in a range of the high 30%s to low 40%s and adjusted other (income)/deductionsare targeted to be between $1.0 billion and $1.2 billion in deductions. The effective tax rate on adjusted income is targeted at approximately 30% while the operating cash flow is expected to be at least $19.0 billion.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
1. Change in Reported Revenues
Reported revenues increased 34% in fourth-quarter 2009 and 4% in full-year 2009, compared to the same periods in 2008. The fourth quarter 2009 increase was due to operational growth of 30%, of which 27% was due to the addition of the legacy Wyeth products and 3% was due to legacy Pfizer products, and the favorable impact of foreign exchange of 4%. Full-year 2009 reported revenues were favorably impacted by 7% due to the addition of the legacy Wyeth products, and by 1% due to legacy Pfizer products. These increases were partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange on full-year 2009 revenues of approximately 4%.
2. Change in Reported Cost of Sales
Reported cost of sales increased 130% in fourth-quarter 2009, compared to the same period in 2008, and increased 10% in full-year 2009, compared to full-year 2008. The increases primarily reflect purchase accounting adjustments associated with the Wyeth acquisition and the addition of Wyeth manufacturing costs. In addition, the impact of foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact on reported cost of sales in the quarter and full-year periods. These increases were partially offset by lower costs recorded in reported cost of sales related to our cost-reduction initiatives in both the fourth-quarter and full-year 2009 periods.
Reported cost of sales includes charges related to our cost-reduction initiatives of $31 million for fourth-quarter 2009, $175 million for full-year 2009, $225 million for fourth-quarter 2008, and $745 million for full-year 2008. Cost-reduction initiative charges incurred after the Wyeth acquisition, other than accelerated depreciation, are included in
Restructuring charges and certain acquisition-related costs.
Reported cost of sales as a percentage of revenues increased 9.9 percentage points to 23.8% in fourth-quarter 2009, compared to the same period in 2008, and reported cost of sales as a percentage of revenues increased 1.0 percentage point to 17.8% in full-year 2009, compared to full-year 2008, reflecting the aforementioned factors.
3. Change in Reported Selling, Informational & Administrative (SI&A) Expenses, Reported Research & Development (R&D) Expenses and Reported In-Process R&D Charges (IPR&D)
Reported SI&A expenses increased 47% in fourth-quarter 2009, compared to the same period in 2008, and increased 2% in full-year 2009, compared to full-year 2008. The increase in fourth-quarter 2009 primarily reflects the addition of Wyeth operating costs, the increased investment in high-growth and in-line opportunities, and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, partially offset by lower costs recorded in reported SI&A related to our cost-reduction initiatives. The increase in full-year 2009 primarily reflects the addition of Wyeth operating costs and the increased investment in high-growth and in-line opportunities, partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange and lower costs recorded in reported SI&A related to our cost-reduction initiatives.In addition, full-year 2009 included certain insurance recoveries related to legal defense costs.
Reported SI&A expenses include charges related to our cost-reduction initiatives of $37 million for fourth-quarter 2009, $219 million for full-year 2009, $143 million for fourth-quarter of 2008, and $413 million for full-year 2008. Cost-reduction initiative charges incurred after the Wyeth acquisition, other than accelerated depreciation, are included in
Restructuring charges and certain acquisition-related costs.
Reported R&D expenses, excluding IPR&D, increased 22% in fourth-quarter 2009, compared to the same period in 2008, and decreased 1% in full-year 2009, compared to 2008. The increase in fourth-quarter of 2009 is primarily due to the addition of Wyeth operating costs and continued investment in the late-stage development portfolio and business-development transactions in the Established Products unit, partially offset by lower costs recorded in reported R&D related to our cost-reduction initiatives. The full-year 2009 decrease was primarily due to lower purchase accounting adjustments related to our merger with Pharmacia, lower costs recorded in reported R&D associated with our cost-reduction initiatives and the favorable impact of foreign exchange. This decrease was partially offset by the addition of Wyeth operating costs, continued investment in the late-stage development portfolio, business-development transactions in the Established Products unit, and a $150 million milestone payment to Bristol-Myers Squibb in first-quarter 2009 in connection with the collaboration on apixaban.
Reported R&D expenses include charges related to our cost-reduction initiatives of $13 million for fourth-quarter 2009, $91 million for full-year 2009, $85 million for fourth-quarter 2008, and $433 million for full-year 2008. Cost-reduction initiative charges incurred after the Wyeth acquisition, other than accelerated depreciation, are included in
Restructuring charges and certain acquisition-related costs.
Reported IPR&D charges of $68 million in 2009 relate to the resolution of a contingency associated with our 2008 acquisition of CovX. IPR&D charges of $633 million in 2008 primarily relate to the acquisitions of Serenex, Inc., Encysive Pharmaceuticals, Inc., CovX, Coley Pharmaceutical Group, Inc. and a number of animal health lines from Schering-Plough Corporation, as well as two smaller acquisitions related to Animal Health. As a result of adopting the provisions of a new accounting standard for business combinations, for acquisitions completed after January 1, 2009, we record acquired IPR&D on our consolidated balance sheet as indefinite-lived intangible assets.
4. Other (Income)/Deductions - Net
5. Effective Tax Rate
The effective tax rate on reported for fourth-quarter 2009 was favorably impacted by a tax benefit of $556 million related to the sale of one of our biopharmaceutical companies, Vicuron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., as well as the jurisdictional mix of certain expenses incurred in connection with the Wyeth acquisition. The effective tax rate of 63.1% in the fourth-quarter of 2008 was negatively impacted by legal settlement provisions, which were either not deductible or deductible at lower tax rates.
Income from continuing operations before provision for taxes on income
The effective tax rate on reported for full-year 2009 was 20.3% and 17.0% for full-year 2008. The higher tax rate in 2009 is primarily due to the increased tax costs associated with certain business decisions executed to finance the Wyeth acquisition, partially offset by the favorable impacts discussed above as well as a tax benefit of $174 million recorded in the third quarter of 2009 related to the final resolution of an agreement-in-principle with the U.S. Department of Justice to settle investigations of past promotional practices concerning Bextra and certain other investigations. This resulted in the receipt of information that raised our assessment of the likelihood of prevailing on the technical merits of our tax position. The higher tax rate in 2009 was also partially offset by the decrease in IPR&D charges, which generally are not deductible for tax purposes.
Income from continuing operations before provision for taxes on income
The effective tax rate on adjusted income was 28.3% in fourth-quarter 2009, 23.5% in fourth quarter 2008, 29.5% in full-year 2009 and 22.0% in full-year 2008. The higher tax rates on adjusted income in 2009 are primarily due to the increased tax costs associated with certain business decisions executed to finance the Wyeth acquisition. The lower tax rate in the full-year 2008 also reflects $305 million in tax benefits related to the resolution of tax issues.

________________
Adjusted income and adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS) are defined as reported net income attributable to Pfizer Inc. and reported diluted EPS attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders excluding purchase-accounting adjustments, acquisition-related costs, discontinued operations and certain significant items. As described under in the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of Pfizers Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 27, 2009, management uses adjusted income, among other factors, to set performance goals and to measure the performance of the overall company. We believe that investors understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing this measure. The adjusted income and adjusted diluted EPS measures are not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for U.S. GAAP net income and diluted EPS.
