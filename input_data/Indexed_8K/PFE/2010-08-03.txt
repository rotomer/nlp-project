EXHIBIT 99
 
($ in millions, except per share amounts)
 
NEW YORK, N.Y., Tuesday, August 3, 2010  Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) today reported financial results for second-quarter 2010.  Since the acquisition of Wyeth was completed on October 15, 2009, legacy Wyeth products and operations are reflected in the first two quarters of 2010, but not reflected in the first two quarters of 2009.  Second-quarter 2010 revenues were $17.3 billion, an increase of 58% compared with $11.0 billion in the year-ago quarter.  Revenues for second-quarter 2010 compared with the year-ago quarter were favorably impacted by $5.4 billion, or 50%, due to the addition of the legacy Wyeth products, by $315 million, or 3%, due to legacy Pfizer products, and by $584 million, or 5%, due to foreign exchange.  For second-quarter 2010, U.S. revenues were $7.4 billion, an increase of 63% compared with the year-ago quarter.  International revenues were $9.9 billion, an increase of 54% compared with the prior-year quarter, which reflected 45% operational growth and a 9% favorable impact of foreign exchange.   U.S. revenues represented 43% of total revenues in second-quarter 2010 compared with 41% in the year-ago quarter, while international revenues represented 57% of total revenues in second-quarter 2010 compared with 59% in the year-ago quarter.

For first-half 2010, revenues were $34.1 billion, an increase of 56% compared with $21.9 billion in the same period in 2009.   Revenues for first-half 2010 compared with the year-ago period were favorably impacted by $10.7 billion, or 49%, due to the addition of the legacy Wyeth products, by $173 million, or 1%, due to legacy Pfizer products, and by $1.3 billion, or 6%, due to foreign exchange.  U.S. revenues were $14.7 billion, an increase of 55% compared with first-half 2009.  International revenues were $19.4 billion, an increase of 57% compared with the same period last year, which reflected 46% operational growth and an 11% favorable impact of foreign exchange.  U.S. revenues represented 43% and international revenues represented 57% of the total in first-half 2010, both comparable with first-half 2009.
Business Revenues
Pfizer operates two distinct commercial organizations: Biopharmaceutical and Diversified.  Biopharmaceutical includes the Primary Care, Specialty Care, Established Products, Emerging Markets and Oncology customer-focused units, while Diversified includes Animal Health, Consumer Healthcare, Nutrition and Capsugel.

For second-quarter 2010, revenues from Biopharmaceutical were $15.0 billion, an increase of 49% compared with $10.1 billion in the year-ago quarter.  Operationally, revenues increased $4.5 billion, or 44%, which included $4.2 billion, or 41%, attributable to legacy Wyeth products, primarily Premarin in the Primary Care unit, Enbrel and the Prevnar/Prevenar franchise in the Specialty Care unit, Effexor in the Established Products unit as well as Enbrel and Prevenar in the Emerging Markets unit, and $313 million, or 3%, due to legacy Pfizer products.  In addition, foreign exchange favorably impacted Biopharmaceutical revenues by 5% or $485 million.
Within the Biopharmaceutical units, legacy Pfizer operational performance was impacted in second-quarter 2010 compared with the year-ago quarter by the loss of exclusivity of certain products and by the resulting reclassification of Camptosar revenues among the units.  Legacy Pfizer Oncology unit revenues no longer include Camptosars European revenues due to its loss of exclusivity in July 2009.  Camptosars European revenues are included in the Established Products unit beginning in first-quarter 2010. This reclassification of revenues negatively impacted the Oncology units performance by 20% in second-quarter 2010 compared with the prior-year quarter.   Further, legacy Pfizer Established Products unit revenues in second-quarter 2010 were adversely impacted by 5% due to the loss of exclusivity for Norvasc in Canada in July 2009, partially offset by the favorable impact of 1% due to the addition of Camptosars European revenues.
For second-quarter 2010, revenues from Diversified were $2.2 billion, an increase of 169% compared with $833 million in the year-ago quarter.  Operationally, revenues increased $1.3 billion, or 157%, which was primarily attributable to legacy Wyeth products, principally Centrum, Advil and Caltrate in Consumer Healthcare and infant and toddler Nutrition products.  Additionally, foreign exchange favorably impacted Diversified revenues by 12% or $102 million.
Reported Net Incomeand Reported Diluted EPS
(1)
(1)
For second-quarter 2010, Pfizer posted reported net income of $2.5 billion, an increase of 9% compared with $2.3 billion in the prior-year quarter, and reported diluted EPS of $0.31, a decrease of 9% compared with $0.34 in the prior-year quarter.  For first-half 2010, Pfizer posted reported net income of $4.5 billion, a decrease of 10% compared with $5.0 billion in first-half 2009, and reported diluted EPS of $0.56, a decline of 24% compared with $0.74 in the prior-year period.  Results were favorably impacted by revenues from legacy Wyeth products and foreign exchange, and negatively impacted by the expenses associated with the legacy Wyeth operations as well as purchase accounting adjustments, integration charges and restructuring charges associated with the Wyeth acquisition, higher net interest expense primarily due to the borrowings used to partially fund the Wyeth acquisition and an increase in the effective tax rate.

The effective tax rate on reported results increased to approximately 37% in second-quarter 2010 from approximately 26% in second-quarter 2009, and approximately 37% in first-half 2010 compared with approximately 27% in first-half 2009.  These increases were primarily the result of higher charges incurred as a result of the acquisition of Wyeth and the mix of jurisdictions in which those charges were incurred.
Additionally, reported diluted EPSin second-quarter 2010 and first-half 2010 was impacted by the increased number of shares outstanding in comparison with the corresponding periods in 2009 resulting from shares issued to partially fund the Wyeth acquisition.
(1)
Adjusted Income and Adjusted Diluted EPS
(2)
(2)
Second-quarter 2010 adjusted income was $5.0 billion, an increase of 53% compared with $3.2 billion in the year-ago quarter, and adjusted diluted EPS was $0.62, an increase of 29% compared with $0.48 in the year-ago quarter.  For first-half 2010, Pfizer posted adjusted income of $9.8 billion, an increase of 42% compared with $6.9 billion in first-half 2009, and adjusted diluted EPS of $1.22, an increase of 18% compared with $1.03 in the prior-year period.  Results were favorably impacted by revenues from legacy Wyeth products and foreign exchange, which were partially offset by the expenses associated with the legacy Wyeth operations as well as higher net interest expense primarily due to the borrowings used to partially fund the acquisition of Wyeth and an increase in the effective tax rate.

The effective tax rate on adjusted incomeincreased to approximately 32% in second-quarter 2010 compared with approximately 28% in second-quarter 2009, and approximately 31% in first-half 2010 compared with approximately 29% in first-half 2009.  These increases were primarily the result of certain business decisions made in connection with the acquisition of Wyeth and the change in the jurisdictional mix of earnings. 
(2)
- 4 - -
 
Additionally, adjusted diluted EPSin second-quarter 2010 and first-half 2010 was impacted by the increased number of shares outstanding in comparison with the corresponding periods in 2009 resulting from shares issued to partially fund the Wyeth acquisition.
(2)  
In second-quarter 2010, adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenues was 17.0% compared with 15.4% in second-quarter 2009.  This increase primarily reflects the change in the mix of products and businesses as a result of the Wyeth acquisition.  Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenues was 18.2% in second-quarter 2010.  
(2)
(2)
Adjusted SI&A expenses were $4.7 billion in second-quarter 2010, an increase of 45% compared with $3.3 billion in the prior-year quarter.  This increase was attributable primarily to the addition of the legacy Wyeth operations.  Foreign exchange increased second-quarter 2010 adjusted SI&A expenses by $126 million compared with the year-ago quarter.
(2)
(2)
Adjusted R&D expenses were $2.2 billion in second-quarter 2010, an increase of 32% compared with $1.7 billion in the prior-year period. This increase was attributable primarily to the addition of the legacy Wyeth operations and continued investment in the late-stage development portfolio.  Foreign exchange increased second-quarter 2010 adjusted R&D expenses by $21 million compared with the year-ago quarter.
(2)
(2)
Overall, foreign exchange increased adjusted total costs by $48 million, or 1%, in second-quarter 2010 compared with the prior-year period.

Executive Commentary
Jeff Kindler, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, During the quarter, Pfizers more balanced global portfolio, which includes small molecules, biologics and vaccines as well as off-patent pharmaceuticals and diversified products generated strong performance in a  period of notable worldwide economic uncertainty.   Within our Biopharmaceutical businesses, our recently launched vaccine for the prevention of pneumococcal disease in children, Prevnar/Prevenar 13, was a strong contributor, while many key products in our Primary Care, Specialty Care and Oncology units also performed well on a global basis.  The Emerging Markets unit continued to benefit from our on-going investment, with year-over-year operational growth on a legacy Pfizer basis of 11%.  Within that unit, revenues in our six key markets, led by China, increased a combined 19% on a legacy Pfizer operational basis to approximately $800 million.  
(13)

We continue to make solid progress on the Wyeth integration while we remain focused on delivering strong business performance.  We expect to receive phase three clinical data for tasocitinib in rheumatoid arthritis, Sutent in lung cancer, Prevnar 13 for the prevention of pneumococcal disease in adults, axitinib in renal cell carcinoma and bosutinib in chronic myelogenous leukemia during the balance of this year.  Within the Established Products unit, we anticipate continued new product launches, and within the Emerging Markets unit, we plan to continue our expansion in China and other key markets.  Within our Diversified businesses, we plan to continue launching new innovations in markets around the world to grow and strengthen our product offerings, such as in our vitamin and infant formula product lines.  We believe that these actions, in addition to a modest level of business development, will continue to support consistent, solid financial results, continued Mr. Kindler.
Frank DAmelio, Chief Financial Officer, stated, Based on our year-to-date performance, continued confidence in the business, progress on both our cost-reduction initiatives and the Wyeth integration as well as our future outlook, we are reaffirming our 2010 financial guidance and our 2012 financial targets.  At this point, we anticipate that 2010 adjusted diluted EPS will be at the upper-end of our guidance range, with expenses at the lower-end of our ranges.  Given the continued strength of our balance sheet and significant operating cash flow, we remain confident that we have the financial wherewithal to successfully execute our strategies and continue to meet our financial objectives.  Additionally, during the second quarter, we repurchased approximately $500 million, or 31 million shares, of our common stock.

2012 Financial Targets
The Company is reaffirming all elements of its 2012 financial targets.  As previously stated, given the longer-term nature of these targets, they are subject to greater variability and less certainty as a result of potential material impacts related to foreign exchange fluctuations, macroeconomic activity including inflation, and industry-specific challenges including changes to government healthcare policy, among others.
For 2012, at current exchange rates, Pfizer is targeting reported revenues between $65.2 and $67.7 billion, reported diluted EPS between $1.58 and $1.73, adjusted diluted EPSbetween $2.25 and $2.35, adjusted R&D expenses between $8.0 and $8.5 billion, adjusted operating marginin a range of the high 30%s to low 40%s and adjusted other (income)/deductionsbetween $1.0 and $1.2 billion in deductions.  The effective tax rate on adjusted income is targeted at approximately 30%, while operating cash flow is expected to be at least $19.0 billion.

Additionally, the Company remains on-track to achieve the cost-reduction target of approximately $4 to $5 billion, by the end of 2012, at 2008 average foreign exchange rates, in comparison with the 2008 pro-forma adjusted total costs of Pfizer and the legacy Wyeth operations.

1. Change in Reported Cost of Sales
Reported cost of sales increased 116% in the second quarter of 2010, compared to the same period in 2009, and increased 156% in the first six months of 2010, compared to the same period in 2009. The increases primarily reflect purchase accounting adjustments associated with the Wyeth acquisition, the addition of Wyeth manufacturing costs, as well as the change in the mix of products and businesses as a result of the Wyeth acquisition. In addition, the impact of foreign exchange had a favorable impact on reported cost of sales in the second quarter of 2010 and an unfavorable impact for the first six months of 2010.
Reported cost of sales as a percentage of revenues increased 5.9 percentage points to 21.9% in second-quarter 2010, compared to the same period in 2009, reflecting the aforementioned factors.
2. Change in Reported Selling, Informational & Administrative (SI&A) Expenses and Reported Research & Development (R&D) Expenses and Reported In-Process R&D (IPR&D) Charges
Reported SI&A expenses increased 43% in the second quarter of 2010, compared to the same period in 2009, and increased 48% in the first six months of 2010, compared to the same period in 2009. The increases primarily reflect the addition of Wyeth operating costs and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange.
Reported R&D expenses increased 29% in the second quarter of 2010, compared to the same period in 2009, and increased 30% in the first six months of 2010, compared to the same period in 2009. The increases are primarily due to the addition of legacy Wyeth operations, continued investment in the late-stage development portfolio and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange.
Reported IPR&D charges of $74 million recorded in the first six months of 2010 relate to the resolution of contingencies associated with our 2008 acquisition of CovX.

4. Effective Tax Rate
The increases in the effective tax rate primarily are the result of higher charges, incurred as a result of our acquisition of Wyeth, and the mix of jurisdictions in which those charges were incurred. In addition, the increases in the effective tax rate were impacted by the expiration of the U.S. research tax credit and, in the first six months of 2010 compared to the first six months of 2009, the write-off of the deferred tax asset of approximately $270 million related the Medicare Part D subsidy for retiree prescription drug coverage resulting from changes in the recently enacted U.S. healthcare legislation concerning the tax treatment of that subsidy effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2012, partially offset by $410 million in tax benefits for the resolution of certain tax positions pertaining to prior years with various foreign tax authorities.
The effective tax rate on reported
Income from continuing operations before provision for taxes on income
for second-quarter 2010 was 37.4% compared to 25.8% in the second quarter of 2009, and in the first six months of 2010 was 36.8% compared to 27.1% in the first six months of 2009.

Adjusted income and adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS) are defined as reported net income attributable to Pfizer Inc. and reported diluted EPS attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders excluding purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition-related costs, discontinued operations and certain significant items. As described under in the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of Pfizers Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended April 4, 2010, management uses adjusted income, among other factors, to set performance goals and to measure the performance of the overall company. We believe that investors understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing this measure. The adjusted income and adjusted diluted EPS measures are not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for U.S. GAAP net income and diluted EPS.
