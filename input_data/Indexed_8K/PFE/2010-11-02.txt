EXHIBIT 99
 
PFIZER REPORTS THIRD-QUARTER 2010 RESULTS
 
 
See end of text prior to tables for notes.
 
NEW YORK, N.Y., Tuesday, November 2, 2010  Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) today reported financial results for third-quarter 2010.  Since the acquisition of Wyeth was completed on October 15, 2009, legacy Wyeth products and operations are reflected in the first three quarters of 2010, but not reflected in the first three quarters of 2009.  Third-quarter 2010 revenues were $16.2 billion, an increase of 39% compared with $11.6 billion in the year-ago quarter.  Revenues for third-quarter 2010 compared with the year-ago quarter were favorably impacted by $5.2 billion, or 44%, due to the addition of the legacy Wyeth products, negatively impacted by $458 million, or 4%, due to legacy Pfizer products, and negatively impacted by $160 million, or 1%, due to foreign exchange.  For third-quarter 2010, U.S. revenues were $7.1 billion, an increase of 48% compared with the year-ago quarter.  International revenues were $9.1 billion, an increase of 33% compared with the prior-year quarter, which reflected 35% operational growth partially offset by a 2% unfavorable impact of foreign exchange.  U.S. revenues represented 44% of total revenues in third-quarter 2010 compared with 41% in the year-ago quarter, while international revenues represented 56% of total revenues in third-quarter 2010 compared with 59% in the year-ago quarter.

For the first nine months of 2010, revenues were $50.2 billion, an increase of 50% compared with $33.5 billion in the same period in 2009.   Revenues for the first nine months of  2010 compared with the year-ago period were favorably impacted by $15.9 billion, or 48%, due to the addition of the legacy Wyeth products, and by $1.2 billion, or 3%, due to foreign exchange, and negatively impacted by $285 million, or 1%, due to legacy Pfizer products.  U.S. revenues were $21.8 billion, an increase of 52% compared with the first nine month of 2009.  International revenues were $28.4 billion, an increase of 48% compared with the same period last year, which reflected 42% operational growth and a 6% favorable impact of foreign exchange.  U.S. revenues represented 43% and international revenues represented 57% of total revenues in the first nine months of 2010, comparable with the first nine months of 2009.
Business Revenues
Pfizer operates two distinct commercial organizations: Biopharmaceutical and Diversified.  Biopharmaceutical includes the Primary Care, Specialty Care, Established Products, Emerging Markets and Oncology customer-focused units, while Diversified includes Animal Health, Consumer Healthcare, Nutrition and Capsugel.

For third-quarter 2010, revenues from Biopharmaceutical were $13.9 billion, an increase of 31% compared with $10.7 billion in the year-ago quarter.  Operationally, revenues increased $3.4 billion, or 33%, which included $3.9 billion, or 37%, attributable to legacy Wyeth products, primarily Premarin in the Primary Care unit, Enbrel and the Prevnar/Prevenar franchise in the Specialty Care unit, Protonix and Zosyn/Tazocin in the Established Products unit as well as Enbrel and the Prevenar franchise in the Emerging Markets unit, partially offset by a decline of $468 million, or 4%, due to legacy Pfizer products.  In addition, foreign exchange unfavorably impacted Biopharmaceutical revenues by 2% or $173 million.
 
Within the Biopharmaceutical units, legacy Pfizer operational performance was impacted in third-quarter 2010 compared with the year-ago quarter primarily by the loss of exclusivity of certain products and by the resulting reclassification of Camptosar European revenues among the units. Legacy Pfizer Primary Care unit revenues in third-quarter 2010 were negatively impacted by 4% due to the loss of exclusivity of Lipitor in Canada in May 2010 and in Spain in July 2010. Legacy Pfizer Oncology unit revenues no longer include Camptosars European revenues due to its loss of exclusivity in July 2009. Camptosars European revenues are included in the Established Products unit beginning in first-quarter 2010. This reclassification of revenues negatively impacted the legacy Pfizer Oncology units performance by 16% in third-quarter 2010 compared with the prior-year quarter. Further, legacy Pfizer Established Products unit revenues in third-quarter 2010 were adversely impacted by 6% due to the loss of exclusivity for Norvasc in Canada in July 2009, partially offset by the favorable impact of 1% due to the addition of Camptosars European revenues. Finally, legacy Pfizer Emerging Markets unit revenues in third-quarter 2010 were essentially flat reflecting solid growth in key priority countries, most notably China, offset by Eastern European pricing pressure and wholesaler purchasing patterns driven by economic conditions.
 
For third-quarter 2010, revenues from Diversified were $2.2 billion, an increase of 151% compared with $855 million in the year-ago quarter.  This increase of $1.3 billion was primarily attributable to legacy Wyeth products, principally Centrum, Advil and Caltrate in Consumer Healthcare and infant and toddler Nutrition products.  The impact of foreign exchange on Diversified revenues was immaterial.

Reported Net Incomeand Reported Diluted EPS

(2)
For third-quarter 2010, Pfizer posted reported net income of $866 million, a decrease of 70% compared with $2.9 billion in the prior-year quarter, and reported diluted EPS of $0.11, a decrease of 74% compared with $0.43 in the prior-year quarter.  For the first nine months of 2010, Pfizer posted reported net income of $5.4 billion, a decrease of 32% compared with $7.9 billion in the first nine months of 2009, and reported diluted EPS of $0.66, a decline of 43% compared with $1.16 in the prior-year period.  Third-quarter 2010 results were favorably impacted by revenues from legacy Wyeth products, and negatively impacted primarily by the expenses associated with the legacy Wyeth operations as well as purchase accounting adjustments, integration charges and restructuring charges associated with the Wyeth acquisition, impairment charges of $1.5 billion (pre-tax) related to certain intangible assets acquired in connection with the Wyeth acquisition and a $701 million (pre-tax) charge for asbestos litigation related to our wholly owned subsidiary Quigley Company, Inc.  For the first nine months of 2010, results were impacted by the aforementioned items as well as the favorable impact of foreign exchange and the unfavorable impact of higher net interest expense primarily due to borrowings used to partially fund the Wyeth acquisition.

In addition, the effective tax rate on reported results increased to approximately 39% in third-quarter 2010 from approximately 28% in third-quarter 2009, and approximately 37% in the first nine months of 2010 from approximately 27% in the first nine months of 2009.  These increases were primarily the result of higher expenses incurred as a result of the acquisition of Wyeth and the mix of jurisdictions in which those expenses were incurred.  Also, the lower rates in the third quarter and first nine months of 2009 compared to the same periods in 2010 reflected a tax benefit of $174 million related to the final resolution of a previously disclosed settlement.
Additionally, reported diluted EPSin third-quarter 2010 and the first nine months of 2010 was impacted by the increased number of shares outstanding in comparison with the corresponding periods in 2009 resulting from shares issued to partially fund the Wyeth acquisition.

Adjusted Income and Adjusted Diluted EPS
(1)
(1)
Third-quarter 2010 adjusted income was $4.4 billion, an increase of 26% compared with $3.5 billion in the year-ago quarter, and adjusted diluted EPS was $0.54, an increase of 6% compared with $0.51 in the year-ago quarter.  For the first nine months of 2010, Pfizer posted adjusted income of $14.2 billion, an increase of 37% compared with $10.4 billion in the first nine months of 2009, and adjusted diluted EPS of $1.76, an increase of 14% compared with $1.54 in the prior-year period.  Results were favorably impacted by revenues from legacy Wyeth products and, to a lesser extent, foreign exchange, which were partially offset by the expenses associated with the legacy Wyeth operations as well as lower overall revenues from legacy Pfizer products and higher net interest expense primarily due to borrowings used to partially fund the acquisition of Wyeth.

In addition, the effective tax rate on adjusted incomedecreased to approximately 30% in third-quarter 2010 compared with approximately 32% in third-quarter 2009, and increased to approximately 31% in the first nine months of 2010 compared with approximately 30% in the first nine months of 2009.  The changes in the effective tax rate on adjusted incomewere primarily the result of the change in the jurisdictional mix of earnings in the respective periods.

Additionally, adjusted diluted EPSin third-quarter 2010 and the first nine months of 2010 was impacted by the increased number of shares outstanding in comparison with the corresponding periods in 2009 resulting from shares issued to partially fund the Wyeth acquisition.

In third-quarter 2010, adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenues was 18.3% compared with 15.4% in third-quarter 2009. This increase primarily reflects the change in the mix of products and businesses as a result of the Wyeth acquisition. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenues was 19.7% in third-quarter 2010.

Foreign exchange decreased third-quarter 2010 adjusted R&D expenses by $15 million compared with the year-ago quarter.

Executive Commentary
Jeff Kindler, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, Its been just over a year since the closing of the Wyeth acquisition.  I am particularly pleased with the speed of the integration, the cost synergies achieved to date as well as our solid financial performance this quarter and year-to-date in this difficult economic environment.  This combination is clearly creating opportunities to provide greater value for our shareholders.
We continue to carefully evaluate and make prudent capital allocation decisions.  We recently announced several business development transactions that we believe will enhance shareholder value by enabling continued growth in several of our business units.  Our pending acquisition of King Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is consistent with our stated objective of seeking a larger presence in the pain market within the Primary Care unit, while our acquisition of FoldRx enhances the orphan and rare disease pipeline portfolio of our Specialty Care unit.  Further, our alliance with Biocon is expected to advance our biosimilars strategy by positioning us competitively in the diabetes market over time, while our agreement with Laboratorio Teuto Brasileiro S.A. is expected to broaden our Emerging Markets presence.  Also, we are reviewing strategic alternatives for Capsugel in order to optimize the value of this asset.  We believe these actions, taken together, will serve to improve our business profile and provide both near-term and longer-term financial benefit, continued Mr. Kindler.
Frank DAmelio, Chief Financial Officer, stated, Given our solid year-to-date performance and continued confidence in the business, we are once again reaffirming our 2012 financial targets, and we are narrowing the ranges for the components of our 2010 financial guidance.  Additionally, we are increasing our 2010 adjusted diluted EPS guidance to a range of  $2.17 to $2.22 from a range of $2.10 to $2.20.  Further, we repurchased approximately $500 million, or 30 million shares, of our common stock in the third quarter, and we continue to review our capital allocation options with the goal of maximizing value for our shareholders.

For full-year 2010, Pfizers financial guidance, at current exchange rates, is summarized below.
(15)
2012 Financial Targets
The Company is reaffirming all elements of its 2012 financial targets.  As previously stated, given the longer-term nature of these targets, they are subject to greater variability and less certainty as a result of potential material impacts related to foreign exchange fluctuations, macroeconomic activity including inflation, and industry-specific challenges including changes to government healthcare policy, among others.
For 2012, at current exchange rates, Pfizer is targeting reported revenues between $65.2 and $67.7 billion, reported diluted EPS between $1.58 and $1.73, adjusted diluted EPSbetween $2.25 and $2.35, adjusted R&D expenses between $8.0 and $8.5 billion, adjusted operating marginin a range of the high 30%s to low 40%s and adjusted other (income)/deductionsbetween $1.0 and $1.2 billion in deductions. The effective tax rate on adjusted income is targeted at approximately 30%, while operating cash flow is expected to be at least $19.0 billion.

Additionally, the Company remains on-track to achieve the cost-reduction target of approximately $4 to $5 billion, by the end of 2012, at 2008 average foreign exchange rates, in comparison with the 2008 pro-forma adjusted total costs of the legacy Pfizer and legacy Wyeth operations.

1. Change in Reported Cost of Sales
Reported cost of sales increased 118% in the third quarter of 2010, compared to the same period in 2009, and increased 142% in the first nine months of 2010, compared to the same period in 2009. The increases primarily reflect purchase accounting adjustments associated with the Wyeth acquisition, a write-off of Wyeth-related inventory of $212 million (which includes a purchase accounting fair value adjustment of $104 million), the addition of Wyeth manufacturing costs, as well as the change in the mix of products and businesses as a result of the Wyeth acquisition, partially offset by a favorable impact of foreign exchange for both the third quarter and first nine months of 2010. The write-off of inventory primarily relates to unfinished inventory acquired from Wyeth that became unusable after the acquisition date.
Reported cost of sales as a percentage of revenues increased 8.7 percentage points to 24.1% in third-quarter 2010, compared to the same period in 2009, reflecting the aforementioned factors.
2. Change in Reported Selling, Informational & Administrative (SI&A) Expenses and Reported Research & Development (R&D) Expenses
Reported SI&A expenses increased 41% in the third quarter of 2010, compared to the same period in 2009, and increased 46% in the first nine months of 2010, compared to the same period in 2009. The increases primarily reflect the addition of Wyeth operating costs. Foreign exchange had a favorable impact on reported SI&A expenses in the third quarter of 2010 and an unfavorable impact for the first nine months of 2010.
Reported R&D expenses increased 34% in the third quarter of 2010, compared to the same period in 2009, and increased 31% in the first nine months of 2010, compared to the same period in 2009. The increases are primarily due to the addition of legacy Wyeth operations and continued investment in the late-stage development portfolio. Foreign exchange had a favorable impact on reported R&D expenses in the third quarter of 2010 and an unfavorable impact for the first nine months of 2010.

4. Effective Tax Rate
Reported
The effective tax rate on reported for third-quarter 2010 was 39.2% compared to 27.5% in the third quarter of 2009, and in the first nine months of 2010 was 37.2% compared to 27.3% in the first nine months of 2009.
Income from continuing operations before provision for taxes on income
The higher tax rates in the third quarter and first nine months of 2010 are primarily the result of:
partially offset by:
The effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2010 was additionally impacted by the write-off of the deferred tax asset of approximately $270 million related to the Medicare Part D subsidy for retiree prescription drug coverage, resulting from changes in the U.S. healthcare legislation enacted in March 2010 concerning the tax treatment of that subsidy effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2012, offset by $460 million in tax benefits for the resolution of certain tax positions pertaining to prior years with various foreign tax authorities.
Adjusted
The effective tax rate on adjusted income decreased to 30.2% in third-quarter 2010 compared to 31.8% in third-quarter 2009, as a result of the change in the jurisdictional mix of earnings, partially offset by the expiration of the U.S. research and development tax credit.

The effective tax rate on adjusted income

for the first nine months of 2010 was 30.7% compared to 29.9% in the first nine months of 2009. In addition to the aforementioned factors, the effective tax rate on adjusted income

Targets to 2012 Reported Net Income Attributable to Pfizer Inc. and Reported Diluted EPS Attributable to Pfizer Inc. Common Shareholders Targets
(a)
 
 
Adjusted income and adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS) are defined as reported net income attributable to Pfizer Inc. and reported diluted EPS attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders excluding purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition-related costs, discontinued operations and certain significant items. As described under in the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of Pfizers Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended July 4, 2010, management uses adjusted income, among other factors, to set performance goals and to measure the performance of the overall company. We believe that investors understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing this measure. The adjusted income and adjusted diluted EPS measures are not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for U.S. GAAP net income and diluted EPS.
