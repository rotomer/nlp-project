NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--February 1, 2011--Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE):
Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) today reported financial results for fourth-quarter and full-year 2010. Since the acquisition of Wyeth was completed on October 15, 2009, fourth-quarter and full-year 2009 results reflect the legacy Wyeth operations from the acquisition date through Pfizers domestic and international year-ends (see note 17); results for all periods in 2010 reflect the legacy Wyeth operations. Fourth-quarter 2010 revenues were $17.6 billion, an increase of 6% compared with $16.5 billion in the year-ago quarter. Revenues for fourth-quarter 2010 compared with the year-ago quarter were favorably impacted by $2.3 billion, or 14%, due to legacy Wyeth products, negatively impacted by $1.2 billion, or 7%, due to legacy Pfizer products, and negatively impacted by $70 million, or 1%, due to foreign exchange. For fourth-quarter 2010, U.S. revenues were $7.2 billion, a decrease of 3% compared with the year-ago quarter. International revenues were $10.3 billion, an increase of 13% compared with the prior-year quarter, which reflected 14% operational growth partially offset by a 1% unfavorable impact of foreign exchange. U.S. revenues represented 41% of total revenues in fourth-quarter 2010 compared with 45% in the year-ago quarter, while international revenues represented 59% of total revenues in fourth-quarter 2010 compared with 55% in the year-ago quarter.
For full-year 2010, revenues were $67.8 billion, an increase of 36% compared with $50.0 billion in full-year 2009. Revenues for full-year 2010 compared with full-year 2009 were favorably impacted by $18.1 billion, or 37%, due to legacy Wyeth products, and by $1.1 billion, or 2%, due to foreign exchange, and negatively impacted by $1.4 billion, or 3%, due to legacy Pfizer products. U.S. revenues were $29.0 billion, an increase of 34% compared with full-year 2009. International revenues were $38.8 billion, an increase of 37% compared with full-year 2009, which reflected 33% operational growth and a 4% favorable impact of foreign exchange. U.S. revenues represented 43% and international revenues represented 57% of total revenues for full-year 2010, comparable with full-year 2009.
Business Revenues
Pfizer operates two distinct commercial organizations: Biopharmaceutical and Diversified. Biopharmaceutical includes the Primary Care, Specialty Care, Established Products, Emerging Markets and Oncology customer-focused units, while Diversified includes Animal Health, Consumer Healthcare, Nutrition and Capsugel.
For fourth-quarter 2010, revenues from Biopharmaceutical were $15.1 billion, an increase of 3% compared with $14.6 billion in the year-ago quarter. Operationally, revenues increased $515 million, or 4%, which included $1.6 billion, or 11%, attributable to legacy Wyeth products, primarily Premarin and Pristiq in the Primary Care unit, Enbrel and the Prevnar/Prevenar franchise in the Specialty Care unit, Protonix in the Established Products unit as well as Enbrel and the Prevenar franchise in the Emerging Markets unit, partially offset by a decline of $1.1 billion, or 8%, due to legacy Pfizer products, primarily Lipitor and Norvasc. The impact of foreign exchange on Biopharmaceutical revenues was immaterial.
Within the Biopharmaceutical units, legacy Pfizer operational performance was impacted in fourth-quarter 2010 compared with the year-ago quarter primarily by the loss of exclusivity of certain products and European pricing pressures, among other factors. Legacy Pfizer Primary Care unit revenues in fourth-quarter 2010 were negatively impacted by the loss of exclusivity of Lipitor in Canada and Spain in May 2010 and July 2010, respectively, as well as Aricept in the U.S. in November 2010. Taken together, the loss of exclusivity for these products reduced legacy Pfizer Primary Care revenues by approximately $500 million, or 8%. Additionally, legacy Pfizer Primary Care revenues were negatively impacted by Developed Europe pricing pressures and U.S. healthcare reform and positively impacted by growth from select brands, including Lyrica, Champix and Celebrex, among others, in key international markets, most notably Japan. Legacy Pfizer Specialty Care unit revenues were also negatively impacted by Developed Europe pricing pressures and U.S. healthcare reform as well as an overall decline in certain therapeutic markets. Legacy Pfizer Established Products unit revenues were mainly impacted by the loss of exclusivity of Norvasc in Canada in July 2009. Lastly, legacy Pfizer Emerging Markets unit revenues were negatively impacted by the loss of exclusivity of Lipitor in August 2010 and Viagra in June 2010, both in Brazil, as well as Emerging Europe pricing pressures, but positively impacted by growth in key markets, including China and Brazil.
For fourth-quarter 2010, revenues from Diversified were $2.4 billion, an increase of 34% compared with $1.8 billion in the year-ago quarter. This increase of $624 million was primarily attributable to legacy Wyeth products, principally Advil, Caltrate and Centrum in Consumer Healthcare and infant and toddler Nutrition products. The impact of foreign exchange on Diversified revenues was immaterial.
Reported Net Incomeand Reported Diluted EPS
(2)
(2)
For fourth-quarter 2010, Pfizer posted reported net income of $2.9 billion, an increase of 277% compared with $767 million in the prior-year quarter, and reported diluted EPS of $0.36, an increase of 260% compared with $0.10 in the prior-year quarter. For full-year 2010, Pfizer posted reported net income of $8.3 billion, a decline of 4% compared with $8.6 billion in full-year 2009, and reported diluted EPS of $1.02, a decline of 17% compared with $1.23 in full-year 2009. Fourth-quarter 2010 results were favorably impacted by revenues from legacy Wyeth products and substantially lower restructuring charges associated with the Wyeth acquisition, and negatively impacted primarily by lower revenues from legacy Pfizer products, expenses associated with the legacy Wyeth operations and an additional charge for asbestos litigation related to our wholly owned subsidiary Quigley Company, Inc. For full-year 2010, results were impacted by the aforementioned items as well as the favorable impact of foreign exchange and the unfavorable impact of impairment charges related to certain intangible assets acquired in connection with the Wyeth acquisition, higher purchase accounting adjustments and integration charges associated with the Wyeth acquisition as well as higher net interest expense primarily due to borrowings used to partially fund the Wyeth acquisition.

(2)
(2)
(2)
Additionally, in fourth-quarter 2010, Pfizer reached a settlement with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service related to issues the Company was appealing regarding the audits of the Pfizer Inc. and Pharmacia tax returns for multiple years. As a result of this settlement, the Company reduced its unrecognized tax benefits by approximately $1.4 billion in tax and approximately $600 million in interest and recorded a corresponding tax benefit to its income tax provision in fourth-quarter 2010, resulting in a favorable impact on net income.
Further, reported diluted EPSin full-year 2010 was impacted by the increased number of shares outstanding in comparison with full-year 2009 resulting from shares issued to partially fund the Wyeth acquisition.
(2)
Adjusted Income and Adjusted Diluted EPS
(1)
(1)
Fourth-quarter 2010 adjusted income was $3.8 billion, comparable with the year-ago quarter, and adjusted diluted EPS was $0.47, a decrease of 4% compared with $0.49 in the year-ago quarter. For full-year 2010, Pfizer posted adjusted income of $18.0 billion, an increase of 27% compared with $14.2 billion in full-year 2009, and adjusted diluted EPS of $2.23, an increase of 10% compared with $2.02 in full-year 2009. Results were favorably impacted by revenues from legacy Wyeth products, and unfavorably impacted by expenses associated with the legacy Wyeth operations as well as lower revenues from legacy Pfizer products and, particularly in full-year 2010, higher net interest expense primarily due to borrowings used to partially fund the acquisition of Wyeth. For full-year 2010, results were favorably impacted by foreign exchange.
(1)
(1)
(1)
(1)
In addition, the effective tax rate on adjusted incomedecreased to approximately 26% in fourth-quarter 2010 compared with approximately 28% in fourth-quarter 2009, and was approximately 30% in both full-year 2010 and 2009. The decrease in the effective tax rate on adjusted income in fourth-quarter 2010 compared with fourth-quarter 2009was primarily due to the extension of the U.S. research and development credit signed into law in December 2010 and the change in the jurisdictional mix of earnings in the respective periods.
(1)
(1)
Additionally, adjusted diluted EPSin full-year 2010 was impacted by the increased number of shares outstanding in comparison with full-year 2009 resulting from shares issued to partially fund the Wyeth acquisition.
(1)
In fourth-quarter 2010, adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenues was 21.5% compared with 17.5% in fourth-quarter 2009. This increase primarily reflects the change in the mix of products and businesses as a result of the Wyeth acquisition. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenues was 20.7% in fourth-quarter 2010.
(1)
(1)
Adjusted SI&A expenses were $5.7 billion in fourth-quarter 2010, an increase of 7% compared with $5.3 billion in the prior-year quarter. This increase was attributable primarily to the legacy Wyeth operations. Foreign exchange decreased fourth-quarter 2010 adjusted SI&A expenses by $15 million compared with the year-ago quarter.
(1)
(1)
Adjusted R&D expenses were $2.8 billion in fourth-quarter 2010, essentially flat compared with the prior-year period. This was attributable primarily to cost reductions that were offset by legacy Wyeth operations and continued investment in the late-stage development portfolio. Foreign exchange decreased fourth-quarter 2010 adjusted R&D expenses by $9 million compared with the year-ago quarter.
(1)
(1)
Overall, foreign exchange increased adjusted total costs by $96 million, or 1%, in fourth-quarter 2010 compared with the prior-year.

Executive Commentary
Ian Read, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, I am pleased with our solid financial performance again this quarter and this year despite continued challenging market conditions. Pfizer has a strong asset base across various therapeutic areas and geographies in addition to a promising late-stage product pipeline, which I believe positions us well going forward.
After evaluating our operating plans and capital allocation opportunities, we have adjusted our 2012 revenue target to exclude the projected contribution from future business development transactions and have reallocated funding to support an attractive, near-term opportunity to significantly increase our share repurchase activity. As announced today, the Board has authorized an additional share repurchase program for up to $5 billion, which increases our total current authorization to $9 billion. During 2011, we anticipate repurchasing approximately $5 billion of our common stock, with the remaining authorized amount available in 2012 and beyond. These repurchases are not expected to constrain our ability to continue dividend increases or to pursue bolt-on acquisitions.
We continue to closely evaluate our global research and development function and will accelerate our current strategies to improve innovation and overall productivity. Key steps in this process include greater focus in disease areas of greatest scientific, medical and commercial opportunity, a realigned global R&D footprint to increase our presence in key biomedical innovation hubs, and an increased level of outsourcing for services that do not drive competitive advantage for Pfizer. Furthermore, we plan to enhance internal programs that are designed to strengthen pipeline delivery and differentiated innovation. As a result of these actions, we expect to reduce adjusted R&D expenses to between approximately $6.5 to $7.0 billion in 2012 compared with our previous target of $8.0 to $8.5 billion.
(1)
We believe that the planned increase in share repurchases and the decrease in research and development spending will serve to provide a greater degree of certainty and a more clearly defined path for us to achieve our 2012 adjusted diluted EPS target of between $2.25 and $2.35.
(1)
Mr. Read concluded, In addition, during 2011 we expect to complete our ongoing review of the composition of our business portfolio to determine the optimal mix of businesses that we can appropriately fund and manage in order to achieve consistent growth and maximum return on investment. We believe these decisions, taken together, will continue to improve our business profile and provide both near-term and longer-term financial benefit.
Frank DAmelio, Chief Financial Officer, stated, Our continued confidence in the business and our ability to meet our commitments and capitalize on near- to mid-term growth opportunities are clearly reflected in the achievement of our 2010 financial guidance, including our projected cost savings from the Wyeth integration, of which more than $2.0 billion was achieved in 2010, our 11% dividend increase announced in December 2010, our additional share repurchase program and recent business development transactions. Further, our 2011 financial guidance as well as our updated 2012 financial targets reflect our confidence to successfully navigate through challenging market conditions and significant events in the company, most notably the loss of exclusivity of Lipitor in many major markets later this year.
2011 Financial Guidance
(16)
For full-year 2011, Pfizers financial guidance, at current exchange rates, is summarized below.
(15)
2012 Financial Targets
(16)
As previously stated, given the longer-term nature of these targets, they are subject to greater variability and less certainty as a result of potential material impacts related to foreign exchange fluctuations, macroeconomic activity including inflation, and industry-specific challenges including changes to government healthcare policy, among others.
The Company is updating certain elements of its 2012 financial targets and is providing for the first time a target for adjusted SI&A expenses. At current exchange rates, Pfizer is now targeting reported revenues between $63.0 and $65.5 billion, compared with the previous target of between $65.2 and $67.7 billion. This decrease primarily reflects the elimination of the projected revenue contribution from future business development transactions previously included in the target as well as certain changes in market conditions. Additionally, adjusted R&D expenses are now expected to be between $6.5 and $7.0 billion, compared with the previous target of between $8.0 and $8.5 billion. Driving this decline is the planned reduction in the number of disease areas the Company will focus on based upon where the greatest medical and commercial impact can be achieved as well as a realigned R&D footprint, including a planned exit from the Sandwich, U.K. site, subject to customary requirements, shift of selected resources from Groton, CT to Cambridge, MA and outsourcing of certain functions. Additionally, the Company is planning to enhance its presence in Cambridge, MA to complement research teams in other hubs like San Francisco, New York, La Jolla and Cambridge, U.K. Further, adjusted other (income)/deductions are now expected to be approximately $1.0 billion in deductions, compared with the previous target of between $1.0 and $1.2 billion in deductions, and the effective tax rate on adjusted income is now targeted at approximately 29%, down from approximately 30%. All other elements of the 2012 financial targets remain unchanged, including adjusted operating marginin a range of the high 30%s to low 40%s, reported diluted EPS between $1.58 and $1.73, adjusted diluted EPSbetween $2.25 and $2.35, and operating cash flow of at least $19.0 billion. In addition, the Company is now providing a target range for adjusted SI&A expenses of between $17.5 and $18.5 billion.

The Company also remains on-track to achieve its cost-reduction target associated with the Wyeth acquisition of approximately $4 to $5 billion, by the end of 2012, at 2008 average foreign exchange rates, in comparison with the 2008 pro-forma adjusted total costs of the legacy Pfizer and legacy Wyeth operations. This cost-reduction target does not include the impact of the planned reduction in R&D spending announced today. In 2010, the Company met its target of achieving more than $2 billion of these cost reductions.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
1. Change in Reported Cost of Sales
Reported cost of sales increased 9% in fourth-quarter 2010 and increased 83% in full-year 2010, compared to the same periods in 2009. The fourth-quarter 2010 increase primarily reflects the inclusion of Wyeth manufacturing costs, and the change in the mix of products and businesses as a result of the Wyeth acquisition, for a full quarter in 2010 compared to a partial quarter in 2009. The full-year 2010 increase is primarily a result of the following:
higher purchase accounting adjustments associated with the Wyeth acquisition;
a $212 million write-off of Wyeth-related inventory in the third quarter of 2010 related to unfinished inventory acquired from Wyeth that became unusable after the acquisition date (which included a purchase accounting fair value adjustment of $104 million);
the inclusion of a full year of Wyeth manufacturing costs; and
the change in the mix of products and businesses as a result of the Wyeth acquisition.
Foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact of 3% on reported cost of sales in fourth-quarter 2010 and a minimal impact for full-year 2010.
Reported cost of sales as a percentage of revenues increased 0.6 percentage points to 24.4% in fourth-quarter 2010, compared to the same period in 2009, reflecting the aforementioned factors.
2. Change in Reported Selling, Informational & Administrative (SI&A) Expenses and Reported Research & Development (R&D) Expenses
Reported SI&A expenses increased 7% in fourth-quarter 2010 and 32% in full-year 2010, compared to the same periods in 2009. The increases primarily reflect the inclusion of Wyeth operating costs for the entire periods of 2010, compared to partial periods in 2009. Foreign exchange had a minimal impact on reported SI&A expenses in fourth-quarter 2010 and an unfavorable impact of 2% for full-year 2010.
Reported R&D expenses were flat in fourth-quarter 2010, compared to the same period in 2009, primarily due to cost reductions that were offset by legacy Wyeth operations and continued investment in the late-stage development portfolio. For full-year 2010, reported R&D expenses increased 20%, compared to full-year 2009, primarily due to the inclusion of legacy Wyeth operations for a full year in 2010 compared to a partial year in 2009, as well as continued investment in the late-stage development portfolio. Foreign exchange had a minimal impact on reported R&D expenses in both fourth-quarter 2010 and full-year 2010.
3. Other (Income)/Deductions - Net
4. Effective Tax Rate
Reported
The Company recorded tax benefits in fourth-quarter 2010 and 2009.
During the fourth quarter of 2010, we reached a settlement with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) related to issues we had appealed with respect to the audits of the Pfizer Inc. tax returns for the years 2002 through 2005, as well as the Pharmacia audit for the year 2003 through the date of merger with Pfizer (April 16, 2003). The IRS concluded its examination of the aforementioned tax years and issued a final Revenue Agents Report (RAR). The company has agreed with all of the adjustments and computations contained in the RAR. As a result of settling these audit years, we reduced our unrecognized tax benefits for fourth-quarter and full-year 2010 by approximately $1.4 billion and recorded a corresponding tax benefit. The fourth-quarter and full-year 2010 effective tax rates were also favorably impacted by approximately $600 million related to interest on these unrecognized tax benefits.
For fourth-quarter 2009, the effective tax rate on reported was favorably impacted by a tax benefit of $556 million related to the sale of one of our biopharmaceutical companies, Vicuron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., as well as the jurisdictional mix of certain expenses incurred in connection with the Wyeth acquisition.
Income from continuing operations before provision for taxes on income
The effectivetax rate on reported for full-year 2010 was 11.9% compared to 20.3% for full-year 2009. The lower tax rate in full-year 2010 is primarily the result of:
Income from continuing operations before provision for taxes on income
the aforementioned $1.4 billion reduction in unrecognized tax benefits and $600 million in interest on these unrecognized tax benefits, which were recorded as a result of the favorable tax audit settlement pertaining to prior years;
$460 million in tax benefits for the resolution of certain tax positions pertaining to prior years with various foreign tax authorities; and
the tax impact of the charge incurred for asbestos litigation;
partially offset by:
higher expenses, incurred as a result of our acquisition of Wyeth, and the mix of jurisdictions in which those expenses were incurred;
the write-off of the deferred tax asset of approximately $270 million related to the Medicare Part D subsidy for retiree prescription drug coverage, resulting from changes in the U.S. healthcare legislation enacted in March 2010 concerning the tax treatment of that subsidy effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2012; and
the non-recurrence of a tax benefit of $174 million that was recorded in the third quarter of 2009 related to the final resolution of a previously disclosed settlement that resulted in the receipt of information that raised our assessment of the likelihood of prevailing on the technical merits of our tax position, and the non-recurrence of the aforementioned $556 million tax benefit that was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2009.
Adjusted
The effective tax rate on adjusted income decreased to 26.0% in fourth-quarter 2010 compared to 28.3% in fourth-quarter 2009, as a result of the extension of the U.S. research and development credit which was signed into law on December 17, 2010 as well as the change in the jurisdictional mix of earnings.
(1)
The effective tax rate on adjusted income was 29.8% in full-year 2010 compared to 29.5% in full-year 2009. In addition to the aforementioned factors, the effective tax rate on adjusted income for full-year 2010 was impacted by the write-off of the deferred tax asset of approximately $270 million related to the Medicare Part D subsidy for retiree prescription drug coverage, resulting from changes in the U.S. healthcare legislation enacted in March 2010 concerning the tax treatment of that subsidy effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2012, offset by $460 million in tax benefits for the resolution of certain tax positions pertaining to prior years with various foreign tax authorities.
