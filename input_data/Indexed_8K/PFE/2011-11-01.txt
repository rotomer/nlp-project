NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--November 1, 2011--Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE):
Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) today reported financial results for third-quarter 2011. Third-quarter 2011 revenues were $17.2 billion, an increase of 7% compared with the year-ago quarter, which reflects operational growth of $247 million, or 1%, and the favorable impact of foreign exchange of $951 million, or 6%.
For third-quarter 2011, U.S. revenues were $6.9 billion, a decrease of 3% compared with the year-ago quarter. International revenues were $10.3 billion, an increase of 15% compared with the prior-year quarter, which reflected 4% operational growth and an 11% favorable impact of foreign exchange. U.S. revenues represented 40% of total revenues in third-quarter 2011 compared with 44% in the year-ago quarter, while international revenues represented 60% of total revenues in third-quarter 2011 compared with 56% in the year-ago quarter.
See end of text prior to tables for notes.
Business Highlights
Primary Care unit revenues in third-quarter 2011 were favorably impacted primarily by foreign exchange, growth from Lipitor in the U.S. and from Celebrex, Lyrica, Pristiq and Spiriva, among others, and the addition of $119 million, or 2%, from legacy King products, while negatively impacted by the loss of exclusivity of Aricept in the U.S. in November 2010 as well as the loss of exclusivity of Lipitor in Canada and Spain in May and July 2010, respectively. Taken together, these losses of exclusivity reduced Primary Care unit revenues by $415 million, or 7%, in comparison with third-quarter 2010.
(5)
(5)
Specialty Care unit revenues were positively impacted by foreign exchange and strong growth in the Prevenar franchise and Enbrel in most international markets. Prevnar 13 revenues in the U.S. were lower than in third-quarter 2010 as fewer patients received the Prevnar 13 catch-up dose as the timeframe for eligibility has nearly expired. Specialty Care unit revenues were also negatively impacted by the loss of exclusivity of Vfend and Xalatan in the U.S. in February and March 2011, respectively. Collectively, these losses of exclusivity reduced Specialty Care unit revenues by $214 million, or 6%, in comparison with third-quarter 2010.
(6)
(6)
(6)
Emerging Markets unit revenues were positively impacted by foreign exchange and growth in certain key innovative brands, primarily the Prevenar franchise, Celebrex, Enbrel, Lyrica, Vfend and Zyvox, notably with double-digit operational growth in China, Russia, Turkey and India. Revenues were negatively impacted by the loss of exclusivity of Lipitor in Brazil and Mexico in August and December 2010, respectively. These losses of exclusivity reduced Emerging Markets unit revenues by $30 million, or 1%, in comparison with third-quarter 2010.
(7)
(7)
Established Products unit revenues were mainly impacted by the loss of exclusivity of Protonix and Zosyn in the U.S., which taken together reduced Established Products unit revenues by $242 million, or 11%, in comparison with third-quarter 2010. This decline was more than offset by $144 million, or 7%, from the addition of legacy King products, as well as foreign exchange. Total revenues from established products in both the Established Products and Emerging Markets units were $3.2 billion, with $996 million generated in emerging markets.
(8)
(8)
(8)
(7)
Animal Healthunit revenues increased by 21%, in comparison with the same quarter last year, reflecting the positive operational impact of $90 million, or 10%, due to the addition of legacy King products, as well as the favorable conditions in global livestock markets and foreign exchange. The Consumer Healthcare unit generated revenue growth of 15% in comparison with third-quarter 2010, primarily driven by the non-recurrence of the voluntary withdrawal of Centrum temporarily in Europe in third-quarter 2010, the U.S. launch of new dietary supplements in third-quarter 2011, as well as foreign exchange. Nutrition unit revenues increased 31% in comparison with the same quarter last year, primarily in China and the Middle East, from increased demand for premium products and from new product launches, in addition to foreign exchange.

See end of text prior to tables for notes.
Adjusted total costs were $9.9 billion in third-quarter 2011, an increase of 3% compared with $9.6 billion in third-quarter 2010. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of $541 million, or 6%, adjusted total costs decreased 3%, primarily reflecting the benefit of cost-reduction and productivity initiatives, particularly in the research and development function. Savings were also generated in third-quarter 2011 by reductions in the U.S. field force and declines in promotional spending in response to product losses of exclusivity. These savings were partially offset by the addition of costs from legacy King operations and the inclusion of the annual U.S. healthcare reform fee.
(14)
(14)
The effective tax rate on adjusted incomewas approximately 31% in third-quarter 2011 compared with approximately 30% in third-quarter 2010. The increase was primarily due to the change in the jurisdictional mix of earnings, partially offset by the extension of the U.S. research and development credit that was signed into law in December 2010.
(1)
The diluted weighted-average shares outstanding for third-quarter 2011 was 7.8 billion shares, a reduction of approximately 247 million shares compared with third-quarter 2010, primarily due to the Companys ongoing share repurchase program.
As a result of the aforementioned factors, third-quarter 2011 adjusted income was $4.8 billion, an increase of 11% compared with $4.4 billion in the year-ago quarter, and adjusted diluted EPS was $0.62, an increase of 15% compared with $0.54 in the year-ago quarter.

Highlights
In addition to the aforementioned factors, third-quarter 2011 reported earnings in comparison with third-quarter 2010 reported earnings were favorably impacted by a $1.3 billion (after-tax) gain on the sale of Capsugel in third-quarter 2011, as well as the non-recurrence of impairment charges of $1.5 billion (pre-tax) related to certain intangible assets acquired in connection with the Wyeth acquisition and a $701 million (pre-tax) charge for asbestos litigation related to our wholly owned subsidiary, Quigley Company, Inc., both in third-quarter 2010. Third-quarter 2011 reported earnings were negatively impacted compared with the same period last year by higher charges associated with cost-reduction and productivity initiatives.
(3)
The effective tax rate on reported results was approximately 34% in third-quarter 2011 compared with approximately 39% in third-quarter 2010. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the previously mentioned extension of the U.S. research and development credit and the change in the jurisdictional mix of earnings, as well as the decrease and jurisdictional mix of the aforementioned impairment charges.
As a result of all these factors, third-quarter 2011 reported net income was $3.7 billion, compared with $866 million in the prior-year quarter, and reported diluted EPS was $0.48, compared with $0.11 in the prior-year quarter.

Executive Commentary
Ian Read, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, Overall, I am very pleased with our financial performance despite the impact of product losses of exclusivity totaling approximately $950 million this quarter and the challenges posed by current global market and economic conditions. Excluding the impact of product losses of exclusivity, all of our businesses generated revenue growth while effectively managing their cost structures. Notably, in our Emerging Markets business, I am pleased that both our innovative and established product portfolios continued to perform well, largely as a result of our targeted investments despite a volatile environment. Further, in Japan, our second largest market, we generated 19% operational growth enterprise-wide. I am also happy with the strong performance of the Lipitor franchise and our ability to continue to maximize the value of this brand prior to its loss of exclusivity in the U.S. We remain well prepared for the Lipitor U.S. loss of exclusivity later this month and in various other countries shortly thereafter.
I am excited by the potential opportunity for Xalkori, recently launched in U.S. specialty pharmacies for the treatment of ALK-positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer, and Prevnar 13/Prevenar 13, recently approved in the European Union for the prevention of invasive pneumococcal disease in adults aged 50 years and older. Additionally, we have several compounds in our late-stage pipeline, notably Eliquis for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation, tofacitinib in rheumatoid arthritis and axitinib in advanced renal cell carcinoma, among others. Each of these opportunities represents a potential valuable, new treatment option for patients in need, Mr. Read continued.
Frank DAmelio, Chief Financial Officer, stated, Given our solid performance so far this year, our continued confidence in the business within the current environment and our financial flexibility, we are narrowing the range of many of our 2011 financial guidance components and reaffirming our 2012 financial targets. Notably, we are increasing our 2011 adjusted diluted EPS guidance range, resulting in an updated range of $2.24 to $2.29. Additionally, we returned approximately $3.6 billion to our shareholders during the quarter through $1.5 billion in dividends and $2.1 billion from the repurchase of 112.9 million shares. So far in 2011, we have repurchased $6.5 billion, or 331.6 million of our shares, and we now anticipate repurchasing between $7 billion and $9 billion of our common stock this year. In total, we have returned approximately $11.2 billion to our shareholders this year through dividends and share repurchases.

(1) "Adjusted Income" and its components and "Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share (EPS)" are defined as reported net income and its components and reported diluted EPS excluding purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition-related costs, discontinued operations and certain significant items. Adjusted Cost of Sales, Adjusted Selling, Informational and Administrative (SI&A) expenses, Adjusted Research and Development (R&D) expenses and Adjusted Other (Income)/Deductions are income statement line items prepared on the same basis, and, therefore, components of the overall adjusted income measure. As described under in the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of Pfizer's Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended July 3, 2011, management uses adjusted income, among other factors, to set performance goals and to measure the performance of the overall company. We believe that investors' understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing this measure. Reconciliations of third-quarter 2011 and 2010 and the first nine months of 2011 and 2010 adjusted income and its components and adjusted diluted EPS to reported net income and its components and reported diluted EPS, as well as reconciliations of full-year 2011 guidance and 2012 targets for adjusted income and adjusted diluted EPS to full-year 2011 guidance and 2012 targets for reported net income and reported diluted EPS, are provided in the materials accompanying this report. The adjusted income and its components and adjusted diluted EPS measures are not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) net income and its components and diluted EPS.

(4) In all periods presented, the results from the Capsugel business are reflected in a single line, until the completion of the sale on August 1, 2011. Additionally, due to the acquisition of King Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (King), legacy King operations are reflected in the 2011 results beginning January 31, 2011. Therefore, in accordance with Pfizers domestic and international reporting periods, the results for the first nine months of 2011 reflect approximately eight months of Kings U.S. operations and approximately seven months of Kings international operations. Legacy King operations are not reflected in the results for the first nine months of 2010.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
1. Change in Reported Cost of Sales
Reported cost of sales decreased 3% in third-quarter 2011 and 4% in the first nine months of 2011, compared to the same periods in 2010. The decreases are due to lower purchase accounting adjustments and lower inventory write-offs in 2011, as well as savings associated with our cost-reduction and productivity initiatives, partially offset by the addition of Kings manufacturing operations and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of 8% in third-quarter 2011 and 7% in the first nine months of 2011.
Reported cost of sales as a percentage of revenues decreased 2.3 percentage points to 21.4% in third-quarter 2011, compared to the same period in 2010, reflecting the aforementioned factors.
2. Change in Reported Selling, Informational & Administrative (SI&A) Expenses and Reported Research & Development (R&D) Expenses
Reported SI&A expenses were largely unchanged in third-quarter 2011 and increased 2% in the first nine months of 2011, compared to the same periods in 2010. Both periods were unfavorably impacted by the annual fee provided for under the 2010 U.S. healthcare reform legislation beginning this year and the addition of legacy King operating costs, and favorably impacted by savings associated with our cost-reduction and productivity initiatives. In addition, the third quarter and first nine months of 2011 were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of 5% and 3%, respectively.
Reported R&D expenses were largely unchanged in third-quarter 2011 and decreased 1% in the first nine months of 2011, compared to the same periods in 2010. Both periods were favorably impacted by savings associated with our cost-reduction and productivity initiatives, and unfavorably impacted by higher charges related to those initiatives, the addition of legacy King expenses and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of 2% in both periods.
3. Other (Income)/Deductions  Net
(a) Interest income increased in both periods of 2011 due to higher cash balances and higher interest rates earned on investments. Interest expense decreased in both periods of 2011 due to lower long- and short-term debt balances and the conversion of some fixed-rate liabilities to floating-rate liabilities.
(b) In the first nine months of 2011, primarily relates to charges for hormone-replacement therapy litigation. In both periods of 2010, primarily includes a charge for asbestos litigation related to our wholly owned subsidiary, Quigley Company, Inc.
(c) In 2011 and 2010, primarily relates to certain Wyeth assets, including in-process research and development (IPR&D) intangible assets.
4. Effective Tax Rate
Reported
The effectivetax rate on reported for third-quarter 2011 was 33.7% compared to 39.5% for third-quarter 2010, and in the first nine months of 2011 was 30.8% compared to 37.3% in the first nine months of 2010. The decreases in the effective tax rate were primarily due to:
Income from continuing operations before provision for taxes on income
the extension of the U.S. research and development credit, which was signed into law on December 17, 2010;
the decrease and jurisdictional mix of certain impairment charges related to assets acquired in connection with the Wyeth acquisition; and
the change in the jurisdictional mix of earnings.
Adjusted
The effective tax rate on adjusted income for third quarter 2011 was 30.9% compared to 30.2% in third-quarter 2010 primarily due to the change in the jurisdictional mix of earnings partially offset by the extension of the U.S. research and development credit, and in the first nine months of 2011 was 29.3% compared to 30.7% in the first nine months of 2010 primarily as a result of the extension of the U.S. research and development credit and the change in the jurisdictional mix of earnings.
