REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE Investors have asked for additional information regarding Principal Financial Group, Inc.'s exposure to investments in the airline industry, as well as Realized Capital Gains and Losses. In order for investors to better understand these two subjects, we are providing the following information: 1. Total airline industry holdings as of March 31, 2003 were $463 million in book value. Of that, $115 million relates to Southwest Airlines and Federal Express, two high quality companies. Approximately half of the remaining exposure is invested in Enhanced Equipment Trust Certificates, which are of a higher quality. There has been no material change in the amount of our airline exposure since December 31, 2002. 2. Exhibit 99.1, attached, shows our Realized Capital Gains and Losses (including unrealized gains and losses on derivatives and seed money) for various reporting periods, including the three months ended March 31, 2003. The format is essentially the same as the required footnote contained in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2002, filed by the company with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
