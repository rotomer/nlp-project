UPDATES EARNINGS GUIDANCE Des Moines, IA (December 15, 2003) -- Principal Financial Group, Inc. (NYSE: PFG) today announced the company intends to take a write-down of its mortgage servicing rights asset (MSR) in fourth quarter 2003. The impact on net income and operating earnings is expected to range from $70 to $110 million after tax, or 22 cents to 34 cents per diluted share. "Our mortgage banking business is strongly focused on the servicing of loans, so determining the value of our MSR is of critical importance to us. We are very disciplined in our approach and committed to our valuation philosophy," said John Aschenbrenner, President, Insurance and Financial Services. "We are highly confident our model reflects the economic value of the asset," said Aschenbrenner. "However, generally accepted accounting principles require mortgage servicing rights to be carried at market value and market valuations of MSRs are not precise in an environment like the current one, where there have been limited sales to use as comparables. "Because assessing market value is difficult, we conducted a thorough review of external market measures, with the help of additional independent valuation experts. Based on our review, we will take a write-down to the mortgage servicing rights during the fourth quarter to bring it more in line with currently available external indicators of market value." Aside from the impact of the write-down, previous net income and operating earnings guidance for fourth quarter 2003 remains unchanged for Principal Financial Group, Inc. 2004 guidance remains unchanged for Principal Financial Group, Inc.
