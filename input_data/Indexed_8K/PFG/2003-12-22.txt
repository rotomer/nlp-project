Principal Blueprint Investment Alert Exhibit 99 THIS COMMUNICATION WAS PREPARED THROUGH THE JOINT EFFORTS OF THE INVESTMENT SERVICES DEPARTMENT OF PRINCIPAL LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY AND PRINCIPAL MANAGEMENT CORPORATION AS PART OF THEIR DUE DILIGENCE PROCESS. Additional Update on Market Timing and Late Trading Issues In our Investment Alert dated October 31, 2003, we told you that The Principal was conducting an extensive voluntary review of its practices, including employees' individual trading records. This review dated back to October 1996. The Principal took its review beyond mutual funds, broadening it to include its entire block of 401(k) separate accounts. We have now completed the review and found the following: o The Principal has not permitted any late trading. o The Principal has not entered into any special arrangements to permit select investors to engage in market timing. o The Principal has not engaged in any "portfolio peeking", the practice of allowing some investors access to portfolio information not generally available to the investing public. o Beginning in late 2000 The Principal imposed progressively more robust standards and protections to further prevent improper market timing. These standards and practices have been applied consistently to customers as well as The Principal's own employees in The Principal 401(k) Plan. o Some employees engaged in market timing trades within their personal accounts, predominantly in our international 401(k) separate accounts. The majority of these employees are no longer with the firm. Included in this group are two portfolio managers who engaged in this activity in their personal accounts within the funds they managed. They are no longer with the firm. The vast majority of this activity took place between 1998 and 2000. No market timing activity by portfolio managers has occurred since 2000. o Investment gains by employees related to mutual funds were $4,600. In addition, investment gains by employees related to our 401(k) separate accounts were $175,000. Restitution will be made to all impacted funds. Repayment methodology will be determined with the assistance of an independent advisor. The Principal will further enhance its practices by: o Implementing an additional valuation service for global equities in the first quarter of 2004. This service will further reduce the arbitrage opportunity for market timers. o Increasing education of employees of The Principal about market timing. o Implementing other tools, such as increased redemption fees on mutual funds, as needed. J. Barry Griswell, chairman, president and CEO of the Principal Financial Group, made the following comment with regard to the review: "WE TAKE OUR RESPONSIBILITY FOR INVESTMENT STEWARDSHIP EXTREMELY SERIOUSLY.
