The foregoing opinion and statement may be qualified by a statement to the effect that such counsel does not assume any responsibility for the 16
accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement or either Final Prospectus. (d) Karen E.

There is no pending or, to the knowledge of such counsel after due inquiry, threatened action, suit, proceeding or investigation that could reasonably be expected to lead to the revocation, termination, suspension or limitation of any such Approval or otherwise impose any limitation on the conduct of business of any Insurance Entity, the revocation, termination or suspension of which would have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, and, to the knowledge of such counsel after due inquiry, no insurance or regulatory agency or body has issued any order or decree impairing, restricting or prohibiting the payment of dividends by any Insurance Entity. Except as otherwise described in each of the Final Prospectuses, none of the Insurance Entities has received any notification from any applicable regulatory authority to the effect that any additional Approvals from such regulatory authority are needed to be obtained by such Insurance Entity in any case where it could be reasonably expected that (i) any of the Insurance Entities would in fact be required either to obtain any such additional Approvals or cease or otherwise limit engaging in certain business and (ii) the failure to have such Approvals or limiting such business would have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

(xii) Except as described in the Final Prospectuses, to the best of such counsel's knowledge, there are no contracts, agreements or understandings between the Company and any person granting such person the right to require the Company to file a registration statement under the Securities Act with respect to any securities of the Company owned or to be owned by such person or to require the Company to include such securities in the securities registered 20

the judgment of the Representative, so material and adverse as to make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Preferred Stock being delivered on the Delivery Date on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Final Prospectuses. (j) Subsequent to the execution and delivery of this Agreement there shall not have occurred any of the following: (i) trading of any securities of or guaranteed by the Company shall have been suspended on any exchange or in any over-the-counter market, (ii) trading in securities on the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange, and the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., shall have been generally suspended, or there shall have been a material disruption in settlement of securities generally, (iii) minimum or maximum ranges for prices shall have been generally established on the New York Stock Exchange by the Commission or by the New York Stock Exchange, (iv) a general banking moratorium shall have been declared by federal or New York State authorities, (v) any major disruption of settlements of securities or clearance services in the United States, or (vi) any outbreak or escalation of major hostilities in which the United States is involved, any declaration of war by the United States Congress or any other substantial national or international calamity, crisis or emergency (including, without limitation, acts of terrorism) affecting the United States, in any such case provided for in clauses (i) through (vi), as to make it, in the judgment of the Representative, impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or delivery of the Preferred Stock being delivered on the Delivery Date on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Final Prospectuses. (k) On or after the date of this Agreement, (i) no downgrading shall have occurred in the rating accorded the Company's debt securities or the debt securities of any of its Significant Subsidiaries (including any "surplus notes" of PLIC) or PLIC's claims paying ability or financial strength by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization", as such term is defined in Rule 436(g)(2) of the Rules, (ii) no such organization shall have publicly announced that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, its rating of any of the Company's debt securities or the debt securities of any of its Significant Subsidiaries (including any "surplus notes" of PLIC) or PLIC's claims paying ability or financial strength and (iii) the Preferred Stock shall continue to be rated BBB by Standard & Poor's and Baa2 by Moody's. (l) No Underwriter shall have discovered and disclosed to the Company on or prior to the Delivery Date that the Registration Statement or the Final Prospectuses or any amendment or supplement thereto contains an untrue statement of a fact which, in the reasonable opinion of Sullivan & Cromwell LLP, counsel for the Underwriters, is material or omits to state a fact which, in the reasonable opinion of such counsel, is material and is required to be stated therein or is necessary to make the statements therein not misleading. 23
All opinions, letters, evidence and certificates mentioned above or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be deemed to be in compliance with the provisions hereof only if they are in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to counsel for the Underwriters. SECTION 8. Indemnification and Contribution. (a) The Company shall indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, its directors, officers and employees and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act, from and against any loss, claim, damage or liability, joint or several, or any action in respect thereof (including, but not limited to, any loss, claim, damage, liability or action relating to purchases and sales of Preferred Stock), to which that Underwriter, director, officer, employee or controlling person may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such loss, claim, damage, liability or action arises out of, or is based upon, any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, any Interim Prospectus or either Final Prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto or the omission or alleged omission to state in the Registration Statement, any Interim Prospectus or either Final Prospectus, or in any amendment or supplement thereto, any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and shall reimburse each Underwriter and each such director, officer, employee or controlling person promptly upon demand for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by that Underwriter, director, officer, employee or controlling person in connection with investigating or defending or preparing to defend against any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action arises out of, or is based upon, any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in the Registration Statement, any Interim Prospectus or either Final Prospectus, or in any such amendment or supplement, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information concerning such Underwriter furnished to the Company through the Representative by or on behalf of any Underwriter specifically for inclusion therein which information consists solely of the information specified in Section 8(e). The foregoing indemnity agreement is in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have to any Underwriter or to any director, officer, employee or controlling person of that Underwriter. (b) Each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its officers and employees, each of its directors, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act, from and against any loss, claim, damage or liability, joint or several, or any action in respect thereof, to which the Company or any such director, officer or controlling person may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such loss, claim, damage, liability or action arises out of, or is based upon, (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, any Interim Prospectus or either Final Prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto, or (ii) the omission or alleged omission to state in the Registration Statement, any Interim 24
Prospectus or either Final Prospectus, or in any amendment or supplement thereto, any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, but in each case only to the extent that the untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information concerning such Underwriter furnished to the Company through the Representative by or on behalf of that Underwriter specifically for inclusion therein, which information is limited to the information set forth in Section 8(e), and shall reimburse the Company and any such director, officer or controlling person for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company or any such director, officer or controlling person in connection with investigating or defending or preparing to defend against any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred. The foregoing indemnity agreement is in addition to any liability which any Underwriter may otherwise have to the Company or any such director, officer, employee or controlling person. (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 8 of notice of any claim or the commencement of any action, the indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 8, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the claim or the commencement of that action; provided, however, that the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have under this Section 8(a) or (b) except to the extent it has been materially prejudiced by such failure and, provided further, that the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to an indemnified party otherwise than under this Section 8(a) or (b). If any such claim or action shall be brought against an indemnified party, and it shall notify the indemnifying party thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it wishes, jointly with any other similarly notified indemnifying party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party). After notice from the indemnifying party to the indemnified party of its election to assume the defense of such claim or action, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to the indemnified party under this Section 8 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. No indemnifying party shall without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding, and (ii) does not include a statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party. 25
(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 shall for any reason be unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under Section 8(a) or 8(b) in respect of any loss, claim, damage or liability, or any action in respect thereof, referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof, (i) in such proportion as shall be appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Preferred Stock or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other with respect to the statements or omissions which resulted in such loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other with respect to such offering shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Preferred Stock purchased under this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company, on the one hand, and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters with respect to the shares of the Preferred Stock purchased under this Agreement, on the other hand, bear to the total gross proceeds from the offering of the shares of the Preferred Stock under this Agreement, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover pages of the Final Prospectuses. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Underwriters, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this Section were to be determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to herein. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof, referred to above in this Section shall be deemed to include, for purposes of this Section 8(d), any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8(d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the shares of Preferred Stock underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise paid or become liable to pay by reason of any untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute as provided in this Section 8(d) are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint. 26
(e) The Underwriters severally confirm and the Company acknowledges that the statements with respect to the public offering of the Preferred Stock by the Underwriters set forth on the cover page of and the concession and reallowance figures appearing under the caption "Underwriting" in, the Prospectus are correct and constitute the only information concerning such Underwriters furnished in writing to the Company by or on behalf of the Underwriters specifically for inclusion in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectuses. SECTION 9. Defaulting Underwriters. If, on the Delivery Date, any Underwriter defaults in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, the remaining non-defaulting Underwriters shall be obligated to purchase the Preferred Stock which the defaulting Underwriter agreed but failed to purchase on the Delivery Date in the respective proportions which the number of shares of the Preferred Stock set opposite the name of each remaining non-defaulting Underwriter in Schedule I hereto bears to the total number of shares of the Preferred Stock set opposite the names of all the remaining non-defaulting Underwriters in Schedule I hereto; provided, however, that the remaining non-defaulting Underwriters shall not be obligated to purchase any of the Preferred Stock on the Delivery Date if the total number of shares of the Preferred Stock which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase on such date exceeds 9.09% of the total number of shares of the Preferred Stock to be purchased on the Delivery Date, and any remaining non-defaulting Underwriter shall not be obligated to purchase more than 110% of the number of shares of the Preferred Stock which it agreed to purchase on the Delivery Date pursuant to the terms of Section 2. If the foregoing maximums are exceeded, the remaining non-defaulting Underwriters, or those other underwriters satisfactory to the Representative who so agree, shall have the right, but shall not be obligated, to purchase, in such proportion as may be agreed upon among them, all the Preferred Stock to be purchased on the Delivery Date. If the remaining Underwriters or other underwriters satisfactory to the Representative do not elect to purchase the shares which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase on the Delivery Date, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except that the Company will continue to be liable for the payment of expenses to the extent set forth in Sections 6 and 11. As used in this Agreement, the term "Underwriter" includes, for all purposes of this Agreement unless the context requires otherwise, any party not listed in Schedule I hereto who, pursuant to this Section 9, purchases Preferred Stock which a defaulting Underwriter agreed but failed to purchase. Nothing contained herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter of any liability it may have to the Company for damages caused by its default. If other Underwriters are obligated or agree to purchase the Preferred Stock of a defaulting or withdrawing Underwriter, either the Representative or the Company may postpone the Delivery Date for up to seven full business days in order to effect any changes that in the opinion of 27
counsel for the Company or counsel for the Underwriters may be necessary in the Registration Statement, the Final Prospectuses or in any other document or arrangement. SECTION 10. Termination. The obligations of the Underwriters hereunder may be terminated by the Representative by notice given to and received by the Company prior to delivery of and payment for the Preferred Stock if, prior to that time, any of the events described in Sections 7(i), 7(j) or 7(k), shall have occurred or if the Underwriters shall decline to purchase the Preferred Stock for any reason permitted under this Agreement. SECTION 11. Reimbursement of Underwriters' Expenses. If the Company shall fail to tender the Preferred Stock for delivery to the Underwriters by reason of any failure, refusal or inability on the part of the Company to perform any agreement on its part to be performed, or because any other condition of the Underwriters' obligations hereunder required to be fulfilled by the Company is not fulfilled, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including fees and disbursements of counsel) incurred by the Underwriters in connection with this Agreement and the proposed purchase of the Preferred Stock, and upon demand the Company shall pay the full amount thereof to the Representative. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to SECTION 9 by reason of the default of one or more Underwriters, the Company shall not be obligated to reimburse any defaulting Underwriter on account of those expenses. SECTION 12. Notices, Etc. All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing, and: (a) if to the Underwriters, shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to Lehman Brothers Inc., 745 Seventh Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10019, Attention: Syndicate Registration Department, Fax (212) 526-0943, with a copy, in the case of any notice pursuant to Section 8(c), to the Director of Litigation, Office of the General Counsel, Lehman Brothers Inc., 399 Park Avenue, 15th Floor, New York, NY 10022; (b) if to the Company, shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the address of the Company set forth in the Registration Statement, Attention: General Counsel (Fax: 515-235-9852); provided, however, that any notice to an Underwriter pursuant to Section 8(c) shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to such Underwriter at its address set forth in its acceptance telex to the Representative, which address will be supplied to any other party hereto by the Representative upon request. Any such statements, requests, notices or agreements shall take effect at the time of receipt thereof. The Company shall be entitled to act and rely upon any request, consent, notice or agreement given or made on behalf of the Underwriters by Lehman Brothers Inc. on behalf of the Representative. SECTION 13. Persons Entitled to Benefit of Agreement. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the Underwriters, the Company, and their respective successors. This Agreement and the terms and provisions hereof are for the sole benefit of only those persons, except that (A) the representations, warranties, indemnities and 28
agreements of the Company contained in this Agreement shall also be deemed to be for the benefit of the directors, officers and the person or persons, if any, who control any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act and (B) the indemnity agreement of the Underwriters contained in Section 8(b) of this Agreement shall be deemed to be for the benefit of directors of the Company, officers of the Company who have signed the Registration Statement and any person controlling the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act. Nothing in this Agreement is intended or shall be construed to give any person, other than the persons referred to in this Section 13, any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this Agreement or any provision contained herein. SECTION 14. Survival. The respective indemnities, representations, warranties and agreements of the Company and the Underwriters contained in this Agreement or made by or on behalf on them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall survive the delivery of and payment for the Preferred Stock and shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any of them or any person controlling any of them. SECTION 15. Definition of the Terms "Business Day" and "Subsidiary". For purposes of this Agreement, (a) "business day" means each Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or Friday which is not a day on which banking institutions in New York are generally authorized or obligated by law or executive order to close and (b) "subsidiary" has the meaning set forth in Rule 405 of the Rules. SECTION 16. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of New York. SECTION 17. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts and, if executed in more than one counterpart, the executed counterparts shall each be deemed to be an original but all such counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument. SECTION 18. Headings. The headings herein are inserted for convenience of reference only and are not intended to be part of, or to affect the meaning or interpretation of, this Agreement. 29

At each annual meeting of stockholders of the Corporation, the date of which will be fixed pursuant to the By-Laws of the Corporation, and subject to the rights of the holders of shares of any class or series of Preferred Stock, the successors of the class of Directors whose term expires at that meeting shall be elected to hold office for a term expiring at the annual meeting of stockholders held in the third year following the year of their election. Section 2. Director Discretion. In determining what he or she reasonably believes to be in the best interests of the Corporation in the performance of his or her duties as a director, a Director may consider, to the extent permitted by law, both in the consideration of tender and exchange offers, mergers, consolidations and sales of all or substantially all of the Corporation's assets and otherwise, such factors as the Board of Directors determines to be relevant, including without limitation: (a) the interests of the policyholders of the Corporation's subsidiaries; (b) the long-term and short-term interests of the Corporation and its stockholders, including the possibility that the interests may be best served by the continued independence of the Corporation; (c) whether the proposed transaction might violate state or federal laws; (d) if applicable, not only the consideration being offered in a proposed transaction, in relation to the then current market price for the outstanding capital stock of the Corporation over a period of years, the estimated price that might be achieved in a negotiated sale of the Corporation as a whole or in part through orderly liquidation, the premiums over market price for 5
the securities of other corporations in similar transactions, current political, economic and other factors bearing on securities prices and the Corporation's financial condition and future prospects; and (e) the interests of the Corporation's employees, suppliers, creditors and customers, the economy of the state, region and nation, and community and societal considerations. In connection with any such evaluation, the Board of Directors is authorized to conduct such investigations and to engage in such legal proceedings as the Board of Directors may determine. Section 3. Management of Business. The following provisions are inserted for the management of the business and for the conduct of the affairs of the Corporation and for the purpose of creating, defining, limiting and regulating the powers of the Corporation and its Directors and stockholders: (a) Subject to the rights of any holders of any series of Preferred Stock, if any, to elect additional Directors under specified circumstances, the holders of a majority of the combined voting power of the then outstanding stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of Directors may remove any Director or the entire Board of Directors, but only for cause.

may adopt, amend, alter or repeal any provision of the By-Laws upon the affirmative vote of the holders of three-fourths (3/4) or more of the combined voting power of the then outstanding stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of Directors. ARTICLE VI LIABILITY OF DIRECTORS Section 1. General. No Director of the Corporation shall be liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of his or her fiduciary duty as a Director, except to the extent that such exemption from liability or limitation thereof is not permitted under the Delaware General Corporation Law as currently in effect or as the same may hereafter be amended. Section 2. Repeal or Modification. Any repeal or modification of this Article VI by the stockholders of the Corporation shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a Director, officer or the Corporation existing at the time of such repeal or modification. If the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware is amended after the filing of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to authorize corporate action further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of Directors, then the liability of a Director of the Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as so amended. ARTICLE VII NO STOCKHOLDER ACTIONS BY WRITTEN CONSENT Effective as of the time the Common Stock shall be registered pursuant to the provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, any action required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders of the Corporation must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation, and the ability of the stockholders to consent in writing to the taking of any action is specifically denied.

The annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation for the election of Directors and for the transaction of such other business as properly may come before such meeting shall be held at such place, either within or without the State of Delaware, or, within the sole discretion of the Board of Directors, by remote electronic communication technologies and at such date and at such time, as may be fixed from time to time by resolution of the Board of Directors and set forth in the notice or waiver of notice of the meeting. Section 1.02. Special Meetings. Special meetings of the stockholders may be called at any time by the Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer (or, in the event of his or her absence or disability, by the President or any Executive Vice President), or by the Board of Directors. A special meeting shall be called by the Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer (or, in the event of his or her absence or disability, by the President or any Executive Vice President), or by the Secretary of the Corporation pursuant to a resolution approved by a majority of the entire Board of Directors. Such special meetings of the stockholders shall be held at such places, within or without the State of Delaware, or, within the sole discretion of the Board of Directors, by remote electronic communication technologies, as shall be specified in the respective notices or waivers of notice thereof. Any power of the stockholders of the Corporation to call a special meeting is specifically denied. Section 1.03. Notice of Meetings; Waiver. (a) The Secretary of the Corporation or any Assistant Secretary shall cause written notice of the place, if any, date and hour of each meeting of the stockholders, and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which such meeting is called, and the means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxyholders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such meeting, to be given personally by mail or by electronic transmission, not fewer than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days prior to the meeting, to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at
such meeting. If such notice is mailed, it shall be deemed to have been given personally to a stockholder when deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, directed to the stockholder at his or her address as it appears on the record of stockholders of the Corporation, or, if a stockholder shall have filed with the Secretary of the Corporation a written request that notices to such stockholder be mailed to some other address, then directed to such stockholder at such other address. Such further notice shall be given as may be required by law. (b) A written waiver of any notice of any annual or special meeting signed by the person entitled thereto, or a waiver by electronic transmission by the person entitled to notice, shall be deemed equivalent to notice. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any annual or special meeting of the stockholders need be specified in a written waiver of notice. Attendance of a stockholder at a meeting of stockholders shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the stockholder attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business on the ground that the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. (c) For notice given by electronic transmission to a stockholder to be effective, such stockholder must consent to the Corporation's giving notice by that particular form of electronic transmission. A stockholder may revoke consent to receive notice by electronic transmission by written notice to the Corporation. A stockholder's consent to notice by electronic transmission is automatically revoked if the Corporation is unable to deliver two consecutive electronic transmission notices and such inability becomes known to the Secretary of the Corporation, any Assistant Secretary, the transfer agent or other person responsible for giving notice. (d) Notices are deemed given (i) if by facsimile, when faxed to a number where the stockholder has consented to receive notice; (ii) if by electronic mail, when mailed electronically to an electronic mail address at which the stockholder has consented to receive such notice; (iii) if by posting on an electronic network (such as a website or chatroom) together with a separate notice to the stockholder of such specific posting, upon the later to occur of (A) such posting or (B) the giving of the separate notice of such posting; or (iv) if by any other form of electronic communication, when directed to the stockholder in the manner consented to by the stockholder. (e) If a stockholder meeting is to be held via electronic communications and stockholders will take action at such meeting, the notice of such meeting must: (i) specify the means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present and vote at such meeting; and (ii) provide the information required to access the stockholder list. A waiver of notice may be given by electronic transmission. 2
Section 1.04. Quorum. Except as otherwise required by law or by the Certificate of Incorporation, the presence in person or by proxy of the holders of record of one-third of the shares entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at such meeting. Section 1.05. Voting. If, pursuant to Section 5.05 of these By-Laws, a record date has been fixed, every holder of record of shares entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be entitled to one (1) vote for each share outstanding in his or her name on the books of the Corporation at the close of business on such record date.

Except as otherwise required by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws, directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at a meeting and voting for nominees in the election of directors, and in all other matters, the affirmative vote of the majority of shares present in person or represented by proxy at a meeting and voting on the subject matter shall be the act of the stockholders. Section 1.06. Voting by Ballot. No vote of the stockholders on an election of Directors need be taken by written ballot or by electronic transmission unless otherwise required by law. Any vote not required to be taken by ballot or by electronic transmission may be conducted in any manner approved by the Board of Directors prior to the meeting at which such vote is taken. Section 1.07. Adjournment. If a quorum is not present at any meeting of the stockholders, the stockholders present in person or by proxy shall have the power to adjourn any such meeting from time to time until a quorum is present. Notice of any adjourned meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation need not be given if the place, if any, date and hour thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken, provided, however, that if the adjournment is for more than thirty (30) days, or if after the adjournment a new record date for the adjourned meeting is fixed pursuant to Section 5.05 of these By-Laws, a notice of the adjourned meeting, conforming to the requirements of Section 1.03 hereof, shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at such meeting. At any adjourned meeting at which a quorum is present, any business may be transacted that might have been transacted on the original date of the meeting. Section 1.08. Proxies. Any stockholder entitled to vote at any meeting of the stockholders may authorize another person or persons to vote at any such meeting and express such consent or dissent for him or her by proxy. A stockholder may authorize a valid proxy by executing a written instrument signed by such stockholder, or by causing 3
his or her signature to be affixed to such writing by any reasonable means including, but not limited to, by facsimile signature, or by transmitting or authorizing the transmission of a telegram, cablegram or other means of electronic transmission to the person designated as the holder of the proxy, a proxy solicitation firm or a like authorized agent. No such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after the expiration of three years from the date of such proxy, unless such proxy provides for a longer period. Every proxy shall be revocable at the pleasure of the stockholder executing it, except in those cases where applicable law provides that a proxy shall be irrevocable. A stockholder may revoke any proxy which is not irrevocable by attending the meeting and voting in person or by filing with the Secretary of the Corporation either an instrument in writing revoking the proxy or another duly executed proxy bearing a later date. Proxies by telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission must either set forth or be submitted with information from which it can be determined that the telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission was authorized by the stockholder. Any copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reliable reproduction of a writing or transmission created pursuant to this section may be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing or transmission for any and all purposes for which the original writing or transmission could be used, provided that such copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of the entire original writing or transmission. Section 1.09. Organization; Procedure. At every meeting of stockholders the presiding officer shall be the Chairman of the Board or, in the event of his or her absence or disability, a presiding officer chosen by the Board of Directors. The Secretary of the Corporation, or in the event of his or her absence or disability, an Assistant Secretary, if any, or if there be no Assistant Secretary, in the absence of the Secretary of the Corporation, an appointee of the presiding officer, shall act as Secretary of the meeting. The order of business and all other matters of procedure at every meeting of stockholders may be determined by such presiding officer. Section 1.10. Notice of Stockholder Business and Nominations.

Authority and Duties of Officers. The officers of the Corporation shall have such authority and shall exercise such powers and perform such duties as may be specified in these By-Laws, except that in any event each officer shall exercise such powers and perform such duties as may be required by law. ARTICLE V CAPITAL STOCK Section 5.01. Certificates of Stock, Uncertificated Shares. The shares of the Corporation shall be represented by certificates, provided that the Board of Directors may provide by resolution or resolutions that some or all of any or all classes or series of the stock of the Corporation shall be uncertificated shares. Any such resolution shall not apply to shares represented by a certificate until each such certificate is surrendered to the Corporation. Notwithstanding the adoption of such a resolution by the Board of Directors, every holder of stock in the Corporation represented by certificates and upon request every holder of uncertificated shares shall be entitled to have a certificate signed by, or in the name of, the Corporation, by the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive 15
Officer or the President, and by the Chief Financial Officer, the Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer, or the Secretary of the Corporation or an Assistant Secretary, representing the number of shares registered in certificate form. Such certificate shall be in such form as the Board of Directors may determine, to the extent consistent with applicable law, the Certificate of Incorporation and these By-Laws. Section 5.02. Signatures; Facsimile. All signatures on the certificate referred to in Section 5.01 of these By-Laws may be in facsimile, engraved or printed form, to the extent permitted by law. In case any officer, transfer agent or registrar who has signed, or whose facsimile, engraved or printed signature has been placed upon a certificate shall have ceased to be such officer, transfer agent or registrar before such certificate is issued, it may be issued by the Corporation with the same effect as if he or she were such officer, transfer agent or registrar at the date of issue. Section 5.03. Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. The Board of Directors may direct that a new certificate be issued in place of any certificate theretofore issued by the Corporation alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon delivery to the Corporation of an affidavit of the owner or owners of such certificate, setting forth such allegation. The Corporation may require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, or his or her legal representative, to give the Corporation a bond sufficient to indemnify it against any claim that may be made against it on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of any such certificate or the issuance of any such new certificate. Section 5.04. Transfer of Stock. Upon surrender to the Corporation or the transfer agent of the Corporation of a certificate for shares, duly endorsed or accompanied by appropriate evidence of succession, assignment or authority to transfer, the Corporation shall issue a new certificate to the person entitled thereto, cancel the old certificate and record the transaction upon its books. Within a reasonable time after the transfer of uncertificated stock, the Corporation shall send to the registered owner thereof a written notice containing the information required to be set forth or stated on certificates pursuant to the laws of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. Subject to the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation and these By-Laws, the Board of Directors may prescribe such additional rules and regulations as it may deem appropriate relating to the issue, transfer and registration of shares of the Corporation. Section 5.05. Record Date. In order to determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, the Board of Directors may fix, in advance, a record date, which record date shall not precede the date on which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and which shall not be more than sixty (60) nor fewer than ten (10) days before the date of such meeting. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting, 16
provided, however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting. In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights of the stockholders entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock, or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted, and which record date shall be not more than sixty (60) days prior to such action. If no record date is fixed, the record date for determining stockholders for any such purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto. Section 5.06. Registered Stockholders. Prior to due surrender of a certificate for registration of transfer, the Corporation may treat the registered owner as the person exclusively entitled to receive dividends and other distributions, to vote, to receive notice and otherwise to exercise all the rights and powers of the owner of the shares represented by such certificate, and the Corporation shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or legal claim to or interest in such shares on the part of any other person, whether or not the Corporation shall have notice of such claim or interests. Whenever any transfer of shares shall be made for collateral security, and not absolutely, it shall be so expressed in the entry of the transfer if, when the certificates are presented to the Corporation for transfer or uncertificated shares are requested to be transferred, both the transferor and transferee request the Corporation to do so. Section 5.07. Transfer Agent and Registrar. The Board of Directors may appoint one (1) or more transfer agents and one (1) or more registrars, and may require all certificates representing shares to bear the signature of any such transfer agents or registrars. ARTICLE VI INDEMNIFICATION Section 6.01. Nature of Indemnity. The Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding (a "Proceeding"), whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that he or she is or was or has agreed to become a Director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was serving or has agreed to serve at the request of the Corporation as a Director or officer, of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, or by reason of any action alleged to 17
have been taken or omitted in such capacity, and may indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to such a Proceeding by reason of the fact that he or she is or was or has agreed to become an employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving or has agreed to serve at the request of the Corporation as an employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him or her or on his or her behalf in connection with such Proceeding and any appeal therefrom, if he or she acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal Proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful; except that in the case of a Proceeding by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor (1) such indemnification shall be limited to expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in the defense or settlement of such Proceeding, and (2) no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Corporation unless and only to the extent that the Delaware Court of Chancery or the court in which such Proceeding was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Delaware Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper. Notwithstanding the foregoing, but subject to Section 6.05 of these By-Laws, the Corporation shall not be obligated to indemnify a Director or officer of the Corporation in respect of a Proceeding (or part thereof) instituted by such Director or officer, unless such Proceeding (or part thereof) has been authorized by the Board of Directors. The termination of any Proceeding by judgment, order settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal Proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful. Section 6.02. Successful Defense. To the extent that a present or former Director or officer of the Corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any Proceeding referred to in Section 6.01 hereof or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, such person shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection therewith. Section 6.03. Determination that Indemnification is Proper. Any indemnification of a present or former Director or officer of the Corporation under Section 6.01 hereof (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Corporation unless a determination is made that indemnification of the present or former Director or officer is not proper in the 18
circumstances because he or she has not met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 6.01 hereof. Any indemnification of a present or former employee or agent of the Corporation under Section 6.01 hereof (unless ordered by a court) may be made by the Corporation upon a determination that indemnification of the present or former employee or agent is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 6.01 hereof. Any such determination shall be made, with respect to a person who is a Director or officer at the time of such determination, (1) by a majority vote of the Directors who are not parties to such Proceeding, even though less than a quorum, or (2) by a committee of such Directors designated by majority vote of such Directors, even though less than a quorum, or (3) if there are no such Directors, or if such Directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (4) by the stockholders. Section 6.04. Advance Payment of Expenses. Expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by a Director or officer in defending any civil, criminal, administrative or investigative Proceeding shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such Proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the Director or officer to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such person is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this Article. Such expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by former Directors and officers or other employees and agents may be so paid upon such terms and conditions, if any, as the Corporation deems appropriate. The Board of Directors may authorize the Corporation's counsel to represent such Director, officer, employee or agent in any Proceeding, whether or not the Corporation is a party to such Proceeding. Section 6.05. Procedure for Indemnification of Directors and Officers. Any indemnification of a Director or officer of the Corporation under Sections 6.01 and 6.02, or advance of costs, charges and expenses to a Director or officer under Section 6.04 of these By-Laws, shall be made promptly, and in any event within thirty (30) days, upon the written request of the Director or officer. If a determination by the Corporation that the Director or officer is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article VI is required, and the Corporation fails to respond within thirty (30) days to a written request for indemnity, the Corporation shall be deemed to have approved such request. If the Corporation denies a written request for indemnity or advancement of expenses, in whole or in part, or if payment in full pursuant to such request is not made within thirty (30) days, the right to indemnification or advances as granted by this Article VI shall be enforceable by the Director or officer in any court of competent jurisdiction. Such person's costs and expenses incurred in connection with successfully establishing his or her right to indemnification, in whole or in part, in any such Proceeding shall also be indemnified by the Corporation. It shall be a defense to any such Proceeding (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for the advance of costs, charges and expenses under Section 6.04 of these By-Laws where the required undertaking, if any, has been received by the Corporation) that the claimant has not met the standard of conduct set forth in 19
Section 6.01 of these By-Laws, but the burden of proving such defense shall be on the Corporation. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, its independent legal counsel, and its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 6.01 of these By-Laws, nor the fact that there has been an actual determination by the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, its independent legal counsel, and its stockholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct. Section 6.06. Survival; Preservation of Other Rights. The foregoing indemnification provisions shall be deemed to be a contract between the Corporation and each Director, officer, employee and agent who serves in any such capacity at any time while these provisions as well as the relevant provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law are in effect and any repeal or modification thereof shall not affect any right or obligation then existing with respect to any state of facts then or previously existing or any Proceeding previously or thereafter brought or threatened based in whole or in part upon any such state of facts. Such a "contract right" may not be modified retroactively without the consent of such Director, officer, employee or agent. The indemnification provided by this Article VI shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those indemnified may be entitled under any by-law, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested Directors or otherwise, both as to action in such person's official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office, and shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a Director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person. Section 6.07. Insurance. The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was or has agreed to become a Director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a Director or officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted against such person and incurred by such person or on such person's behalf in any such capacity, or arising out of such person's status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify him or her against such liability under the provisions of this Article VI. Section 6.08. Severability. If this Article VI or any portion hereof shall be invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify each Director or officer and may indemnify each employee or agent of the Corporation as to costs, charges and expenses (including attorneys' fees), 20
judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement with respect to a Proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, including a Proceeding by or in the right of the Corporation, to the fullest extent permitted by any applicable portion of this Article VI that shall not have been invalidated and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. ARTICLE VII OFFICES Section 7.01. Initial Registered Office. The initial registered office of the Corporation in the State of Delaware shall be located at Corporation Trust Center, 1209 N. Orange Street in the City of Wilmington, County of New Castle. Section 7.02. Other Offices. The Corporation may maintain offices or places of business at such other locations within or without the State of Delaware as the Board of Directors may from time to time determine or as the business of the Corporation may require. ARTICLE VIII GENERAL PROVISIONS Section 8.01. Dividends. Subject to any applicable provisions of law and the Certificate of Incorporation, dividends upon the shares of the Corporation may be declared by the Board of Directors at any regular or special meeting of the Board of Directors and any such dividend may be paid in cash, property, or shares of the Corporation's capital stock. A member of the Board of Directors, or a member of any committee designated by the Board of Directors shall be fully protected in relying in good faith upon the records of the Corporation and upon such information, opinions, reports or statements presented to the Corporation by any of its officers or employees, or committees of the Board of Directors, or by any other person as to matters the Director reasonably believes are within such other person's professional or expert competence and who has been selected with reasonable care by or on behalf of the Corporation, as to the value and amount of the assets, liabilities and/or net profits of the Corporation, or any other facts pertinent to the existence and amount of surplus or other funds from which dividends might properly be declared and paid. 21
Section 8.02. Reserves. There may be set aside out of any funds of the Corporation available for dividends such sum or sums as the Board of Directors from time to time, in its absolute discretion, thinks proper as a reserve or reserves to meet contingencies, or for equalizing dividends, or for repairing or maintaining any property of the Corporation or for such other purpose as the Board of Directors shall think conducive to the interest of the Corporation, and the Board of Directors may similarly modify or abolish any such reserve. Section 8.03. Execution of Instruments. The Board of Directors may authorize, or provide for the authorization of, officers, employees or agents to enter into any contract or execute and deliver any instrument in the name and on behalf of the Corporation. Any such authorization must be in writing or by electronic transmission and may be general or limited to specific contracts or instruments. Section 8.04. Corporate Indebtedness. No loan shall be contracted on behalf of the Corporation, and no evidence of indebtedness shall be issued in its name, unless authorized by the Board of Directors. Such authorization may be general or confined to specific instances. Loans so authorized may be effected at any time for the Corporation from any bank, trust company or other institution, or from any firm, corporation or individual. All bonds, debentures, notes and other obligations or evidences of indebtedness of the Corporation issued for such loans shall be made, executed and delivered as the Board of Directors shall authorize. When so authorized by the Board of Directors, any part of or all the properties, including contract rights, assets, business or good will of the Corporation, whether then owned or thereafter acquired, may be mortgaged, pledged, hypothecated or conveyed or assigned in trust as security for the payment of such bonds, debentures, notes and other obligations or evidences of indebtedness of the Corporation, and of the interest thereon, by instruments executed and delivered in the name of the Corporation. Section 8.05. Disposition of Funds. The funds of the Corporation shall be paid out, transferred or otherwise disposed of only in such manner and under such controls as may be authorized by resolution of the Board of Directors or as may be authorized by such officers of the Corporation as the Board of Directors designates. Section 8.06. Sale, Transfer, etc. of Securities. To the extent authorized by the Board of Directors or by the Chief Executive Officer, the President, any Vice President, the Secretary of the Corporation, the Chief Financial Officer or the Treasurer or any other officers designated by the Board of Directors or the Chief Executive Officer may sell, transfer, endorse, and assign any shares of stock, bonds or other securities owned by or held in the name of the Corporation, and may make, execute and deliver in the name of the Corporation, under its corporate seal, any instruments that may be appropriate to effect any such sale, transfer, endorsement or assignment. 22
Section 8.07. Voting as Stockholder. Unless otherwise determined by resolution of the Board of Directors, the Chief Executive Officer, the President, any Executive Vice President or any Senior Vice President shall have full power and authority on behalf of the Corporation to attend any meeting of stockholders of any corporation in which the Corporation may hold stock, and to act, vote (or execute proxies to vote) and exercise in person or by proxy all other rights, powers and privileges incident to the ownership of such stock. Such officers acting on behalf of the Corporation shall have full power and authority to execute any instrument expressing consent to or dissent from any action of any such corporation without a meeting. The Board of Directors may by resolution from time to time confer such power and authority upon any other person or persons. Section 8.08. Fiscal Year. The fiscal year of the Corporation shall commence on the first day of January of each year (except for the Corporation's first fiscal year which shall commence on the date of incorporation) and shall terminate in each case on December 31. Section 8.09. Seal. The seal of the Corporation shall be in such form as the Board of Directors may from time to time determine and shall contain the name of the Corporation, the year of its incorporation and the words "Corporate Seal" and "Delaware". The form of such seal shall be subject to alteration by the Board of Directors. The seal may be used by causing it or a facsimile thereof to be impressed, affixed or reproduced, or may be used in any other lawful manner. Section 8.10. Books and Records; Inspection. Except to the extent otherwise required by law, the books and records of the Corporation shall be kept at such place or places within or without the State of Delaware as may be determined from time to time by the Board of Directors. ARTICLE IX AMENDMENT OF BY-LAWS Section 9.01. Amendment. These By-Laws may be amended, altered or repealed: (a) by resolution adopted by a majority of the Board of Directors at any special or regular meeting of the Board of Directors if, in the case of such special meeting only, notice of such amendment, alteration or repeal is contained in the notice or waiver of notice of such meeting; or (b) at any regular or special meeting of the stockholders upon the affirmative vote of the holders of three-fourths ( 3/4) or more of the combined voting power of the outstanding shares of the Corporation entitled to vote 23

Exhibit 4.1 CERTIFICATE OF DESIGNATIONS OF SERIES A NON-CUMULATIVE PERPETUAL PREFERRED STOCK OF PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL GROUP, INC. --------------- Principal Financial Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Corporation"), does hereby certify: That the following resolutions were duly adopted by the Board of Directors of the Corporation (the "Board of Directors") at a meeting duly convened and held on June 7, 2005 (the "June 7 Resolutions") and by the Pricing Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors by unanimous written consent on June 14, 2005 (the "June 14 Resolutions") pursuant to authority conferred upon the Board of Directors by the provisions of the amended and restated certificate of incorporation of the Corporation authorizing the Corporation to issue up to 500 million shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share ("Preferred Stock"), and pursuant to authority conferred upon the Committee in accordance with Section 141(c) of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, Article III, Section 3.01 of the amended and restated by-laws of the Corporation (the "by-laws") and resolutions of the Board of Directors adopted at a meeting duly convened and held on June 7, 2005: 1. On June 7, 2005, the Board of Directors adopted the following resolution authorizing the Committee to act on behalf of the Board of Directors in connection with the issuance of a new series of Preferred Stock: "RESOLVED, that Principal Financial Group, Inc. (the "Corporation") be, and it hereby is, authorized to issue shares of the Corporation's Series A Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Series A Preferred Shares"), and shares of the Series B Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Series B Preferred Shares", and together with the Series A Preferred Shares, the "Preferred Shares"), with an initial public offering price of the Preferred Shares not to exceed US$550 million in the aggregate, and individually not to exceed US$325 million per series, to be issued from time to time, together or separately, upon such terms as the Pricing Committee (as defined below) or the officers designated below shall determine, as provided in the immediately succeeding resolutions." 2. On June 14, 2005, the Committee, pursuant to the authority conferred upon it by Section 141(c) of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, Article III, Section 3.01 of the by-laws of the
Corporation and the June 7 Resolutions, duly adopted the following resolution: "RESOLVED, that pursuant to a resolution of the Board of Directors (the "Board of Directors") of Principal Financial Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Corporation") adopted on June 7, 2005, the issuance of two series of preferred stock of the Corporation, designated as the Series A Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Series A Preferred Shares") and the Series B Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Series B Preferred Shares"), respectively, is hereby authorized, and the designation, voting powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights, and qualifications, limitations and restrictions of the Series A Preferred Shares and Series B Preferred Shares, in addition to those set forth in the amended and restated certificate of incorporation of the Corporation, are hereby fixed as set forth on Annex A and Annex B, respectively." 3. Accordingly, the designation, voting powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights, and qualifications, limitations and restrictions of the Series A Preferred Shares, as set forth in Annex A to the June 14 Resolutions, have been fixed as follows: SECTION 1. Designation. The distinctive serial designation of such series is "Series A Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock" ("Series A Preferred Stock"). Each share of Series A Preferred Stock shall be identical in all respects to every other share of Series A Preferred Stock. SECTION 2. Number of Shares. The number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be 3,000,000. Such number may from time to time be increased (but not in excess of the total number of authorized shares of Preferred Stock) or decreased (but not below the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock then outstanding) by the Board of Directors. Shares of Series A Preferred Stock that are redeemed, purchased or otherwise acquired by the Corporation shall be cancelled and shall revert to authorized but unissued shares of Preferred Stock undesignated as to series. SECTION 3. Definitions. As used herein with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock: "3-Month LIBOR" means, with respect to any Dividend Period, the rate (expressed as a percentage per annum) for deposits in U.S. dollars for a 3-month period commencing on the first day of that Dividend Period that appears on Telerate Page 3750 as of 11:00 a.m. (London time) on the Dividend Determination Date for that Dividend Period. If such rate does not appear on Telerate Page 3750, 3-Month LIBOR will be determined on the basis of the rates at which deposits in U.S. dollars for a 3-month period commencing on the first day of that Dividend Period and in a principal amount of not less 2
than $1,000,000 are offered to prime banks in the London interbank market by four major banks in the London interbank market selected by the Calculation Agent, at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time on the Dividend Determination Date for that Dividend Period. The Calculation Agent will request the principal London office of each of such banks to provide a quotation of its rate. If at least two such quotations are provided, 3-Month LIBOR with respect to that Dividend Period will be the arithmetic mean (rounded upward if necessary to the nearest .00001 of 1%) of such quotations. If fewer than two quotations are provided, 3-Month LIBOR with respect to that Dividend Period will be the arithmetic mean (rounded upward if necessary to the nearest .00001 of 1%) of the rates quoted by three major banks in New York City selected by the Calculation Agent, at approximately 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the first day of that Dividend Period for loans in U.S. dollars to leading European banks for a 3-month period commencing on the first day of that Dividend Period and in a principal amount of not less than $1,000,000. However, if the banks selected by the Calculation Agent to provide quotations are not quoting as described above, 3-Month LIBOR for that Dividend Period will be the same as 3-Month LIBOR as determined for the previous Dividend Period. The establishment of 3-Month LIBOR for each Dividend Period by the Calculation Agent shall (in the absence of manifest error) be final and binding. "10-year Treasury CMT" means the rate determined in accordance with the following provisions: (a) With respect to any Dividend Determination Date and the Dividend Period that begins immediately thereafter, the 10-year Treasury CMT means the rate per annum for deposits for a 10-year period commencing on the Dividend Determination Date displayed on the Bloomberg interest rate page most nearly corresponding to Telerate Page 7051 containing the caption "...Treasury Constant Maturities... Federal Reserve Board Release H.15...Mondays Approximately 3:45 P.M.," and the column for the Designated CMT Maturity Index. (b) If such rate is no longer displayed on the relevant page, or is not so displayed by 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on the applicable Dividend Determination Date, then the 10-year Treasury CMT for such Dividend Determination Date will be such treasury constant maturity rate for the Designated CMT Maturity Index as is published in H.15(519). (c) If such rate is no longer displayed on the relevant page, or if not published by 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on the applicable Dividend Determination Date, then the 10-year Treasury CMT for such Dividend Determination Date will be such constant maturity treasury rate for the Designated CMT Maturity Index (or other United States Treasury rate for the Designated CMT Maturity Index) for the applicable Dividend Determination Date as may then be published by either the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve 3
System or the United States Department of the Treasury that the Calculation Agent determines to be comparable to the rate formerly displayed on the Bloomberg interest rate page most nearly corresponding to Telerate Page 7051 and published in H.15(519). (d) If such information is not provided by 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on the applicable Dividend Determination Date, then the 10-year Treasury CMT for such Dividend Determination Date will be calculated by the Calculation Agent and will be a yield to maturity, based on the arithmetic mean of the secondary market offered rates as of approximately 3:30 P.M., New York City time, on such Dividend Determination Date reported, according to their written records, by three leading primary United States government securities dealers in The City of New York (each, a "Reference Dealer") selected by the Calculation Agent (from five such Reference Dealers selected by the Calculation Agent and eliminating the highest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the highest) and the lowest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the lowest)), for the most recently issued direct noncallable fixed rate obligations of the United States ("Treasury Debentures") with an original maturity of approximately the Designated CMT Maturity Index and a remaining term to maturity of not less than such Designated CMT Maturity Index minus one year. (e) If the Calculation Agent is unable to obtain three such Treasury Debentures quotations, the 10-year Treasury CMT for the applicable Dividend Determination Date will be calculated by the Calculation Agent and will be a yield to maturity based on the arithmetic mean of the secondary market offered rates as of approximately 3:30 P.M., New York City time, on the applicable Dividend Determination Date of three Reference Dealers in The City of New York (from five such Reference Dealers selected by the Calculation Agent and eliminating the highest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the highest) and the lowest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the lowest)), for Treasury Debentures with an original maturity of the number of years that is the next highest to the Designated CMT Maturity Index and a remaining term to maturity closest to the Designated CMT Maturity Index and in an amount of at least $100 million. (f) If three or four (and not five) of such Reference Dealers are quoting as set forth above, then the 10-year Treasury CMT will be based on the arithmetic mean of the offered rates obtained and neither the highest nor lowest of such quotes will be eliminated; provided, however, that if fewer than three Reference Dealers selected by the Calculation Agent are quoting as set forth above, the 10-year Treasury CMT with respect to the applicable Dividend Determination Date will remain the 10-year Treasury CMT for the immediately preceding Dividend Period. If two Treasury Debentures with an original maturity as described in the second preceding sentence have remaining terms to maturity 4
equally close to the Designated CMT Maturity Index, then the quotes for the Treasury Debentures with the shorter remaining term to maturity will be used.

a Dividend Payment Date and (y) from the immediately preceding Dividend Payment Date if the date of issue is other than a Dividend Payment Date, payable quarterly on the 30th day of each March, June, September and December in each year (each such date a "Dividend Payment Date"), commencing on September 30, 2005, with respect to the Dividend Period (or portion thereof) ending on the day preceding such respective Dividend Payment Date, to holders of record on the respective date, not more than 60 nor less than 10 days preceding such Dividend Payment Date, fixed for that purpose by the Board of Directors in advance of payment of each particular dividend. During the Initial Fixed Rate Period, the Dividend Rate shall be the Initial Dividend Rate. For each Dividend Period thereafter, the Dividend Rate shall be determined in accordance with Section 4(b). (ii) BUSINESS DAY CONVENTION. If any Dividend Payment Date with respect to a Fixed Rate Period is not a Business Day, then dividends will be payable on the first Business Day following such Dividend Payment Date, without accrual to the actual payment date. If any Dividend Payment Date with respect to a Floating Rate Period is not a Business Day, then dividends will be payable on the first Business Day following such Dividend Payment Date unless such day is in the next calendar month, in which case dividends shall be payable on the first Business Day preceding such Dividend Payment Date and dividends, in each case, shall accrue to the actual payment date. (iii) DAY COUNT CONVENTION. The amount of dividends payable per share of Series A Preferred Stock on each Dividend Payment Date relating to a Fixed Rate Period will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve-30 day months. The amount of dividends payable per share of Series A Preferred Stock on each Dividend Payment Date relating to a Floating Rate Period will be computed by multiplying the per annum Dividend Rate in effect for such Dividend Period by a fraction, the numerator of which will be the actual number of days in such Dividend Period (or portion thereof) (determined by including the first day thereof and excluding the last day thereof) and the denominator of which will be 360, and multiplying the rates obtained by $100. (b) Remarketing. (i) FIXED RATE PERIOD. Prior to the expiration of the Initial Fixed Rate Period, the Corporation will have the option to remarket the Series A Preferred Stock to establish a new Fixed Rate with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock (to be in effect after the Initial Fixed Rate Period); provided, however, that (A) the Corporation may effect a 10
Remarketing only if and for so long as the Series A Preferred Stock is issued solely in global, fully registered form to a Clearing Agency and (B) if the Corporation has initiated a Remarketing but at or prior to the related Remarketing Settlement Date the Series A Preferred Stock is no longer issued solely in global, fully registered form to a Clearing Agency, the Remarketing shall terminate and shall not be consummated. In the event that clause (A) or clause (B) of the proviso set forth in the previous sentence applies, the Dividend Rate for the next succeeding Dividend Period shall be determined pursuant to Section 4(b)(ii). Any new Fixed Rate so established will be in effect for such Fixed Rate Period as the Corporation determines in connection with the Remarketing, provided that a Fixed Rate Period must be for a duration of at least six months and must end on a Dividend Payment Date. Prior to the expiration of any Fixed Rate Period after the Initial Fixed Rate Period, the Corporation will have the option, subject to the proviso set forth in the first sentence of this Section 4(b)(i), to remarket the Series A Preferred Stock to establish a new Fixed Rate for a new Fixed Rate Period (to be in effect after the expiration of the then current Dividend Period). If the Remarketing Agent, pursuant to the Remarketing Procedures described in Section 4(b)(iii), has determined that it will be able to remarket all Series A Preferred Stock tendered or deemed tendered for purchase in the Remarketing at a Fixed Rate and at the per share Liquidation Preference, prior to 4:00 P.M., New York City time, on any Remarketing Date, the Dividend Rate for the new Fixed Rate Period will be the Fixed Rate determined by the Remarketing Agent, which will be the rate per annum (rounded to the nearest one-thousandth (0.001) of one percent per annum) that the Remarketing Agent determines, in its sole judgment, to be the lowest Fixed Rate per annum that will enable it to remarket all Series A Preferred Stock tendered or deemed tendered for Remarketing at the per share Liquidation Preference. (ii) FLOATING RATE PERIOD. If the Series A Preferred Stock is not redeemed and the Corporation does not elect or is not entitled to remarket the Series A Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 4 or has terminated a Remarketing or if the Remarketing Agent is unable to remarket all of the Series A Preferred Stock tendered or deemed tendered for a purchase price of $100 per share of Series A Preferred Stock pursuant to the Remarketing procedures described above or if the Remarketing has been terminated in accordance with the requirements of Section 4(b)(i)(B), the Dividend Rate shall be the Floating Rate and the new Dividend Period shall be a Floating Rate Period, subject to the Corporation's right to subsequently remarket the Series A 11
Preferred Stock to again establish a Fixed Rate for a new Fixed Rate Period. During any Floating Rate Period, the Corporation may elect to remarket the Series A Preferred Stock prior to any Dividend Payment Date relating to a Floating Rate Period in order to again establish a new Fixed Rate for a new Fixed Rate Period (to be in effect after the expiration of the then current Dividend Period). The Calculation Agent shall calculate the Floating Rate on the applicable Dividend Determination Date relating to that Floating Rate Period as follows: Except as provided below, the Floating Rate for any Floating Rate Period for the Series A Preferred Stock will be reset quarterly and will be equal to the Adjustable Rate plus 1.45%. The "Adjustable Rate" for any Dividend Period will be equal to the highest of the 3-month LIBOR, the 10-year Treasury CMT and the 30-year Treasury CMT (collectively, the "Benchmark Rates") for such Dividend Period during the Floating Rate Period. In the event that the Calculation Agent determines in good faith that for any reason: (1) any one of the Benchmark Rates cannot be determined for any Dividend Period, the Adjustable Rate for such Dividend Period will be equal to the higher of whichever two of such rates can be so determined; (2) only one of the Benchmark Rates can be determined for any Dividend Period, the Adjustable Rate for such Dividend Period will be equal to whichever such rate can be so determined; or (3) none of the Benchmark Rates can be determined for any Dividend Period, the Adjustable Rate for the preceding Dividend Period will be continued for such Dividend Period, provided that if such preceding Dividend Period was a Fixed Rate Period, the Fixed Rate for the preceding Dividend Period will be continued for such Dividend Period. Each of the 10-year Treasury CMT and the 30-year Treasury CMT shall be rounded to the nearest hundredth (0.01) of one percent and 3-month LIBOR shall be rounded to the nearest one-hundred-thousandth (0.00001) of one percent. The Floating Rate with respect to each Dividend Period that occurs within a Floating Rate Period will be calculated as promptly as practicable by the Calculation Agent according to the appropriate method described above. If a new Fixed Rate for a new Fixed Rate Period is set in a Remarketing (as described in this Section 4), a new Fixed Rate Period shall commence following the expiration of the then current Dividend Period. If a new Fixed Rate for a new Fixed Rate Period is not set, for any reason, including after the expiration of the Initial Fixed Rate Period, in accordance with the terms of 12
Section 4(b)(iii) hereof, a Floating Rate Period and the corresponding Floating Rate determined or redetermined in accordance with this Section 4(b)(ii) shall be in effect unless and until the Corporation remarkets the Series A Preferred Stock and sets a new Fixed Rate for a new Fixed Rate Period in accordance with this Section 4(b)(i) and 4(b)(iii). (iii) REMARKETING PROCEDURES. If the Corporation elects to conduct a Remarketing of the Series A Preferred Stock for the purpose of establishing a new Fixed Rate for a new Fixed Rate Period, the Corporation shall, not less than 10 nor more than 35 Business Days prior to the related Election Date, notify in writing the Clearing Agency, the Remarketing Agent and the Calculation Agent. Such notice shall describe the Remarketing and shall indicate the length of the proposed new Fixed Rate Period, the proposed Remarketing Date and any redemption provisions that will apply during such new Fixed Rate Period. The Corporation shall have the right to terminate a Remarketing on any day prior to the date of the Remarketing of the Series A Preferred Stock by notice of such termination to the Clearing Agency (or the holders, as applicable), the Remarketing Agent and the Calculation Agent. Not later than 4:00 P.M., New York City time, on an Election Date, each Owner of Series A Preferred Stock may give, through the facilities of the Clearing Agency, a written notice to the Corporation of its election ("Notice of Election") (i) to retain and not to have all or any portion of the Series A Preferred Stock owned by it remarketed in the Remarketing or (ii) to tender all or any portion of such Series A Preferred Stock for purchase in the Remarketing (such portion, in either case, is to be at the per share Liquidation Preference or any integral multiple thereof). Any Notice of Election given to the Corporation will be irrevocable and may not be conditioned upon the level at which the Fixed Rate is established in the Remarketing. Promptly after 4:30 P.M., New York City time, on such Election Date, the Corporation, based on the Notices of Election received by it through the Clearing Agency prior to such time, will notify the Remarketing Agent of the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock to be retained by holders of Series A Preferred Stock and the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock tendered or deemed tendered for purchase in the Remarketing. If any holder gives a Notice of Election to tender shares of Series A Preferred Stock as described in (ii) in the immediately preceding paragraph, the Series A Preferred Stock so subject to such Notice of Election will be deemed tendered for purchase in the Remarketing, notwithstanding any failure by such holder to deliver or properly deliver such Series A Preferred Stock to the Remarketing Agent for purchase. If any holder of shares of Series A Preferred Stock fails timely to deliver a Notice of Election, as described above, such shares of Series A Preferred Stock will be deemed tendered for purchase in such 13
Remarketing, notwithstanding such failure or the failure by such holder to deliver or properly deliver such shares of Series A Preferred Stock to the Remarketing Agent for purchase. The right of each holder of Series A Preferred Stock to have shares of Series A Preferred Stock tendered for purchase in the Remarketing shall be limited to the extent that (i) the Remarketing Agent conducts a Remarketing pursuant to the terms of the Remarketing Agreement, (ii) Series A Preferred Stock tendered have not been called for redemption, (iii) the Remarketing Agent is able to find a purchaser or purchasers for tendered Series A Preferred Stock at a Fixed Rate and (iv) such purchaser or purchasers deliver the purchase price therefore to the Remarketing Agent. Any holder of Series A Preferred Stock that desires to continue to retain a number of Series A Preferred Stock, but only if the Fixed Rate is not less than a specified rate per annum, shall submit a Notice of Election to tender such Series A Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 4(b)(iii) and separately notify the Remarketing Agent of its interest at the telephone number set forth in the notice of Remarketing delivered pursuant to this Section 4(b)(iii). If such holder so notifies the Remarketing Agent, the Remarketing Agent will give priority to such holder's purchase of such number of Series A Preferred Stock in the Remarketing, provided that the Fixed Rate is not less than such specified rate. If holders submit Notices of Election to retain all of the Series A Preferred Stock then outstanding, the Fixed Rate will be the rate determined by the Remarketing Agent, in its sole discretion, as the rate that would have been established had a Remarketing been held on the related Remarketing Date. On any Remarketing Date on which the Remarketing is to be conducted, the Remarketing Agent will use commercially reasonable efforts to remarket, at a price equal to 100% of the per share Liquidation Preference, shares of Series A Preferred Stock tendered or deemed tendered for purchase. If, as a result of such efforts, on any Remarketing Date, the Remarketing Agent has determined that it will be able to remarket all shares of Series A Preferred Stock tendered or deemed tendered for purchase in the Remarketing at a Fixed Rate and at the per share Liquidation Preference, prior to 4:00 P.M., New York City time, on such Remarketing Date, the Remarketing Agent will determine the Fixed Rate, which will be the rate per annum (rounded to the nearest one-thousandth (0.001) of one percent per annum) which the Remarketing Agent determines, in its sole judgment, to be the lowest Fixed Rate per annum, if any, that will enable it to remarket all shares of Series A Preferred Stock tendered or deemed tendered for Remarketing at the per share Liquidation Preference. By approximately 4:30 P.M., New York City time, on a Remarketing Date, the Remarketing Agent shall advise, by telephone, (i) the Clearing Agency Participant, the Corporation and the 14
Calculation Agent of any new Fixed Rate established pursuant to the Remarketing and the number of remarketed shares of Series A Preferred Stock sold in the Remarketing; (ii) each purchaser of a remarketed share of Series A Preferred Stock (or the Clearing Agency Participant thereof) of such new Fixed Rate and the number of remarketed shares of Series A Preferred Stock such purchaser is to purchase; and (iii) each purchaser to give instructions to its Clearing Agency Participant to pay the purchase price on the Remarketing Settlement Date in same day funds against delivery of the remarketed Series A Preferred Stock purchased through the facilities of the Clearing Agency Participant. If the Remarketing Agent is unable to remarket by 4:00 P.M., New York City time on the third Business Day prior to the Remarketing Settlement Date, all shares of Series A Preferred Stock tendered or deemed tendered for purchase at the per share Liquidation Preference, the Dividend Rate for the next Dividend Period shall be the Floating Rate and the new Dividend Period shall be a Floating Rate Period. In such case, no shares of Series A Preferred Stock will be sold in the Remarketing and each holder will continue to hold its shares of Series A Preferred Stock at such Floating Rate during such Floating Rate Period. All shares of Series A Preferred Stock tendered or deemed tendered in the Remarketing will be automatically delivered to the account of the Remarketing Agent through the facilities of the Clearing Agency against payment of the purchase price therefor on the Remarketing Settlement Date. The Remarketing Agent will make payment to the Clearing Agency Participant of each tendering holder of Series A Preferred Stock in the Remarketing through the facilities of the Clearing Agency by the close of business on the Remarketing Settlement Date. In accordance with the Clearing Agency's normal procedures, on the Remarketing Settlement Date, the transaction described above with respect to each share of Series A Preferred Stock tendered or deemed tendered for purchase and sold in the Remarketing will be executed through the Clearing Agency and the account of the Clearing Agency Participant, will be debited and credited and such Series A Preferred Stock delivered by book entry as necessary to effect purchases and sales of such shares of Series A Preferred Stock. The Clearing Agency is expected to make payment in accordance with its normal procedures. If any holder selling Series A Preferred Stock in the Remarketing fails to deliver such Series A Preferred Stock, the Clearing Agency Participant of such selling holder and of any other person that was to have purchased Series A Preferred Stock in the Remarketing may deliver to any such other person a number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock that is less than the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock that otherwise was to be purchased by such person. In such event the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock to be so delivered will be determined by such Clearing Agency Participant and delivery of 15
such lesser number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock will constitute good delivery. The Remarketing Agent is not obligated to purchase any shares of Series A Preferred Stock that would otherwise remain unsold in a Remarketing. Neither the Corporation nor the Remarketing Agent shall be obligated in any case to provide funds to make payment upon tender of shares of Series A Preferred Stock for Remarketing. (c) Non-Cumulative Dividends. Dividends on shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be non-cumulative. To the extent that any dividends payable on the shares of Series A Preferred Stock on any Dividend Payment Date are not declared and paid, in full or otherwise, on such Dividend Payment Date, then such unpaid dividends shall not cumulate and shall cease to accrue and be payable and the Corporation shall have no obligation to pay dividends accrued for such Dividend Period after the Dividend Payment Date for such Dividend Period or to pay interest with respect to such dividends, whether or not dividends are declared on Series A Preferred Stock for any subsequent Dividend Period. (d) Priority of Dividends. (i) JUNIOR STOCK. So long as any share of Series A Preferred Stock remains outstanding, during a Dividend Period no dividend whatsoever shall be paid or declared and no distribution shall be made on any Junior Stock, other than a dividend payable solely in Junior Stock, and no shares of Junior Stock shall be purchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired for consideration by the Corporation, directly or indirectly (other than as a result of a reclassification of Junior Stock for or into Junior Stock, or the exchange or conversion of one share of Junior Stock for or into another share of Junior Stock, and other than through the use of the proceeds of a substantially contemporaneous sale of other shares of Junior Stock), unless the full dividends for such Dividend Period on all outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock have been paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set aside. Subject to this Section 4(d)(i), but not otherwise, such dividends (payable in cash, stock or otherwise), as may be determined by the Board of Directors may be declared and paid on any Junior Stock from time to time out of any funds legally available therefor, and the shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to participate in any such dividend. (ii) PARITY STOCK. When dividends for any Dividend Payment Date are not paid in full upon the shares of Series A Preferred Stock for any reason other than the restrictions on payment of dividends set forth in Section 5, and not paid in full upon any Parity Stock, all dividends 16
declared upon shares of Series A Preferred Stock and all Parity Stock for such Dividend Payment Date shall be declared pro rata so that the respective amounts of such dividends shall bear the same ratio to each other as all dividends per share on the shares of Series A Preferred Stock and all such Parity Stock otherwise payable on such Dividend Payment Date (subject to their having been declared by the Board of Directors out of legally available funds and including, in the case of any Parity Stock that bears cumulative dividends, all accrued but unpaid dividends) bear to each other. When dividends for any Dividend Payment Date are not paid in full upon the shares of Series A Preferred Stock because of the restriction on payment of dividends set forth in Section 5 and not paid in full upon any Parity Stock that includes a restriction on dividends substantially similar to the restriction in Section 5, then all dividends declared upon shares of Series A Preferred Stock and such Parity Stock for such Dividend Payment Date shall be declared pro rata so that the respective amounts of such dividends shall bear the same ratio to each other as all dividends per share on the shares of Series A Preferred Stock and all such other Parity Stock otherwise payable on such Dividend Payment Date (subject to their having been declared by the Board of Directors out of legally available funds and including, in the case of any such other Parity Stock that bears cumulative dividends, all accrued but unpaid dividends) bear to each other. (e) Dividend Payment Dates for Other Preferred Stock. For so long as any shares of Series A Preferred Stock are outstanding, the Corporation shall not issue any shares of Preferred Stock having dividend payment dates other than the Dividend Payment Dates for the Series A Preferred Stock. SECTION 5. Restrictions on Declaration and Payment of Dividends. (a) Tests for Suspension. Notwithstanding Section 4(a), neither the Board of Directors nor any committee of the Board of Directors may declare dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock for payment on any Dividend Payment Date in an aggregate amount exceeding the New Common Equity Amount as of the date of declaration (the "Dividend Declaration Date") for such Dividend Payment Date if: (i) the Covered Insurance Subsidiaries' Most Recent Weighted Average NAIC RBC Ratio was less than 175% (subject to Section 5(d)(iii)); or (ii) (x) the Trailing Four Quarters Consolidated Net Income for the period ending on the Preliminary Quarter End Test Date for such Dividend Payment Date is zero or a negative amount and (y) the Adjusted 17
Shareholders' Equity Amount as of each of the Preliminary Quarter End Test Date and the Final Quarter End Test Date for such Dividend Payment Date has declined by 10% or more as compared to the Adjusted Shareholders' Equity Amount as of the tenth Quarter End prior to such Final Quarter End Test Date (such date for such Dividend Payment Date and related Final Quarter End Test Date, the "Benchmark Quarter End Test Date"). Additionally, and without limiting the foregoing provisions of this Section 5(a), if the Corporation has failed the test in Section 5(a)(ii) as to a prior Dividend Payment Date, then neither the Board of Directors nor any committee of the Board of Directors may declare dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock for payment thereafter in an aggregate amount exceeding the New Common Equity Amount as of the Dividend Declaration Date for a Dividend Payment Date until the Dividend Declaration Date for the first Dividend Payment Date thereafter for which, as of the related Final Quarter End Test Date, the Adjusted Shareholders' Equity Amount has increased or has declined by less than 10%, in either case as compared to the Adjusted Shareholders' Equity Amount as of the Benchmark Quarter End Test Date for such prior Dividend Payment Date. (b) Potential Dividend Suspension Notice. If as of the Preliminary Quarter End Test Date for any Dividend Payment Date (x) the Trailing Four Quarters Consolidated Net Income for the period ending on such Preliminary Quarter End Test Date is zero or a negative amount and (y) the Adjusted Shareholders' Equity Amount as of such Preliminary Quarter End Test Date has declined by 10% or more as compared to the Adjusted Shareholders' Equity Amount as of the date that is eight quarters prior to such Preliminary Quarter End Test Date, then the Corporation shall give notice of such circumstance by first class mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the holders of record of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock at their respective last addresses appearing on the books of the Corporation, and shall file a copy of such notice on Form 8-K with the Commission (or, if the Corporation is not then a reporting company under the Securities Exchange Act, post a copy of such notice on the Corporation's website), by not later than the first Dividend Payment Date following such Preliminary Quarter End Test Date. Such notice shall (i) set forth the Trailing Four Quarters Consolidated Net Income for the period ending on such Preliminary Quarter End Test Date and the Adjusted Shareholders' Equity Amount as of such Preliminary Quarter End Test Date and as of the date that is eight quarters prior to such Preliminary Quarter End Test Date, and (ii) state that the Corporation may be limited by the terms of the Series A Preferred Stock from declaring and paying dividends on such Dividend Payment Date unless the Corporation, through the generation of earnings or issuance of new Common Stock, increases its Adjusted Shareholders' Equity Amount by an amount specified in such notice by the second Quarter End after the date of such notice. 18
The Corporation need not give any notice under this Section 5(b) during any period in which the Corporation's ability to declare and pay dividends is limited by reason of the application of Section 5(a). (c) Dividend Suspension Notice. By not later than the 15th day prior to each Dividend Payment Date for which dividends are being suspended by reason of either of the tests set forth in Section 5(a), and the Corporation is not otherwise able to pay dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock out of the New Common Equity Amount, the Corporation shall give notice of such suspension by first class mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the holders of record of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock at their respective last addresses appearing on the books of the Corporation, and shall file a copy of such notice on Form 8-K with the Commission (or, if the Corporation is not then a reporting company under the Securities Exchange Act, post a copy of such notice on the Corporation's website). Such notice, in addition to stating that dividends will be suspended, shall (i) if dividends are suspended by reason of the test set forth in Section 5(a)(i), set forth the fact that the Covered Insurance Subsidiaries' Most Recent Weighted Average NAIC RBC Ratio was less than 175% and (ii) if such suspension is by reason of the test set forth in Section 5(a)(ii), set forth the Adjusted Shareholders' Equity Amount as of the most recent Quarter End and the amount by which the Adjusted Shareholders' Equity Amount must increase in order for declaration and payment of dividends to be resumed. (d) Interpretive Provisions; Qualifications, Etc. In order to give effect to the foregoing, the following provisions apply: (i) Neither the Board of Directors nor a committee of the Board of Directors may declare dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock for payment on any Dividend Declaration Date (x) that is more than 60 days prior to the related Dividend Payment Date or (y) that is earlier than the date on which the Corporation's financial statements for the most recently completed quarter prior to the related Dividend Payment Date have been filed or furnished to the Commission on Form 10-K, Form 10-Q or Form 8-K; provided, however, if the Board of Directors determines to delay filing the Corporation's financial statements as of and for the period ended on a Final Quarter End Test Date with the Commission to a date later than the date on which "accelerated filers" within the meaning of Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act are required to file such financial statements, whether because of concerns over accuracy of such financial statements or their compliance with U.S. GAAP or otherwise, then the Board of Directors or a committee of the Board of Directors may determine whether the Corporation is permitted under Section 5(a) to declare dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock based upon the 19
Corporation's financial statements most recently filed with, or furnished to the Commission. (ii) Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Section 5, all references in this Section 5 to financial statements of the Corporation shall be deemed to be to financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, consistently applied, and, for so long as the Corporation is a reporting company under the Securities Exchange Act, filed by the Corporation with, or furnished by it to, the Commission under the Securities Exchange Act. If at any relevant time or for any relevant period the Corporation is not a reporting company under the Securities Exchange Act, then (x) for all relevant dates and periods the Corporation shall prepare and post on its website the financial statements that it would have been required to file with the Commission had it continued to be a reporting company under the Securities Exchange Act, in each case on or before the dates that the Corporation would have been required to file such financial statements with the Commission under the Securities Exchange Act had it continued to be an "accelerated filer" within the meaning of Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act, and (y) the provisions of this Section 5 shall be read mutatis mutandis to give effect to such provision. (iii) The limitation on dividends provided for in Section 5(a)(i) shall be of no force and effect if, as of a Dividend Declaration Date, the combined total assets of the Insurance Subsidiaries do not account for 25% or more of the consolidated total assets of the Corporation as reflected on its most recent consolidated financial statements. (iv) All financial terms used in this Section 5 that are not specifically defined, including within the definitions of defined terms, shall be determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP as applied to and reflected in the related financial statements of the Corporation as of the relevant dates and for the relevant period, except as provided in the next sentence. If because of a change in U.S. GAAP that results in a periodic charge, a cumulative adjustment or a restatement: (x) the Corporation's Consolidated Net Income Amount for the quarter in which such change takes effect is higher or lower than it would have been absent such change by the greater of $25 million or 5%, and the Trailing Four Quarters Consolidated Net Income is higher or lower than it would have been absent such change, then, for purposes of the calculations described under Section 5(a)(ii), commencing with the fiscal quarter for which such changes in U.S. GAAP becomes effective and ending with the 20
third quarter thereafter, such Trailing Four Quarters Consolidated Net Income shall be calculated on a pro forma basis without giving effect to such change in U.S. GAAP; or (y) the Adjusted Shareholders' Equity Amount as of the Quarter End in which such change takes effect is higher or lower than it would have been absent such change by the greater of $65 million or 1%, then, for purposes of the calculations described under Section 5(a)(ii) and the last sentence of Section 5(a), and for so long as such calculations with respect to such quarter are required to be performed, the Adjusted Shareholders' Equity Amount shall be calculated on a pro forma without giving effect to such change in U.S. GAAP.

(b) Partial Payment. If the assets of the Corporation are not sufficient to pay the Liquidation Preference in full to all holders of Series A Preferred Stock and all holders of any Parity Stock, the amounts paid to the holders of Series A Preferred Stock and to the holders of all Parity Stock shall be paid pro rata in accordance with the respective aggregate liquidation preferences of Series A Preferred Stock and all such Parity Stock. (c) Residual Distributions. If the Liquidation Preference has been paid in full to all holders of Series A Preferred Stock and the liquidation preference of any Parity Stock has been paid in full to all holders of such Parity Stock, the holders of Junior Stock shall be entitled to receive all remaining assets of the Corporation according to their respective rights and preferences. (d) Merger, Consolidation and Sale of Assets Not Liquidation. For purposes of this Section 6, the merger or consolidation of the Corporation with any other corporation, including a merger in which the holders of Series A Preferred Stock receive cash or property for their shares, or the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation, shall not constitute a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation. SECTION 7. Redemption. (a) Redemption. So long as the full dividends on all outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock for the then-current Dividend Period have been paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set aside, the Corporation, at the option of its Board of Directors, may, upon notice given as provided in Section 7(b), redeem the shares of Series A Preferred Stock at the time outstanding in whole or, subject to the next succeeding sentence, in part (i) on the last Dividend Payment Date of the Initial Fixed Rate Period, (ii) on such dates with respect to any other Fixed Rate Period as the Corporation may determine prior to the commencement of such Fixed Rate Period or (iii) at any time during a Floating Rate Period. A redemption of shares of Series A Preferred Stock in part may be made pursuant to the foregoing sentence only if, after giving effect to such redemption, not less than 500,000 shares of Series A Preferred 24
Stock will remain outstanding. Any such redemption shall be at the redemption price of $100 per share, together, in each case, with accrued and unpaid dividends for the then-current Dividend Period to the redemption date. (b) Notice of Redemption. Notice of every redemption of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be mailed by first class mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the holders of record of the shares to be redeemed at their respective last addresses appearing on the books of the Corporation. Such mailing shall be at least 30 days and not more than 60 days before the date fixed for redemption. Any notice mailed as provided in this Subsection shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the holder receives such notice, but failure duly to give such notice by mail, or any defect in such notice or in the mailing thereof, to any holder of shares of Series A Preferred Stock designated for redemption shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other shares of Series A Preferred Stock. Each notice shall state (i) the redemption date; (ii) the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock to be redeemed; (iii) the redemption price; (iv) the place or places where the shares of Series A Preferred Stock are to be redeemed; and (v) that dividends on the shares of Series A Preferred Stock to be redeemed will cease to accrue on the redemption date. (c) Partial Redemption. In case of any redemption of only part of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, the shares to be redeemed shall be selected either pro rata or by lot or in such other manner as the Board of Directors may determine to be fair and equitable. Subject to the provisions hereof, the Board of Directors shall have full power and authority to prescribe the terms and conditions upon which shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be redeemed from time to time. (d) Effectiveness of Redemption. If notice of redemption has been duly given and if on or before the redemption date specified in the notice all funds necessary for the redemption have been set aside by the Corporation, separate and apart from its other funds, in trust for the pro rata benefit of the holders of the shares called for redemption, so as to be and continue to be available therefor, then, notwithstanding that any certificate for any share so called for redemption has not been surrendered for cancellation, on and after the redemption date all shares so called for redemption shall cease to be outstanding and all rights with respect to such shares shall forthwith on such redemption date cease and terminate, except only the right of the holders thereof to receive the amount payable on such redemption without interest. Any funds unclaimed at the end of three years from the redemption date shall, to the extent permitted by law, be released to the Corporation, after which time the holders of the shares so called for redemption shall look only to the Corporation for payment of the redemption price of such shares. 25
SECTION 8. Voting Rights. (a) General. The holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall not have any voting rights except as set forth in this Section 8 or as otherwise required by law. (b) Right to Elect Two Directors Upon Non-Payment of Dividends. If and whenever dividends on Series A Preferred Stock and any other class or series of stock of the Corporation ranking on a parity with Series A Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends (any such class or series being herein referred to as "Dividend Parity Stock") have not been paid in an aggregate amount, as to any such class or series, equal to at least six quarterly dividends (whether or not consecutive), the number of directors then constituting the Board of Directors shall be increased by two and the holders of Series A Preferred Stock, together with the holders of all other affected classes and series of Dividend Parity Stock similarly entitled to vote for the election of a total of two additional directors, voting separately as a single class, shall be entitled to elect the two additional members of the Corporation's directors at any annual meeting of stockholders or any special meeting of the holders of Series A Preferred Stock and such Dividend Parity Stock for which dividends have not been paid, called as hereinafter provided, provided that the election of any such directors shall not cause the Corporation to violate the corporate governance requirement of the New York Stock Exchange (or any other exchange on which its securities may be listed) that listed companies must have a majority of independent directors. Whenever full dividends have been paid regularly on the Series A Preferred Stock and Dividend Parity Stock then outstanding, if any, for at least one year, then the right of the holders of Series A Preferred Stock and such Dividend Parity Stock to elect such additional two directors shall cease (but subject always to the same provisions for the vesting of such voting rights in the case of any similar non-payment of dividends in respect of future Dividend Periods), and the terms of office of all persons elected as directors by the holders of Series A Preferred Stock and such Dividend Parity Stock for which dividends have not been paid shall forthwith terminate and the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors shall be reduced accordingly. At any time after such voting power shall have been so vested in the holders of Series A Preferred Stock and such Dividend Parity Stock, the Secretary of the Corporation may, and upon the written request of any holder of shares of Series A Preferred Stock (addressed to the Secretary at the principal office of the Corporation) shall, call a special meeting of the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock and such Dividend Parity Stock for which dividends have not been paid for the election of the two directors to be elected by them as herein provided, such call to be made by notice similar to that provided in the by-laws for a special meeting of the stockholders or as required by law. If any such special meeting so required to be called shall not be called by the Secretary within 20 days after receipt of any such request, then any holder of shares of Series A 26
Preferred Stock may (at the Corporation's expense) call such meeting, upon notice as herein provided, and for that purpose shall have access to the stock books of the Corporation. The directors elected at any such special meeting shall hold office until the next annual meeting of the stockholders if such office shall not have previously terminated as above provided. In case any vacancy shall occur among the directors elected by the holders of Series A Preferred Stock and such Dividend Parity Stock for which dividends have not been paid, a successor shall be elected by the Board of Directors to serve until the next annual meeting of the stockholders upon the nomination of the then remaining director elected by the holders of Series A Preferred Stock and such Dividend Parity Stock for which dividends have not been paid or the successor of such remaining director. (c) Other Voting Rights. So long as any shares of Series A Preferred Stock are outstanding, in addition to any other vote or consent of stockholders required by law or by the amended and restated certificate of incorporation, the vote or consent of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, voting separately as a single class, given in person or by proxy, either in writing without a meeting or by vote at any meeting called for the purpose, shall be necessary for effecting or validating: (i) any amendment, alteration or repeal of any provision of the amended and restated certificate of incorporation or by-laws of the Corporation that would alter or change the voting powers, preferences or special rights of the Series A Preferred Stock so as to affect them adversely; provided, however, that the amendment of the amended and restated certificate of incorporation so as to authorize or create, or to increase the authorized amount of, any Junior Stock or any shares of any class or series or any securities convertible into shares of any class or series of Parity Stock shall not be deemed to affect adversely the voting powers, preferences or special rights of the Series A Preferred Stock; (ii) any amendment or alteration of the amended and restated certificate of incorporation of the Corporation to authorize or create, or increase the authorized amount of, any shares of any class or series or any securities convertible into shares of any class or series of capital stock of the Corporation ranking prior to Series A Preferred Stock in the payment of dividends or in the distribution of assets on any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation; or (iii) consummation of a binding share exchange or reclassification involving the Series A Preferred Stock or a merger or consolidation of the Corporation with another entity, unless in each case (i) the Series A Preferred Stock remain outstanding or, in the case of any such merger or consolidation with respect to which the Corporation is not 27
the surviving or resulting entity, are converted into or exchanged for preference securities of the surviving or resulting entity or its ultimate parent, and (ii) such Series A Preferred Stock remaining outstanding or such preference securities, as the case may be, have such rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers, taken as a whole, as are not materially less favorable to the holders thereof than the rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers of the Series A Preferred Stock, taken as a whole; provided, however, that any increase in the amount of the authorized or issued Series A Preferred Stock or authorized preferred stock or the creation and issuance, or an increase in the authorized or issued amount, of other Parity Stock and/or Junior Stock (whether such stock bears dividends on a cumulative or non-cumulative basis) will not be deemed to adversely affect the special rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers of the Series A Preferred Stock. If an amendment, alteration, repeal, share exchange, reclassification, merger or consolidation described above would adversely affect one or more but not all series of voting preferred stock (including the Series A Preferred Stock for this purpose), then only the series affected and entitled to vote shall vote as a class in lieu of all such series of preferred stock. Without the consent of the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock, so long as such action does not adversely affect the special rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers of the Series A Preferred Stock, taken as a whole, the Corporation may amend, alter, supplement or repeal any terms of the Series A Preferred Stock: (x) to cure any ambiguity, or to cure, correct or supplement any provision contained in the certificate of designations for the Series A Preferred Stock that may be defective or inconsistent; or (y) to make any provision with respect to matters or questions arising with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock that is not inconsistent with the provisions of the certificate of designations. The foregoing voting provisions will not apply if, at or prior to the time when the act with respect to which such vote would otherwise be required shall be effected, all outstanding Series A Preferred Stock shall have been redeemed or called for redemption upon proper notice and sufficient funds shall have been set aside by the Corporation for the benefit of the holders of Series A Preferred Stock to effect such redemption. SECTION 9. Other Rights. The shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall not have any voting powers, preferences or relative, participating, optional or other 28
special rights, or qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, other than as set forth herein or in the amended and restated certificate of incorporation of the Corporation. SECTION 10. Restatement of Certificate. Upon any restatement of the amended and restated certificate of incorporation of the Corporation, Sections 1 through 9 of this certificate of designations shall be included in Article 2 of the amended and restated certificate of incorporation under the heading "Series A Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock" and this Section 10 may be omitted. If the Board of Directors so determines, the numbering of Sections 1 through 9 may be changed for convenience of reference or for any other proper purpose. 29

Exhibit 4.2 CERTIFICATE OF DESIGNATIONS OF SERIES B NON-CUMULATIVE PERPETUAL PREFERRED STOCK OF PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL GROUP, INC. -------------- Principal Financial Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Corporation"), does hereby certify: That the following resolutions were duly adopted by the Board of Directors of the Corporation (the "Board of Directors") at a meeting duly convened and held on June 7, 2005 (the "June 7 Resolutions") and by the Pricing Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors by unanimous written consent on June 14, 2005 (the "June 14 Resolutions") pursuant to authority conferred upon the Board of Directors by the provisions of the amended and restated certificate of incorporation of the Corporation authorizing the Corporation to issue up to 500 million shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share ("Preferred Stock"), and pursuant to authority conferred upon the Committee in accordance with Section 141(c) of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, Article III, Section 3.01 of the amended and restated by-laws of the Corporation (the "by-laws") and resolutions of the Board of Directors adopted at a meeting duly convened and held on June 7, 2005: 1. On June 7, 2005, the Board of Directors adopted the following resolution authorizing the Committee to act on behalf of the Board of Directors in connection with the issuance of a new series of Preferred Stock: "RESOLVED, that Principal Financial Group, Inc. (the "Corporation") be, and it hereby is, authorized to issue shares of the Corporation's Series A Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Series A Preferred Shares"), and shares of the Series B Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Series B Preferred Shares", and together with the Series A Preferred Shares, the "Preferred Shares"), with an initial public offering price of the Preferred Shares not to exceed US$550 million in the aggregate, and individually not to exceed US$325 million per series, to be issued from time to time, together or separately, upon such terms as the Pricing Committee (as defined below) or the officers designated below shall determine, as provided in the immediately succeeding resolutions." 2. On June 14, 2005, the Committee, pursuant to the authority conferred upon it by Section 141(c) of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, Article III, Section 3.01 of the by-laws of the
Corporation and the June 7 Resolutions, duly adopted the following resolution: "RESOLVED, that pursuant to a resolution of the Board of Directors (the "Board of Directors") of Principal Financial Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Corporation") adopted on June 7, 2005, the issuance of two series of preferred stock of the Corporation, designated as the Series A Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Series A Preferred Shares") and the Series B Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Series B Preferred Shares"), respectively, is hereby authorized, and the designation, voting powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights, and qualifications, limitations and restrictions of the Series A Preferred Shares and Series B Preferred Shares, in addition to those set forth in the amended and restated certificate of incorporation of the Corporation, are hereby fixed as set forth on Annex A and Annex B, respectively." 3. Accordingly, the designation, voting powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights, and qualifications, limitations and restrictions of the Series B Preferred Shares, as set forth in Annex B to the June 14 Resolutions, have been fixed as follows: SECTION 1. Designation. The distinctive serial designation of such series is "Series B Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock" ("Series B Preferred Stock"). Each share of Series B Preferred Stock shall be identical in all respects to every other share of Series B Preferred Stock. SECTION 2. Number of Shares. The number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall be 10,000,000. Such number may from time to time be increased (but not in excess of the total number of authorized shares of Preferred Stock) or decreased (but not below the number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock then outstanding) by the Board of Directors. Shares of Series B Preferred Stock that are redeemed, purchased or otherwise acquired by the Corporation shall be cancelled and shall revert to authorized but unissued shares of Preferred Stock undesignated as to series. SECTION 3. Definitions. As used herein with respect to the Series B Preferred Stock: "3-Month LIBOR" means, with respect to any Dividend Period, the rate (expressed as a percentage per annum) for deposits in U.S. dollars for a 3-month period commencing on the first day of that Dividend Period that appears on Telerate Page 3750 as of 11:00 a.m. (London time) on the Dividend Determination Date for that Dividend Period. If such rate does not appear on Telerate Page 3750, 3-Month LIBOR will be determined on the basis of the rates at which deposits in U.S. dollars for a 3-month period commencing on the first day of that Dividend Period and in a principal amount of not less than $1,000,000 are offered to prime banks in the London interbank market by four major -2-
banks in the London interbank market selected by the Calculation Agent, at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time on the Dividend Determination Date for that Dividend Period. The Calculation Agent will request the principal London office of each of such banks to provide a quotation of its rate. If at least two such quotations are provided, 3-Month LIBOR with respect to that Dividend Period will be the arithmetic mean (rounded upward if necessary to the nearest .00001 of 1%) of such quotations. If fewer than two quotations are provided, 3-Month LIBOR with respect to that Dividend Period will be the arithmetic mean (rounded upward if necessary to the nearest .00001 of 1%) of the rates quoted by three major banks in New York City selected by the Calculation Agent, at approximately 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the first day of that Dividend Period for loans in U.S. dollars to leading European banks for a 3-month period commencing on the first day of that Dividend Period and in a principal amount of not less than $1,000,000. However, if the banks selected by the Calculation Agent to provide quotations are not quoting as described above, 3-Month LIBOR for that Dividend Period will be the same as 3-Month LIBOR as determined for the previous Dividend Period. The establishment of 3-Month LIBOR for each Dividend Period by the Calculation Agent shall (in the absence of manifest error) be final and binding. "10-year Treasury CMT" means the rate determined in accordance with the following provisions: (a) With respect to any Dividend Determination Date and the Dividend Period that begins immediately thereafter, the 10-year Treasury CMT means the rate per annum for deposits for a 10-year period commencing on the Dividend Determination Date displayed on the Bloomberg interest rate page most nearly corresponding to Telerate Page 7051 containing the caption "...Treasury Constant Maturities... Federal Reserve Board Release H.15...Mondays Approximately 3:45 P.M.," and the column for the Designated CMT Maturity Index. (b) If such rate is no longer displayed on the relevant page, or is not so displayed by 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on the applicable Dividend Determination Date, then the 10-year Treasury CMT for such Dividend Determination Date will be such treasury constant maturity rate for the Designated CMT Maturity Index as is published in H.15(519). (c) If such rate is no longer displayed on the relevant page, or if not published by 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on the applicable Dividend Determination Date, then the 10-year Treasury CMT for such Dividend Determination Date will be such constant maturity treasury rate for the Designated CMT Maturity Index (or other United States Treasury rate for the Designated CMT Maturity Index) for the applicable Dividend Determination Date as may then be published by either the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or the United States Department of the Treasury that the Calculation Agent determines to be comparable to the rate formerly displayed on the -3-
Bloomberg interest rate page most nearly corresponding to Telerate Page 7051 and published in H.15(519). (d) If such information is not provided by 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on the applicable Dividend Determination Date, then the 10-year Treasury CMT for such Dividend Determination Date will be calculated by the Calculation Agent and will be a yield to maturity, based on the arithmetic mean of the secondary market offered rates as of approximately 3:30 P.M., New York City time, on such Dividend Determination Date reported, according to their written records, by three leading primary United States government securities dealers in The City of New York (each, a "Reference Dealer") selected by the Calculation Agent (from five such Reference Dealers selected by the Calculation Agent and eliminating the highest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the highest) and the lowest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the lowest)), for the most recently issued direct noncallable fixed rate obligations of the United States ("Treasury Debentures") with an original maturity of approximately the Designated CMT Maturity Index and a remaining term to maturity of not less than such Designated CMT Maturity Index minus one year. (e) If the Calculation Agent is unable to obtain three such Treasury Debentures quotations, the 10-year Treasury CMT for the applicable Dividend Determination Date will be calculated by the Calculation Agent and will be a yield to maturity based on the arithmetic mean of the secondary market offered rates as of approximately 3:30 P.M., New York City time, on the applicable Dividend Determination Date of three Reference Dealers in The City of New York (from five such Reference Dealers selected by the Calculation Agent and eliminating the highest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the highest) and the lowest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the lowest)), for Treasury Debentures with an original maturity of the number of years that is the next highest to the Designated CMT Maturity Index and a remaining term to maturity closest to the Designated CMT Maturity Index and in an amount of at least $100 million. (f) If three or four (and not five) of such Reference Dealers are quoting as set forth above, then the 10-year Treasury CMT will be based on the arithmetic mean of the offered rates obtained and neither the highest nor lowest of such quotes will be eliminated; provided, however, that if fewer than three Reference Dealers selected by the Calculation Agent are quoting as set forth above, the 10-year Treasury CMT with respect to the applicable Dividend Determination Date will remain the 10-year Treasury CMT for the immediately preceding Dividend Period. If two Treasury Debentures with an original maturity as described in the second preceding sentence have remaining terms to maturity equally close to the Designated CMT Maturity Index, then the quotes for the Treasury Debentures with the shorter remaining term to maturity will be used. -4-

SECTION 4. Dividends. (a) General. (i) DIVIDEND PAYMENT DATES, DIVIDEND RATE, ETC. Subject to Section 5, holders of Series B Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors, but only out of funds legally available therefor, cash dividends at the applicable Dividend Rate applied to the Liquidation Preference per share, accruing on each share of Series B Preferred Stock (i) if issued on the Issue Date, from June 17, 2005, and (ii) if issued thereafter, from (x) the date of issue if such date is a Dividend Payment Date and (y) from the immediately preceding Dividend Payment Date if the date of issue is other than a Dividend Payment Date, payable quarterly on the 30th day of each March, June, September and December in each year (each such date a "Dividend Payment Date"), commencing on September 30, 2005, with respect to the Dividend Period (or portion thereof) ending on the day preceding such respective Dividend Payment Date, to holders of record on the respective date, not more than 60 nor less than 10 days preceding such Dividend Payment Date, fixed for that purpose by the Board of Directors in advance of payment of each particular dividend. During the Initial Fixed Rate Period, the Dividend Rate shall be the Initial Dividend Rate. For each Dividend Period thereafter, the Dividend Rate shall be determined in accordance with Section 4(b). (ii) BUSINESS DAY CONVENTION. If any Dividend Payment Date with respect to a Fixed Rate Period is not a Business Day, then dividends will be payable on the first Business Day following such Dividend Payment Date, without accrual to the actual payment date. If any Dividend Payment Date with respect to a Floating Rate Period is not a Business Day, then dividends will be payable on the first Business Day following such Dividend Payment Date unless such day is in the next calendar month, in which case dividends shall be payable on the first Business Day preceding such Dividend Payment Date and dividends, in each case, shall accrue to the actual payment date.

(b) Remarketing. (i) FIXED RATE PERIOD. Prior to the expiration of the Initial Fixed Rate Period, the Corporation will have the option to remarket the Series B Preferred Stock to establish a new Fixed Rate with respect to the Series B Preferred Stock (to be in effect after the Initial Fixed Rate Period); provided, however, that (A) the Corporation may effect a Remarketing only if and for so long as the Series B Preferred Stock is issued solely in global, fully registered form to a Clearing Agency and (B) if the Corporation has initiated a Remarketing but at or prior to the related Remarketing Settlement Date the Series B Preferred Stock is no longer issued solely in global, fully registered form to a Clearing Agency, the Remarketing shall terminate and shall not be consummated. In the event that clause (A) or clause (B) of the proviso set forth in the previous sentence applies, the Dividend Rate for the next succeeding Dividend Period shall be determined pursuant to Section 4(b)(ii). Any new Fixed Rate so established will be in effect for such Fixed Rate Period as the Corporation determines in connection with the Remarketing, provided that a Fixed Rate Period must be for a duration of at least six months and must end on a Dividend Payment Date. Prior to the expiration of any Fixed Rate Period after the Initial Fixed Rate Period, the Corporation will have the option, subject to the proviso set forth in the first sentence of this Section 4(b)(i), to remarket the Series B Preferred Stock to establish a new Fixed Rate for a new Fixed Rate Period (to be in effect after the expiration of the then current Dividend Period). If the Remarketing Agent, pursuant to the Remarketing Procedures described in Section 4(b)(iii), has determined that it will be able to remarket all Series B Preferred Stock tendered or deemed tendered for purchase in the Remarketing at a Fixed Rate and at the per share Liquidation Preference, prior to 4:00 P.M., New York City time, on any Remarketing Date, the Dividend Rate for the new Fixed Rate Period will be the Fixed Rate determined by the Remarketing Agent, which will be the rate per annum (rounded to the nearest one-thousandth (0.001) of one percent per annum) that the Remarketing Agent determines, in its sole judgment, to be the lowest Fixed Rate per annum that will enable it to remarket all Series B Preferred Stock tendered or deemed tendered for Remarketing at the per share Liquidation Preference. (ii) FLOATING RATE PERIOD. If the Series B Preferred Stock is not redeemed and the Corporation does not elect or is not entitled to remarket the Series B Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 4 or has terminated a Remarketing or if the Remarketing Agent is unable to remarket all of the Series B Preferred Stock tendered or deemed tendered for a purchase price of $25 per share of Series B Preferred Stock pursuant to the Remarketing procedures described above or if the Remarketing has been terminated in accordance with the requirements of Section 4(b)(i)(B), the Dividend Rate shall be the Floating Rate and the new Dividend Period shall be a Floating Rate Period, subject to the -11-
Corporation's right to subsequently remarket the Series B Preferred Stock to again establish a Fixed Rate for a new Fixed Rate Period. During any Floating Rate Period, the Corporation may elect to remarket the Series B Preferred Stock prior to any Dividend Payment Date relating to a Floating Rate Period in order to again establish a new Fixed Rate for a new Fixed Rate Period (to be in effect after the expiration of the then current Dividend Period). The Calculation Agent shall calculate the Floating Rate on the applicable Dividend Determination Date relating to that Floating Rate Period as follows: Except as provided below, the Floating Rate for any Floating Rate Period for the Series B Preferred Stock will be reset quarterly and will be equal to the Adjustable Rate plus 2.10%. The "Adjustable Rate" for any Dividend Period will be equal to the highest of the 3-month LIBOR, the 10-year Treasury CMT and the 30-year Treasury CMT (collectively, the "Benchmark Rates") for such Dividend Period during the Floating Rate Period. In the event that the Calculation Agent determines in good faith that for any reason: (1) any one of the Benchmark Rates cannot be determined for any Dividend Period, the Adjustable Rate for such Dividend Period will be equal to the higher of whichever two of such rates can be so determined; (2) only one of the Benchmark Rates can be determined for any Dividend Period, the Adjustable Rate for such Dividend Period will be equal to whichever such rate can be so determined; or (3) none of the Benchmark Rates can be determined for any Dividend Period, the Adjustable Rate for the preceding Dividend Period will be continued for such Dividend Period, provided that if such preceding Dividend Period was a Fixed Rate Period, the Fixed Rate for the preceding Dividend Period will be continued for such Dividend Period. Each of the 10-year Treasury CMT and the 30-year Treasury CMT shall be rounded to the nearest hundredth (0.01) of one percent and 3-month LIBOR shall be rounded to the nearest one-hundred-thousandth (0.00001) of one percent. The Floating Rate with respect to each Dividend Period that occurs within a Floating Rate Period will be calculated as promptly as practicable by the Calculation Agent according to the appropriate method described above. If a new Fixed Rate for a new Fixed Rate Period is set in a Remarketing (as described in this Section 4), a new Fixed Rate Period shall commence following the expiration of the then current Dividend Period. If a new Fixed Rate for a new Fixed Rate Period is not set, for any reason, including after the expiration of the Initial Fixed Rate Period, in accordance with the terms of -12-
Section 4(b)(iii) hereof, a Floating Rate Period and the corresponding Floating Rate determined or redetermined in accordance with this Section 4(b)(ii) shall be in effect unless and until the Corporation remarkets the Series B Preferred Stock and sets a new Fixed Rate for a new Fixed Rate Period in accordance with this Section 4(b)(i) and 4(b)(iii). (iii) REMARKETING PROCEDURES. If the Corporation elects to conduct a Remarketing of the Series B Preferred Stock for the purpose of establishing a new Fixed Rate for a new Fixed Rate Period, the Corporation shall, not less than 10 nor more than 35 Business Days prior to the related Election Date, notify in writing the Clearing Agency, the Remarketing Agent and the Calculation Agent. Such notice shall describe the Remarketing and shall indicate the length of the proposed new Fixed Rate Period, the proposed Remarketing Date and any redemption provisions that will apply during such new Fixed Rate Period. The Corporation shall have the right to terminate a Remarketing on any day prior to the date of the Remarketing of the Series B Preferred Stock by notice of such termination to the Clearing Agency (or the holders, as applicable), the Remarketing Agent and the Calculation Agent. Not later than 4:00 P.M., New York City time, on an Election Date, each Owner of Series B Preferred Stock may give, through the facilities of the Clearing Agency, a written notice to the Corporation of its election ("Notice of Election") (i) to retain and not to have all or any portion of the Series B Preferred Stock owned by it remarketed in the Remarketing or (ii) to tender all or any portion of such Series B Preferred Stock for purchase in the Remarketing (such portion, in either case, is to be at the per share Liquidation Preference or any integral multiple thereof). Any Notice of Election given to the Corporation will be irrevocable and may not be conditioned upon the level at which the Fixed Rate is established in the Remarketing. Promptly after 4:30 P.M., New York City time, on such Election Date, the Corporation, based on the Notices of Election received by it through the Clearing Agency prior to such time, will notify the Remarketing Agent of the number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock to be retained by holders of Series B Preferred Stock and the number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock tendered or deemed tendered for purchase in the Remarketing. If any holder gives a Notice of Election to tender shares of Series B Preferred Stock as described in (ii) in the immediately preceding paragraph, the Series B Preferred Stock so subject to such Notice of Election will be deemed tendered for purchase in the Remarketing, notwithstanding any failure by such holder to deliver or properly deliver such Series B Preferred Stock to the Remarketing Agent for purchase. If any holder of shares of Series B Preferred Stock fails timely to deliver a Notice of Election, as described above, such shares of Series B Preferred Stock will be deemed tendered for purchase in such Remarketing, notwithstanding such failure or the failure by such holder to deliver -13-
or properly deliver such shares of Series B Preferred Stock to the Remarketing Agent for purchase. The right of each holder of Series B Preferred Stock to have shares of Series B Preferred Stock tendered for purchase in the Remarketing shall be limited to the extent that (i) the Remarketing Agent conducts a Remarketing pursuant to the terms of the Remarketing Agreement, (ii) Series B Preferred Stock tendered have not been called for redemption, (iii) the Remarketing Agent is able to find a purchaser or purchasers for tendered Series B Preferred Stock at a Fixed Rate and (iv) such purchaser or purchasers deliver the purchase price therefore to the Remarketing Agent. Any holder of Series B Preferred Stock that desires to continue to retain a number of Series B Preferred Stock, but only if the Fixed Rate is not less than a specified rate per annum, shall submit a Notice of Election to tender such Series B Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 4(b)(iii) and separately notify the Remarketing Agent of its interest at the telephone number set forth in the notice of Remarketing delivered pursuant to this Section 4(b)(iii). If such holder so notifies the Remarketing Agent, the Remarketing Agent will give priority to such holder's purchase of such number of Series B Preferred Stock in the Remarketing, provided that the Fixed Rate is not less than such specified rate. If holders submit Notices of Election to retain all of the Series B Preferred Stock then outstanding, the Fixed Rate will be the rate determined by the Remarketing Agent, in its sole discretion, as the rate that would have been established had a Remarketing been held on the related Remarketing Date. On any Remarketing Date on which the Remarketing is to be conducted, the Remarketing Agent will use commercially reasonable efforts to remarket, at a price equal to 100% of the per share Liquidation Preference, shares of Series B Preferred Stock tendered or deemed tendered for purchase. If, as a result of such efforts, on any Remarketing Date, the Remarketing Agent has determined that it will be able to remarket all shares of Series B Preferred Stock tendered or deemed tendered for purchase in the Remarketing at a Fixed Rate and at the per share Liquidation Preference, prior to 4:00 P.M., New York City time, on such Remarketing Date, the Remarketing Agent will determine the Fixed Rate, which will be the rate per annum (rounded to the nearest one-thousandth (0.001) of one percent per annum) which the Remarketing Agent determines, in its sole judgment, to be the lowest Fixed Rate per annum, if any, that will enable it to remarket all shares of Series B Preferred Stock tendered or deemed tendered for Remarketing at the per share Liquidation Preference. By approximately 4:30 P.M., New York City time, on a Remarketing Date, the Remarketing Agent shall advise, by telephone, (i) the Clearing Agency Participant, the Corporation and the Calculation Agent of any new Fixed Rate established pursuant to the Remarketing and the number of remarketed shares of Series B Preferred Stock sold in the -14-
Remarketing; (ii) each purchaser of a remarketed share of Series B Preferred Stock (or the Clearing Agency Participant thereof) of such new Fixed Rate and the number of remarketed shares of Series B Preferred Stock such purchaser is to purchase; and (iii) each purchaser to give instructions to its Clearing Agency Participant to pay the purchase price on the Remarketing Settlement Date in same day funds against delivery of the remarketed Series B Preferred Stock purchased through the facilities of the Clearing Agency Participant. If the Remarketing Agent is unable to remarket by 4:00 P.M., New York City time on the third Business Day prior to the Remarketing Settlement Date, all shares of Series B Preferred Stock tendered or deemed tendered for purchase at the per share Liquidation Preference, the Dividend Rate for the next Dividend Period shall be the Floating Rate and the new Dividend Period shall be a Floating Rate Period. In such case, no shares of Series B Preferred Stock will be sold in the Remarketing and each holder will continue to hold its shares of Series B Preferred Stock at such Floating Rate during such Floating Rate Period. All shares of Series B Preferred Stock tendered or deemed tendered in the Remarketing will be automatically delivered to the account of the Remarketing Agent through the facilities of the Clearing Agency against payment of the purchase price therefor on the Remarketing Settlement Date. The Remarketing Agent will make payment to the Clearing Agency Participant of each tendering holder of Series B Preferred Stock in the Remarketing through the facilities of the Clearing Agency by the close of business on the Remarketing Settlement Date. In accordance with the Clearing Agency's normal procedures, on the Remarketing Settlement Date, the transaction described above with respect to each share of Series B Preferred Stock tendered or deemed tendered for purchase and sold in the Remarketing will be executed through the Clearing Agency and the account of the Clearing Agency Participant, will be debited and credited and such Series B Preferred Stock delivered by book entry as necessary to effect purchases and sales of such shares of Series B Preferred Stock. The Clearing Agency is expected to make payment in accordance with its normal procedures. If any holder selling Series B Preferred Stock in the Remarketing fails to deliver such Series B Preferred Stock, the Clearing Agency Participant of such selling holder and of any other person that was to have purchased Series B Preferred Stock in the Remarketing may deliver to any such other person a number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock that is less than the number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock that otherwise was to be purchased by such person. In such event the number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock to be so delivered will be determined by such Clearing Agency Participant and delivery of such lesser number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock will constitute good delivery. -15-
The Remarketing Agent is not obligated to purchase any shares of Series B Preferred Stock that would otherwise remain unsold in a Remarketing. Neither the Corporation nor the Remarketing Agent shall be obligated in any case to provide funds to make payment upon tender of shares of Series B Preferred Stock for Remarketing. (c) Non-Cumulative Dividends. Dividends on shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall be non-cumulative. To the extent that any dividends payable on the shares of Series B Preferred Stock on any Dividend Payment Date are not declared and paid, in full or otherwise, on such Dividend Payment Date, then such unpaid dividends shall not cumulate and shall cease to accrue and be payable and the Corporation shall have no obligation to pay dividends accrued for such Dividend Period after the Dividend Payment Date for such Dividend Period or to pay interest with respect to such dividends, whether or not dividends are declared on Series B Preferred Stock for any subsequent Dividend Period. (d) Priority of Dividends. (i) JUNIOR STOCK. So long as any share of Series B Preferred Stock remains outstanding, during a Dividend Period no dividend whatsoever shall be paid or declared and no distribution shall be made on any Junior Stock, other than a dividend payable solely in Junior Stock, and no shares of Junior Stock shall be purchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired for consideration by the Corporation, directly or indirectly (other than as a result of a reclassification of Junior Stock for or into Junior Stock, or the exchange or conversion of one share of Junior Stock for or into another share of Junior Stock, and other than through the use of the proceeds of a substantially contemporaneous sale of other shares of Junior Stock), unless the full dividends for such Dividend Period on all outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock have been paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set aside. Subject to this Section 4(d)(i), but not otherwise, such dividends (payable in cash, stock or otherwise), as may be determined by the Board of Directors may be declared and paid on any Junior Stock from time to time out of any funds legally available therefor, and the shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to participate in any such dividend. (ii) PARITY STOCK. When dividends for any Dividend Payment Date are not paid in full upon the shares of Series B Preferred Stock for any reason other than the restrictions on payment of dividends set forth in Section 5, and not paid in full upon any Parity Stock, all dividends declared upon shares of Series B Preferred Stock and all Parity Stock for such Dividend Payment Date shall be declared pro rata so that the respective amounts of such dividends shall bear the same ratio to each other as all dividends per share on the shares of Series B Preferred Stock and all such Parity Stock otherwise payable on such Dividend Payment Date (subject to their having been declared by the Board of Directors out of legally available funds and including, in the case of any Parity Stock that bears -16-
cumulative dividends, all accrued but unpaid dividends) bear to each other. When dividends for any Dividend Payment Date are not paid in full upon the shares of Series B Preferred Stock because of the restriction on payment of dividends set forth in Section 5 and not paid in full upon any Parity Stock that includes a restriction on dividends substantially similar to the restriction in Section 5, then all dividends declared upon shares of Series B Preferred Stock and such Parity Stock for such Dividend Payment Date shall be declared pro rata so that the respective amounts of such dividends shall bear the same ratio to each other as all dividends per share on the shares of Series B Preferred Stock and all such other Parity Stock otherwise payable on such Dividend Payment Date (subject to their having been declared by the Board of Directors out of legally available funds and including, in the case of any such other Parity Stock that bears cumulative dividends, all accrued but unpaid dividends) bear to each other. (e) Dividend Payment Dates for Other Preferred Stock. For so long as any shares of Series B Preferred Stock are outstanding, the Corporation shall not issue any shares of Preferred Stock having dividend payment dates other than the Dividend Payment Dates for the Series B Preferred Stock. SECTION 5. Restrictions on Declaration and Payment of Dividends. (a) Tests for Suspension. Notwithstanding Section 4(a), neither the Board of Directors nor any committee of the Board of Directors may declare dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock for payment on any Dividend Payment Date in an aggregate amount exceeding the New Common Equity Amount as of the date of declaration (the "Dividend Declaration Date") for such Dividend Payment Date if: (i) the Covered Insurance Subsidiaries' Most Recent Weighted Average NAIC RBC Ratio was less than 175% (subject to Section 5(d)(iii)); or (ii) (x) the Trailing Four Quarters Consolidated Net Income for the period ending on the Preliminary Quarter End Test Date for such Dividend Payment Date is zero or a negative amount and (y) the Adjusted Shareholders' Equity Amount as of each of the Preliminary Quarter End Test Date and the Final Quarter End Test Date for such Dividend Payment Date has declined by 10% or more as compared to the Adjusted Shareholders' Equity Amount as of the tenth Quarter End prior to such Final Quarter End Test Date (such date for such Dividend Payment Date and related Final Quarter End Test Date, the "Benchmark Quarter End Test Date"). Additionally, and without limiting the foregoing provisions of this Section 5(a), if the Corporation has failed the test in Section 5(a)(ii) as to a prior -17-
Dividend Payment Date, then neither the Board of Directors nor any committee of the Board of Directors may declare dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock for payment thereafter in an aggregate amount exceeding the New Common Equity Amount as of the Dividend Declaration Date for a Dividend Payment Date until the Dividend Declaration Date for the first Dividend Payment Date thereafter for which, as of the related Final Quarter End Test Date, the Adjusted Shareholders' Equity Amount has increased or has declined by less than 10%, in either case as compared to the Adjusted Shareholders' Equity Amount as of the Benchmark Quarter End Test Date for such prior Dividend Payment Date. (b) Potential Dividend Suspension Notice. If as of the Preliminary Quarter End Test Date for any Dividend Payment Date (x) the Trailing Four Quarters Consolidated Net Income for the period ending on such Preliminary Quarter End Test Date is zero or a negative amount and (y) the Adjusted Shareholders' Equity Amount as of such Preliminary Quarter End Test Date has declined by 10% or more as compared to the Adjusted Shareholders' Equity Amount as of the date that is eight quarters prior to such Preliminary Quarter End Test Date, then the Corporation shall give notice of such circumstance by first class mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the holders of record of the shares of Series B Preferred Stock at their respective last addresses appearing on the books of the Corporation, and shall file a copy of such notice on Form 8-K with the Commission (or, if the Corporation is not then a reporting company under the Securities Exchange Act, post a copy of such notice on the Corporation's website), by not later than the first Dividend Payment Date following such Preliminary Quarter End Test Date. Such notice shall (i) set forth the Trailing Four Quarters Consolidated Net Income for the period ending on such Preliminary Quarter End Test Date and the Adjusted Shareholders' Equity Amount as of such Preliminary Quarter End Test Date and as of the date that is eight quarters prior to such Preliminary Quarter End Test Date, and (ii) state that the Corporation may be limited by the terms of the Series B Preferred Stock from declaring and paying dividends on such Dividend Payment Date unless the Corporation, through the generation of earnings or issuance of new Common Stock, increases its Adjusted Shareholders' Equity Amount by an amount specified in such notice by the second Quarter End after the date of such notice. The Corporation need not give any notice under this Section 5(b) during any period in which the Corporation's ability to declare and pay dividends is limited by reason of the application of Section 5(a). (c) Dividend Suspension Notice. By not later than the 15th day prior to each Dividend Payment Date for which dividends are being suspended by reason of either of the tests set forth in Section 5(a), and the Corporation is not otherwise able to pay dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock out of the New Common Equity Amount, the Corporation shall give notice of such suspension by first class mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the holders of record of the shares of Series B Preferred Stock at their respective last addresses appearing on the -18-
books of the Corporation, and shall file a copy of such notice on Form 8-K with the Commission (or, if the Corporation is not then a reporting company under the Securities Exchange Act, post a copy of such notice on the Corporation's website). Such notice, in addition to stating that dividends will be suspended, shall (i) if dividends are suspended by reason of the test set forth in Section 5(a)(i), set forth the fact that the Covered Insurance Subsidiaries' Most Recent Weighted Average NAIC RBC Ratio was less than 175% and (ii) if such suspension is by reason of the test set forth in Section 5(a)(ii), set forth the Adjusted Shareholders' Equity Amount as of the most recent Quarter End and the amount by which the Adjusted Shareholders' Equity Amount must increase in order for declaration and payment of dividends to be resumed. (d) Interpretive Provisions; Qualifications, Etc. In order to give effect to the foregoing, the following provisions apply: (i) Neither the Board of Directors nor a committee of the Board of Directors may declare dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock for payment on any Dividend Declaration Date (x) that is more than 60 days prior to the related Dividend Payment Date or (y) that is earlier than the date on which the Corporation's financial statements for the most recently completed quarter prior to the related Dividend Payment Date have been filed or furnished to the Commission on Form 10-K, Form 10-Q or Form 8-K; provided, however, if the Board of Directors determines to delay filing the Corporation's financial statements as of and for the period ended on a Final Quarter End Test Date with the Commission to a date later than the date on which "accelerated filers" within the meaning of Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act are required to file such financial statements, whether because of concerns over accuracy of such financial statements or their compliance with U.S. GAAP or otherwise, then the Board of Directors or a committee of the Board of Directors may determine whether the Corporation is permitted under Section 5(a) to declare dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock based upon the Corporation's financial statements most recently filed with, or furnished to the Commission. (ii) Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Section 5, all references in this Section 5 to financial statements of the Corporation shall be deemed to be to financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, consistently applied, and, for so long as the Corporation is a reporting company under the Securities Exchange Act, filed by the Corporation with, or furnished by it to, the Commission under the Securities Exchange Act. If at any relevant time or for any relevant period the Corporation is not a reporting company under the Securities Exchange Act, then (x) for all relevant dates and periods the Corporation shall prepare and post on its website the financial statements that it would have -19-
been required to file with the Commission had it continued to be a reporting company under the Securities Exchange Act, in each case on or before the dates that the Corporation would have been required to file such financial statements with the Commission under the Securities Exchange Act had it continued to be an "accelerated filer" within the meaning of Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act, and (y) the provisions of this Section 5 shall be read mutatis mutandis to give effect to such provision. (iii) The limitation on dividends provided for in Section 5(a)(i) shall be of no force and effect if, as of a Dividend Declaration Date, the combined total assets of the Insurance Subsidiaries do not account for 25% or more of the consolidated total assets of the Corporation as reflected on its most recent consolidated financial statements. (iv) All financial terms used in this Section 5 that are not specifically defined, including within the definitions of defined terms, shall be determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP as applied to and reflected in the related financial statements of the Corporation as of the relevant dates and for the relevant period, except as provided in the next sentence. If because of a change in U.S. GAAP that results in a periodic charge, a cumulative adjustment or a restatement: (x) the Corporation's Consolidated Net Income Amount for the quarter in which such change takes effect is higher or lower than it would have been absent such change by the greater of $25 million or 5%, and the Trailing Four Quarters Consolidated Net Income is higher or lower than it would have been absent such change, then, for purposes of the calculations described under Section 5(a)(ii), commencing with the fiscal quarter for which such changes in U.S. GAAP becomes effective and ending with the third quarter thereafter, such Trailing Four Quarters Consolidated Net Income shall be calculated on a pro forma basis without giving effect to such change in U.S. GAAP; or (y) the Adjusted Shareholders' Equity Amount as of the Quarter End in which such change takes effect is higher or lower than it would have been absent such change by the greater of $65 million or 1%, then, for purposes of the calculations described under Section 5(a)(ii) and the last sentence of Section 5(a), and for so long as such calculations with respect to such quarter are required to be performed, the Adjusted Shareholders' Equity Amount shall be calculated on a pro forma without giving effect to such change in U.S. GAAP.

(b) Partial Payment. If the assets of the Corporation are not sufficient to pay the Liquidation Preference in full to all holders of Series B Preferred Stock and all holders of any Parity Stock, the amounts paid to the holders of Series B Preferred Stock and to the holders of all Parity Stock shall be paid pro rata in -23-
accordance with the respective aggregate liquidation preferences of Series B Preferred Stock and all such Parity Stock. (c) Residual Distributions. If the Liquidation Preference has been paid in full to all holders of Series B Preferred Stock and the liquidation preference of any Parity Stock has been paid in full to all holders of such Parity Stock, the holders of Junior Stock shall be entitled to receive all remaining assets of the Corporation according to their respective rights and preferences. (d) Merger, Consolidation and Sale of Assets Not Liquidation. For purposes of this Section 6, the merger or consolidation of the Corporation with any other corporation, including a merger in which the holders of Series B Preferred Stock receive cash or property for their shares, or the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation, shall not constitute a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation. SECTION 7. Redemption. (a) Redemption. So long as the full dividends on all outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock for the then-current Dividend Period have been paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set aside, the Corporation, at the option of its Board of Directors, may, upon notice given as provided in Section 7(b), redeem the shares of Series B Preferred Stock at the time outstanding in whole or, subject to the next succeeding sentence, in part (i) on any Dividend Payment Date during the Initial Fixed Rate Period beginning on or after the Dividend Payment Date in June 2015, (ii) on such dates with respect to any other Fixed Rate Period as the Corporation may determine prior to the commencement of such Fixed Rate Period or (iii) at any time during a Floating Rate Period. A redemption of shares of Series B Preferred Stock in part may be made pursuant to the foregoing sentence only if, after giving effect to such redemption, not less than 2,000,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock will remain outstanding. Any such redemption shall be at the redemption price of $25 per share, together, in each case, with accrued and unpaid dividends for the then-current Dividend Period to the redemption date. (b) Notice of Redemption. Notice of every redemption of shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall be mailed by first class mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the holders of record of the shares to be redeemed at their respective last addresses appearing on the books of the Corporation. Such mailing shall be at least 30 days and not more than 60 days before the date fixed for redemption. Any notice mailed as provided in this Subsection shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the holder receives such notice, but failure duly to give such notice by mail, or any defect in such notice or in the mailing thereof, to any holder of shares of Series B Preferred Stock designated for redemption shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of -24-
any other shares of Series B Preferred Stock. Each notice shall state (i) the redemption date; (ii) the number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock to be redeemed; (iii) the redemption price; (iv) the place or places where the shares of Series B Preferred Stock are to be redeemed; and (v) that dividends on the shares of Series B Preferred Stock to be redeemed will cease to accrue on the redemption date. (c) Partial Redemption. In case of any redemption of only part of the shares of Series B Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, the shares to be redeemed shall be selected either pro rata or by lot or in such other manner as the Board of Directors may determine to be fair and equitable. Subject to the provisions hereof, the Board of Directors shall have full power and authority to prescribe the terms and conditions upon which shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall be redeemed from time to time. (d) Effectiveness of Redemption. If notice of redemption has been duly given and if on or before the redemption date specified in the notice all funds necessary for the redemption have been set aside by the Corporation, separate and apart from its other funds, in trust for the pro rata benefit of the holders of the shares called for redemption, so as to be and continue to be available therefor, then, notwithstanding that any certificate for any share so called for redemption has not been surrendered for cancellation, on and after the redemption date all shares so called for redemption shall cease to be outstanding and all rights with respect to such shares shall forthwith on such redemption date cease and terminate, except only the right of the holders thereof to receive the amount payable on such redemption without interest. Any funds unclaimed at the end of three years from the redemption date shall, to the extent permitted by law, be released to the Corporation, after which time the holders of the shares so called for redemption shall look only to the Corporation for payment of the redemption price of such shares. SECTION 8. Voting Rights. (a) General. The holders of Series B Preferred Stock shall not have any voting rights except as set forth in this Section 8 or as otherwise required by law. (b) Right to Elect Two Directors Upon Non-Payment of Dividends. If and whenever dividends on Series B Preferred Stock and any other class or series of stock of the Corporation ranking on a parity with Series B Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends (any such class or series being herein referred to as "Dividend Parity Stock") have not been paid in an aggregate amount, as to any such class or series, equal to at least six quarterly dividends (whether or not consecutive), the number of directors then constituting the Board of Directors shall be increased by two and the holders of Series B Preferred Stock, together -25-
with the holders of all other affected classes and series of Dividend Parity Stock similarly entitled to vote for the election of a total of two additional directors, voting separately as a single class, shall be entitled to elect the two additional members of the Corporation's directors at any annual meeting of stockholders or any special meeting of the holders of Series B Preferred Stock and such Dividend Parity Stock for which dividends have not been paid, called as hereinafter provided, provided that the election of any such directors shall not cause the Corporation to violate the corporate governance requirement of the New York Stock Exchange (or any other exchange on which its securities may be listed) that listed companies must have a majority of independent directors. Whenever full dividends have been paid regularly on the Series B Preferred Stock and Dividend Parity Stock then outstanding, if any, for at least one year, then the right of the holders of Series B Preferred Stock and such Dividend Parity Stock to elect such additional two directors shall cease (but subject always to the same provisions for the vesting of such voting rights in the case of any similar non-payment of dividends in respect of future Dividend Periods), and the terms of office of all persons elected as directors by the holders of Series B Preferred Stock and such Dividend Parity Stock for which dividends have not been paid shall forthwith terminate and the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors shall be reduced accordingly. At any time after such voting power shall have been so vested in the holders of Series B Preferred Stock and such Dividend Parity Stock, the Secretary of the Corporation may, and upon the written request of any holder of shares of Series B Preferred Stock (addressed to the Secretary at the principal office of the Corporation) shall, call a special meeting of the holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock and such Dividend Parity Stock for which dividends have not been paid for the election of the two directors to be elected by them as herein provided, such call to be made by notice similar to that provided in the by-laws for a special meeting of the stockholders or as required by law. If any such special meeting so required to be called shall not be called by the Secretary within 20 days after receipt of any such request, then any holder of shares of Series B Preferred Stock may (at the Corporation's expense) call such meeting, upon notice as herein provided, and for that purpose shall have access to the stock books of the Corporation. The directors elected at any such special meeting shall hold office until the next annual meeting of the stockholders if such office shall not have previously terminated as above provided. In case any vacancy shall occur among the directors elected by the holders of Series B Preferred Stock and such Dividend Parity Stock for which dividends have not been paid, a successor shall be elected by the Board of Directors to serve until the next annual meeting of the stockholders upon the nomination of the then remaining director elected by the holders of Series B Preferred Stock and such Dividend Parity Stock for which dividends have not been paid or the successor of such remaining director. (c) Other Voting Rights. So long as any shares of Series B Preferred Stock are outstanding, in addition to any other vote or consent of stockholders required by law or by the amended and restated certificate of incorporation, the -26-
vote or consent of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the shares of Series B Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, voting separately as a single class, given in person or by proxy, either in writing without a meeting or by vote at any meeting called for the purpose, shall be necessary for effecting or validating: (i) any amendment, alteration or repeal of any provision of the amended and restated certificate of incorporation or by-laws of the Corporation that would alter or change the voting powers, preferences or special rights of the Series B Preferred Stock so as to affect them adversely; provided, however, that the amendment of the amended and restated certificate of incorporation so as to authorize or create, or to increase the authorized amount of, any Junior Stock or any shares of any class or series or any securities convertible into shares of any class or series of Parity Stock shall not be deemed to affect adversely the voting powers, preferences or special rights of the Series B Preferred Stock; (ii) any amendment or alteration of the amended and restated certificate of incorporation of the Corporation to authorize or create, or increase the authorized amount of, any shares of any class or series or any securities convertible into shares of any class or series of capital stock of the Corporation ranking prior to Series B Preferred Stock in the payment of dividends or in the distribution of assets on any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation; or (iii) consummation of a binding share exchange or reclassification involving the Series B Preferred Stock or a merger or consolidation of the Corporation with another entity, unless in each case (i) the Series B Preferred Stock remain outstanding or, in the case of any such merger or consolidation with respect to which the Corporation is not the surviving or resulting entity, are converted into or exchanged for preference securities of the surviving or resulting entity or its ultimate parent, and (ii) such Series B Preferred Stock remaining outstanding or such preference securities, as the case may be, have such rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers, taken as a whole, as are not materially less favorable to the holders thereof than the rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers of the Series B Preferred Stock, taken as a whole; provided, however, that any increase in the amount of the authorized or issued Series B Preferred Stock or authorized preferred stock or the creation and issuance, or an increase in the authorized or issued amount, of other Parity Stock and/or Junior Stock (whether such stock bears dividends on a cumulative or non-cumulative basis) will not be deemed to adversely affect the special rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers of the Series B Preferred Stock. -27-
If an amendment, alteration, repeal, share exchange, reclassification, merger or consolidation described above would adversely affect one or more but not all series of voting preferred stock (including the Series B Preferred Stock for this purpose), then only the series affected and entitled to vote shall vote as a class in lieu of all such series of preferred stock. Without the consent of the holders of the Series B Preferred Stock, so long as such action does not adversely affect the special rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers of the Series B Preferred Stock, taken as a whole, the Corporation may amend, alter, supplement or repeal any terms of the Series B Preferred Stock: (x) to cure any ambiguity, or to cure, correct or supplement any provision contained in the certificate of designations for the Series B Preferred Stock that may be defective or inconsistent; or (y) to make any provision with respect to matters or questions arising with respect to the Series B Preferred Stock that is not inconsistent with the provisions of the certificate of designations. The foregoing voting provisions will not apply if, at or prior to the time when the act with respect to which such vote would otherwise be required shall be effected, all outstanding Series B Preferred Stock shall have been redeemed or called for redemption upon proper notice and sufficient funds shall have been set aside by the Corporation for the benefit of the holders of Series B Preferred Stock to effect such redemption. SECTION 9. Other Rights. The shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall not have any voting powers, preferences or relative, participating, optional or other special rights, or qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, other than as set forth herein or in the amended and restated certificate of incorporation of the Corporation. SECTION 10. Restatement of Certificate. Upon any restatement of the amended and restated certificate of incorporation of the Corporation, Sections 1 through 9 of this certificate of designations shall be included in Article 2 of the amended and restated certificate of incorporation under the heading "Series B Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock" and this Section 10 may be omitted. If the Board of Directors so determines, the numbering of Sections 1 through 9 may be changed for convenience of reference or for any other proper purpose." -28-

(l) On or after any Election Date, (i) no downgrading shall have occurred in the rating accorded the Company's debt securities or the debt securities of any of its Significant Subsidiaries (including any "surplus notes" of PLIC) or PLIC's claims paying ability or financial strength by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization", as such term is defined in Rule 436(g)(2) of the Rules, (ii) no such organization shall have publicly announced that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, its rating of any of the Company's debt securities or the debt securities of any of its Significant Subsidiaries (including any "surplus notes" of PLIC) or PLIC's claims paying ability or financial strength and (iii) the Remarketed Securities shall continue to be rated BBB by Standard & Poor's and Baa2 by Moody's, or the equivalent of such ratings at the time of any Remarketing.

All opinions, letters, evidence, and certificates mentioned above or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be deemed to be in compliance with the provisions hereof only if they are in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to counsel for the Remarketing Agent. Section 6. Indemnification. (a) The Company shall indemnify and hold harmless the Remarketing Agent, its directors, officers and employees and each person, if any, who controls the Remarketing Agent within the meaning of the Securities Act, from and against any loss, claim, damage or liability, joint or several, or any action in respect thereof (including, but not limited to, any loss, claim, damage, liability or action relating to purchases and sales of the Remarketed Securities), to which the Remarketing Agent, director, officer, employee or controlling person may become subject under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such loss, claim, damage, liability or action arises out of, or is based upon, any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, any Interim Prospectus or the Final Prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto or the omission or alleged omission to state in the Registration Statement, any Interim Prospectus or the Final Prospectus, or in any amendment or supplement thereto, any 12
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and shall reimburse the Remarketing Agent and each such director, officer, employee or controlling person promptly upon demand for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Remarketing Agent, director, officer, employee or controlling person in connection with investigating or defending or preparing to defend against any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action arises out of, or is based upon, any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in the Registration Statement, any Interim Prospectus or the Final Prospectus, or in any such amendment or supplement, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information concerning the Remarketing Agent furnished to the Company by or on behalf of the Remarketing Agent specifically for inclusion therein which information consists solely of the information specified in Section 6(e). The foregoing indemnity agreement is in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have to the Remarketing Agent or to any director, officer, employee or controlling person of the Remarketing Agent. (b) The Remarketing Agent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its officers and employees, each of its directors, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act, from and against any loss, claim, damage or liability, joint or several, or any action in respect thereof, to which the Company or any such director, officer or controlling person may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such loss, claim, damage, liability or action arises out of, or is based upon, (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, any Interim Prospectus or the Final Prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto, or (ii) the omission or alleged omission to state in the Registration Statement, any Interim Prospectus or the Final Prospectus, or in any amendment or supplement thereto, any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, but in each case only to the extent that the untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information concerning the Remarketing Agent furnished to the Company through the Representative by or on behalf of the Remarketing Agent specifically for inclusion therein, which information is limited to the information set forth in Section 6(e), and shall reimburse the Company and any such director, officer or controlling person for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company or any such director, officer or controlling person in connection with investigating or defending or preparing to defend against any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred. The foregoing indemnity agreement is in addition to any liability which the Remarketing Agent may otherwise have to the Company or any such director, officer, employee or controlling person. (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 6 of notice of any claim or the commencement of any action, the indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 6, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the claim or the commencement of 13
that action; provided, however, that the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have under this Section 6(a) or (b) except to the extent it has been materially prejudiced by such failure and, provided further, that the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to an indemnified party otherwise than under this Section 6(a) or (b). If any such claim or action shall be brought against an indemnified party, and it shall notify the indemnifying party thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it wishes, jointly with any other similarly notified indemnifying party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party). After notice from the indemnifying party to the indemnified party of its election to assume the defense of such claim or action, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to the indemnified party under this Section 6 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. No indemnifying party shall without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding, and (ii) does not include a statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party. (d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 6 shall for any reason be unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under Section 6(a) or 6(b) in respect of any loss, claim, damage or liability, or any action in respect thereof, referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof, in such proportion as shall be appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Remarketing Agent on the other with respect to the statements or omissions which resulted in such loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Remarketing Agent, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Remarketing Agent agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this Section were to be determined by pro rata or by any other method of allocation which does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to herein. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof, referred to above in this Section shall be deemed to include, for purposes of this Section 6(d), any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding 14
the provisions of this Section 6(d), the Remarketing Agent shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Remarketed Securities distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which the Remarketing Agent has otherwise paid or become liable to pay by reason of any untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. (e) The Remarketing Agent confirms and the Company acknowledges that the statements with respect to the Remarketing of the Remarketed Securities by the Remarketing Agent to be set forth on the cover page of, and the concession and reallowance figures to appear under the caption "Underwriting" in, the Final Prospectus as of any Remarketing Settlement Date are correct and constitute the only information concerning the Remarketing Agent to have been furnished in writing to the Company by or on behalf of the Remarketing Agent specifically for inclusion in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus. Section 7. Resignation and Removal of Remarketing Agent. The Remarketing Agent may resign and be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder, and the Company may remove the Remarketing Agent, by giving 30 days' prior written notice, in the case of a resignation, to the Company and the Clearing Agency Participant, and, in the case of a removal, such removed Remarketing Agent and the Clearing Agency Participant; provided, however, that (i) the Company may not remove the Remarketing Agent unless (A) the Remarketing Agent becomes involved as debtor in a bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceeding, (B) the Remarketing Agent shall not be among the five underwriters with the largest volume underwritten in dollars, on a lead or co-managed basis, of U.S. domestic preferred securities during the twelve-month period ended as of the last calendar quarter preceding the Scheduled Remarketing Date, (C) the Remarketing Agent shall be subject to any restriction preventing the performance of its obligations hereunder or (D) the distribution rates provided by the Remarketing Agent in connection with remarketings of securities by it in the twelve month period ended as of the end of the last calendar quarter preceding a Remarketing Date shall not be among the lowest remarketing distribution rates provided by the top three underwriters during such 12 month period and (ii) no such resignation nor any such removal shall become effective until the Company shall have appointed at least one nationally recognized broker-dealer as successor Remarketing Agent and such successor Remarketing Agent shall have entered into a remarketing agreement with the Company in which it shall have agreed to conduct the Remarketing in accordance with the Remarketing Procedures. In such case, the Company will use its best efforts to appoint a successor Remarketing Agent and enter into such a remarketing agreement with such person as soon as reasonably practicable. The provisions of Sections 3 and 6 shall survive the resignation or removal of the Remarketing Agent pursuant to this Agreement. Section 8. Dealing in the Remarketed Securities. The Remarketing Agent, when acting as a Remarketing Agent or in its individual or any other capacity, may, to the extent permitted by law, buy, sell, hold and deal in any Remarketed 15
Securities. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Remarketing Agent is not obligated to purchase any Remarketed Securities that would otherwise remain unsold in a Remarketing. To the extent the Remarketing Agent holds Remarketed Securities, the Remarketing Agent may exercise any vote or join in any action which any beneficial owner of Remarketed Securities may be entitled to exercise or take pursuant to the Certificates of Designations, with like effect as if it did not act in any capacity hereunder. The Remarketing Agent, in its individual capacity, either as principal or agent, may also engage in or have an interest in any financial or other transaction with the Company as freely as if it did not act in any capacity hereunder. Section 9. Remarketing Agent's Performance; Duty of Care. The duties and obligations of the Remarketing Agent shall be determined solely by the express provisions of this Agreement and the Certificates of Designations. No implied covenants or obligations of or against the Remarketing Agent shall be read into this Agreement or the Certificates of Designations, as applicable. In the absence of bad faith on the part of the Remarketing Agent, the Remarketing Agent may conclusively rely upon any document furnished to it, which purports to conform to the requirements of this Agreement or the Certificates of Designations as to the truth of the statements expressed in any of such documents. The Remarketing Agent shall be protected in acting upon any document or communication reasonably believed by it to have been signed, presented or made by the proper party or parties. The Remarketing Agent, acting under this Agreement, shall incur no liability to the Company or to any holder of Remarketed Securities in its individual capacity or as Remarketing Agent for any action or failure to act, on its part in connection with a Remarketing or otherwise, except if such liability is judicially determined to have resulted from gross negligence or willful misconduct on its part. Section 10. Termination. This Agreement shall terminate as to the Remarketing Agent on the effective date of the resignation or removal of the Remarketing Agent pursuant to Section 7. In addition, the obligations of the Remarketing Agent hereunder with respect to a specific Remarketing may be terminated by it by notice given to the Company prior to 10:00 A.M., New York City time, on the applicable Remarketing Date if, prior to that time, any of the events described in Sections 5(j), (k) or (l) herein shall have occurred or if the Remarketing Agent shall decline to perform its obligations under this Agreement for any reason permitted hereunder. The Company may elect to terminate a specific Remarketing on any day prior to such Remarketing. Section 11. Notices. All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing, and: (a) if to the Remarketing Agent, shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to Lehman Brothers Inc., 745 7th Avenue, New York, New York 10019, Attention: Syndicate Department (Fax: (646) 758-2018), with a copy, 16

Any such statements, requests, notices or agreements shall take effect at the time of receipt thereof. Section 12. Persons Entitled to Benefit of Agreement. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the Remarketing Agent, the Company and their respective successors. This Agreement and the terms and provisions hereof are for the sole benefit of only those persons, except that (x) the representations, warranties, indemnities and agreements of the Company contained in this Agreement shall also be deemed to be for the benefit of the directors, officers and the person or persons, if any, who control the Remarketing Agent within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act and (y) the representations, warranties, indemnity and agreement of the Remarketing Agent contained in Section 6(b) of this Agreement shall be deemed to be for the benefit of directors of the Company, officers of the Company who signed the Registration Statement as defined in Section 2(b)(II)(A) of this Agreement and any person controlling the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act. Nothing in this Agreement is intended or shall be construed to give any person, other than the persons referred to in this Section 12, any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this Agreement or any provision contained herein. Section 13. Survival. The respective indemnities, representations, warranties and agreements of the Company and the Remarketing Agent contained in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the Remarketing and shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any of them or any person controlling any of them. Section 14. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York. Section 15. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts and, if executed in more than one counterpart, the executed counterparts shall each be deemed to be an original but all such counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument. Section 16. Headings. The headings herein are inserted for convenience of reference only and are not intended to be part of, or to affect the meaning or interpretation of, this Agreement. 17

EXHIBIT A FORM OF OPINION OF COMPANY COUNSEL TO BE DELIVERED PURSUANT TO SECTION 5(D) (a) The Company has been duly incorporated and is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, with corporate power and authority to own its properties and conduct its business as described in the Final Prospectus; (b) The Company has an authorized capitalization as set forth in the Final Prospectus. (c) The Remarketed Securities have been duly and validly authorized, are fully paid and non-assessable and conform to the descriptions thereof contained in the Final Prospectus. (d) This Agreement and the Calculation Agent Agreement were duly and validly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company. (e) The Registration Statement was declared effective under the Securities Act as of the date and time specified in such opinion, the Final Prospectus was filed with the Commission pursuant to the subparagraph of Rule 424(b) of the Rules specified in such opinion on the date specified therein and to the knowledge of such counsel no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued and no proceeding for that purpose is pending or threatened by the Commission. (f) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not conflict with or result in a breach or violation of (A) any of the provisions of the certificate of incorporation or by-laws or similar organizational documents of the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries (B) any agreement or instrument listed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement, or (C) New York or Federal statute or the Delaware General Corporation Law or any rule or regulation of any New York or Federal governmental agency or body having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any of their respective properties, in the case of clauses (B) and (C), the effect of which, individually or in the aggregate, would be to affect adversely the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or to have a Material Adverse Effect; and no notice, consent, approval, authorization, order registration or qualification of or with or to any court or governmental agency or body is required for the consummation of transactions contemplated hereby, except for the registration of the Remarketed Securities under the Securities Act and such consents, approvals, authorizations, registrations or qualifications as may be required under the Exchange Act and applicable state securities laws in connection with the purchase and distribution of the Remarketed Securities by the Remarketing Agent. A-1
(g) The Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus and any further amendments or supplements thereto made by the Company prior to the Remarketing Settlement Date (except for the financial statements, the related notes and schedules therein, as to which such counsel need express no belief) appear on their face to be appropriately responsive in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act and the Rules. (h) The statements contained in the Basic Prospectus under the caption "Description of Capital Stock of Principal Financial Group Inc.", in the Series A Final Prospectus under the caption "Description of the Shares", in the Series B Final Prospectus and under the caption "Description of the Shares", and in the Final Prospectus under the caption "Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences", insofar as they describe the terms of agreements, the Remarketed Securities or Federal statutes, rules and regulations, constitute a fair summary thereof.

In rendering such opinion, such counsel may state that their opinion is limited to matters governed by the Federal laws of the United States of America, the laws of the State of New York and the Delaware General Corporation Law. Such counsel shall also state that in the course of its review and discussion of contents of the Registration Statement with certain officers and employees of the Company and representatives of the Company's independent accountants, but without independent check or verification, no facts have come to the attention of such counsel which cause them to believe that the Registration Statement (except for the financial statements, the related notes and schedules therein, as to which such counsel need express no belief) as of the date of the Final Prospectus, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading, or that, as of the date of the Final Prospectus or as of the date of such opinion, the Final Prospectus (except for the financial statements, the related notes and schedules therein, as to which such counsel need express no belief) contained or contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The foregoing opinion and statement may be qualified by a statement to the effect that such counsel does not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement or the Final Prospectus. - ---------- * To the extent no registration statement or prospectus is required under the Securities Act in connection with the Remarketing, the foregoing opinions shall be revised as appropriate to reflect such fact. A-2
EXHIBIT B FORM OF OPINION OF GENERAL COUNSEL TO BE DELIVERED PURSUANT TO SECTION 5(E) (a) Each of the Company and its Significant Subsidiaries has been duly incorporated and is validly existing as a corporation, partnership or limited partnership, as applicable, and is in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction, with corporate power and authority to own its properties and conduct its business as described in the Final Prospectus; the Company is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing under the laws of each other jurisdiction in which its ownership or lease of property or the conduct of its business requires such qualification, or is subject to no material liability or disability by reason of the failure to be so qualified and in good standing in any such jurisdiction; and each subsidiary of the Company is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation, partnership or limited partnership, as applicable, and is in good standing under the laws of each other jurisdiction in which its ownership or lease of property or the conduct of its business requires such qualification and good standing, except where the failure to be so qualified would not have a Material Adverse Effect. (b) The Company has an authorized capitalization as set forth in the Final Prospectus. All of the issued shares of capital stock of the Company conform to the description thereof contained in the Final Prospectus. All of the outstanding shares of capital stock of each Significant Subsidiary of the Company have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid and non-assessable and are owned directly or indirectly by the Company, free and clear of all liens, encumbrances, equities or claims. (c) The Remarketed Securities have been duly and validly authorized, are fully paid and non-assessable and conform to the descriptions thereof contained in the Final Prospectus. (d) This Agreement and the Calculation Agent Agreement have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company. (e) The Registration Statement was declared effective under the Securities Act as of the date and time specified in such opinion, the Final Prospectus was filed with the Commission pursuant to the subparagraph of Rule 424(b) of the Rules specified in such opinion on the date specified therein and to the knowledge of such counsel no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued and no proceeding for that purpose is pending or threatened by the Commission. (f) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not conflict with or result in a breach or violation of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under, any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement or other agreement or instrument to which the Company or its subsidiaries is a party or by which B-1
the Company or its subsidiaries is bound or to which any of the property or assets of the Company or its subsidiaries is subject or give the holder of any of the notes, debentures, or other evidence of indebtedness of the Company or its subsidiaries the right to require repurchase, redemption or repayment of all or a portion of such indebtedness by any of the Company or its subsidiaries, or result in the creation or imposition of any lien, charge or encumbrance upon any of the assets, properties or operations of any of the Company or its subsidiaries, nor will such actions result in any violation of the provisions of the certificate of incorporation or by-laws or similar organizational documents of the Company or its subsidiaries, or any statute or any order, rule or regulation of any court or insurance or other regulatory agency or governmental agency or body having jurisdiction over the Company or its subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or assets, in each case the effect of which (other than any violation of the provisions of the certificate of incorporation or by-laws or similar organizational documents of the Company or any of its subsidiaries), individually or in the aggregate, would be to affect adversely the consummation of transaction contemplated hereby, or to have a Material Adverse Effect; and no notice, consent, approval, authorization, order registration or qualification of or with or to any court or governmental agency or body is required for the consummation of transactions contemplated hereby, except for the registration of the Remarketed Securities under the Securities Act and such consents, approvals, authorizations, registrations or qualifications as may be required under the Exchange Act and applicable state securities laws in connection with the purchase and distribution of the Remarketed Securities by the Remarketing Agent. (g) To the best of such counsel's knowledge, there are no contracts or other documents which are required to be described in the Final Prospectus or filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement by the Securities Act or by the Rules which have not been described or filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement. (h) Each of the Company and its subsidiaries that are required to be organized and licensed or registered as an insurance or an insurance holding company (collectively, the "Insurance Entities") is duly organized and licensed or registered as an insurance or insurance holding company, as the case may be, in its jurisdiction of incorporation, and, in the case of an insurance company, is duly licensed or authorized in each other jurisdiction where it is required to be so licensed or authorized to conduct its business and all such licenses or authorizations are in full force and effect. Except as otherwise described in the Final Prospectus, each of the Insurance Entities has all approvals, orders, consents, authorizations, licenses, certificates, permits, registrations and qualifications (collectively, the "Approvals") of and from all insurance and regulatory authorities, as the case may be, to conduct its business, with such exceptions as would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, and all such Approvals are in full force and effect except where the failure of such Approvals to be in full force and effect would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. There is no pending or, to the knowledge of such counsel after due inquiry, threatened action, suit, proceeding or investigation that could reasonably be expected to lead to the revocation, termination, suspension or limitation of any such Approval or otherwise impose any limitation on the conduct of business of any Insurance Entity, the revocation, termination or suspension of which would have, individually or in B-2
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, and, to the knowledge of such counsel after due inquiry, no insurance or regulatory agency or body has issued any order or decree impairing, restricting or prohibiting the payment of dividends by any Insurance Entity. Except as otherwise described in the Final Prospectus, none of the Insurance Entities has received any notification from any applicable regulatory authority to the effect that any additional Approvals from such regulatory authority are needed to be obtained by such Insurance Entity in any case where it could be reasonably expected that (i) any of the Insurance Entities would in fact be required either to obtain any such additional Approvals or cease or otherwise limit engaging in certain business and (ii) the failure to have such Approvals or limiting such business would have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Company and its Insurance Entities is in compliance with all applicable insurance laws, rules, regulations, orders, bylaws and similar requirements which are applicable to it, and has filed all notices, reports, documents or other information required to be filed thereunder, in each case with such exceptions as would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. (i) Each of the Company and its bank subsidiaries, broker-dealer subsidiaries and investment advisor subsidiaries (respectively, a "Bank Subsidiary", a "Broker-Dealer Subsidiary" and "Investment Advisor Subsidiary") is duly licensed or registered as a bank, broker-dealer or investment advisor, as the case may be, in each jurisdiction where it is required to be so licensed or registered to conduct its business. Each Bank Subsidiary, Broker-Dealer Subsidiary and Investment Advisor Subsidiary has all other necessary Approvals of and from all applicable regulatory authorities, including any self-regulatory organization, to conduct its businesses, in each case with such exceptions as would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. There is no pending or, to the knowledge of such counsel after due inquiry, threatened action, suit, proceeding or investigation that could reasonably be expected to lead to the revocation, termination, suspension or limitation of any such Approval or otherwise impose any limitation on the conduct of business of any Bank Subsidiary, Broker-Dealer Subsidiary or Investment Advisor Subsidiary, the revocation, termination or suspension of which would have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. Except as otherwise described in the Final Prospectus, none of the Bank Subsidiaries, Broker-Dealer Subsidiaries or Investment Advisor Subsidiaries has received any notification from any applicable regulatory authority to the effect that any additional Approvals from such regulatory authority are needed to be obtained by such Bank Subsidiary, Broker-Dealer Subsidiary or Investment Advisor Subsidiary in any case where it could be reasonably expected that (i) any of the Bank Subsidiaries, Broker-Dealer Subsidiaries or Investment Advisor Subsidiaries would in fact be required either to obtain any such additional Approvals or cease or otherwise limit engaging in certain business and (ii) the failure to have such Approvals or limiting such business would have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect; and each Bank Subsidiary, Broker-Dealer Subsidiary and Investment Advisor Subsidiary is in compliance with the requirements of the banking, broker-dealer and investment advisor laws and regulations of each jurisdiction which are applicable to such subsidiary, and has filed all notices, reports, documents or other information required to be filed thereunder, in each case with such exceptions as would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. B-3
In rendering such opinion, such counsel may state that her opinion is limited to matters governed by the Federal laws of the United States of America, the laws of the State of Iowa and the Delaware General Corporation Law. Such counsel shall also state that in the course of review and discussion of the contents of the Registration Statement by her or by lawyers in the Company's law department under her supervision, but without independent check or verification, no facts have come to her attention which lead her to believe that the Registration Statement (except for the financial statements, the related notes and schedules therein, as to which such counsel need express no belief) as of the date of the Final Prospectus, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading, or that, as of the date of the Final Prospectus or as of the date of such opinion, the Final Prospectus (except for the financial statements, the related notes and schedules therein, as to which such counsel need express no belief) contained or contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The foregoing opinion and statement may be qualified by a statement to the effect that she does not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement or the Final Prospectus. - ---------- * To the extent no registration statement or prospectus is required under the Securities Act in connection with the Remarketing, the foregoing opinions shall be revised as appropriate to reflect such fact. B-4

Exhibit 99.2 PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL GROUP, INC. Series A Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock (Ten-Year Initial Fixed Rate Period) (Liquidation Preference Equivalent to $100 Per Share of Series A Preferred Stock) Series B Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock (Thirty-Year Initial Fixed Rate Period) (Liquidation Preference Equivalent to $25 Per Share of Series A Preferred Stock) CALCULATION AGENT AGREEMENT THIS AGREEMENT dated as of June 17, 2005, among Principal Financial Group, Inc. (hereinafter called the "Company"), a Delaware corporation having its principal office at 711 High Street, Des Moines, Iowa 50392, and Computershare Trust Company, Inc. a Colorado corporation (hereinafter sometimes called the "Calculation Agent," which term shall, unless the context shall otherwise require, include its successors and assigns), having its principal corporate trust office at 350 Indiana Street, Suite 800, Golden, Colorado 80401. Recitals of the Company The Company is issuing on the date hereof (i) 3,000,000 shares of preferred stock, each representing a share of the Series A Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock (Ten-Year Initial Fixed Rate Period) (the "Series A Preferred Stock") having a liquidation preference equivalent to $100 per share, and (ii) 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, each representing a share of the Series B Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock (Thirty-Year Initial Fixed Rate Period) (the "Series B Preferred Stock", and together with the Series A Preferred Stock, the "Preferred Stock") having a liquidation preference equivalent to $25 per share. The Series A Preferred Stock was issued by the Company pursuant to the terms of the certificate of designations dated as of June 16, 2005 (the "Series A Certificate of Designations") and the Series B Preferred Stock was issued by the Company pursuant to the terms of the certificate of designations dated as of June 16, 2005 (the "Series B Certificate of Designations", and together with the Series A Certificate of Designations, the "Certificates"). Capitalized terms used in this Agreement and not otherwise defined herein are used as defined in the Certificates, as applicable. The Initial Dividend Rates on the Series A Preferred Stock and the Series B Preferred Stock will be 5.563 % per annum from June 17, 2005 until the Dividend Payment Date in June 2015 and 6.518% per annum from June 17, 2005 until the Dividend Payment Date in June 2035, respectively (each, an "Initial Fixed Rate Period"). Thereafter, the Dividend Rates for the Preferred Stock may be at Fixed Rates determined through Remarketing of the Preferred Stock for specific periods of varying lengths not less than six months or may be at Floating Rates reset quarterly equal to the Adjustable Rate (as defined below) plus (i) 1.45%, in the case of the Series A Preferred Stock and (ii) 2.10%, in the case of the Series B Preferred Stock. The Company
desires to engage the Calculation Agent to perform certain services in connection with the Preferred Stock while the Preferred Stock bears interest at Floating Rates. NOW IT IS HEREBY, AGREED THAT: 1. The Company hereby appoints Computershare Trust Company, Inc. at its corporate trust office in The City of New York, as Calculation Agent (in such capacity, the "Calculation Agent") for the Preferred Stock, upon the terms and subject to the conditions herein mentioned, and Computershare Trust Company, Inc. hereby accepts such appointment. The Calculation Agent shall act as an agent of the Company for the purpose of determining the Floating Rates on the Preferred Stock. 2. The Company has delivered to the Calculation Agent (i) a copy of the form of the global stock certificate representing the Series A Preferred Stock and a copy of the Series A Certificate of Designations, including copies of all terms and conditions relating to the determination of the Floating Rates thereunder and (ii) a copy of the form of the global stock certificate representing the Series B Preferred Stock and a copy of the Series B Certificate of Designations, including copies of all terms and conditions relating to the determination of the Floating Rates thereunder. The Calculation Agent hereby acknowledges its receipt of and acceptance of (i) the form of the Series A Preferred Stock and of the Series A Certificate of Designations, to the extent relating to the determination of the Floating Rates on the Series A Preferred Stock and (ii) the form of the Series B Preferred Stock and of the Series B Certificate of Designations, to the extent relating to the determination of the Floating Rates on the Series B Preferred Stock. The Company agrees to give the Calculation Agent written notice of the commencement of a Floating Rate Period immediately after the Company has determined that, or is aware that, such Floating Rate Period is to commence with respect to either the Series A Preferred Stock or the Series B Preferred Stock. The Calculation Agent shall have no liability for any failure to determine a Floating Rate on a timely basis if such written notice is given to it on or after the Floating Rate Determination Date preceding the commencement of the first Dividend Period in a new Floating Rate Period. The Company agrees to give the Calculation Agent prompt written notice of the termination of a Floating Rate Period. 3. The Company hereby notifies the Calculation Agent that the Preferred Stock are being issued on the date hereof and acknowledges that it has delivered to the Calculation Agent the information, if any, required to be provided by the Company for the calculation of the Floating Rate thereunder. The Calculation Agent shall calculate the Floating Rate as follows: Except as provided below, the Floating Rate for any Floating Rate Period for the Preferred Stock will be equal to the Adjustable Rate plus (i) 1.45%, in the case of the Series A Preferred Stock and (ii) 2.10%, in the case of the Series B Preferred Stock. The "Adjustable Rate" for any Dividend Period will be equal to the highest of the 3-month LIBOR Rate, the 10-year Treasury CMT and the 30-year Treasury CMT (each as defined below and collectively referred to as the "Benchmark Rates") for such Dividend Period during the Floating Rate Period. In the event that the Calculation Agent determines in good faith that for any reason: -2-
(1) any one of the Benchmark Rates cannot be determined for any Dividend Period, the Adjustable Rate for such Dividend Period will be equal to the higher of whichever two of such rates can be so determined; (2) only one of the Benchmark Rates can be determined for any Dividend Period, the Adjustable Rate for such Dividend Period will be equal to whichever such rate can be so determined; or (3) none of the Benchmark Rates can be determined for any Dividend Period, the Adjustable Rate for the preceding Dividend Period will be continued for such Dividend Period, provided that if such preceding Dividend Period was a Fixed Rate Period, the Fixed Rate for the preceding Dividend Period will be continued for such Dividend Period. The "3-month LIBOR Rate" means, with respect to any Dividend Period, the rate (expressed as a percentage per annum) for deposits in U.S. dollars for a 3-month period commencing on the first day of that Dividend Period that appears on Telerate Page 3750 as of 11:00 a.m. (London time) on the Dividend Determination Date for that Dividend Period. If such rate does not appear on Telerate Page 3750, 3-month LIBOR Rate will be determined on the basis of the rates at which deposits in U.S. dollars for a 3-month period commencing on the first day of that Dividend Period and in a principal amount of not less than $1,000,000 are offered to prime banks in the London interbank market by four major banks in the London interbank market selected by the Calculation Agent, at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time on the Dividend Determination Date for that Dividend Period. The Calculation Agent will request the principal London office of each of such banks to provide a quotation of its rate. If at least two such quotations are provided, 3-month LIBOR Rate with respect to that Dividend Period will be the arithmetic mean (rounded upward if necessary to the nearest 0.00001 of 1%) of such quotations. If fewer than two quotations are provided, 3-month LIBOR Rate with respect to that Dividend Period will be the arithmetic mean (rounded upward if necessary to the nearest 0.00001 of 1%) of the rates quoted by three major banks in New York City selected by the Calculation Agent, at approximately 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the first day of that Dividend Period for loans in U.S. dollars to leading European banks for a 3-month period commencing on the first day of that Dividend Period and in a principal amount of not less than $1,000,000. However, if the banks selected by the Calculation Agent to provide quotations are not quoting as described above, 3-month LIBOR Rate for that Dividend Period will be the same as 3-month LIBOR Rate as determined for the previous Dividend Period. The establishment of 3-month LIBOR Rate for each Dividend Period by the Calculation Agent shall (in the absence of manifest error) be final and binding. "The 10-year Treasury CMT" means the rate determined in accordance with the following provisions: (1) With respect to any Dividend Determination Date and the Dividend Period that begins immediately thereafter, the 10-Year -3-
Treasury CMT means the rate per annum for deposits for a 10-year period commencing on the Dividend Determination Date displayed on the Bloomberg interest rate page most nearly corresponding to Telerate Page 7051 containing the caption "...Treasury Constant Maturities... Federal Reserve Board Release H.15...Mondays Approximately 3:45 P.M.," and the column for the Designated CMT Maturity Index. (2) If such rate is no longer displayed on the relevant page, or is not so displayed by 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on the applicable Dividend Determination Date, then the 10-year Treasury CMT for such Dividend Determination Date will be such treasury constant maturity rate for the Designated CMT Maturity Index as is published in H.15(519). (3) If such rate is no longer displayed on the relevant page, or if not published by 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on the applicable Dividend Determination Date, then the 10-year Treasury CMT for such Dividend Determination Date will be such constant maturity treasury rate for the Designated CMT Maturity Index (or other United States Treasury rate for the Designated CMT Maturity Index) for the applicable Dividend Determination Date as may then be published by either the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or the United States Department of the Treasury that the Calculation Agent determines to be comparable to the rate formerly displayed on the Bloomberg interest rate page most nearly corresponding to Telerate Page 7051 and published in H.15(519). (4) If such information is not provided by 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on the applicable Dividend Determination Date, then the 10-year Treasury CMT for such Dividend Determination Date will be calculated by the Calculation Agent and will be a yield to maturity, based on the arithmetic mean of the secondary market offered rates as of approximately 3:30 P.M., New York City time, on such Dividend Determination Date reported, according to their written records, by three leading primary United States government securities dealers in The City of New York (each, a "Reference Dealer") selected by the Calculation Agent (from five such Reference Dealers selected by the Calculation Agent and eliminating the highest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the highest) and the lowest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the lowest)), for the most recently issued direct noncallable fixed rate obligations of the United States ("Treasury -4-
Debentures") with an original maturity of approximately the Designated CMT Maturity Index and a remaining term to maturity of not less than such Designated CMT Maturity Index minus one year. (5) If the Calculation Agent is unable to obtain three such Treasury Debentures quotations, the 10-year Treasury CMT for the applicable Dividend Determination Date will be calculated by the Calculation Agent and will be a yield to maturity based on the arithmetic mean of the secondary market offered rates as of approximately 3:30 P.M., New York City time, on the applicable Dividend Determination Date of three Reference Dealers in The City of New York (from five such Reference Dealers selected by the Calculation Agent and eliminating the highest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the highest) and the lowest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the lowest)), for Treasury Debentures with an original maturity of the number of years that is the next highest to the Designated CMT Maturity Index and a remaining term to maturity closest to the Designated CMT Maturity Index and in an amount of at least $100 million. (6) If three or four (and not five) of such Reference Dealers are quoting as set forth above, then the 10-year Treasury CMT will be based on the arithmetic mean of the offered rates obtained and neither the highest nor lowest of such quotes will be eliminated; provided, however, that if fewer than three Reference Dealers selected by the Calculation Agent are quoting as set forth above, the 10-year Treasury CMT with respect to the applicable Dividend Determination Date will remain the 10-year Treasury CMT for the immediately preceding Dividend Period. If two Treasury Debentures with an original maturity as described in the second preceding sentence have remaining terms to maturity equally close to the Designated CMT Maturity Index, then the quotes for the Treasury Debentures with the shorter remaining term to maturity will be used. The "30-year Treasury CMT" has the meaning specified under the definition of 10-year Treasury CMT, except that (i) each reference to "10-year" in the definition of the "10-year Treasury CMT" will be "30-year" for the purposes of the "30-year Treasury CMT" and (ii) the Designated CMT Maturity Index for the 30-year Treasury CMT shall be 30 years. Each of the 10-year Treasury CMT and the 30-year Treasury CMT shall each be rounded to the nearest hundredth (0.01) of one percent per annum and the 3-month LIBOR Rate shall be rounded to the nearest one-hundred-thousandth (0.00001) of one percent per annum. -5-
The Floating Rate with respect to each Dividend Period that occurs within a Floating Rate Period will be calculated as promptly as practicable by the Calculation Agent according to the appropriate method described above. "Bloomberg" means Bloomberg Financial Markets Commodities News. "Business Day" means each Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or Friday on which banking institutions in the City of New York are not authorized or obligated by law, regulation or executive order to close. "Designated CMT Maturity Index" means the original period to maturity of the U.S. Treasury securities with respect to which the 10-year Treasury CMT or the 30-year Treasury CMT, as applicable, will be calculated (which are ten years and thirty years, respectively). "Dividend Determination Date" means the second London Banking Day immediately preceding the first day of the relevant Dividend Period in the Floating Rate Period. "London Banking Day" means any day on which commercial banks are open for general business (including dealings in deposits in U.S. dollars) in London. "Telerate Page 3750" means the display page so designated on the Moneyline/Telerate Service (or such other page as may replace that page on that service, or such other service as may be nominated as the information vendor, for the purpose of displaying rates or prices comparable to London Interbank Offered Rate for U.S. dollar deposits). "Telerate Page 7051" means the display page so designated on the MoneyLine/Telerate Service (or any successor service), on such page (or any other page as may replace such page on that service), for the purpose of displaying Treasury Constant Maturities as reported in H.15(519). 4. Promptly following the determination of each change to the Floating Rate applicable to the Series A Preferred Stock or the Series B Preferred Stock, as applicable, the Calculation Agent will cause to be forwarded to the Company information regarding such Floating Rate. 5. The Calculation Agent shall be entitled to such compensation for its services under this Agreement as the Calculation Agent and the Company may agree, and the Company shall pay such compensation and shall reimburse the Calculation Agent for all reasonable expenses, including fees and expenses of its counsel, disbursements and advances incurred or made by the Calculation Agent in connection with the services rendered by it under this Agreement, upon receipt of such invoices as the Company shall reasonably require. 6. Notwithstanding any redemption of the Series A Preferred Stock or the Series B Preferred Stock, as applicable, the Company will indemnify the Calculation Agent and its nominees against any losses, liabilities, costs, claims, actions or demands which it may incur or -6-
sustain or which may be made against it in connection with its appointment or the exercise of its powers and duties hereunder as well as the reasonable costs, including the reasonable expenses and fees of counsel, in defending any claim, action or demand, except such as may result from the negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith of the Calculation Agent or any of its employees. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, the Calculation Agent shall incur no liability and shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Company for, or in respect of, any actions taken or suffered to be taken in good faith by the Calculation Agent or its nominees in reliance upon (i) the written opinion or advice of counsel or (ii) written instructions from the Company. 7. The Calculation Agent accepts its obligations herein set forth upon the terms and conditions hereof, including the following, to all of which the Company agrees: (i) in acting under this Agreement and in connection with the Preferred Stock, the Calculation Agent, acting as agent for the Company, does not assume any obligation towards, or any relationship of agency or trust for or with, any of the purchasers of the Preferred Stock; (ii) unless herein otherwise specifically provided, any order, certificate, notice, request or communication from the Company made or given under any provision of this Agreement shall be sufficient if signed by any person whom the Calculation Agent reasonably believes to be a duly authorized officer or attorney-in-fact of the Company; (iii) the Calculation Agent shall be obligated to perform only such duties as are set forth specifically herein, and no other duties or obligations on the part of the Calculation Agent, in its capacity as such, shall be implied by this Agreement; (iv) the Calculation Agent shall be protected and shall incur no liability for or in respect of any action taken or omitted to be taken or anything suffered by it or its nominees in reliance upon anything contained in the Preferred Stock, the Certificates or any information supplied to it in writing by the Company pursuant to this Agreement, including the information supplied pursuant to paragraph 3 above; (v) the Calculation Agent, whether acting for itself or in any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of the Preferred Stock with the same rights as it would have had if it were not acting hereunder as Calculation Agent; (vi) the Calculation Agent or its nominees shall incur no liability hereunder except for loss sustained by reason of its negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith; (vii) The Calculation Agent shall have the right, but not the obligation, to consult with counsel of its choice and shall not be liable for action taken or -7-

(a) The Calculation Agent or its nominees shall not be responsible to the Company or any third party for any failure of any bank or financial institution selected by the Calculation Agent (after consultation with the Company) for the purpose of quoting rates in accordance with the terms of the Preferred Stock and the Certificates to fulfill their duties or meet their obligations to provide such rates or as a result of the Calculation Agent having acted (except in the event of negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith) on any quotation or other information given by any such bank or financial institution which subsequently may be found to be incorrect. (b) Except as provided below, the Calculation Agent may at any time resign as Calculation Agent by giving written notice to the Company of such intention on its part, specifying the date on which its desired resignation shall become effective, provided that such notice shall be given not less than 60 days prior to the said effective date unless the Company otherwise agrees in writing.
