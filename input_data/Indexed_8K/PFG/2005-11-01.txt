RELEASE: On receipt MEDIA CONTACT: Jeff Rader, 515-247-7883, rader.jeff@principal.com INVESTOR RELATIONS CONTACT: Tom Graf, 515-235-9500, investor-relations@principal.com PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL GROUP, INC. REPORTS THIRD QUARTER 2005 RESULTS Des Moines, IA (October 31, 2005) - Principal Financial Group, Inc. (NYSE: PFG) today announced net income available to common stockholders for the three months ended September 30, 2005, of $210.0 million, or $0.74 per diluted share. This compares to $298.8 million (which included gains of $94.1 million associated with the sale of Principal Residential Mortgage, Inc. and $10.1 million associated with the sale of operations in Argentina), or $0.95 per diluted share for the three months ended September 30, 2004. The company reported operating earnings of $214.3 million for third quarter 2005(1), compared to $205.2 million for third quarter 2004. Operating earnings per diluted share (EPS) for third quarter 2005 were $0.75 compared to $0.66 for the same period in 2004. Operating revenues for third quarter 2005 were $2,221.9 million compared to $2,111.8 million for the same period last year.(2) "With our initial public offering in October 2001, we set some aggressive long-term growth targets, including 11 to 13 percent annual growth in operating earnings per diluted share," said J. Barry Griswell, chairman and chief executive officer. "Four years later, we've established The Principal as an organization that delivers, with results year-to-date underscoring that point - third quarter EPS is up 14 percent to 75 cents, and through nine months, EPS is $2.19, an increase of 23 percent compared to the year ago period." "We committed to driving growth by building on our U.S. retirement services leadership; by leveraging our retirement leadership and expertise internationally; and by creating a successful global asset manager," said Griswell. "Again, results for the quarter and year-to-date emphasize our continued success." o Operating earnings for the company's largest U.S. retirement business, pension full service accumulation, are up 10 percent from a year ago to $62.7 million and up 12 percent through nine months to $185.5 million. o Organic full service accumulation sales were a record $1.9 billion in the third quarter, driving the nine month total to nearly $4.5 billion, and positioning the company to achieve or exceed its full year organic sales target of $5.7 to $5.8 billion. o Full service accumulation account values are up 25 percent from a year ago at $75.1 billion, including net cash flow of $1.3 billion in the third quarter, the business' best net cash flow quarter in more than 2 years. o Principal International, the company's business in Latin America and Asia delivered a record $19.7 million in operating earnings in the third quarter, contributing to 68 percent growth in earnings year-to-date. o Principal Global Investors' operating earnings improved 65 percent compared to a year ago to $18.0 million in third quarter 2005, and are up $16.8 million, or 44 percent through nine months, driven by a 41 percent or $11.8 billion increase in third party assets under management compared to the year ago quarter. "Strong growth in our retirement and asset management businesses reflects continued enhancements to distribution, improvements in investment performance, and a significantly expanded array of value-added solutions," said Griswell. "We're also making meaningful progress in profitably growing our life and health insurance businesses, with record operating revenues of $1.1 billion in third quarter 2005. And for the third quarter and year-to-date, reflecting very good sales and retention, both the Individual Life and Specialty Benefits divisions have achieved double-digit operating earnings growth, driving segment earnings up solidly to $211 million for the first nine months." 3
Additional highlights: o Net income available to common stockholders for the nine months ended September 30, 2005 increased to $654.4 million, or $2.23 per diluted share compared to $612.1 million, or $1.92 per diluted share during the same period a year ago. o Operating earnings for the nine months ended September 30, 2005 increased 14 percent to $644.5 million, from $565.1 million in the year earlier period. o Operating revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2005 increased 6 percent to $6,561.3 million from $6,202.9 million in the year earlier period. o Record total company assets under management (AUM) of $188.4 billion as of September 30, 2005, an increase of $34.0 billion or 22 percent compared to September 30, 2004.(3) o Continued strong sales of the company's other key retirement and investment products, including $817 million for mutual funds and $450 million for individual annuities in third quarter 2005, driving nine month totals to $2.5 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively. SEGMENT HIGHLIGHTS U.S. ASSET MANAGEMENT AND ACCUMULATION Segment operating earnings for third quarter 2005 were $133.3 million, compared to $123.5 million for the same period in 2004. The increase was primarily driven by a $7.1 million increase in Principal Global Investors earnings, reflecting continued strong growth in assets under management and record commercial mortgage securitization earnings, and a $5.5 million increase in pension full service accumulation earnings, reflecting continued strong growth in account values. Operating revenues for the third quarter increased 5 percent to $975.4 million compared to $931.3 million for the same period in 2004. Increased fee revenues, reflecting higher account values for pension full service accumulation and higher assets under management for Principal Global Investors, more than offset lower sales of single premium group annuities. The single premium product, typically used to fund defined benefit plan terminations, can generate large premiums from very few customers and therefore tends to vary from period to period. Excluding this product, revenues for the segment increased 8 percent. Segment assets under management continued to increase, reaching a record $159.0 billion as of September 30, 2005, up 3 percent from $154.8 billion as of June 30, 2005, and up 22 percent from $130.5 billion as of September 30, 2004. (3) Pension full service accumulation account values were $75.1 billion as of September 30, 2005 compared to $60.0 billion as of September 30, 2004. Third quarter 2005 account values reflect the fourth quarter 2004 acquisition of ABN AMRO Trust Services Company, which included $4.0 billion of account values at the time of purchase. INTERNATIONAL ASSET MANAGEMENT AND ACCUMULATION Segment operating earnings for third quarter 2005 were a record $19.7 million (which included tax benefits of $1.0 million), compared to $10.9 million for third quarter 2004 (which included tax benefits of $3.2 million). After adjusting for the tax benefits in both periods, approximately two-thirds of the increase from third quarter 2004 reflects 4
improved operating performance, primarily in the pension operations in Mexico and Brazil, driven by continued strong growth in assets under management. The increase also reflects refinement of accrued revenues in the Mexican pension business. Operating revenues were $148.4 million for third quarter 2005, compared to $136.0 million for the same period last year, primarily due to higher revenues in Mexico, including improved net cash flows from pension plan participants and higher single premium annuity sales. Assets under management for the segment were $14.7 billion as of September 30, 2005, compared to $11.8 billion as of June 30, 2005, and compared to $9.1 billion as of September 30, 2004.(4) LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE Segment operating earnings for third quarter 2005 were $65.4 million, compared to $71.6 million for the same period in 2004. Higher earnings in the Individual Life division, reflecting improved claim results, as well as in the Specialty Benefits division, reflecting improved claim results and strong premium growth, were more than offset by a decline in Health division earnings due to higher loss ratios. Operating revenues increased to a record $1,106.1 million for the quarter, compared to $1,051.8 million for the same period in 2004. Specialty Benefits revenues increased 15 percent, driven by strong sales and steady retention in each of the division's product lines. Health division revenues increased 4 percent, primarily due to higher premium per member and a 4 percent increase in total group medical covered members. Individual Life revenues were relatively flat, as the company continued its shift in marketing emphasis from traditional premium-based products to fee-based universal life and variable universal life products. Unlike traditional premium-based products, universal life and variable universal life premium are not reported as GAAP revenue. CORPORATE AND OTHER Operating losses for third quarter 2005 were $4.1 million, compared to operating losses of $0.8 million for the same period in 2004. As operations in the corporate segment are diverse, many items contributed to the variance. The primary contributor to higher operating losses was the preferred stock dividend declared in third quarter 2005, associated with the company's June 2005 issuance of non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock. The dividend reduced third quarter 2005 operating results within the Corporate segment by $9.4 million with no corresponding activity in the year earlier period. Higher earnings from real estate operations and a benefit due to tax-related matters largely offset the impact of the dividend. FORWARD LOOKING AND CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS This press release contains forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, statements as to sales targets, sales and earnings trends, and management's beliefs, expectations, goals and opinions. These statements are based on a number of assumptions concerning future conditions that may ultimately prove to be inaccurate. Future events and their effects on the company may not be those anticipated, and actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in these forward-looking statements. The risks, uncertainties and factors that could cause or contribute to such material differences are discussed in the company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004, and in the company's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2005, filed by the company with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These risks and uncertainties include, without 5
limitation: competitive factors; volatility of financial markets; decrease in ratings; interest rate changes; inability to attract and retain sales representatives; international business risks; foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; and investment portfolio risks. USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES The company uses a number of non-GAAP financial measures that management believes are useful to investors because they illustrate the performance of normal, ongoing operations, which is important in understanding and evaluating the company's financial condition and results of operations. They are not, however, a substitute for U.S. GAAP financial measures. Therefore, the company has provided reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure at the end of the release. The company adjusts U.S. GAAP measures for items not directly related to ongoing operations. However, it is possible that these adjusting items have occurred in the past and could recur in the future. Management also uses non-GAAP measures for goal setting, determining employee and senior management awards and compensation, and evaluating performance on a basis comparable to that used by investors and securities analysts. SHARE REPURCHASES In June 2005, following the Board's share repurchase authorization of up to 15.0 million shares, the company entered into an accelerated stock repurchase agreement with a third party investment bank for approximately 13.7 million shares of Principal Financial Group, Inc. common stock with an initial payment of $542.3 million, using cash proceeds from the company's June issuance of perpetual preferred stock. The transaction is subject to a market price adjustment provision based on the volume weighted average market price over the execution period. The company currently expects the program to be fully executed by the end of November 2005, and estimates paying a true-up adjustment of approximately $80 million, based on share price appreciation to date. STOCK OPTIONS The company expenses employee stock options and the employee stock purchase plan, resulting in an after-tax expense of $5.8 million and $16.3 million, respectively for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2005, compared to $5.4 million and $16.8 million, respectively for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2004.

*OPERATING EARNINGS VERSUS U.S. GAAP (GAAP) NET INCOME Management uses operating earnings, which excludes the effect of net realized/unrealized capital gains and losses, as adjusted, and other after-tax adjustments, for goal setting, determining employee compensation, and evaluating performance on a basis comparable to that used by securities analysts. Segment operating earnings are determined by adjusting U.S. GAAP net income for net realized/unrealized capital gains and losses, as adjusted, and other after-tax adjustments we believe are not indicative of overall operating trends. Note: after-tax adjustments have occurred in the past and could recur in future reporting periods. While these items may be significant components in understanding and assessing our consolidated financial performance, we believe the presentation of segment operating earnings enhances the understanding of our results of operations by highlighting earnings attributable to the normal, ongoing operations of our businesses. 8
