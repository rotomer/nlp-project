ANNOUNCES OUTLOOK FOR 2006 Des Moines, IA (December 2, 2005) - Principal Financial Group, Inc. (NYSE: PFG) today announced its outlook for 2006. Based on an estimated $45 million for net realized/unrealized capital losses(1) in 2006, the company expects 2006 net income available to common stockholders to range from $2.94 to $3.09 per diluted share. The company expects 2006 operating earnings to range from $3.10 to $3.25 per diluted share. Guidance for 2006 incorporates certain assumptions, including approximately $100 million of share repurchases throughout the year and domestic equity market performance improvement of roughly 2 percent per quarter. 2006 guidance also includes expectations for: Principal Global Investors' operating earnings to be flat compared to 2005, primarily reflecting transition to the commercial mortgage securitization (CMBS) joint venture with US Bank(2); a benefit of approximately $10 million for the Specialty Benefits division due to reserve refinements to be implemented for the long term disability line; and operating losses for the Corporate and Other segment of $50 to $55 million after payment of preferred dividends(3). Company guidance does not contemplate any acquisition or divestiture activity other than where a definitive agreement has been signed by the company and publicly announced. FORWARD LOOKING AND CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS This press release contains forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, statements as to sales targets, sales and earnings trends, and management's beliefs, expectations, goals and opinions. These statements are based on a number of assumptions concerning future conditions that may ultimately prove to be inaccurate. Future events and their effects on the company may not be those anticipated, and actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in these forward-looking statements. The risks, uncertainties and factors that could cause or contribute to such material differences are discussed in the company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004, and in the company's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2005, filed by the company with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Other items the company is unable to predict could significantly affect results such as mark-to-market on derivatives and seed money investments, changes to laws, regulations, or accounting standards, litigation, and gains or losses from discontinued operations. (2) The CMBS joint venture will not be consolidated onto the company's balance sheet, which will have the effect of lowering total company debt by approximately $250 million from 2005 levels. (3) The company issued perpetual preferred stock in August 2005. Corporate segment results for 2005 will reflect perpetual preferred dividends declared in third quarter 2005 and fourth quarter of 2005.
