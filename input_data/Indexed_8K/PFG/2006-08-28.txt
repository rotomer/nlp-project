ITEM 1.01. ENTRY INTO MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT. On August 22, 2006, the board of directors of Principal Financial Group, Inc. (the "Company") agreed to revise three components of director compensation. ANNUAL RETAINER Beginning in November 2006, directors who are not officers or employees of the Company or its subsidiaries will receive an annual retainer of $60,000 (payable semiannually), an increase from the prior annual retainer of $45,000. The additional annual retainers received for serving as chair of the audit committee ($15,000), the human resources or nominating and governance committees ($10,000), and of any other board committee or as presiding director ($5,000) were not changed. DIRECTORS STOCK PLAN Beginning in May 2007, at the close of each annual meeting, each non-employee director will receive $85,000 worth of restricted stock units (unless a greater or lesser amount is determined to be appropriate by the nominating and governance committee), an increase from the existing annual grant of $75,000 worth of restricted stock units. These restricted stock units will vest upon the director's continued service to the next annual meeting. The receipt of the restricted stock units will be deferred until the director's retirement or termination from the Board. Any director first elected subsequent to an annual meeting will be granted the number of restricted stock units as determined by the committee. The board of directors has also adopted formal stock ownership guidelines for non-employee directors effective immediately. Such directors are expected to own the Company's common stock, restricted stock units and phantom stock units acquired through the Company's Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors with a value equal to or greater than five times the value of the non-employee director annual retainer. Non-employee directors are to achieve the new ownership guidelines within five years of adoption. DIRECTORS MATCHING GIFT PROGRAM Beginning immediately, Principal Life will match charitable gifts of non-employee directors to the United Way up to an annual aggregate limit for each such director of $10,000 per calendar year during a director's term and for each of the three years following the director's retirement from the board under the Directors Charitable Matching Gift Program. This is a new addition to the program, pursuant to which Principal Life currently matches the charitable gifts of non-employee directors to eligible section 501(c)(3) organizations up to an annual aggregate limit for each such director of $6,000 per calendar year. The directors who make personal charitable gifts that Principal Life matches derive no financial benefit from the Directors Matching Gift Program since all charitable contribution tax deductions for the Principal Life matching gifts accrue solely to Principal Life. 2
