EXHIBIT 99
 
 
 
Des Moines, IA (November 28, 2007)  Principal Financial Group, Inc. (NYSE:PFG) today announced its outlook for 2008. The company expects 2008 net income available to common stockholders to range from $3.95 to $4.20 per diluted share. The company expects 2008 operating earnings per diluted share (EPS) to range from $4.20 to $4.45.

Recent equity market weakness, including a meaningful drop in the S&P 500 since the end of the third quarter, has somewhat muted our outlook for 2008, said J. Barry Griswell, chairman and chief executive officer. However, reflecting continued underlying strength in our asset management and accumulation businesses, we remain committed to our longer-term goals: average annual improvement in total company return on equity (ROE) of roughly 50 basis points; and 11 to 13 percent average annual growth in EPS.

Guidance for 2008 incorporates certain assumptions, including: domestic equity market performance improvement of roughly two percent per quarter; and operating losses for the Corporate and Other segment of $50 to $60 million. Company guidance incorporates completion, in 2008, of the $500 million repurchase program authorized by the board, announced by the company on November 27, 2007. Company guidance does not contemplate any acquisition or divestiture activity other than where a definitive agreement has been signed by the company and publicly announced.
 
_________________________
1 
Guidance speaks only as of the date it is made. The company does not undertake to update annual guidance during the year, but may do so if significant changes occur in general business conditions or company operations.
2 
The range of $3.95 to $4.20 reflects the company's estimate for 2008 mortgage and credit losses only. There are a number of items the company does not predict that could significantly affect net income available to common stockholders and net income available to common stockholders per diluted share, including, but not limited to: mark-to-market on derivatives; changes to laws, regulations, or accounting standards; and gains or losses from discontinued operations.
3 
EPS, which is not measured in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP), should not be viewed as a substitute for net income available to common stockholders per diluted share determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. EPS is calculated by dividing operating earnings by weighted average shares outstanding. Operating earnings are determined by adjusting U.S. GAAP net income available to common stockholders for the effect of net realized/unrealized capital gains and losses, as adjusted, and other after-tax adjustments. After-tax adjustments have occurred in the past and could recur in future reporting periods. While these items may be significant components in understanding and assessing the company's consolidated financial performance, management believes the presentation of operating earnings per diluted share enhances the understanding of results of operations by highlighting earnings attributable to the normal, ongoing operations of the company's businesses.

Operating return on average equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive income, calculated over the trailing twelve month period.
