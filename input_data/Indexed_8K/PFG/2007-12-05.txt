Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
A non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of performance, financial position, or cash flows that includes adjustments from a comparable financial measure presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.  
The company uses a number of non-GAAP financial measures that management believes are useful to investors because they illustrate the performance of the company's normal, ongoing operations which is important in understanding and evaluating
the company's
financial condition and results of operations.  While such measures are also consistent with measures utilized by investors to evaluate performance, they are not a substitute for U.S. GAAP financial measures.  Therefore, in the back of the handouts, the company has provided reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure.  The company adjusts U.S. GAAP financial measures for items not directly related to ongoing operations.  However, it is possible that these adjusting items have occurred in the past and could recur in the future.  Management also uses non-GAAP financial measures for goal setting, to determine employee and senior management awards and compensation, and to evaluate performance on a basis comparable to that used by investors and securities analysts.  
The company also uses a variety of other measures not considered to be non-GAAP financial measures.  These are operational measures and do not have U.S. GAAP counterparts.  Assets under management is an example of an operational measure.
 
Forward Looking Statements
Certain statements made by the company which are not historical facts may be considered forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, statements as to sales targets, sales and earnings trends, and management's beliefs, expectations, goals and opinions.  The company does not undertake to update these statements, which are based on a number of assumptions concerning future conditions that may ultimately prove to be inaccurate.  Future events and their effects on the company may not be those anticipated, and actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in these forward-looking statements.
The risks, uncertainties and factors that could cause or contribute to such material differences are discussed in the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2006 and in the company's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2007, filed by the company with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These risks and uncertainties include, without limitation: competitive factors; volatility of financial markets; decrease in ratings; interest rate changes; inability to attract and retain sales representatives; international business risks; foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; a pandemic, terrorist attack or other catastrophic event; default of the company's re-insurers; and investment portfolio risks.

Outlook for 2008
* $4.10 was the First Call mean estimate as of 11/26/2007 for 2007 EPS.  The company is not affirming the reasonableness of this estimate.  It is being used for illustration only.
** The company has disclosed unsustainable items through nine months of 2007, which on the net have benefited operating earnings per share by 15 cents.
*** The S&P 500 closed at 1,407 on November 26, the day the company finalized guidance, approximately
9
% below the companys normal growth assumption. Under normal market conditions, applying the companys equity market sensitivity of roughly 5%, both ends of the range would have been approximately 4.5% higher.
