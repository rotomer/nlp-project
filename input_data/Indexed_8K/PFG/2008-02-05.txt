The following information is provided in response to inquiries by investors about exposure to subprime mortgage lending. The following is an overview of Principal Financial Group, Inc.s (PFG) investment in residential mortgages, mortgage backed securities (MBS) (including collateralized mortgage obligations (CMO) and commercial mortgage backed securities (CMBS)), and asset backed securities (ABS) (including collateralized debt obligations (CDO)). All values are as of December 31, 2007.
 
Residential Mortgages.
PFG owned approximately $1.9 billion of whole loan residential mortgages. This $1.9 billion was comprised of $1.3 billion of first and second lien mortgages to prime borrowers at Principal Bank. PFGs subsidiary, Principal International de Chile S.A., owned approximately $550 million of first mortgages to prime Chilean borrowers.
 
MBS.
PFG owned approximately $7.1 billion of MBS. This $7.1 billion was comprised of (i) $1.5 billion of AAA rated mortgage pass-through certificates in which the underlying mortgages were conforming loans backed by U.S. government agencies or instrumentalities; (ii) $937 million of CMO which were backed by 92% prime mortgages and 8% Alt A mortgages (94% rated AAA and 6% rated AA; 78% issued in 2005 or before, 16% in 2006 and 6% in 2007); and (iii) $4.7 billion of CMBS, 98% of which were investment grade, with 73% rated A- or better.
 
ABS.
PFG owned approximately $2.6 billion of ABS. This included (i) $557 million of subprime first lien mortgages, 94% of which were rated AA or better and 87% of which were issued in 2005 or before; (ii) $56 million of CDO backed by subprime mortgages (42% rated AA, and 22% rated A or A-; 36% issued in 2005 or before, and 64% in 2006 and 2007); and (iii) $966 million of CDO backed by cash or synthetic corporate debt (72%) or CMBS (28%) (100% of the CDO corporate securities were investment grade and 89% of the CMBS CDO securities were investment grade).
