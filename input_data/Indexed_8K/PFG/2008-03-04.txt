Regulation FD Disclosure
 
The following information is provided in response to inquiries by investors about exposure to monoline insurance companies (i.e., bond insurers (Monolines)) and mortgage insurance companies (Mortgage Insurers). The following is an overview of Principal Life Insurance Companys (PLIC) exposure to Monolines and Mortgage Insurers as of December 31, 2007. All values are based on GAAP carrying values, except where noted.
 
PLIC had $996.5 million of exposure to Monolines and Mortgage Insurers. Of the $996.5 million in total exposure, Monolines and Mortgage Insurers provided guarantees (Wrapped Guarantees) on $774.1 million of underlying municipal bonds, corporate credit, or asset backed securities (ABS). Of the $774.1 million, 44% was municipal bonds (99% of which was rated investment grade), 40% was investment grade bank perpetual preferreds, 9% was ABS backed by investment grade subprime first lien mortgages, and 7% was investment grade corporate bonds. PLIC owned securities issued by Monoline and Mortgage Insurers ("Direct Exposure") totaling $222.4 million. The following table provides detail of PLICs exposure in millions as of December 31, 2007:
