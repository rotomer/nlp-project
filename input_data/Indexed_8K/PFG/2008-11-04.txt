period last year.

"The Principal's results continue to reflect strong fundamentals and the benefit of earnings diversification," said Larry D. Zimpleman, president and chief executive
officer. "The
strength of our franchise continues to be demonstrated by our ability to drive positive net cash flows in our retirement and third party institutional
businesses, offsetting some of the
market headwinds."
Additional highlights include:
     
"We believe these results reflect our uncompromising focus  on helping businesses, individuals, and institutional clients achieve financial security and success 
which continues to translate into strong sales and outstanding customer retention," said Zimpleman. "We also believe these results reflect our ability to effectively manage
our businesses and investment portfolio, in a dynamic, challenging environment.

"We've maintained a broad portfolio of businesses which has helped us manage our equity market sensitivity," said Zimpleman. "Examples of our prudent risk
management include limiting the size of our variable annuities with guaranteed living benefits business, and elimination of our very modest general account securities
lending program over the last several weeks.
     
"We've also built an investment portfolio around seasoned commercial real estate and credit research capabilities, which has resulted in very little exposure to asset
classes such as subprime residential mortgages," said Zimpleman. "Wide credit spreads may continue to impact gross unrealized losses, but this is less relevant to The
Principal because our liabilities are longer-term in nature and because we have the intent and ability to hold until maturity, as evidenced by our disciplined asset/liability
matching and strong general account liquidity position."
Net Income
Net income available to common stockholders of $90.1 million reflects net realized/unrealized capital losses of $156.3 million, which includes: $114.1 million of losses related to sales and permanent impairment of fixed maturity securities (including $41.0 million related to Lehman Brothers Holdings and $41.2 million related to Washington Mutual); $15.6 million of losses on mark to market of seed money investments; $13.1 million of impairments on equity securities (including $6.5 million related to Lehman Brothers Holdings); and net capital losses of $0.9 million related to hedging activities. Net income also includes a $4.8 million loss from other after-tax adjustments due to termination of the commercial mortgage securities issuance operation.
U.S. Asset Accumulation
     
Segment operating earnings for third quarter 2008 were $136.5 million, compared to $186.7 million for the same period in 2007. The decline in segment operating earnings
primarily reflects results for the full service accumulation business, which generated $64.5 million of earnings in third quarter 2008. This compares to $111.0 million in third
quarter 2007, which included a $30.1 million after-tax benefit from unlocking deferred revenue and expense assumptions

. The decrease in full service accumulation earnings
from a year ago also reflects a true-up to the deferred policy acquisition cost (DPAC) asset, resulting in higher DPAC amortization expense of $7.0 million after tax, as well as a
5 percent drop in average account values from third quarter 2007, both due to significant equity market declines. Segment earnings also reflect a DPAC true-up in the individual
annuities business due to equity market declines, which resulted in higher DPAC amortization expense for the business of $6.8 million after tax.
     
Segment operating revenues for the third quarter decreased 12 percent to $1,237.5 million, compared to $1,404.9 million for the same period in 2007. Excluding the recognition
in third quarter 2007 of

The impact of unlocking deferred revenue and expense assumptions was recognized in full service accumulation's third quarter 2007 income statement through three line items,
netting to a $30.1 million after tax benefit to operating earnings, as follows: approximately $100 million of higher fee revenues, approximately $55 million of higher deferred policy acquisition cost amortization expense, and approximately $15 million of higher income tax expense.

previously deferred revenues as a result of the assumption refinements described above, revenues were down 5 percent, consistent with a 4 percent decline in
average account values for the segment.
     
Segment assets under management were $160.7 billion as of September 30, 2008, compared to $179.3 billion as of September 30, 2007.
Global Asset Management
     
Segment operating earnings for third quarter 2008 were $23.5 million, compared to $28.3 million in the prior year quarter.

The decline from a year ago reflects a
decrease in net investment income due to lower rates on escrows, lower transaction and borrower fees due to a slowdown in the real estate market, and third quarter
 
2008 severance costs.
     
Operating revenues for third quarter increased to $141.7 million compared to $138.9 million for the same period in 2007, as higher revenues in the fee mandate
business offset a decline in spread business revenues associated with a slowdown in the real estate market.
     
Unaffiliated institutional assets under management were $82.9 billion as of September 30, 2008, compared to $83.1 billion as of September 30, 2007.
International Asset Management and Accumulation
     
Segment operating earnings for third quarter 2008 were a record $44.4 million compared to $39.3 million for the same period in 2007, reflecting continued strong
growth in assets under
management and fee revenues. Several items impacted comparability between periods. Third quarter 2008 earnings included: a $5.0 million
unlocking benefit for price changes in Brazil;
and a $7.1 million experience benefit from higher yields on invested assets in Chile due to unusually high inflation.
Third quarter 2007 earnings included: a $9.2 million unlocking benefit
from regulations enacted that quarter in Mexico; and a $5.1 million experience benefit from higher
yields on invested assets in Chile due to unusually high inflation. Excluding these
items, earnings for the segment increased 29 percent compared to the year ago quarter.
     
Operating revenues were $265.5 million for third quarter 2008, compared to $224.6 million for the same period last year primarily due to higher investment
yields in Chile.
     
Segment assets under management were $28.6 billion as of September 30, 2008, compared to $26.9 billion as of September 30, 2007.
Life and Health Insurance
     
Segment operating earnings for third quarter 2008 were $73.9 million, compared to $73.4 million for the same period in 2007. Specialty Benefits earnings were a record
$31.2 million, compared to $27.4 million in third quarter 2007, primarily due to favorable claims experience. Health division earnings were $21.5 million, compared to $19.0
million for third quarter 2007, primarily reflecting favorable development

of claims from June 30, 2008. Individual Life earnings were $21.2 million, compared to $27.0 million in third quarter 2007, primarily due to higher DPAC amortization
expense in third quarter 2008 resulting from equity market declines, and lower earnings from prepayment fee income.
     
Operating revenues were $1,158.9 million, compared to $1,211.6 million for the same period a year ago. Revenues in the Individual Life and Specialty Benefits
divisions increased slightly from 2007. Health revenues decreased 12 percent, primarily due to a decline in covered members.
Corporate and Other
     
Operating losses for third quarter 2008 were $27.1 million, compared to operating losses of $11.7 million for the same period in 2007. The variance reflects: a charge
in third quarter
2008 of $4.1 million due to establishment of deferred state tax liabilities associated with a filing status change for a subsidiary; a $2.8 million after tax loss
in third quarter 2008 due to mark
to market of underlying investments in an equity method partnership, reflecting difficult market conditions; and higher earnings in third
quarter 2007 due to higher invested assets.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The company uses a number of non-GAAP financial measures that management believes are useful to investors because they illustrate the performance of normal, ongoing operations, which is important in understanding and evaluating the company's financial condition and results of operations. They are not, however, a substitute for U.S. GAAP financial measures. Therefore, the company has provided reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure at the end of the release. The company adjusts U.S. GAAP measures for items not directly related to ongoing operations. However, it is possible these adjusting items have occurred in the past and could recur in the future reporting periods. Management also uses non-GAAP measures for goal setting, as a basis for determining employee and senior management awards and compensation, and evaluating performance on a basis comparable to that used by investors and securities analysts.
Forward looking and cautionary statements

The company does not undertake to update or revise these statements, which are based on a number of assumptions concerning future conditions that may ultimately prove to be inaccurate. Future events and their effects on the company may not be those anticipated, and actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in these forward-looking statements.

These risks and uncertainties include, without limitation: adverse capital and credit market conditions that may significantly affect the company's ability to meet liquidity needs, access to capital and cost of capital; difficult conditions in the global capital markets and the general economy, which the company does not expect to improve in the near future, that may materially adversely affect the company's business and results of operations; the actions of the U.S. government, Federal Reserve and other governmental and regulatory bodies for purposes of stabilizing the financial markets might not achieve the intended effect; the risk from acquiring new businesses, which could result in the impairment of goodwill and/or intangible

*Operating earnings versus U.S. GAAP (GAAP) net income available to common stockholders
Management uses operating earnings, which excludes the effect of net realized/unrealized capital gains and losses, as adjusted, and other after-tax adjustments, for goal setting, as a basis for determining employee compensation, and evaluating performance on a basis comparable to that used by investors and securities analysts. Segment operating earnings are determined by adjusting U.S. GAAP net income available to common stockholders for net realized/unrealized capital gains and losses, as adjusted, and other after-tax adjustments the company believes are not indicative of overall operating trends. Note: it is possible these adjusting items have occurred in the past and could recur in future reporting periods. While these items may be significant components in understanding and assessing our consolidated financial performance, management believes the presentation of segment operating earnings enhances the understanding of results of operations b y highlighting earnings attributable to the normal, ongoing operations of the company's businesses.
