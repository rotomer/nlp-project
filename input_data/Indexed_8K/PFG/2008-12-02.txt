ITEM: Financial Statements and Exhibits
     
On November 25, 2008, the board of directors of Principal Financial Group, Inc. adopted resolutions approving revised change-of-control employment agreements that incorporate changes required by Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, and approving indemnification agreements between the company and each director and officer at the level of senior vice president and above. Forms of each agreement are attached as exhibits to this report, and the terms and conditions of the agreements are incorporated herein by this reference.
 
 
     
THIS AGREEMENT dated as of February 28, 2006 (the "Agreement Date") is made by and among Principal Financial Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (together with all successors thereto, "PFG"), Principal Financial Services, Inc., an Iowa corporation, and Principal Life Insurance Company, an Iowa corporation (together with all successors thereto, "Life") (each of the foregoing referred to individually as a "Company" or collectively as "Companies"), and __
___________
__ ("Executive").
     
The Companies previously determined that it is in the best interests of the Companies and their stockholders to assure that the Companies will have the continued service of Executive. The Companies also concluded that it is imperative to reduce the distraction of Executive that would result from the personal uncertainties caused by a pending or threatened change of control of PFG, to encourage Executive's full attention and dedication to the Companies, and to provide Executive with compensation and benefits arrangements upon a change of control which ensure that the expectations of Executive will be satisfied and are competitive with those of similarly-situated businesses. To that end, the Companies and Executive previously entered into a Change of Control Employment Agreement (the "Prior Agreement").
     
The parties have determined that the Prior Agreement should be modified to simplify its operation, clarify certain provisions and otherwise conform to changes in best practices for such arrangements arising since the execution of the Prior Agreement. This Agreement is intended to accomplish these objectives, and shall supercede the Prior Agreement in its entirety.
     
Term
. This Agreement shall have an initial term commencing on the Agreement Date and ending on the second anniversary of the Agreement Date. On the second anniversary and each subsequent anniversary of the Agreement Date, the Agreement Term shall automatically be extended for one additional year unless prior thereto the Company shall have delivered written notice (an "Expiration Notice") to Executive that the Agreement shall expire at the end of its then current term (including any extensions of the initial term that having previously occurred) (the "Expiration Date"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Effective Date occurs before the Expiration Date, then the Agreement Term shall automatically be extended to the second anniversary of the Effective Date and shall then expire. If an Expiration Notice is given but an Effective Date or a Pre-Change
of Control Event occurs before the Expiration Date, then the Expiration Notice shall be void and be of no further effect. However, if a Pre-Change of Control Event does not culminate in a Consummation Date, then the Expiration Notice shall be reinstated and the Agreement Term shall expire on the later of (
i
) the originally-specified Expiration Date or (
ii
) the date the Board determines in good faith that Pre-Change of Control Event will not result in a Change of Control.
     
Effective
. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, this Agreement shall not have any affect until the occurrence of an Effective Date. Notwithstanding anything else in the Agreement to the contrary (other than Section 1.3 hereof), the provisions of this Agreement other than Article IX shall have no force and effect unless Executive is an employee of the Companies continuously from the Agreement Date to the Effective Date.

i
) in the case of a termination of employment, Executive shall be deemed to have been terminated following the Effective Date, (and unless such termination would qualify as a termination for Cause hereunder, Executive shall be entitled to the benefits payable pursuant to Article V hereof), and (
ii
) in the case of an adverse change in employment terms and conditions, shall not be taken into account in determini ng Executive's terms and conditions of employment in any period prior to the Effective Date and shall be deemed to have occurred immediately after the Effective Date for purposes of determining whether Executive has Good Reason to terminate his employment hereunder and to receive the benefits payable pursuant to Article V.

Binding
. Any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or in connection with or relating to this Agreement or any breach or alleged breach thereof, or any benefit or alleged benefit hereunder, shall be submitted to and settled by binding arbitration in Des Moines, Iowa, in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association. Any dispute, controversy or claim submitted for resolution shall be submitted to three (3) arbitrators. The Company involved in the dispute, controversy or claim, or PFG if more than one Company is so involved, shall select one arbitrator, the Executive shall select one arbitrator and the third arbitrator shall be selected by the first two arbitrators. Any award rendered shall be final and conclusive upon the parties and a judgment thereon may be entered in the highest court of a forum, state or federal, having jurisdiction. The expenses of the arbitration shall be borne by the Companies, except that Executive's expenses shall be handled according to Section 7.1. No arbitration shall be commenced after the date when institution of legal or equitable proceedings based upon such subject matter would be barred by the applicable statute of limitations. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 7.3 or elsewhere in this Agreement, either party may bring an action in the District Court of Polk County, or the United States District Court for the Southern District of Iowa, if jurisdiction there lies, in order to maintain the status quo ante of the parties. The "status quo ante" is defined as the last peaceable, uncontested status between the parties. However, neither the party bringing the action nor the party defending the action thereby waives its right to arbitration of any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or in co nnection or relating to this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 7.3 or elsewhere in this Agreement, either party may seek relief in the form of specific performance, injunctive or other equitable relief in order to enforce the decision of the arbitrators. The parties agree that in any arbitration commenced pursuant to this Agreement, the parties shall be entitled to such discovery (including depositions, requests for the production of documents and interrogatories) as would be available in a federal district court pursuant to Rules 26 through 37 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. In the event that either party fails to comply with its discovery obligations hereunder, the arbitrator(s) shall have full power and authority to compel disclosure or impose sanctions to the full extent of Rule 37 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

Reasonableness
.
of Restrictive Covenants
     
Executive acknowledges that the covenants contained in Sections 9.1, 9.2, 9.3 and 9.4 are reasonable in the scope of the activities restricted, the geographic area covered by the restrictions, and the duration of the restrictions, and that such covenants are reasonably necessary to protect the legitimate interests of each of the Companies in their respective Confidential Information and their relationships with their employees, customers and suppliers
.
Executive further acknowledges such covenants are essential elements of this Agreement and that, but for such covenants, the Company would not have entered into this Agreement.

In recognition of the confidential nature of the Confidential Information, and in recognition of the necessity of the limited restrictions imposed by Sections 9.1, 9.2, 9.3 and 9.4 the parties agree that it would be impossible to measure solely in money the damages which any of the Companies would suffer if Executive were to breach any of his obligations under such Sections
.
Executive acknowledges that any breach of any provision of such Sections would irreparably injure the Companies
.
Accordingly, Executive agrees that if he breaches any of the provisions of such Sections, each of the Companies shall be entitled, in addition to any other remedies to which such Company may be entitled under this Agreement or otherwise, to an injunction to be issued by a court of competent jurisdiction, to restrain any breach, or threatened breach, of such provisions, and Executive hereby waives any right to assert any claim or defense that such Company has an adequate remedy at law for any such breach.
     
If a court determines that any of the covenants included in this Article IX is unenforceable in whole or in part because of such covenant's duration or geographical or other scope, such court shall have the power to modify the duration or scope of such provision, as the case may be, so as to cause such covenant as so modified to be enforceable.
     
Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Article IX, the provisions of this Article IX shall survive any Termination of Employment without regard to (i) the reasons for such termination or (ii) the expiration of the term of this Agreement.
     
Waiver
of Certain Other Rights
.
To the extent that lump sum cash severance payments are made to Executive pursuant to Article V, Executive hereby waives the right to receive severance payments or severance benefits under any other Plan or agreement with any of the Companies; provided, however, that if Executive's employment was terminated prior to the Effective Date but is deemed to terminate after the Effective Date pursuant to Section 1.3, Executive shall be entitled to retain any severance payments or benefits paid in connection with such termination, but such amounts shall apply as an offset against the benefits payable under Article V hereof.
    
 
Other
Rights
.
Except as expressly provided in Section 10.1 or elsewhere in this Agreement, this Agreement shall not prevent or limit Executive's continuing or future participation in any benefit, bonus, incentive or other Plans provided by the Company and for which Executive may qualify, nor shall this Agreement limit or otherwise affect such rights as Executive may have under any other agreements with any of the Companies

Payments
to Beneficiary
.
If Executive dies before receiving amounts to which Executive is entitled under this Agreement, such amounts shall be paid in a lump sum to one or more beneficiaries designated in writing by Executive under the Companies' group life insurance plan (each, a "Beneficiary"). If no such beneficiary is so designated, the Executive's estate shall be his or her Beneficiary. If Executive participates in more than one group life insurance plan, Executive's Beneficiary shall be the person(s) named as his or her beneficiary under whichever such plan provides Executive the largest amount of insurance coverage.
  
   
Non
-Alienation of Benefits
.
Benefits payable under this Agreement shall not be subject in any manner to anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance, charge, garnishment, execution or levy of any kind, either voluntary or involuntary, before actually being received by Executive, and any such attempt to dispose of any right to benefits payable under this Agreement shall be void.
     
Severability

ii
) the Company is materially prejudiced by such failure.
     
Settlement
. The Company will not, without the prior written consent of Indemnitee, which may be provided or withheld in Indemnitee's sole discretion, effect any settlement of any Proceeding against Indemnitee or which could have been brought against Indemnitee unless such settlement solely involves the payment of money by persons other than Indemnitee and includes an unconditional release of Indemnitee from all liability on any matters that are the subject of such Proceeding and an acknowledgment that Indemnitee denies all wrongdoing in connection with such matters. The Company shall not be obligated to indemnify Indemnitee against amounts paid in settlement of a Proceeding against Indemnitee if such settlement is effected by Indemnitee without the Company's prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.
 
     
Request
for Payment; Timing of Payment.

x
) by a committee of such directors designated by majority vote of such directors, even though less than a quorum, with the advice of Independent Legal Counsel, or (
y
) if there are no such directors, or if such directors so direct, by Independent Legal Counsel in a wr itten opinion to the Company and Indemnitee, or (

Independent
Legal Counsel. If there has not been a Change in Control, Independent Legal Counsel shall be selected by the board of directors of the Company and approved by Indemnitee (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). If there has been
a Change in Control, Independent Legal Counsel shall be selected by Indemnitee and approved by the Company (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

Consequences

Indemnitee shall be entitled to be indemnified for all Expenses incurred in connection with such a Proceeding in accordance with Section 3(b) and to have such Expenses advanced by the Company in accordance with Section 4. If Indemnitee fails to timely challenge an Adverse Determination, or if Indemnitee challenges an Adverse Determination and such Adverse Determination has been upheld by a final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction from which no appeal can be taken, then, to the extent and only to the extent required by such Adverse Determination or final judgment, the Company shall not be obligated to indemnify or advance Expenses to Indemnitee under this Agreement.
of Determination; Remedies of Indemnitee

The termination of any Proceeding by judgment, order, finding, settlement (whether with or without court approval) or conviction, or upon a plea of
nolo contendere
, or its equivalent, shall not create a presumption that indemnification is not proper or that Indemnitee did not meet the applicable standard of conduct or that a court has determined that indemnification is not permitted by this Agreement or otherwise.
     
Neither the failure of any person or persons to have made a Determination nor an Adverse Determination by any person or persons shall be a defense to Indemnitee's claim or create a presumption that Indemnitee did not meet the applicable standard of conduct, and any Proceeding commenced by Indemnitee pursuant to Section 5(f) shall be
