(b)         Each of the Company and PFS has complied and will comply with the requirements of Rule 433 under the Act applicable to any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, including timely filing with the Commission or retention where required and legending; and
 
(c)         Each of the Company and PFS jointly and severally agrees that if at any time following issuance of an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus any event occurred or occurs as a result of which such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus would conflict with the information in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus or, when taken together with the information set forth in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus, as applicable, would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the Company or PFS, as applicable, will give prompt notice thereof to the Representatives and, if requested by the Representatives, will prepare and furnish without charge to each Underwriter an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or other document which will correct such conflict, statement or omission; provided, however, that this representation and warranty shall not apply to any statements or omissions in an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus made in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company and PFS by an Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein.
 
7.         Whether or not any sale of the Securities is consummated, each of the Company and PFS jointly and severally covenants and agrees with the several Underwriters that the Company and PFS will pay or cause to be paid the following: (i) the fees, disbursements and expenses of the Company's counsel, PFS's counsel and the Company's accountants in connection with the registration of the Securities and the Guarantees under the Act and all other expenses in connection with the preparation, printing, reproduction and filing of the

It is understood, however, that, except as provided in this Section 7, and Sections 9 and 12 hereof, the Underwriters will pay all of their own costs and expenses, including the fees of their counsel, transfer taxes on resale of any of the Securities by them, and any advertising expenses connected with any offers they may make.
 
8.         The obligations of the several Underwriters hereunder shall be subject, in the discretion of the Underwriters, to the condition that all representations and warranties and other statements of the Company and PFS contained herein are, at and as of the Applicable Time and the Time of Delivery, true and correct, the condition that the Company and PFS shall have performed all of their obligations hereunder theretofore to be performed at and as of the Applicable Time and the Time of Delivery, as the case may be, and the following additional conditions:
 
(a)         The Prospectus shall have been filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Act within the applicable time period prescribed for such filing by the rules and regulations under the Act and in accordance with Section 5(a) hereof; the Final Term Sheet contemplated by Section 5(a) hereof, and any other material required to be filed by the Company or PFS pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Act, shall have been filed with the Commission within the applicable time periods prescribed for such filings by Rule 433; no order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or any part thereof shall have been issued and no proceeding for that purpose or pursuant to Section 8A of the Act against the Company or PFS or related to the offering of the Securities or the issuance of the Guarantees shall have been initiated or threatened by the Commission and no notice of objection of the Commission to the use of the Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment thereto pursuant to Rule 401(g)(2) under the Act shall have been received; no stop order suspending or preventing the use of the Prospectus or any

(b)         At the Time of Delivery, Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP, counsel for the Underwriters, shall have furnished to the Representatives such written opinion or opinions, dated the Time of Delivery, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives, and such counsel shall have received such papers and information from the Company as they may reasonably request to enable them to pass upon such matters;
 
(c)         At the Time of Delivery, Debevoise & Plimpton LLP, counsel for the Company, shall have furnished to the Representatives their written opinion and negative assurance letter, dated the Time of Delivery, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives, substantially in the form of Exhibits B-1 and B-2 hereto, respectively;

(f)          (i)  Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries shall have sustained since the date of the latest audited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Pricing Disclosure Package any loss or interference with its business from fire, explosion, flood or other calamity, whether or not covered by insurance, or from any labor dispute or court or governmental action, order or decree, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Pricing Disclosure Package, and (ii) since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Pricing Disclosure Package, there shall not have been any decrease in the capital stock of the Company in excess of 10 million shares or increase in the consolidated long-term debt of the Company in excess of $10,000,000 except for the incurrence of debt as contemplated by this Agreement or any change or any development involving a prospective change in or affecting the general affairs, management, financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Pricing Disclosure Package, the effect of which, in any such case described in clause (i) or (ii), is in the judgment of the
Representatives so material and adverse as to make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus;

(i)          Each of the Company and PFS shall have furnished or caused to be furnished to the Representatives at the Time of Delivery certificates of officers of the Company and PFS, as applicable, reasonably satisfactory to the Representatives as to the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company and PFS herein at and as of such Time of Delivery, as to the performance by the Company and PFS of all of their obligations hereunder to be performed at or prior to such Time of Delivery, as to the matters set forth in subsections (a) and (f) of this Section 8 and as to such other matters as the Representatives may reasonably request.
 
9.         (a)  The Company and PFS will jointly and severally  indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any "issuer information" filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Act, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein not misleading, and will reimburse each Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that neither the Company nor PFS shall be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any "issuer information" filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Act, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company or PFS by any Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein. The foregoing indemnity agreement is in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have to the Underwriters.
 
(b)       Each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, will indemnify and hold harmless, in each case, the Company and PFS against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company or PFS may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any "issuer information" filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) of the Act, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Disclosure Package or the Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any such "issuer information" or any such amendment or supplement thereto, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company or PFS by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein and will reimburse the Company and PFS for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company or PFS in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred. The foregoing indemnity agreement is in addition to any liability which any Underwriter may otherwise have to the Company, or PFG.
 
(c)       Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party under Section 9(a) or (b) except to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and it has been materially prejudiced by such failure and, provided further, that the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to an indemnified party otherwise than under Section 9(a) or (b).  In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party
of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section 9 for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation.  No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
 
(d)       If the indemnification provided for in this Section 9 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company or PFS on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities.  If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company or PFS on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  The relative benefits received by the Company or PFS on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Securities purchased under this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus.  The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or PFS, on the one hand, or the Underwriters, on the other, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.  The Company, PFS and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were
determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d).  The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.  No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.  The Underwriters' obligations in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.  The Company's and PFS' obligation in this subsection (d) to contribute is joint and several.
pro rata
 
(e)       The obligations of the Company and PFS under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company or PFS may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 under the Act and each broker-dealer affiliate of any Underwriter; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each employee, officer and director of the Company or PFS and to each person, if any, who controls the Company or PFS within the meaning of Section 15 under the Act.
 
10.       (a)  If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Securities which it has agreed to purchase hereunder, the non-defaulting Underwriters may in their discretion arrange for the non-defaulting Underwriters or another party or other parties to purchase such Securities on the terms contained herein.  If within thirty six hours after such default by any Underwriter the non-defaulting Underwriters do not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to the non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase such Securities on such terms.  In the event that, within the respective prescribed periods but no later than the Time of Delivery, the non-defaulting Underwriters notify the Company that the non-defaulting Underwriters have so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, or the Company notifies the Representatives that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, or the non-defaulting Underwriters are required to purchase the Securities of the defaulting Underwriters pursuant to subsection (b) below, the non-defaulting Underwriters or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Time of Delivery for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments or
 
supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in the non-defaulting Underwriters' and the Company's opinion may thereby be made necessary.  The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to this Agreement with respect to such Securities.
 
(b)       If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the non-defaulting Underwriters and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, by the Time of Delivery, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities which remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Securities which such non-defaulting Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the principal amount of Securities which such non-defaulting Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder) of the Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made by the Time of Delivery; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
 
(c)       If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the non-defaulting Underwriters and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities which remains unpurchased exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then this Agreement shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters as provided in Section 7 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 9 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
 
11.       The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company, PFS and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Company or PFS, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company or PFS, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.
 
12.       If this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 10 hereof, the Company shall not then be under any liability to any non-defaulting Underwriter except as provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof; but if the Securities are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein by reason of any failure, refusal or inability on part of the Company to perform any agreement on its part or because any other condition of the Underwriters' obligations hereunder required to be fulfilled by the Company is not fulfilled, the
Company will reimburse the Underwriters through the Representatives for all out-of-pocket expenses approved in writing by the Representatives, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of the Securities, but the Company shall then be under no further liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 10 by reason of the default of one or more Underwriters, the Company shall not be obligated to reimburse any defaulting Underwriter on account of those expenses.
 
13.       In all dealings hereunder, the Representatives shall act on behalf of each of the Underwriters, and the parties hereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any Underwriter made or given by any of the Representatives.
 
All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing, and if to the Underwriters shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the Representatives in care of Citigroup Global Markets Inc., 388/90 Greenwich Street, New York, New York 10013, Attention: General Counsel (facsimile: (212) 816-7912); Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, Eleven Madison Avenue, New York, New York 10010, Attention: LCD-IBD (facsimile: (212) 325-4296); and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., 60 Wall Street, New York, New York 10005, Attention: Debt Capital Markets-Syndicate Desk (facsimile: (212) 797-5420); and if to the Company or PFS shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the respective addresses of the Company and PFS set forth in the Registration Statement, Attention: Secretary.  Any such statements, requests, notices or agreements shall take effect upon receipt thereof.
 
14.       This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure solely to the benefit of, the Underwriters, the Company and PFS and, to the extent provided in Sections 9 and 11 hereof, the officers and directors of the Company or PFS and each person who controls the Company or PFS or any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Agreement.  No purchaser of any of the Securities from any Underwriter shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase.
 
15.       Time shall be of the essence of this Agreement.  As used herein, the term "business day" shall mean any day when the Commission's office in Washington, D.C. is open for business.
 
16.       Each of the Company and PFS acknowledges and agrees that (i) the purchase and sale of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement is an arm's-length commercial transaction between the Company and PFS, on the one hand, and the several Underwriters, on the other, (ii) in connection therewith and with the process leading to such transaction each Underwriter is acting solely as a principal and not the agent or fiduciary of the Company, (iii) no Underwriter has assumed an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in favor of
the Company or PFS with respect to the offering contemplated hereby or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether such Underwriter has advised or is currently advising the Company or PFS on other matters) or any other obligation to the Company or PFS except the obligations expressly set forth in this Agreement and (iv) the Company and PFS have consulted their own legal and financial advisors to the extent they deemed appropriate.
Each of the Company and PFS agrees that it will not claim that the Underwriters, or any of them, has rendered advisory services of any nature or respect, or owes a fiduciary or similar duty to the Company or PFS, in connection with such transaction or the process leading thereto.
 
17.       This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings (whether written or oral) among the Company, PFS and the Underwriters, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof.
 
18.      This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.
 
19.      
The Company, PFS and each of the Underwriters hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any and all right to trial by jury in any legal proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.
 
20.       This Agreement may be executed by any one or more of the parties hereto in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all such respective counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument.
 
21.       Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each of the Company and PFS is authorized to disclose to any persons the U.S. federal and state income tax treatment and tax structure of the potential transaction and all materials of any kind (including tax opinions and other tax analyses) provided to the Company or PFS relating to that treatment and structure, without the Underwriters imposing any limitation of any kind.  However, any information relating to the tax treatment and tax structure shall remain confidential (and the foregoing sentence shall not apply) to the extent necessary to enable any person to comply with securities
laws.  For this purpose, "tax structure" is limited to any facts that may be relevant to that treatment.
 
If the foregoing is in accordance with the Representatives' understanding, please sign and return to us six (6) counterparts hereof, and upon the acceptance hereof by the Representatives, on behalf of each of the Underwriters, this letter and such acceptance hereof shall constitute a binding agreement among each of the Underwriters, the Company and PFS.

At any time and from time to time after the execution and delivery of this Indenture, the Company may deliver Securities executed by the Company to the Trustee for authentication, together with a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of such Securities, and the Trustee in accordance with the Company Order shall authenticate and deliver such Securities.
 
Notwithstanding the provisions of the preceding paragraph, if all Securities of a series are not to be originally issued at one time, it shall not be necessary to deliver the Company Order otherwise required pursuant to such preceding paragraph at or prior to the authentication of each Security of such series if such Company Order is delivered at or prior to the authentication upon original issuance of the first Security of such series to be issued.

The Depositary must, at all times while it serves as such Depositary, be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act, and any other applicable statute or regulation.
 
Neither the Trustee nor any agent shall have any responsibility for any actions taken or not taken by the Depositary.
 
Section 304.           .  Pending the preparation of definitive Securities of any series, the Company may execute, and, upon Company Order, the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, temporary Securities which are printed, typewritten or otherwise produced, in any authorized denomination, substantially of the tenor of the definitive Securities of any series in lieu of which they are issued and with such appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions and other variations as the officers executing such Securities may determine, as evidenced by their execution of such Securities.
Temporary Securities
 
If temporary Securities of any series are issued, the Company will cause definitive Securities of such series to be prepared without unreasonable delay.  After the preparation of definitive Securities, the temporary Securities shall be exchangeable for definitive Securities upon surrender of the temporary Securities at the office or agency of the Company in a Place of Payment without charge to the Holder.

The Trustee is hereby appointed "Security Registrar" for the purpose of registering Securities and transfers of Securities as herein provided.
Registration; Registration of Transfer and Exchange
Security Register
 
Upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Security at the office or agency of the Company in a Place of Payment, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in the name of the designated transferee or transferees, one or more new Securities of the same series of any authorized denominations and of a like tenor and aggregate principal amount, of the same original Issue Date and Stated Maturity and having the same terms.
 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section, unless and until it is exchanged in whole or in part for the individual Securities represented thereby, a Global Security representing all or a portion of the Securities may not be transferred except as a whole by the Depositary to a nominee of such Depositary, or by a nominee of such Depositary to such Depositary or another nominee of such Depositary, or by such Depositary or any such nominee to a successor Depositary or nominee of such successor Depositary.
 
At the option of the Holder, Securities may be exchanged for other Securities, of the same series of any authorized denominations, of like tenor and aggregate principal amount, of the same Original Issue Date and Stated Maturity and having the same terms, upon surrender of the Securities to be exchanged at such office or agency.  Whenever any Securities are so surrendered for exchange, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the Securities which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive.
 
If at any time the Depositary notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary or if at any time the Depositary shall cease to be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act as provided in Section 303, the Company shall appoint a successor Depositary.  If a successor Depositary is not appointed by the Company within 90 days after the Company receives such notice or becomes aware of such ineligibility, the Company will execute, and the Trustee, upon receipt of a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of individual Securities, will authenticate and make available for delivery, individual Securities in an aggregate principal amount equal
to the principal amount of the Global Security or Securities representing the Securities in exchange for such Global Security or Securities.
 
The Company may at any time and in its sole discretion (subject to the procedures of the Depositary) determine that individual Securities issued in the form of one or more Global Securities shall no longer be represented by such Global Security or Securities.  In such event the Company will execute, and the Trustee, upon receipt of a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of individual Securities, will authenticate and make available for delivery, individual Securities in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Global Security or Securities representing the Securities in exchange for such Global Security or Securities.
 
The Depositary may surrender a Global Security in exchange in whole or in part for individual Securities on such terms as are acceptable to the Company, the Trustee and such Depositary.  Thereupon, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and make available for delivery, without service charge:
 
(1)           to each Person specified by such Depositary a new individual Security or Securities of any authorized denomination as requested by such Person in aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for such Person's beneficial interest in the Global Security; and
 
(2)           to such Depositary a new Global Security in a denomination equal to the difference, if any, between the principal amount of the surrendered Global Security and the aggregate principal amount of individual Securities delivered to Holders thereof.
 
Upon the exchange of a Global Security for individual Securities in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of such Global Security, such Global Security shall be canceled by the Trustee.  Individual Securities issued in exchange for a Global Security pursuant to this Section shall be registered in such names and in such authorized denominations as the Depositary for such Global Security, pursuant to instructions from its direct or indirect participants or otherwise, shall instruct the Trustee.  The Trustee shall make available for delivery such individual Securities to the Persons in whose names such Securities are so registered.
 
All Securities issued upon any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities shall be the valid obligations of the Company, evidencing the same debt, and entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture, as the Securities surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange.
 
Every Security presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or for exchange shall (if so required by the Company or the Security Registrar) be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to
the Company and the Security Registrar duly executed, by the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing.
 
No service charge shall be made to a Holder for any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, other than exchanges pursuant to Section 304, Section 906 or Section 1108 not involving any transfer.
 
Neither the Company nor the Trustee shall be required, pursuant to the provisions of this Section: () to issue, register the transfer of or exchange any Security of any series during a period beginning at the opening of business 15 calendar days before the day of the mailing of a notice of redemption of any such Securities selected for redemption of Securities pursuant to Article Eleven and ending at the close of business on the day of such mailing of notice of redemption; or () to register the transfer of or exchange any Security so selected for redemption in whole or in part, except, in the case of any Security to be redeemed in part, any portion thereof that is not redeemed.

Section 306.           .  If any mutilated Security is surrendered to the Trustee together with such security or indemnity as may be required by the Company or the Trustee to save each of them harmless, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a new Security of the same issue and series, of like tenor and principal amount, having the same Original Issue Date and Stated Maturity and bearing the same Interest Rate as such mutilated Security, and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.
Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen Securities
 
If there shall be delivered to the Company and to the Trustee () evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Security and () such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them and any agent of either of them harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the Company or the Trustee that such Security has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the issuing Company shall execute and upon its request the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in lieu of any such destroyed, lost or stolen Security, a new Security of the same issue and series of like tenor and principal amount, having the same Original Issue Date and Stated Maturity and bearing the same Interest Rate as such destroyed, lost or stolen Security, and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.

that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected therewith.
 
Every new Security issued pursuant to this Section in lieu of any destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall constitute an original additional contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Securities duly issued hereunder.
 
The provisions of this Section are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities.
 
Section 307.           .  Interest on any Security of any series which is payable, and is punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date shall be paid to the Person in whose name that Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest in respect of Securities of such series.  The initial payment of interest on any Security of any series which is issued between a Regular Record Date and the related Interest Payment Date shall be payable as provided in such Security or in the Board Resolution pursuant to Section 301 with respect to the related series of Securities.
Payment of Interest; Interest Rights Preserved
 
Any interest on any Security which is payable, but is not timely paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date for Securities of such series (herein called ""), shall forthwith cease to be payable to the registered Holder on the relevant Regular Record Date by virtue of having been such Holder, and such Defaulted Interest may be paid by the Company, at its election in each case, as provided in Clause (1) or (2) below:

The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of Defaulted Interest proposed to be paid on each Security and the date of the proposed payment, and at the same time the Company shall deposit with the Trustee an amount of money equal to the aggregate amount proposed to be paid in respect of such Defaulted Interest or shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for such deposit prior to the date of the proposed payment, such money when deposited to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such Defaulted Interest as in this Clause provided.  Thereupon the Trustee shall fix a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest which shall be not more than 15 days and not
less than 10 days prior to the date of the proposed payment and not less than 10 days after the receipt by the Trustee of the notice of the proposed payment.  The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company of such Special Record Date and, in the name and at the expense of the Company, shall cause notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor to be mailed, first class, postage prepaid, to each Holder of a Security of such series at the address of such Holder as it appears in the Security Register not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date.  Notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor having been so mailed, such Defaulted Interest shall be paid to the Persons in whose names the Securities of such series (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on such Special Record Date and shall no longer be payable pursuant to the following Clause (2).
 
(2)           The Company may make payment of any Defaulted Interest on the Securities of any series in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Securities of the series in respect of which interest is in default may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange (or by the Trustee if the Securities are not listed), if, after notice given by the Company to the Trustee of the proposed payment pursuant to this Clause, such manner of payment shall be deemed practicable by the Trustee.
