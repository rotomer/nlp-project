Each of the Company and PFS jointly and severally represents and agrees that, other than the Final Term Sheet prepared and filed pursuant to Section 5(a) hereof and any other Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the use of which has been consented to by the Company, PFG and the Representatives, and identified in Schedule II (a) or (b) hereto, without the prior consent of the Representatives, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, it has not made and will not make any offer relating to the Securities that would constitute a "free writing prospectus" as defined in Rule 405 under the Act;

Each of the Company and PFS jointly and severally agrees that if at any time following issuance of an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus any event occurred or occurs as a result of which such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus would conflict with the information in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus or, when taken together with the information set forth in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus, as applicable, would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the Company or PFS, as applicable, will give prompt
notice thereof to the Representatives and, if requested by the Representatives, will prepare and furnish without charge to each Underwriter an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or other document which will correct such conflict, statement or omission; provided, however, that this representation and warranty shall not apply to any statements or omissions in an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus made in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company and PFS by an Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein.
 
7.

It is understood, however, that, except as provided in this Section 7, and Sections 9 and 12 hereof, the Underwriters will pay all of their own costs and expenses, including the fees of their counsel, transfer taxes on resale of any of the Securities by them, and any advertising expenses connected with any offers they may make.

9.
                         
(a)  The Company and PFS will jointly and severally indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any "issuer information" filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Act, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse each Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that neither the Company nor PFS shall be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any "issuer information" filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Act, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company or PFS by any Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein. The foregoing indemnity agreement is in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have to the Underwriters.
 
(b)
                    
Each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, will indemnify and hold harmless, in each case, the Company and PFS against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company or PFS may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any "issuer information" filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) of the Act, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Disclosure Package or the Prospectus or
any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any such "issuer information" or any such amendment or supplement thereto, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company or PFS by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein and will reimburse the Company and PFS for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company or PFS in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred. The foregoing indemnity agreement is in addition to any liability which any Underwriter may otherwise have to the Company, or PFG.
 
(c)
                     
Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party under Section 9(a) or (b) except to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and it has been materially prejudiced by such failure and, provided further, that the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to an indemnified party otherwise than under Section 9(a) or (b).  In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section 9 for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation.  No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
 
(d)
                    
If the indemnification provided for in this Section 9 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company or PFS on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities.  If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under
subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company or PFS on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  The relative benefits received by the Company or PFS on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Securities purchased under this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus.  The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or PFS, on the one hand, or the Underwriters, on the other, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.  The Company, PFS and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d).  The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.  No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.  The Underwriters' obligations in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.  The Company's and PFS' obligation in this subsection (d) to contribute is joint and several.
pro rata
 
(e)
                     
The obligations of the Company and PFS under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company or PFS may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 under the Act, each broker-dealer affiliate and any employee, officer, director and agent of any Underwriter; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each employee, officer and director of the Company or PFS and to each person, if any, who controls the Company or PFS within the meaning of Section 15 under the Act.
 
10.       (a)  If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Securities which it has agreed to purchase hereunder, the non-defaulting Underwriters may in their discretion arrange for the non-defaulting Underwriters or another party or other parties to purchase such Securities on the terms contained herein.  If within thirty six hours after such default by any Underwriter the non-defaulting Underwriters do not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to the non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase such Securities on such terms.  In the event that, within the respective prescribed periods but no later than the Time of Delivery, the non-defaulting Underwriters notify the Company that the non-defaulting Underwriters have so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, or the Company notifies the Representatives that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, or the non-defaulting Underwriters are required to purchase the Securities of the defaulting Underwriters pursuant to subsection (b) below, the non-defaulting Underwriters or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Time of Delivery for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in the non-defaulting Underwriters' and the Company's opinion may thereby be made necessary.  The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to this Agreement with respect to such Securities.
 
(b)       If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the non-defaulting Underwriters and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, by the Time of Delivery, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities which remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Securities which such non-defaulting Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the principal amount of Securities which such non-defaulting Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder) of the Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made by the Time of Delivery; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
 
(c)       If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the non-defaulting Underwriters and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities which remains unpurchased exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then this Agreement shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters as provided in Section 7 hereof and the indemnity and
contribution agreements in Section 9 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
 
11.       The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company, PFS and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Company or PFS, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company or PFS, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.
 
12.       If this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 10 hereof, the Company shall not then be under any liability to any non-defaulting Underwriter except as provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof; but if the Securities are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein by reason of any failure, refusal or inability on part of the Company to perform any agreement on its part or because any other condition of the Underwriters' obligations hereunder required to be fulfilled by the Company is not fulfilled, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters through the Representatives for all out-of-pocket expenses approved in writing by the Representatives, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of the Securities, but the Company shall then be under no further liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 10 by reason of the default of one or more Underwriters, the Company shall not be obligated to reimburse any defaulting Underwriter on account of those expenses.
 
13.       In all dealings hereunder, the Representatives shall act on behalf of each of the Underwriters, and the parties hereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any Underwriter made or given by any of the Representatives.
 
All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing and if to the Underwriters shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the Representatives in care of Citigroup Global Markets Inc., 388 Greenwich Street, New York, New York 10013, Attention: General Counsel (facsimile: (212) 816-7912); Barclays Capital Inc., 745 Seventh Avenue, New York, New York 10019, Attention: Syndicate Registration (facsimile: (646) 834-8133); Wells Fargo Securities, LLC 301 South College Street, Charlotte, North Carolina 28288, Attention: Transaction Management (facsimile: (704) 383-9165); and if to the Company or PFS shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the respective addresses of the Company and PFS set forth in the Registration Statement, Attention: Secretary.  Any such statements, requests, notices or agreements shall take effect upon receipt thereof.
 
14.       This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure solely to the benefit of, the Underwriters, the Company and PFS and, to the extent provided in Sections 9 and 11 hereof,
the officers and directors of the Company or PFS and each person who controls the
Company or PFS or any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Agreement.  No purchaser of any of the Securities from any Underwriter shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase.
 
15.       Time shall be of the essence of this Agreement.  As used herein, the term "business day" shall mean any day when the Commission's office in Washington, D.C. is open for business.
 
16.       Each of the Company and PFS acknowledges and agrees that (i) the purchase and sale of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement is an arm's-length commercial transaction between the Company and PFS, on the one hand, and the several Underwriters, on the other, (ii) in connection therewith and with the process leading to such transaction each Underwriter is acting solely as a principal and not the agent or fiduciary of the Company, (iii) no Underwriter has assumed an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in favor of the Company or PFS with respect to the offering contemplated hereby or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether such Underwriter has advised or is currently advising the Company or PFS on other matters) or any other obligation to the Company or PFS except the obligations expressly set forth in this Agreement and (iv) the Company and PFS have consulted their own legal and financial advisors to the extent they deemed appropriate.
Each of the Company and PFS agrees that it will not claim that the Underwriters, or any of them, has rendered advisory services of any nature or respect, or owes a fiduciary or similar duty to the Company or PFS, in connection with such transaction or the process leading thereto.
 
17.       This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings (whether written or oral) among the Company, PFS and the Underwriters, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof.
 
18.      This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.
 
19.       The Company, PFS and each of the Underwriters hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any and all right to trial by jury in any legal proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.
 
20.       This Agreement may be executed by any one or more of the parties hereto in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all such respective counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument.
 
21.       Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each of the Company and PFS is authorized to disclose to any persons the U.S. federal and state income tax treatment and tax structure of the potential transaction and all materials of any kind (including tax opinions
and other tax analyses) provided to the Company or PFS relating to that treatment and structure, without the Underwriters imposing any limitation of any kind.  However, any information relating to the tax treatment and tax structure shall remain confidential (and the foregoing sentence shall not apply) to the extent necessary to enable any person to comply with
securities
laws.  For this purpose, "tax structure" is limited to any facts that may be relevant to that treatment.
If the foregoing is in accordance with the Representatives' understanding, please sign and return to us five (5) counterparts hereof, and upon the acceptance hereof by the Representatives, on behalf of each of the Underwriters, this letter and such acceptance hereof shall constitute a binding agreement among each of the Underwriters, the Company and PFS.

], 2012, relating to the Securities and the Guarantees, in the form filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act").

5.             Each of the Base Indenture and the Supplemental Indentures has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by or on behalf of the Company and constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms.

Base Indenture and delivered to and paid for by the Underwriters today in accordance with the terms of the Underwriting Agreement, (a) the 2022 Notes will constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms, and will be entitled to the benefits of the Base Indenture and the Third Supplemental Indenture, and (b) the Guarantee of the 2022 Notes by PFSI will constitute the valid and binding obligation of PFSI, enforceable against PFSI in accordance with its terms.
 
8.             The 2042 Notes have been duly authorized by the Company, and when executed by or on behalf of the Company, and, when issued and authenticated on behalf of the Trustee in accordance with the terms of the Base Indenture and delivered to and paid for by the Underwriters today in accordance with the terms of the Underwriting Agreement, (a) the 2042 Notes will constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms, and will be entitled to the benefits of the Base Indenture and the Fourth Supplemental Indenture, and (b) the Guarantee of the 2042 Notes by PFSI will constitute the valid and binding obligation of PFSI, enforceable against PFSI in accordance with its terms.

Neither the Company nor PFSI is, and, on the date hereof after giving effect to the offering and sale of the Securities in the manner contemplated in the Underwriting Agreement and the Prospectus, will not be, required to be registered as an "investment company" (as defined in the 1940 Act) under the 1940 Act.
 
10.          Subject to the assumptions, qualifications and limitations set forth in the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus, the statements of United States Federal income tax law under the heading "U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations" in the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus, when taken together, as they relate to the Securities, are accurate in all material respects.
 
Our opinions set forth above are subject to the effects of (i) bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, fraudulent transfer, reorganization and moratorium laws, and other similar laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights or remedies generally, (ii) general equitable principles (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law), (iii) concepts of good faith, reasonableness and fair dealing, and standards of materiality and (iv) limitations on the validity or enforceability of indemnification, contribution or exculpation under applicable law (including court decisions) or public policy.  Without limiting the foregoing, we express no opinion as to the validity, binding effect or enforceability of any provision of the Indenture or the Securities that purports to (i) waive, release or
vary any defense, right or privilege of, or any duties owing to, any party to the extent that such waiver, release or variation may be limited by applicable law, (ii) constitute a waiver of inconvenient forum or improper venue, (iii) relate to the subject matter jurisdiction of a court to adjudicate any controversy, (iv) grant a right to collect any amount that a court determines to constitute unearned interest, or post-judgment interest or a penalty or forfeiture, (v) preserve or seek to preserve the solvency of any guarantor, pledgor or grantor by purporting to limit (by formula or otherwise) the amount of the liability of, and/or to provide rights of contribution in favor of, such guarantor, pledgor or grantor or (vi) provide for liquidated damages or otherwise specify or limit damages, liabilities or remedies.  In addition, the enforceability of any provision in the Indenture or the Securities to the effect that (x) the terms thereof may not be waived or modified except in writing, (y) the express terms thereof supersede any inconsistent course of dealing, performance or usage of trade or (z) certain determinations made by one party shall have conclusive effect, may be limited under certain circumstances.
 
We express no opinion as to the laws of any jurisdiction other than the laws of the State of New York, the DGCL and the Federal laws of the United States of America, as currently in effect, in each case that in our experience are normally applicable to transactions of the type contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement and the Indenture without regard to the particular nature of the business conducted by the Company.
 
The opinions expressed herein are solely for the benefit of the Underwriters and, without our prior written consent, neither our opinions nor this opinion letter may be disclosed to or relied upon by any other person, except that the Trustee may rely upon paragraphs 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 of this letter as if such paragraphs were addressed to the Trustee.  This opinion letter is limited to, and no opinion is implied or may be inferred beyond, the matters expressly stated herein.  The opinions expressed herein are rendered only as of the date hereof, and we assume no responsibility to advise the Underwriters of facts, circumstances, changes in law, or other events or developments that hereafter may occur or be brought to our attention and that may alter, affect or modify the opinions expressed herein.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
We have acted as special counsel to Principal Financial Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the issuance and sale today by the Company of $[
] aggregate principal amount of its [
]% Senior Notes due 2022 (the "2022 Notes") and $[

The 2022 Notes and the 2042 Notes will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed pursuant to separate guarantees, dated as of September [

The Securities will be issued pursuant to the Indenture, dated as of May 21, 2009 (the "Base Indenture"), among the Company, PFSI, as guarantor, and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the "Trustee"), as supplemented and amended by the Third Supplemental Indenture, dated as of September [

"Indenture").  We are delivering this letter to you pursuant to Section 8(c) of the Underwriting Agreement.
 
In so acting, we have reviewed the registration statement on Form S-3 (Registration Nos. 333-174438 and 333-174438-04) of the Company and PFSI filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act"), the Time of Sale Information (as defined below) and the final prospectus supplement, dated September [

As used herein, the term "Registration Statement" means such registration statement on the date such registration statement is deemed to be effective pursuant to Rule 430B under the 1933 Act for purposes of liability under Section 11 of the 1933 Act of the Company and the Underwriters (which, for purposes hereof, is September [
], 2012, the "Effective Date"), including the information deemed to be a part of such registration statement as of the Effective Date pursuant to Rule 430B under the 1933 Act.  The term "Base Prospectus" means the basic prospectus, dated May 24, 2011, filed as part of the Registration Statement.  The term "Preliminary Prospectus Supplement" means the preliminary prospectus supplement, dated September [
], 2012, relating to the Securities and the Guarantees, in the form filed with the SEC pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the 1933 Act.  The term "Time of Sale Information" means, collectively, the Base Prospectus, the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement and the final term sheet in the form filed with the SEC pursuant to Rule 433 under the 1933 Act and attached hereto as Schedule A.  The term "Prospectus" means the Base Prospectus as supplemented by, and together with, the Prospectus Supplement.
 
We have reviewed and discussed the contents of the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus with certain officers and employees of the Company, PFSI and their subsidiaries, their inside counsel, representatives of the Company's independent accountants, representatives of the Underwriters and Underwriters' counsel.  We have not ourselves checked the accuracy, completeness or fairness of, or otherwise verified, and are not passing upon and assume no responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of, the statements contained in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information, the Prospectus or the documents incorporated by reference in any of the foregoing, and have made no independent check or verification thereof.  We have assumed the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in Section 1(p) of the Underwriting Agreement as to its status as a "well-known seasoned issuer" as defined in Rule 405 under the 1933 Act.
