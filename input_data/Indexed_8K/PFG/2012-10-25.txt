Item 2.02.  Results of Operations and Financial Condition
 
On October 25, 2012, Principal Financial Group, Inc. publicly announced information regarding its results of operations and financial condition for the quarter ended September 30, 2012.  The text of the announcement is included herewith as Exhibit 99.
 
Item 9.01   Financial Statements and Exhibits
 
99    Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Release
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
 

EXHIBIT 99
 
 
(Des Moines, Iowa)  Principal Financial Group, Inc. (NYSE: PFG) today announced results for third quarter 2012.  The company reported operating earnings of $134.8 million for third quarter 2012, compared to $193.2 million for third quarter 2011.  Third quarter operating earnings were negatively impacted by $90.7 million, or $0.30 per diluted share, as a result of the company's previously announced third quarter actuarial assumption review.  Operating earnings per diluted share (EPS) were $0.45 for third quarter 2012, compared to $0.61 for third quarter 2011. The company reported net income available to common stockholders of $179.7 million, or $0.60 per diluted share for third quarter 2012, compared to $71.9 million, or $0.23 per diluted share for third quarter 2011. Operating revenues for third quarter 2012 were $2,638.6 million compared to $2,031.7 million for the same period last year.
 
"Business momentum continued to accelerate in the third quarter.  With strong sales, net cash flows and record assets under management, we feel well positioned going into 2013.  However, we continue to see macroeconomic headwinds, including foreign exchange and low interest rates, that will pressure financial performance in the near term," said Larry D. Zimpleman, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Principal Financial Group, Inc.  "We are pleased with the continuing growth in earnings from our fee-based businesses, which gives us greater financial flexibility in this challenging time.  Our recent announcement of the intent to acquire AFP Cuprum in Chile adds meaningfully to our fee-based model, which will add to our growth and increase long-term value for shareholders."
 
Added Terry Lillis, senior vice president and chief financial officer, "Our periodic actuarial assumption review negatively impacted third quarter operating earnings.  However, the impact is a non-cash charge and therefore has no impact on our capital deployment strategy.  Backing out this impact and foreign currency headwinds, third quarter total company operating earnings were up 8 percent over normalized third quarter 2011, reflecting strong execution and growth of the businesses."
 
(1)  Use of non-GAAP financial measures is discussed in this release after segment results.

Net Income
 
Net income available to common stockholders of $179.7 million for third quarter 2012 reflects net realized capital gains of $88.8 million, which includes:
 
                 
A net gain of $141.2 million as a result of Catalyst Health Solutions, Inc.'s merger into a subsidiary of SXC Health Solutions Corp. (SXC), and our subsequent sale of our interest in SXC (now known as Catamaran Corporation);
                 
$30.7 million net loss from the change in our GMWB embedded derivative primarily from the impact on fair value due to the reduction of our own credit spread during the quarter;
                 
$22.3 million of net losses related to sales and permanent impairments of fixed maturity securities, including:
1.
              
$17.9 million of losses on commercial mortgage backed securities, which is down 24 percent from $23.5 million loss in third quarter 2011.
 
Retirement and Investor Services
 
Segment operating earnings for third quarter 2012 were $137.5 million, compared to $129.6 million for the same period in 2011. Full Service Accumulation earnings were $71.7 million compared to $69.7 million in the year ago quarter, with growth in net revenues partially offset by a $3.4 million charge from the actuarial assumption review of deposits. Principal Funds earnings were $13.4 million compared to $12.5 million in third quarter 2011, also reflecting strong revenue growth. Individual Annuities earnings were $22.7 million compared to $17.5 million for third quarter 2011. Third quarter 2012 results reflect an $11.0 million charge from the actuarial assumption review of long-term interest rate assumptions. The year ago quarter results were negatively impacted by a $9.0 million DPAC amortization expense true up due to negative equity market returns. Bank and Trust Services operating earnings were

(3)  Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income.
 
$8.8 million, compared to $9.2 million for third quarter 2011.  The guaranteed businesses, which consist of Investment Only and Full Service Payout, earned $20.9 million in the third quarter 2012 compared to $20.7 million in third quarter 2011.
Operating revenues for the third quarter 2012 were $1,570.7 million compared to $996.0 million for the same period in 2011 driven by higher sales in the Full Service Payout business.
 
Segment assets under management were $206.4 billion as of Sept. 30, 2012, compared to $168.6 billion as of Sept. 30, 2011, reflecting asset appreciation and strong net cash flows from Full Service Accumulation and Principal Funds.
 
Principal Global Investors
 
Segment operating earnings for third quarter 2012 were $20.6 million, compared to $19.1 million in the prior year quarter, primarily due to an increase in assets under management offset by additional investments to support growth.
 
Operating revenues for third quarter were $144.0 million, compared to $132.9 million for the same period in 2011.
 
Unaffiliated assets under management were a record $97.8 billion as of Sept. 30, 2012, compared to $77.7 billion as of Sept. 30, 2011, as a result of improved net cash flows and investment performance.
 
Principal International
 
Segment operating earnings were $29.5 million in third quarter 2012, compared to $35.3 million in the prior year quarter. Third quarter 2012 results were dampened by $11.5 million due to the actuarial assumption review of lapse rate assumptions in Mexico.  Combined net revenue growth was flat compared to the year ago quarter, though foreign currency headwinds continue to mask an underlying 18 percent growth.
 
Operating revenues were $203.8 million for third quarter 2012, compared to $220.1 million for the same period last year, down due to lower inflation in Chile and the strengthening of the U.S. dollar.
 
Segment assets under management were a record $66.2 billion as of Sept. 30, 2012, compared to $54.5 billion as of Sept. 30, 2011, despite currency headwinds.
 
U.S. Insurance Solutions
 
Segment operating losses for third quarter 2012 were $21.6 million, compared to operating earnings of $49.1 million for the same period in 2011. Individual Life losses were $37.9 million in the third quarter compared to earnings of $28.2 million in third quarter 2011 primarily reflecting a $62.9 million charge from the review of long-term interest rate assumptions and other model enhancements.
 
Specialty Benefits earnings were $16.3 million in third quarter 2012, down from $20.9 million in the same period a year ago primarily due to higher disability claims in the quarter due to normal volatility and a $1.9 million charge resulting from a 75 basis point reduction in the disability claims discount rate from the year ago quarter.
 
Segment operating revenues for third quarter 2012 were $766.5 million compared to $739.3 million for the same period a year ago.
 
Corporate
 
Operating losses for third
quarter 2012 were $31.2 million compared to operating losses of $39.9 million in third quarter 2011. Third quarter 2011 had $12.0 million of lower variable investment income on excess capital at the holding company due to negative marks caused by widening of credit spreads.
 
Forward looking and cautionary statements
 
This press release contains forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, statements as to operating earnings, net income available to common stockholders, net cash flows, realized and unrealized gains and losses, capital and liquidity positions, sales and earnings trends, and management's beliefs, expectations, goals and opinions. The company does not undertake to update these statements, which are based on a number of assumptions concerning future conditions that may ultimately prove to be inaccurate. Future events and their effects on the company may not be those anticipated, and actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in these forward-looking statements. The risks, uncertainties and factors that could cause or contribute to such material differences are discussed in the company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended Dec. 31, 2011, and in the company's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2012, filed by the company with the Securities and Exchange Commission, as updated or supplemented from time to time in subsequent filings. These risks and uncertainties include, without limitation: adverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect the company's ability to meet liquidity needs, access to capital and cost of capital; continued difficult conditions in the global capital markets and the economy generally; continued volatility or further declines in the equity markets; changes in interest rates or credit spreads; the company's investment portfolio is subject to several risks that may diminish the value of its invested assets and the investment returns credited to customers; the company's valuation of securities may include methodologies, estimations and assumptions that are subject to differing interpretations; the determination of the amount of allowances and impairments taken on the company's investments requires estimations and assumptions that are subject to differing interpretations; gross unrealized losses may be realized or result in future impairments; competition from companies that may have greater financial resources, broader arrays of products, higher ratings and stronger financial performance; a downgrade in the company's financial strength or credit ratings; inability to attract and retain sales representatives and develop new distribution sources; international business risks; the company's actual experience could differ significantly from its pricing and reserving assumptions; the company's ability to pay stockholder dividends and meet its obligations may be constrained by the limitations on dividends or distributions Iowa insurance laws impose on Principal Life; the pattern of amortizing the company's DPAC and other actuarial balances on its universal life-type insurance contracts, participating life insurance policies and certain investment contracts may change; the company may need to fund deficiencies in its "Closed Block" assets that support participating ordinary life insurance policies that had a dividend scale in force at the time of Principal Life's 1998 conversion into a stock life insurance company; the company's reinsurers could default on their obligations or increase their rates; risks arising from the company's ability to obtain regulatory approval and consummate the acquisition of A.F.P. Cuprum S.A. and from other acquisitions of businesses; changes in laws, regulations or accounting standards; a computer system failure or security breach could disrupt the company's business, and damage its reputation; results of litigation and regulatory investigations; from time to time the company may become subject to tax audits, tax litigation or similar proceedings, and as a result it may owe additional taxes, interest and penalties in amounts that may be material; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; and applicable laws and the company's certificate of incorporation and by-laws may discourage takeovers and business combinations that some stockholders might consider in their best interests.
 
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
The company uses a number of non-GAAP financial measures that management believes are useful to investors because they illustrate the performance of normal, ongoing operations, which is important in understanding and evaluating the company's financial condition and results of operations.  They are not, however, a substitute for U.S. GAAP financial measures.  Therefore, the company has provided reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure at the end of the release.  The company adjusts U.S. GAAP measures for items not directly related toongoing operations.  However, it is possible these adjusting items have occurred in the past and could recur in future reporting periods.  Management also uses non-GAAP measures for goal setting, as a basis for determining employee and senior management awards and compensation, and evaluating performance on a basis comparable to that used by investors and securities analysts.

Summary of Segment and Principal Financial Group, Inc. Results
 
 
 
*Operating earnings versus U.S. GAAP (GAAP) net income available to common stockholders
Management uses operating earnings, which excludes the effect of net realized capital gains and losses, as adjusted, and other after-tax adjustments, for goal setting, as a basis for determining employee compensation, and evaluating performance on a basis comparable to that used by investors and securities analysts.  Segment operating earnings are determined by adjusting U.S. GAAP net income available to common stockholders for net realized capital gains and losses, as adjusted, and other after-tax adjustments the company believes are not indicative of overall operating trends.  Note: it is possible these adjusting items have occurred in the past and could recur in future reporting periods.  While these items may be significant components in understanding and assessing our consolidated financial performance, management believes the presentation of segment operating earnings enhances the understanding of results of operations by highlighting earnings attributable to the normal, ongoing operations of the company's businesses.
