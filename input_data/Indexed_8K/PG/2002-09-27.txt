This information will be included in Chief Financial Officer Clayt Daley's presentation at the October 2nd Merrill Lynch Global Branded Consumer Products Conference. For the September 2002 quarter, volume is expected to grow double digits. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, volume growth is forecasted to be in the high single digit percent range. Sales, excluding foreign exchange, are expected to finish the quarter with growth in the high single digit range. Core earnings per share, which excludes restructuring program charges, are expected to grow in the mid teens range. "The interventions that we have made over the course of the last 18 months to sharpen our focus and improve the consumer value propositions on key brands are clearly building momentum on our top line and bottom line," said Daley. "Despite the continuation of the tough global economic environment, we continue to see a strong consumer response to our leading innovation, effective marketing and competitive pricing programs." For the fiscal year 2003, core earnings per share are expected to grow at the company's long-term growth target of double digits. Sales, excluding foreign exchange impacts, are expected to grow four to six percent.
