OTHER EVENTS As disclosed in its Annual Report on Form 10-K, on May 31, 2002, The Procter & Gamble Company (the "Company") completed its spin-off of the Jif and Crisco brands. In addition, effective July 1, 2002, the Company realigned the management of its feminine care business from Baby, Feminine & Family Care to Beauty Care. To reflect these management and business changes, the Company has realigned its internal and external reporting segments. Beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2003 (July - September 2002), the feminine care business will be included in the Beauty Care segment, and the former Baby, Feminine & Family Care segment will become Baby & Family Care. The former Food & Beverage segment will be renamed Snacks & Beverages, reflecting the remaining businesses. As required by FASB Statement No. 131, DISCLOSURES ABOUT SEGMENTS OF AN ENTERPRISE AND RELATED INFORMATION, prior year segment results have been reclassified to reflect these changes and provide comparable current and historical results. The elements of the former Food & Beverage segment that were spun off or divested, including Jif, Crisco and commercial shortening and oils, are now presented as part of Corporate. This change affects only the presentation of segment results and does not affect the consolidated results of The Procter & Gamble Company. In the Company's Form 8-K filed on October 24, 2002, selected interim segment information for 2002 was presented. In this 8-K filing, additional interim segment information is provided for fiscal 2002 and selected interim segment information is provided for fiscal 2001. Full segment information will be presented in the Company's next annual filing. P&G is filing this 8-K pursuant to the SEC's Regulation FD.
