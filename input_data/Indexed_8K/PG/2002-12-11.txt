News Release by The Procter & Gamble Company dated December 11, 2002.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE --------------------- PROCTER & GAMBLE - SECOND QUARTER 2002/03 UPDATE ------------------------------------------------ PROCTER & GAMBLE GUIDES HIGHER ON BOTTOM LINE CINCINNATI, Dec. 11, 2002 - The Procter & Gamble Company today stated that it is raising its estimated earnings per share growth for the December 2002 quarter behind higher operating margin growth versus previous guidance. Volume is expected to grow in the high single digits behind strong performance by the health care business unit and continued strength in developing markets. The net impact of acquisitions and divestitures is expected to contribute less than one percent to volume growth during the quarter. Sales are expected to finish the quarter in the mid to high single digit range versus year ago. Currently, foreign exchange is expected to have no impact on the top line. Core earnings per share, which exclude restructuring charges, are expected to grow in the high single digit range and above current consensus estimates. Earnings in the base period include a one-time gain from the divestiture of Comet. Excluding this impact earnings would have grown in the mid teens. This increase in core earnings is also expected to be accretive versus the current fiscal year consensus estimates. The company is comfortable with existing consensus estimates for the January to June 2003 period. Operating margin growth for the quarter is expected to be toward the upper end of the previous guidance range of 100 to 150 basis points. This improvement is driven by gross margin expansion and reduced overhead expenses. For the fiscal year, the company expects to achieve its long-term growth rates. Core earnings per share are expected to grow double digits. The growth in reported earnings will exceed the growth in core earnings due to lower restructuring charges versus the prior year. Sales, excluding foreign exchange impacts, are expected to grow four to six percent. Foreign exchange effects are expected to have a slightly positive impact on the top-line for the year.
