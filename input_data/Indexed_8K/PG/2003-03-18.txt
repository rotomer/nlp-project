THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY /s/SHARON E. ABRAMS ------------------------------------ Sharon E. Abrams, Secretary March 18, 2003 Exhibit 99. News Release by The Procter & Gamble Company dated March 18, 2003.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE --------------------- PROCTER & GAMBLE ACQUIRES CONTROLLING INTEREST IN WELLA WILL NOW MAKE TENDER OFFER FOR REMAINING SHARES CINCINNATI, USA and DARMSTADT, Germany - March 18, 2003 - The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE: PG) today said that it has signed an agreement to purchase a controlling interest from the majority shareholders of Wella AG (FSE: WAD) headquartered in Darmstadt, Germany. The cash purchase of (euro)3.2 billion gives P&G 77.6% of Wella's voting shares. P&G also announced today that it intends to make a tender offer for the remaining voting and preference shares of Wella. P&G will offer a cash price of (euro)92.25 per share for the voting shares, and (euro)61.50 per share for the preference shares, valuing the total shares at (euro)5.4 billion. P&G may, however, offer Wella's preference shareholders the option of accepting P&G shares as an alternative to the cash offer. This deal is subject to normal regulatory review and government approvals in various markets including the European Union and the U.S. "Wella is a leading beauty and hair care company with strong brands, excellent management and an organization with deep expertise in the beauty business," said A.G. Lafley, chairman of the board, president and chief executive of P&G. "This acquisition is a great strategic fit given P&G's leadership and proven strength in its core hair care business. The deal further expands P&G's beauty businesses across Eastern and Western Europe, and in Latin America." "P&G and Wella are in highly complementary businesses," said Lafley. "Wella's strength in professional hair care complements P&G's strength in retail hair care. Wella's strength in color and styling, complements P&G's strength in shampoo and conditioners. Wella's strength in Europe complements P&G's strength in North America. By bringing these complementary businesses together, we create significant opportunities for top and bottom line growth in hair care." "The P&G and Wella combination is also highly synergistic," said Lafley. "With global geographic scale, we expect to generate significant efficiencies." This acquisition is expected to contribute about (euro)3.4 billion in sales to P&G's overall beauty business - approximately (euro)1.6 billion in the professional hair care segment; (euro)1.0 billion in the retail hair care segment; and (euro)800 million in fragrances. WELLA ACQUISITION IS ON STRATEGY FOR P&G - ---------------------------------------- o The deal is in line with P&G's strategy to strengthen its core businesses and focus on higher-growth, higher-margin businesses. Wella's professional business has averaged double-digit sales growth over the last three years - well ahead of the annual industry growth of about 5 percent. o The deal is expected to help drive innovation across P&G's entire hair care portfolio. o The timing is right for this acquisition as P&G's overall business, and particularly its hair care business, are both strong with solid fundamentals in place. P&G AND WELLA ARE HIGHLY COMPLEMENTARY - -------------------------------------- o Professional salon hair care sales are $10 billion globally. Wella estimates it has a 22 percent global share -- the number two position in the world. P&G, through its Clairol(R) brands, has a relatively small professional presence in North America. o The global retail hair care market is a $34 billion industry. P&G has annual sales of more than $4.5 billion with leading brands such as Pantene(R), Head & Shoulders(R) and Herbal Essences(R). Wella is complementary to P&G from both a geographic and category perspective. o The size of the global fine fragrance market is approximately $20 billion. Wella's and P&G's combined sales in fragrances are more than $1.0 billion. Wella markets several brands that are, or have the potential to become, classics such as Gucci(R), Rochas(R), Escada(R) and Montblanc(R). These fragrances, marketed to females, complement P&G's male-oriented fragrances like Lacoste(R) and Hugo Boss(R) (the leading male fine fragrance in the world). THE DEAL OFFERS P&G SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITY FOR SYNERGY - ------------------------------------------------------- Synergies to be gained from the combination of P&G and Wella are projected to be at least (euro)300 million by the third year. P&G said it expects to keep Wella's professional salon business largely intact. THE PURCHASE - ------------ In addition to the equity offer of (euro)5.4 billion for Wella, P&G will assume net debt of (euro)1.1 billion, bringing the total enterprise value to (euro)6.5 billion. With Wella's annual sales of (euro)3.4 billion for the 2002 calendar year, the total enterprise value of (euro)6.5 billion is roughly 1.9 times sales, after taking the year-three synergies into account, a 10-times projected EBIT multiple. The purchase is expected to have a neutral earnings effect in year one. Going forward, P&G expects the purchase to be slightly accretive to earnings per share in year two, and solidly accretive in year three.

The company's three divisions include professional hair care, retail hair care, and cosmetics and fragrances. Some of its well-known brands include Wella(R), Koleston(R), Sebastian(R), Graham Webb(R) and High Hair(R) professional hair care lines; Wellaflex(R), ShockWaves(R), Ultra Sheen(R), and Vivality(R) consumer retail hair care products; Gucci(R), Rochas(R), Escada(R) and Montblanc(R) fragrances.
