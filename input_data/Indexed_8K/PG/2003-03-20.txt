THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY /s/SHARON E. ABRAMS ------------------------------------ Sharon E. Abrams, Secretary March 20, 2003 Exhibit 99. Wella Acquisition - Investor Questions & Answers.

P&G - WELLA ACQUISITION INVESTOR QUESTIONS & ANSWERS MARCH 19, 2003 ---------------------------- Q: In your announcement, you mentioned that P&G stock could be offered to Wella Preference shareholders. What would be the benefit of taking P&G shares versus cash? A: P&G's tender offer for Preference Shares will be 61.5 Euros per share. P&G may offer stock as a way to facilitate Wella employee ownership in P&G, and as a way to allow Wella investors to retain their positions in the consumer packaged goods industry and the Wella business. If P&G stock is offered, it would be offered at an equivalent value to the cash offer. The decision whether or not to offer stock has not yet been made. Q: On March 13, 2003, Wella's Supervisory Board announced they would propose a dividend payment at their Annual General Meeting on May 15, 2003. Will Wella shareholders receive that dividend payment? A: Yes, Wella shareholders should expect to receive payment of the dividend that was announced last week. P&G has a long history of paying dividends to its shareholders. Although it is highly unlikely that P&G could complete the acquisition of Wella prior to May 15, 2003, P&G would fully support payment of the dividend that was announced by the Supervisory Board. Q: What are the anti-trust clearances that are required to complete the acquisition? A: There are several normal regulatory and government approvals that P&G must receive to complete the acquisition. These specific approvals vary by country, and will include the European Union and the United States. Q: When will you get those clearances? A: P&G will promptly file all of the necessary regulatory clearance requests. However, it is impossible for P&G to predict when all of the clearances will be granted. The timing for approval is in the hands of the respective regulatory agencies. Q: After P&G makes the tender offer to purchase the outstanding shares, if I sell my shares, when will I receive the cash? A: P&G will make payment to shareholders who accept the cash offer soon after the closing of the tender offer transaction. Timing for closing of the transaction will be dependent on P&G receiving all necessary regulatory approvals.
