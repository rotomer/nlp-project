FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE --------------------- PROCTER & GAMBLE WELCOMES ACCEPTANCE OF OFFER FOR ORDINARY AND VOTING SHARES BY WELLA MANAGEMENT BOARD ---------------------------------------------------- CINCINNATI, May 9, 2003 - The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE: PG) said today that it welcomes the positive response from Wella's Management Board to the tender offer that P&G announced on April 28, 2003. The Management Board of Wella today published its response to P&G's public offer as required by Section 27 of the German takeover law. In Wella's response statement, it confirms that P&G's offer is legally sound, and that it is fair for both ordinary and preference shareholders. Additionally, Wella's statement says, "the members of the management board intend to accept the tender offer with regard to the Wella ordinary shares and Wella preference shares held by them." With regard to fairness of the offer, a "fairness opinion" was arrived at by an outside third-party commissioned by Wella - Greenhill Investment Bank - who applied various standard evaluation methods, which confirmed the fairness of the offer. "Wella Management's acceptance of the offer provides additional confirmation that our offer to Wella shareholders is adequate and fair," said Bruce Byrnes, P&G's vice-chairman of the board and president-global beauty care and global health care. "P&G welcomes Wella Management's support." On March 18, 2003, P&G signed an agreement to purchase 77.6% of the voting stock in Wella AG from its majority shareholders. On April 28, 2003, P&G launched its tender offer of EUR 92.25 per share for the Wella voting shares, and EUR 65 per share for Wella preference shares. The tender offer period will run until May 28, 2003. An extended two-week acceptance period, as required by German law, will likely start on June 6, 2003. This deal is subject to normal regulatory review and government approvals in various markets including the European Union and the United States of America. - More -
