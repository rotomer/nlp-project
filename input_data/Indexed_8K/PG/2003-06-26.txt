FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE --------------------- PROCTER & GAMBLE ANNOUNCES WELLA TENDER OFFER FINAL RESULTS ----------------------------------------------------------- CINCINNATI, USA, and SCHWALBACH, Germany, June 26, 2003 -- The Procter & Gamble Germany Management GmbH (P&G), a wholly owned subsidiary of The Procter & Gamble Company (Procter & Gamble) (NYSE:PG), today announced the final results from the tender offer for Wella AG shares. The additional acceptance period, required by German law, expired at midnight (Central European Summer Time) on Friday June 20, 2003. 9,053,768 voting and 10,167,531 preference shares of Wella AG (FSE:WAD) were tendered. This represents 20.51% and 43.49%, respectively, of each class of shares, or a total of 28.47% of the registered share capital. The tendered shares combined with the controlling interest that P&G secured through its share purchase agreement with the majority shareholders will bring P&G's total ownership of Wella AG to 79.17% of the total registered share capital and about 84.9% of the value of the outstanding shares. The value percentage is based on the tender offer prices, and excludes the treasury shares held by Wella AG.
