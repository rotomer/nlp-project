FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE --------------------- P&G EXPLORING STRATEGIC ALTERNATIVES FOR SUNNY DELIGHT(R) AND PUNICA(R) ---------------------------------------- CINCINNATI, July 16, 2003 - Procter & Gamble today announced it is exploring strategic alternatives with respect to its Sunny Delight(R) and Punica(R) juice drink brands. P&G will consider various alternative structures to increase shareholder value, which could include a sale of the brands and related assets. Additionally, the company is seeking partners, licensees, or other ways to commercialize its considerable nutrition technologies. "Exploring strategic options for P&G's business is an ongoing process. P&G's strategy for sustained growth is focused on building from the core. A key element of our strategic focus involves tough choices that enable us to re-deploy resources and invest in core and new businesses. This is one of those tough but right choices," said A.G. Lafley, P&G chairman, president and chief executive. "The Sunny Delight and Punica businesses have made significant progress on delivering a better cost structure, better brand equity and are leading brands in their home markets", said Jorge P. Montoya, President of P&G's global snacks and beverages business. "However, while the juice based market is large, the business model is better for companies that have chosen Juice beverages as a corporate priority." Lafley added, "Following this decision, we're now focused on growing our Snacks and Coffee businesses, where P&G has two Billion Dollar Brands with strong equities. Both Folgers and Pringles have proprietary technology, a robust innovation pipeline and solid business plans." - More -
P&G is now soliciting offers for the refrigerated drink/juice businesses and will consider sale or alternative offers for the businesses as a group or as individual units. P&G has retained Goldman Sachs to act as the advisor of any eventual transaction.
