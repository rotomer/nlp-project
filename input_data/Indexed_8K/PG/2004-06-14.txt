THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY NEWS RELEASE One P&G Plaza Cincinnati, OH 45202 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE DOMINATION AND PROFIT TRANSFER AGREEMENT BETWEEN PROCTER & GAMBLE AND WELLA AG EFFECTIVE P&G TO COMMENCE CASH CONSIDERATION FOR OUTSTANDING WELLA AG SHARES CINCINNATI, USA, June 11, 2004 -- The Procter & Gamble Holding GmbH & Co Operations oHG (P&G), a wholly owned subsidiary of The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE: PG), announced today that their domination and profit transfer agreement with Wella AG (FSE: WAD) has been registered with the commercial register in Darmstadt. Upon this registration, the domination and profit transfer agreement became effective and is valid for Wella's current shortened reporting period (Jan 1, 2004 to June 30, 2004). The agreement was approved by Wella shareholders during the company's annual shareholder meeting on June 8. P&G now controls Wella AG as defined under Sections 291 et seq. of the German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz; "AktG"). Under the agreement, P&G is entitled to give instructions to the Management Board of Wella AG. Additionally, annual profits of Wella AG will be transferred to P&G. The domination and profit transfer agreement will strengthen collaboration efforts between Wella AG and P&G. The Wella Management Board believes the agreement will ease operational decision making, improving Wella's ability to respond more effectively to future market demands. P&G anticipates that the agreement will create greater efficiency in achieving previously stated business plans and collaboration synergies. Additionally, the domination and profit transfer agreement will improve knowledge transfers between the two companies. As required by German law, pursuant to the agreement P&G is offering a cash consideration (Barabfindung) of Euro72.86 per share for all outstanding Wella AG shares. As an alternative to this cash offer, minority shareholders of Wella AG have the option to receive a fixed annual compensation payment of Euro3.81 per ordinary share and Euro3.83 per preference share from P&G. As a result of Wella's current shortened reporting period, the first compensation payment will be reduced on a pro rata basis. The fairness of both the cash offer and the annual compensation payment offered by P&G pursuant to Sections 304, 305 AktG were confirmed by a court-appointed, independent auditor, Ernst & Young AG Wirtschaftsprufungsgesellschaft. Deutsche Bank will assist P&G as paying agent in settling the cash consideration offer. P&G expects a system for shareholders to tender their shares to be in place by Monday, June 14. Guidelines on how to tender shares will be communicated separately. ABOUT WELLA Founded in 1880, Wella is a leading beauty care company selling its products in more than 150 countries.
