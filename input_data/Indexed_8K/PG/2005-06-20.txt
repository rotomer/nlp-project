ITEM: Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION Washington, D.C. 20549 FORM 8-K CURRENT REPORT PURSUANT TO SECTION 13 OR 15(d) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 Date of Report (Date of earliest event reported) June 14, 2005 THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- (Exact name of registrant as specified in its charter) Ohio 1-434 31-0411980 - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- (State or other (Commission File Number) (IRS Employer jurisdiction of Identification incorporation) Number) One Procter & Gamble Plaza, Cincinnati, Ohio 45202 - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- (Address of principal executive offices) (Zip Code) Registrant's telephone number, including area code (513) 983-1100 -------------- [X] Written communications pursuant to Rule 425 under the Securities Act (17 CFR 230.425) [ ] Soliciting material pursuant to Rule 14a-12 under the Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.14a-12) [ ] Pre-commencement communications pursuant to Rule 14d-2(b) under the Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.14d-2(b)) [ ] Pre-commencement communications pursuant to Rule 13e-4(c) under the Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.13e-4(c)) ITEM 1.01 ENTRY TO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT On January 28, 2005, The Procter & Gamble Company ("Company" or "P&G") announced its proposed merger with The Gillette Company ("Gillette"). The closing of the transaction, which is subject to shareholder and regulatory approval and other conditions, is expected to occur in fall, 2005. P&G's Board of Directors and management are confident that combining P&G and Gillette will create substantial and sustainable shareholder value over the long term. Near term, the Company must focus on the successful integration of the Gillette business and delivery of growth and cost synergies, while maintaining momentum in the core businesses. The dilutive impact of the acquisition is expected to reduce P&G earnings by 25 to 35 cents per share in the first year following closing, and 5 to 10 cents per share in the second year following closing. In the third year following closing, the acquisition is expected to add 1 to 5 cents per share. The near term impacts of the proposed transaction caused the Board's Compensation & Leadership Development Committee ("Committee") to re-consider certain aspects of P&G's incentive compensation programs, during meetings on May 19, 2005 and June 14, 2005. Subject to closing of the transaction, the Committee approved at its June 14, 2005, meeting modifications to the Company's Short Term Achievement Reward Program ("STAR") and Business Growth Program ("BGP") as described below and in the documents attached hereto. STAR is the Company's annual incentive program. Awards are made within the authority of the Additional Remuneration Plan, which dates back to 1949, and the 2001 Stock and Incentive Compensation Plan ("2001 Stock Plan). Historically, STAR awards have been based on two factors -- overall Company results and specific business unit results. In view of the importance of successfully integrating the Gillette acquisition, an additional factor will be used in determining STAR awards beginning fiscal year 2005/06. This 'Gillette Factor' will be determined by assessing performance during the fiscal year on various metrics related to integration goals including: sustaining the overall health of both the P&G and Gillette businesses during this period (based on market share and earnings progress); achieving sales, research and administrative budget and synergy objectives; meeting enrollment reduction targets; and staying within integration cost and restructuring estimates. This will put payments for all STAR participants at risk based on the achievement of integration goals. Under the revised STAR plan, participants may end up earning more or less than they would have without this change. BGP is a three-year performance program under the authority of the Additional Remuneration Plan and the 2001 Stock Plan. Approximately 35 senior executive officers were included in BGP for the period from July 1, 2004 through June 30, 2007. Each was assigned a target amount for the performance period. Taken together, stock options at target and BGP at target represent total long-term incentive compensation equal to the median long-term incentive of P&G's compensation survey group for comparable positions. The Committee determines actual BGP awards based on an assessment of Company performance versus pre-established financial measures for diluted earnings per share ("EPS") growth and operating total shareholder return ("OTSR"). The Committee believes P&G's compensation programs should continue to be directly linked to business results and remain consistent with shareholder interests following the Gillette merger. Accordingly, the Committee will discontinue the current three-year BGP cycle at the end of its first year (June 30, 2005). In its place, the Committee will establish a new three-year cycle, beginning July 1, 2005. The Committee will restart the program cycle so that senior management compensation for the combined company is linked more directly to the success of the Gillette integration. By starting a new BGP cycle, the Committee will ensure that management compensation reflects results of all the Company's businesses, including those acquired from Gillette. More specifically, management will be incented to minimize the dilution of EPS in the first two years following closing and deliver accretive EPS in the third year following closing. The program will pay out at target compensation levels for the full three-year period only if, by the third year following closing, the Company achieves its Operating Total Shareholder Return goal and delivers three-year 10% compound EPS growth for P&G's current business, while also achieving its accretion goal for Gillette. Consequently, management compensation will be at risk to achieve the profitable growth objectives of both Gillette and current P&G. Depending on actual results, participants may earn more or less than target. The Committee has approved funding formulas covering STAR and BGP awards to named executive officers. These formulas qualify the payments as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, thereby preserving tax deductibility. More detailed descriptions of STAR and BGP, as modified, are attached as Exhibit 10-1 hereto, together with related correspondence and grant materials.

SIGNATURE Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this Report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized. THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY /S/ CHRIS B. WALTHER ------------------------------------- Chris B. Walther, Associate General Counsel and Assistant Secretary June 20, 2005 EXHIBITS Exhibit 10-1 with related correspondence and grant materials.

SHORT TERM ACHIEVEMENT REWARD PROGRAM ------------------------------------- The Short Term Achievement Reward ("STAR") Program is the Company's annual incentive bonus program designed to support outstanding business results of The Procter & Gamble Company (the "Company" or "P&G"). Awards are made within the authority of the Additional Remuneration Plan and the 2001 Stock and Incentive Compensation Plan. I. ELIGIBILITY Eligibility is based on job level and the requirement of working at least four weeks during the fiscal year. STAR participants who do not work a full time schedule for the entire fiscal year may have awards pro-rated. Separating employees must be active as of June 30 (the close of the fiscal year for which the award is payable) to receive an award, unless due to retirement or special circumstances agreed in advance. II. CALCULATION The individual STAR Award Calculation is: (STAR Target) x (Business Unit Performance Factor) x (Corporate Adjustment Factor) x (Gillette Factor) o The STAR TARGET for each participant is calculated as: (Base Salary) x (STAR Target percent) BASE SALARY as of the end of June is used to calculate the STAR award. If a participant's level changes, the highest band level and salary during the fiscal year is used to determine the STAR Target. The STAR TARGET PERCENT is dependent on job level in the organization and will fall between 6% and 140%. JOB BAND STAR TARGET AS % OF BASE 3 6% in 2005/06; 8% in 2006/07 and beyond 4 15% 5 25% 6 45% 7 70% 8 75% 9 140% o The BUSINESS UNIT PERFORMANCE FACTOR is assigned to each STAR business unit as a measure of success for the fiscal year. The factors range from 53% to 167% with the target at 100%. A STAR Committee, comprised of a small number of senior executives (who do not determine their own awards), conducts a retrospective assessment of the performance of each business unit according to one or more of the following measures and makes a recommendation to the Compensation & Leadership Development Committee: Operating Total Shareholder Return, Key Competitor Comparison, After Tax Profit, Operating Cash Flow, Value Share, Volume, Net Outside Sales, Value Contribution, Organization Head Self Assessment, and Cross Organization Assessment. There may also be other factors significantly affecting unit results. o The CORPORATE ADJUSTMENT FACTOR measures the total Company success and ranges from 80% to 130%, with a 100% target. The same Corporate Adjustment Factor is applied to all STAR award calculations. It is determined by a matrix that measures P&G's market total shareholder return ("TSR") ranking relative to a competitive peer group and diluted earnings per share ("EPS") growth. Market TSR reflects the return shareholders could earn during the year - stock appreciation and dividends - from an investment in the Company's stock. o The GILLETTE FACTOR is derived from a review and recommendation by the STAR Committee based on the results of the success of the Gillette integration. The factor ranges from 80% to 130% with 100% as the target. The same Gillette Factor will apply to all STAR award calculations. It will be determined by assessing performance during the fiscal year on various metrics including: sustaining the overall health of both the P&G and Gillette businesses during this period (based on market share and earnings progress); achieving sales, research and administrative budget and synergy objectives; meeting enrollment targets; and staying within integration cost and restructuring estimates. The Gillette Factor will be applied starting with the results of fiscal year 2005/06. STAR awards for fiscal year 2004/05 will be based on only the Business Unit Performance Factor and the Corporate Adjustment Factor, as in prior years. The STAR Committee makes recommendations to the Compensation & Leadership Development Committee regarding the actual awards to be made. The final awards are approved by the Compensation & Leadership Development Committee. STAR Awards for members of the Star Committee are determined exclusively by the Compensation & Leadership Development Committee without any recommendation from the STAR Committee. III. TIMING AND FORM STAR awards are determined after the close of the fiscal year and are paid on or about September 15. The award form choices and relevant considerations are explained in payment preference materials generally in the form of Appendix 1. Participants receive written notice of their award detailing the calculation, generally in the form of Appendix 2. The grant letters are generally in the form of Appendix 3. Generally, STAR awards are paid in cash. However, before the end of the calendar year preceding the award date, participants on record can choose their upcoming award in forms other than cash, such as stock options, stock appreciation rights or restricted stock units (for participants also in the Business Growth Program), depending on local regulations. To pay a STAR award in stock options, the Company compares current cash value to stock option value with a conversion factor that is reviewed annually.
BUSINESS GROWTH PROGRAM ----------------------- The Business Growth Program ("BGP") is a part of the Company's long-term incentive plan and is designed to provide additional focus on key Company measures for top executives with senior management responsibility for total Company results. Awards are made within the authority of the Additional Remuneration Plan and the 2001 Stock and Incentive Compensation Plan. I. ELIGIBILITY The CEO, Vice-Chairs, Presidents, Global Function Heads, Senior Vice Presidents and equivalents may participate, as recommended by management and approved by the Compensation & Leadership Development Committee. II. CALCULATION A BGP Award may be payable for the three-year performance period running July 1, 2005 through June 30, 2008. Interim awards may also be payable at the conclusion of the first and second years of the program. The Compensation & Leadership Development Committee reviews and approves awards relative to the base period of fiscal year 2004/05. It assesses Company performance according to the pre-established financial measures of diluted earnings per share ("EPS") growth and operating total shareholder return ("OTSR"). Adjustments may be made for significant acquisitions and divestitures, major equity investments, or other unusual items not reflected in the Company's operating plan or base year results. In all cases, the Compensation & Leadership Development Committee retains discretion to determine whether certain items should be included or excluded from award calculations and to verify that awards are appropriate and consistent with the long-term interests of shareholders. The Committee may reduce awards if it determines that payouts do not correspond to actual business results. o THE THREE-YEAR AWARD is calculated as: (Payout Factor) X (Participant's Target Award). The AWARD PAYOUT FACTOR ranging from 0% to 200% is assessed relative to a performance level of EPS growth and OTSR. A PARTICIPANT'S TARGET AWARD is based on a multiple of the executive's base salary at the time of entry into the program. For the Chairman of the Board and CEO, the target is two times base salary, times three (the number of years in the performance period). For all others, the target is one times base salary times the number of years participating in the program. o INTERIM AWARDS are payable only if EPS growth and OTSR meets or exceeds target relative to the base period at the end of the first year and the first two years combined, respectively. Interim awards are calculated using the same factors as the three-year award. However, each interim award is only a partial progress payment, paid at 30% of the full three-year calculation. Any interim payments are subtracted from the full three-year award when calculating the final BGP payment. III. TIMING AND FORM BGP awards are delivered on or about September 15th for the fiscal year just completed. Each year's award, if payable, will be delivered half in three-year restricted stock units ("Required RSUs") and half in cash. Participants may elect to receive restricted stock units in place of the cash portion ("Elected RSUs"). For the CEO, all BGP payments will be made in restricted stock units, half in three-year restricted stock units and half in retirement restricted stock units. The award form choices and relevant considerations are explained in payment preference materials generally in the form of Appendix 1. Participants receive written notice of their award detailing the calculation, generally in the form of Appendix 4. The grant letters are generally in the form of Appendix 5. Program participants have their long-term incentives split between BGP and equity awards under the 2001 Stock and Incentive Compensation Plan. Their key manager awards under the latter plan are reduced in value by one-third of their three-year BGP target.
