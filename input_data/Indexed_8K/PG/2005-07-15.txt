P&G THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY NEWS RELEASE One P&G Plaza Cincinnati, OH 45202 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE EUROPEAN COMMISSION CLEARS P&G-GILLETTE MERGER ---------------------------------------------- CINCINNATI, July 15, 2005 - The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE: PG) learned today that the European Commission has cleared the proposed merger with the Gillette Company. "Today's announcement from the European Commission is excellent news," said A.G. Lafley, P&G chairman, president and chief executive. "The EU clearance is a significant milestone as we work to combine two of the world's leading companies to benefit consumers, customers and shareholders." Today's announcement follows Tuesday's overwhelming vote by the shareholders of both companies in support of the merger. As part of the regulatory review process, P&G announced today that it plans to divest its SpinBrush battery toothbrush business, sold mainly in the United States, Canada, Europe and Japan.

In the United States, SpinBrush has leading awareness and consumers consider it to be the best battery operated toothbrush.

The company expects the Gillette deal to close in the Fall, 2005 once the merger has received clearances from other regulatory authorities, including the U. S. Federal Trade Commission.
