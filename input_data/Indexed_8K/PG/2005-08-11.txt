Lafley, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive of the Company, has terminated his stock trading plan, which was entered pursuant to Rule 10b5-1(c) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Under Rule 10b5-1(c), directors and officers may adopt a prearranged plan or contract for the sale of company securities under specified conditions and at specified times. As described in the Company's 2004 Proxy Statement, the Board of Directors implemented a mandatory holding period for stock option gains which now requires Mr. Lafley to hold for at least two years the net shares received from stock option exercises, after paying the exercise price and taxes. In accordance with the commitment, Mr. Lafley will retain shares for the required period rather than sell them under his stock trading plan. Mr. Lafley also wishes to retain a higher level of his stock during the initial stages of the integration of The Gillette Company as a sign of confidence in the transaction. Accordingly, Mr. Lafley has terminated his stock trading plan in accordance with its terms, effective August 8, 2005. SIGNATURE Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this Report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
