7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure
     On August 26, 2005 the Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") granted early termination of the Hart-Scott-Rodino waiting period for the proposed acquisition by The Procter & Gamble Company ("P&G") of up to $500,000,000 of voting securities of The Gillette Company ("Gillette"). This early termination is separate from the FTC approval which is required to close the merger between P&G and Gillette. That merger is still under FTC review and P&G expects it will be completed in the Fall. P&G is furnishing this 8-K pursuant to Item 7.01 "Regulation FD Disclosure".
 
        Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this Report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
