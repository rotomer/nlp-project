The blackout period is contingent on the consummation of the merger. The blackout is expected to last approximately three business days around the closing date, which is not yet known. Because P&G will assume the Plans at closing, P&G's directors and executive officers were notified that they would be restricted from trading in P&G and Gillette securities during the anticipated blackout period, according to applicable regulations. Steven W. Jemison, P&G Secretary, was designated as the officer to respond to questions by directors and officers about the proposed blackout period. The blackout period is necessary for the Plans' administrator--Fidelity Investments--to clear all pending trades, determine final share balances, and process the exchange of Gillette securities for P&G securities pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated January 27, 2005. SIGNATURE Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this Report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
