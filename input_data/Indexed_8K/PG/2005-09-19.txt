P&G THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY News Release One P&G Plaza Cincinnati, OH 45202 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE P&G CONFIRMS FIRST QUARTER EPS GUIDANCE DESPITE IMPACT OF HURRICANE KATRINA --------------------------------------------------------- Strong base business growth expected to offset higher costs on the quarter CINCINNATI, Sept. 19, 2005 - The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE: PG) confirmed previously announced earnings per share guidance for the July to September quarter despite disruption of the coffee business and higher commodity materials costs. P&G continues to expect earnings per share of $0.75 to $0.76 for the first quarter. The company stated it expects sales growth toward the upper end of the previous guidance range of six percent to eight percent for the quarter. The strong sales growth continues to be led by the Beauty and Health businesses and in developing market geographies. The higher volume and sales growth should offset the -$0.01 to -$0.02 first quarter earnings per share impact related to the hurricane. While it is too early to completely and accurately assess the hurricane damage impacts beyond the July to September period, P&G stated that it expects continued strong business momentum and ongoing cost savings efforts to allow the company to offset the hurricane's impact on the fiscal year results.
