The Company has elected to adopt SFAS 123(R) using the modified retrospective method under which prior years' results will be revised to give effect to the value of options granted in fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 1995. The recognized compensation expense will be consistent with the amounts previously reported in the Company's pro forma footnote disclosure for stock-based compensation on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2005. Consistent with the Company's basis of measurement for segment performance, the additional expense associated with stock-based compensation under SFAS 123(R) will be also reflected in segment results. The attached exhibits are intended to provide investors more insight into the impact of SFAS 123(R) on the Company's 2005 results by quarter and for the full year. Exhibits 99-1 and 99-2 provide consolidated earnings information both as reported and reflecting the retrospective impact of SFAS 123(R) for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Exhibits 99-3 and 99-4 provide business segment information both as reported and reflecting the retrospective impact of SFAS 123(R) for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively. As required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 131, consolidated financial statements issued by the Company in the future will reflect these modifications, including reclassification of all comparative prior period segment information. These financial statements, conformed for the changes, will become the historical financial statements of The Procter & Gamble Company and consolidated subsidiaries for currently open and future filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
