SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION Washington, D.C. 20549 FORM 8-K CURRENT REPORT PURSUANT TO SECTION 13 OR 15(d) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 Date of Report (Date of earliest event reported) November 22, 2005 THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- (Exact name of registrant as specified in its charter) Ohio 1-434 31-0411980 - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- (State or other (Commission File Number) (IRS Employer jurisdiction of Identification incorporation) Number) One Procter & Gamble Plaza, Cincinnati, Ohio 45202 - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- (Address of principal executive offices) (Zip Code) Registrant's telephone number, including area code (513) 983-1100 -------------- [ ] Written communications pursuant to Rule 425 under the Securities Act (17 CFR 230.425) [ ] Soliciting material pursuant to Rule 14a-12 under the Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.14a-12) [ ] Pre-commencement communications pursuant to Rule 14d-2(b) under the Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.14d-2(b)) [ ] Pre-commencement communications pursuant to Rule 13e-4(c) under the Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.13e-4(c)) ITEM 7.01 REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE As disclosed in its Form 8-K furnished on October 3, 2005, The Procter & Gamble Company (the "Company") completed its acquisition of The Gillette Company ("Gillette") on October 1, 2005. The Gillette Company has historically operated in five operating business segments: Blades & Razors; Duracell; Oral Care; Braun; and Personal Care. Gillette's Oral Care and Personal Care segments will be subsumed within the Company's Health Care and Beauty Care segments, respectively. Blades & Razors and Duracell & Braun, which together will be managed as a separate Gillette Global Business Unit (GBU) under the direction of a Vice Chair, will be presented as two reportable segments in future filings. Blades & Razors will constitute a separate reportable segment and the combined Duracell and Braun businesses will constitute the second separate reportable segment. Exhibit 99-1 provides net sales and earnings data on a pro forma basis for the Gillette Global Business Unit for the three months ended September 30, 2005 along with a discussion of the results. With respect to the earnings data, the exhibit reconciles "Profit from Operations," the measure used by Gillette in its historical filings, to Earnings before Income Taxes, the comparable measure used by the Company. The net sales and earnings data for the two separate reportable segments will be utilized in the Management Discussion and Analysis section of future filings as the base period for discussing the performance of the respective segments. Because Gillette's Oral Care and Personal Care businesses will be subsumed within the Company's existing segments and will therefore not be reported separately in the future, pro forma net sales and earnings data are not provided for these businesses in Exhibit 99-1. For perspective, for the three months ended September 30, 2005, Gillette Oral Care and Personal Care businesses both delivered sales growth in the mid single-digits versus the prior year period. Sales growth came behind solid volume growth on Oral-B and in shave preps as well as the ongoing success of TAG body sprays. SIGNATURE Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this Report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Exhibit 99-1: Unaudited Pro Forma Gillette Global Business Unit Financial Results for the three months ended September 30, 2005 THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES Gillette Global Business Unit Pro Forma Information (Amounts in Millions) Three Months Ended Change Versus September 30, Prior Year Blades & Razors 2005 Period - --------------- --------------------------------- Net Sales $1,164 5% Profit from Operations 403 -7% Allocation of Gillette Corporate Expenses(1) (7) Stock Option Expense(2) (14) ------ Earnings before Income Taxes 382 -7% Duracell/Braun - -------------- Net Sales $ 912 0% Profit from Operations 170 -7% Allocation of Gillette Corporate Expenses(1) (6) Stock Option Expense(2) (11) ------ Earnings before Income Taxes 153 -6% Gillette GBU - ------------ Net Sales $2,076 3% Profit from Operations 573 -7% Allocation of Gillette Corporate Expenses(1) (13) Stock Option Expense(2) (25) ------ Earnings before Income Taxes 535 -6% 1. Reclassification of expenses that are not allocated to segments under Gillette's management reporting but are allocated to segments under P&G's management reporting. 2. The effect of stock option expenses using the fair-value-based method of SFAS 123(R) to record expense for stock options. Gillette employee stock options issued prior to June 2005 were fully vested upon completion of the acquisition. Accordingly, stock option expense that will be reported for the Gillette segments under P&G will be based only on stock options granted beginning in June 2005. Blades & Razors - --------------- Blades & Razors net sales grew five percent to $1.16 billion despite a major competitive razor platform launch and a base year comparison which included the launch of M3Power in the UK, Germany, and Japan. Favorable exchange rates and pricing each added one percent of growth. Consumer demand for premium offerings remained strong with Mach3 global blade market share increasing 1.5 points to 30% fueled by M3Power. In addition, market share on Venus blades grew one point globally to 7% behind Venus Vibrance and Venus Divine. Earnings Before Income Taxes declined by seven percent to $382 million. Earnings Before Income Taxes were impacted by increased marketing spending, negative mix from trial building activities on M3 Power and one-time items. One-time items drove the year-over-year profit decline and included legal charges associated with an advertising claims settlement, asset write-offs, and a non-recurring benefit in the base period. Duracell & Braun - ---------------- Duracell & Braun net sales were flat versus a very strong year ago base period in which sales increased 13% as a result of several hurricanes in densely populated areas in the United States. Sales growth included a one percent benefit from favorable foreign exchange and a negative two percent mix impact driven by increased sales of large pack battery products. In North America, Duracell's market share of General Purpose Batteries increased 2.3 points to 47.9%, the highest level in two years. However, battery sales were down single-digits due to the high consumption levels in the base period as a result of the hurricanes in the USA. Braun delivered mid single-digit sales growth behind strong results on recently launched initiatives in both shavers and appliances. Earnings Before Income Taxes on Duracell & Braun decreased six percent to $153MM compared to a base year in which profit from operations increased 43%. The decrease in Earnings Before Income Taxes was driven primarily by flat sales that included a shift towards larger battery pack sizes as well as write-offs related to the shut down of the Lexington facility.
