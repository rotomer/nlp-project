P&G THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY NEWS RELEASE One P&G Plaza Cincinnati, OH 45202 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE P&G INCREASES SECOND QUARTER SALES AND EPS GUIDANCE TOWARD TOP END OF PREVIOUS RANGES --------------------------------------------------- CINCINNATI, Dec 13, 2005 - The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE: PG) updated previously announced sales and earnings per share guidance for the October to December quarter. The company said it now expects sales growth of 25% to 26% for the quarter, toward the top end of the previously announced range of 23% to 26%. P&G stated that its confidence in the top line is due to strong performance on both the P&G and Gillette businesses and better than expected pricing contribution. P&G now expects organic sales growth of six percent to seven percent led by the household care and beauty businesses. Organic sales growth excludes the impacts of foreign exchange and acquisitions and divestitures. The Gillette global business unit, which is comprised of the Blades & Razors and Duracell & Braun businesses, is expected to deliver stronger sales growth than previously anticipated. P&G previously anticipated flat to low-single digit sales growth versus a very strong base period when sales grew 17% driven by the M3 Power and Braun Activator innovations as well as broad-based geographic strength, especially in developing markets. P&G also stated it now expects earnings per share of $0.68 to $0.69 for the quarter, toward the top end of the previously announced range of $0.66 to $0.69 per share. The improvement in the EPS outlook is due to lower than anticipated dilution in the quarter from the Gillette acquisition. The company now expects Gillette dilution to be 8 to 10 cents per share for the quarter compared to previous estimates of 9 to 12 cents per share. This change is driven by refined timing forecasts for SG&A costs. The Company continues to expect Gillette dilution for the fiscal year to be in the $0.20 to $0.26 per share range.
