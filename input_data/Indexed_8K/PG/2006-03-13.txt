News Release by The Procter & Gamble Company dated March 13, 2006.

P&G THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY NEWS RELEASE One P&G Plaza Cincinnati, OH 45202 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE P&G DECLARES DIVIDEND INCREASE FOR 50TH CONSECUTIVE FISCAL YEAR AND CONFIRMS SALES AND EPS GUIDANCE FOR FISCAL THIRD QUARTER ------------------------------------------------------------------- CINCINNATI, March 13, 2006 - The Board of Directors of The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE: PG) declared an increase in the quarterly dividend on its Common Stock and on its Series A and Series B ESOP Convertible Class A Preferred Stock from $0.28 to $0.31 per share, payable on or after May 15, 2006 to shareholders of record at the close of business on April 21, 2006. P&G has been paying dividends without interruption since incorporation in 1890. Clayt Daley, P&G's Chief Financial Officer, said, "This is the 50th consecutive fiscal year that P&G has increased dividends and reflects the Board's confidence in P&G's ability to generate strong, profitable growth in line with our long term objectives. Over the past 50 years, compound annual dividend growth has exceeded 9 percent." P&G also confirmed previously announced guidance for sales growth and earnings per share for the January to March quarter. The company narrowed its EPS guidance range to $0.59 to $0.61 per share including $0.07 to $0.10 per share of Gillette dilution and added that sales growth for the quarter is currently trending toward the mid-point of its previous 20% to 23% range. P&G said it now expects organic sales growth, which excludes the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange, of five to six percent based on current quarter trends - at the upper-end of the company's annual organic sales growth target of three to five percent. This compares to the earlier third quarter organic sales growth outlook of five to seven percent. The company said market share is growing in businesses representing about two-thirds of global sales and that the revised organic sales growth range reflects recent customer inventory reductions and tempered outlooks for Asia and Eastern Europe for the quarter. P&G added that the contribution to sales growth from the Gillette acquisition is in-line with previous expectations as strong results of the new Fusion razor in the U.S. are offsetting high base period comparisons in international markets. In total, acquisitions and divestitures are expected to add 17 percent to 18 percent to sales growth for the quarter. The company also noted that it still expects pricing and mix to add one percent to sales growth and foreign exchange to reduce sales growth by two percent.
