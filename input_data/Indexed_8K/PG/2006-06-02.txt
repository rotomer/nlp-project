and the Indenture has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act; (x) The issue and sale of the Designated Securities and the compliance by the Company with all of the provisions of the Designated Securities, the Indenture, each of the Delayed Delivery Contracts, if any, this Agreement and the Pricing Agreement with respect to the Designated Securities and the consummation of the transactions herein and therein contemplated will not conflict with or result in a breach of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under, any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement or other agreement or instrument known to such counsel to which the Company or any of its domestic subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company or any of its domestic subsidiaries is bound or to which any of the property or assets of the Company or any of its domestic subsidiaries is subject, nor will such action result in any violation of the provisions of the Amended Articles of Incorporation, Regulations or By Laws of the Company or any applicable statute or any applicable order, rule or regulation known to such counsel of any court or governmental agency or body having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its domestic subsidiaries or any of its or their properties;

and such counsel has no reason to believe that any of such documents, when they were so filed, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made when such documents were so filed, not misleading; and (xii) The Registration Statement as of the effective date (as such term is defined in Rule 158(c) under the Act) and the Prospectus as of its issue date, as amended or supplemented, (other than the financial statements and related schedules therein, as to which such counsel need express no opinion) comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Act and the Trust Indenture Act and the rules and regulations thereunder; such counsel has no reason to believe (x) that the Registration Statement, at the time it was deemed effective, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; or (y) that the Pricing Disclosure Package, as of the Applicable Time, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; or (z) that, as of its date and as of the Time of Delivery, the Prospectus or any such further amendment or supplement thereto made by the Company prior to the Time of Delivery contained or contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; such counsel does not know of any contracts or other documents of a character required to be filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement or required to be incorporated by reference into the Prospectus as amended or supplemented or required to be described in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented which are not filed or incorporated by reference or described as required; and the statements in the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus as amended or supplemented describing the Designated Securities are accurate and fairly present the information required or purported to be shown. In rendering such opinion or opinions, such counsel may rely as to all matters governed by New York law upon the opinions referred to in subsection (b) of this Section; (d) On the date of the Pricing Agreement and at the Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities, Deloitte & Touche LLP, which has rendered its opinion on the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, shall have furnished to the Underwriter a comfort letter, in form and substance satisfactory to the Underwriter; (e) (i) Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries shall have sustained since the date of the latest audited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus any loss or interference with its business from fire, explosion, flood or other calamity, whether or not covered by insurance, or from any labor dispute or court or governmental action, order or decree, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, and (ii) since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement and the Pricing Prospectus there shall not have been any change in the capital stock or long-term debt of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or in the consolidated capitalization of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries or any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the general affairs, management, financial position, shareholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries considered as a whole, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, the effect of which, in any such case described in Clause (i) or (ii), is in the judgment of the Underwriter so material and adverse as to make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Designated Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus; (f) Subsequent to the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Securities no downgrading shall have occurred in the rating accorded the Company's debt securities by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization", as that term is defined by the Commission for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Act and no public announcement shall have been made by any such organization that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, its rating of any of the Company's debt securities; (g) Subsequent to the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Securities there shall not have occurred any of the following: (i) a suspension or material limitation in trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange or the over-the-counter market; (ii) a suspension or material limitation in trading in the Company's securities on the New York Stock Exchange or the over-the-counter market; (iii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities in New York declared by either Federal or New York State authorities or a material disruption in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States; (iv) the outbreak or escalation of hostilities involving the United States or the declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war; or (v) the occurrence of any other calamity or crisis or any change in financial, political or economic conditions in the United States or elsewhere, if the effect of any such event specified in clause (iv) or (v) in the judgment of the Underwriter makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Underwriter's Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented; and (h) The Company shall have furnished or caused to be furnished to the Underwriter at the Time of Delivery for the Designated Securities certificates of officers of the Company satisfactory to the Underwriter as to the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company herein at and as of such Time of Delivery, as to the performance by the Company of all of its obligations hereunder to be performed at or prior to such Time of Delivery, as to the matters set forth in subsections (a) and (e) of this Section, and as to such other matters as the Underwriter may reasonably request. 9. (a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless the Underwriter against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, in which the Underwriter may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus, the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the Pricing Disclosure Package or any "issuer information" filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Act or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse the Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus, the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Pricing Disclosure Package, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by the Underwriter of Designated Securities expressly for use therein. (b) The Underwriter will indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus, the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Pricing Disclosure Package, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus, the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Pricing Disclosure Package, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by the Underwriter expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred. (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel of any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. (d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 9 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriter of the Designated Securities on the other from the offering of the Designated Securities to which such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriter of the Designated Securities on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and such Underwriter on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from such offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriter. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or such Underwriter on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriter agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the applicable Designated Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. (e) The obligations of the Company under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Underwriter and to each person, if any, who controls the Underwriter within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of the Underwriter under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the Underwriter may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act. 10. (a) If the Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Underwriter's Securities which it has agreed to purchase under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Securities, the Underwriter may in its discretion arrange for itself or another party or other parties to purchase the Underwriter's Securities on the terms contained herein. If within thirty-six hours after such default by the Underwriter, the Underwriter does not arrange for the purchase of such Underwriter's Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to the Underwriter to purchase such Underwriter's Securities on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed period, the Underwriter notifies the Company that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Underwriter's Securities, or the Company notifies the Underwriter that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Underwriter's Securities, the Underwriter or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Time of Delivery for such Underwriter's Securities for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in the opinion of the Underwriter may thereby be made necessary. The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement and the Pricing Agreement with respect to such Securities shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to such Pricing Agreement with respect to such Designated Securities. (b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Underwriter's Securities, if the Underwriter defaults, by the Underwriter and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, any of the Underwriter's Securities remains unpurchased, then the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company as provided in Section 7 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 9 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve the defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default. 11. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the Underwriter, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of the Underwriter or any controlling person of the Underwriter, or the Company, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities. 12. If any Pricing Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 10 hereof, the Company shall not then be under any liability to the Underwriter with respect to the Designated Securities covered by such Pricing Agreement except as provided in Section 7 and Section 9 hereof; but, if for any other reason Underwriter's Securities are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein, the Company will reimburse the Underwriter for all out-of-pocket expenses, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriter in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of such Designated Securities, but the Company shall then be under no further liability to the Underwriter with respect to such Designated Securities except as provided in Section 7 and Section 9 hereof. 13. All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing or by telegram if promptly confirmed in writing, and if to the Underwriter shall be sufficient in all respects if delivered or sent by registered mail to the address of the Underwriter as set forth in the Pricing Agreement; and if to the Company shall be sufficient in all respects if delivered, or sent by registered mail to the address of the Company set forth in the Registration Statement, Attention: Secretary; provided, however, that any notice to the Underwriter pursuant to Section 9(c) hereof shall be delivered or sent by registered mail to the Underwriter at its address set forth in its Underwriter's Questionnaire, or telex constituting such Questionnaire, which address will be supplied to the Company by the Underwriter upon request. 14. This Agreement and each Pricing Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure solely to the benefit of, the Underwriter, the Company and, to the extent provided in Section 9 and Section 11 hereof, the officers and directors of the Company and each person who controls the Company or the Underwriter, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Agreement or any such Pricing Agreement. No purchaser of any of the Securities from the Underwriter shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase. 15. Time shall be of the essence of each Pricing Agreement. 16. This Agreement and each Pricing Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York. 17. This Agreement and each Pricing Agreement may be executed by any one or more of the parties hereto and thereto in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all such respective counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument.
