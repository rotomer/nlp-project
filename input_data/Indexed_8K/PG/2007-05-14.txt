News Release by The Procter & Gamble Company dated May 14, 2007.

 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
CINCINNATI, May 14, 2007 - The Board of Directors of The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) today announced some business unit realignments and associated changes to its executive management structure effective July 1, 2007.
Summary of Key Changes
 
We are making these moves to realign our business units and top leadership structure to meet the changing needs of our larger, more diverse, faster-paced global business, said Mr. Lafley. These changes are designed to help P&Gs businesses consistently win at both the first (in-store) and second (at-home) moments of truth with consumers.
Our business has nearly doubled since 2000. Weve had three major acquisitions including Clairol, Wella and Gillette. And, we have tripled the pace of our business initiatives over this same period, said Lafley.
It is appropriate to make these changes in response to the current realities of our business, and I look forward to continuing to lead our very talented executive team.
Reporting to Ms. Arnold
In addition, three executives who have Beauty Care responsibilities will continue to report to Ms. Arnold. They are:
