ITEM 5.02(e) COMPENSATORY ARRANGEMENTS OF CERTAIN OFFICERS
 
On June 30, 2008, The Procter & Gamble Company's (the "Company") current long-term incentive program for its most senior executives expired on its own terms.  Accordingly, on September 22, 2008, the Compensation & Leadership Development Committee (the Committee") of the Board of Directors of the Company renewed and approved the Company's Business Growth Program ("BGP") with the material modifications described below.
 
BGP is a three-year performance program for approximately 40 of the Companys most senior executive officers.  Under the previous BGP for the period from July 1, 2005 to June 30, 2008, awards were based on the Companys performance versus pre-established financial measures in two areas: (1) diluted earnings per share ("EPS") growth and (2) operating total shareholder return ("OTSR"). The previous BGP also allowed for interim payments to be made based on performance metrics between 100 and 200% of target and provided payments in the form of cash and three year restricted stock units.
 
The BGP recently approved by the Committee covers the period from July 1, 2008 to June 30, 2011 and sets awards based on the Companys performance versus pre-established financial measures in four areas: (1) earnings per share growth; (2) organic sales growth; (3) before-tax operating profit growth; and (4) free cash flow efficiency.  This BGP also prohibits Interim Payments exceeding 100% of target and provides for payment in the form of cash and restricted stock units that deliver in shares at the conclusion of the three year Performance Period. The BGP pays out at target compensation levels for the three year Performance Period only if the Company achieves the Performance Goals on each of the four measures described above.
 
A summary of the new BGP approved by the Committee is attached as Exhibit 99.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this Report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Ex. 99 -- BGP Summary
The Business Growth Program (BGP) is a part of The Procter & Gamble Companys (the Company) long-term incentive compensation and is designed to provide additional focus on key Company measures for top executives with senior management responsibility for total Company results.  BGP Awards are made pursuant to authority delegated to the Compensation & Leadership Development Committee (the C&LD Committee) by the Board of Directors for determining compensation for the Companys principal officers and for making awards under the Procter & Gamble 2001 Stock and Incentive Compensation Plan (the 2001 Plan) and successor stock plans.
I.           
ELIGIBILITY
The Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer and those principal officers at Band 7 or above recommended by management and approved by the C&LD Committee are eligible to participate.
II.           
CALCULATION
BGP Three-Year Awards are based on a  three-year performance period starting on July 1 and ending on June 30 three years later (Performance Period).  The total BGP Three-Year Award will be made in up to three payments with the possibility of Interim Payments at the conclusion of the first and/or second years of any Performance Period and a Final Payment at the end of the Performance Period.  The amount of each BGP Three-Year Award (including any Interim or Final Payments) is based on the Companys performance in each of the following categories (each a Performance Category):
Earnings per share (EPS) growth
Organic sales growth
Before-tax operating profit
Free cash flow efficiency
The C&LD Committee compares the Companys results in each Performance Category for the first year, for cumulative results of the first two years and for cumulative results of the entire Performance Period to certain pre-established targets set by the C&LD Committee based on the fiscal year preceding the Performance Period (the Performance Goals). Based on these comparisons, the C&LD Committee creates a performance factor (a Performance Factor) for each Performance Category between 0% to 200% (e.g., an EPS Factor, Sales Factor, Profit Factor and Cash Flow Factor, respectively).
In all cases, the C&LD Committee retains discretion to determine whether certain of the Performance Categories should be included or excluded from BGP payment calculations.  The C&LD Committee also has discretion to change the duration of the Performance Period, as appropriate, and may reduce any payment if it determines that such payout is inconsistent with long-term shareholders interests.
:
Interim Payment 1 for the first year and Interim Payment 2 for cumulative results of years 1 and 2 will be calculated as
If the calculated BGP Three-Year Award is less than the sum of the Interim Payments, each participant will be required to return the overpayment to the Company.
At the beginning of the Performance Period, the C&LD Committee approves a BGP annual award pool for each fiscal year of that Performance Period with a cash value equal to a percentage of basic net earnings multiplied by the number of common shares outstanding, and the C&LD Committee sets a limit on the portion of that pool which can be awarded to each of the Named Executive Officers subject to Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Service code.  This ensures that any BGP payments made to such executives are fully tax deductible by the Company.
III.           
TIMING AND FORM
The Final BGP Payments are delivered on or about September 15following the Performance Period and Interim Payments, if any, are delivered on or about September 15 following the fiscal year just completed. Interim Payments will be delivered in 25% cash and 75% restricted stock units that are forfeitable until the payment date following expiration of the Performance Period after which time they will deliver in shares unless the participant has elected to defer receipt of shares.  The Final BGP Payment, if payable, will be delivered in cash.  Participants may elect, in lieu of the cash portion of Interim Payments or the Final BGP Payment, to receive restricted stock units, deferred compensation, or stock options (for special situations approved by the Committee).  Any Payments or portion of a BGP Payment paid in restricted stock units, stock options, or other equity shall be awarded pursuant to this program and subject to the terms and conditions of the 2001 Plan or any successor stock plan approved in accordance with applicable listing standards, as they may be revised from time to time.

IV.           
INTERIM PAYMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO RECOUPMENT
In general, any Interim Payments are subject to recoupment if the BGP Three-Year Award calculated for an individual, based on the Companys results during the Performance Period, is less than the total of the Interim Payments.  To recoup this money, the Company will first cancel a sufficient number of outstanding RSUs awarded pursuant to BGP.  If there are not enough outstanding RSUs to recoup the monies owed, the Company will require the individual to repay the difference in cash. The value of RSUs to be recouped will be the value of those RSUs on or about September 15 following the Performance Period.
th
V.           
SEPARATION FROM THE COMPANY
No Interim Payments will be made to any individual after separation from the Company.  If the BGP Three-Year Award prorated for an individual who has separated from the Company exceeds the amount of Interim Payments received, any Final Payment will be made in cash. The BGP Three-Year Award will be prorated based on the number of years of participation in a Performance Period as follows:
 
VI.                 
CHANGE IN CONTROL
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if there is a Change in Control in any fiscal year, BGP Three-Year Awards and Interim Payments will be calculated in accordance with Section II above, but each Performance Factor will be calculated using the period from the beginning of the fiscal year in which a Change in Control occurred up to and including the date of such Change in Control (CIC Period) and each target will be prorated at the time of Change in Control. Change in Control shall have the same meaning as defined in the 2001 Stock and Incentive Compensation Plan.
VII.           
GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS
It shall be understood that this plan does not give to any officer or employee any contract rights, express or implied, against any Company for any BGP Three-Year Award, Interim Payment, or future Interim Payment or BGP Three-Year Award, or for compensation in addition to the salary paid to him or her, or any right to question the action of the Board of Directors or the C&LD Committee.
Each award made to individuals at Band 7 and above made pursuant to this plan is subject to the Senior Executive Recoupment Policy adopted by the Committee in December 2006.
This program document may be amended at any time by the C&LD Committee.
