On November 3, 2008, The Procter & Gamble Company ("P&G"), an Ohio corporation, issued a news release announcing the exchange ratio for its exchange offer related to the separation of P&G's coffee business and the previously announced merger of The Folgers Coffee Company ("Folgers") and The J. M. Smucker Company ("Smucker"), pursuant to which a Smucker subsidiary will merge with and into Folgers, with Folgers surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of Smucker. A copy of the news release is filed as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this Report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CINCINNATI, Nov. 3, 2008 - The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE: PG) today announced that the exchange ratio for its exchange offer for P&G common stock is set at 1.6342 shares of Folgers common stock for each share of P&G common stock accepted in the exchange offer. This exchange ratio permits P&G shareholders to exchange their shares of P&G common stock for shares of Folgers common stock at a discount of 12 percent based on the Average P&G Stock Price ($63.7766) and Average Smucker Stock Price ($44.3469) (each as defined in the registration statements described below under "Additional Information"). This exchange offer is in connection with the previously announced merger of P&G's coffee subsidiary with The J. M. Smucker Company (NYSE: SJM). Following the merger, each share of Folgers common stock will automatically convert into the right to receive one Smucker common share. The Smucker common shares issued in the Folgers merger are expected to represent approximately 53.5% of the Smucker common shares that will be outstanding after the merger.
The exchange offer is designed to permit P&G shareholders to exchange their shares of P&G common stock for shares of Folgers common stock and is expected to be tax-advantaged to P&G and P&G shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The exchange offer will expire at 12:00 midnight, New York City time, on November 5, 2008, unless extended, and will be immediately followed by the closing of the merger of Folgers and the Smucker subsidiary. The transactions are subject to customary closing conditions, including a minimum tender condition. As a result of the exchange offer, the number of outstanding shares of P&G common stock will be reduced.
P&G is offering all 63,166,532 shares of Folgers in exchange for shares of P&G common stock. Based on the final exchange ratio, P&G will accept for exchange a maximum of 38,652,878 shares of P&G common stock. The upper limit of 1.7213 shares of Folgers common stock for each share of P&G common stock is not in effect.
The exchange offer will be subject to proration if it is over-subscribed, and, accordingly, the number of shares of P&G common stock accepted in the exchange offer may be less than the number of shares of P&G common stock tendered. If the exchange offer is consummated but not fully subscribed, P&G will distribute all of the shares of Folgers common stock it continues to own as a pro rata dividend to all P&G shareholders whose shares of P&G common stock remain outstanding and have not been accepted for exchange in the exchange offer.
 
Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated is serving as the dealer manager for the exchange offer.
