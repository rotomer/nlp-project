Gentlemen/Mesdames:
This opinion is rendered for use in connection with the Registration Statement on Form S-3, filed by The Procter & Gamble Company (the Company or Procter & Gamble) and Procter & Gamble International Funding SCA (PGIF) with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 7, 2007 (the Registration Statement), with respect to the issuance of $2,000,000,000 aggregate principal amount of PGIFs Floating Rate Notes due May 7, 2010 (the Debt Securities), fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by the Company (the Guarantee).
 
The Debt Securities and the Guarantee will be issued under an Indenture dated as of July 6, 2007, among PGIF, as issuer, the Company, as guarantor and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the Indenture).
 
As counsel for the Company, I have examined and am familiar with originals or copies, certified or otherwise, identified to my satisfaction, of such statutes, documents, corporate records, certificates of public officials and other instruments as I have deemed necessary for the purpose of this opinion, including the Amended Articles of Incorporation, Regulations and By Laws of the Company and the records of the proceedings of the shareholders and directors of the Company.
This opinion is limited to the Federal laws of the United States and the laws of the State of Ohio, each as currently in effect, and I am expressing no opinion as to the effect of the laws of any other jurisdiction. Insofar as the opinions set forth herein are governed by the laws of the State of New York, I have relied as to all matters governed by such law upon the opinion dated the date hereof of Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson LLP, One New York Plaza, New York, New York 10004, addressed to the Company and PGIF and filed as an Exhibit to the Registration Statement. To the extent the opinion of Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson LLP contains conditions and limitations, I incorporate such conditions and limitations herein. Also, insofar as my opinion involves factual matters, I have relied, to the extent I deem proper, upon certificates of officers of the Company and certificates of public officials.
 
Upon the basis of the foregoing, I am of the opinion that:
 
 (a) The Company has been duly incorporated and is validly existing and in good standing as a corporation under the laws of Ohio;
   
 
 
 (b) The Guarantee has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company, has been legally issued and constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Company in accordance with its terms, subject as to enforcement, to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, and other laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights and to general equity principles, and shall be entitled to the benefits of the Indenture.
   
 
I hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as an Exhibit to the Registration Statement and to the reference to my name in the prospectus contained in the Registration Statement.

In connection with this opinion, we have (i) investigated such questions of law, (ii) examined originals or certified, conformed or reproduction copies, of such agreements, instruments, documents and records of the Company and PGIF, such certificates of public officials and such other documents, and (iii) received such information from officers and representatives of the Company, PGIF and others as we have deemed necessary or appropriate for the purposes of this opinion.  We have examined, among other documents, the following:
The documents referred to in items (a) through (d) above, inclusive, are referred to herein collectively as the Documents.
In all such examinations, we have assumed the legal capacity of all natural persons, the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of original and certified documents and the conformity to original or certified documents of all copies submitted to us as conformed or reproduction copies. As to various questions of fact relevant to the opinions expressed herein, we have relied upon, and assume the accuracy of, the representations and warranties contained in the Documents, certificates and oral or written statements and other information of or from officers or other appropriate representatives of the Company, PGIF and others and assume compliance on the part of all parties to the Documents with the covenants and agreements contained therein.
 
We have assumed, for purposes of the opinions expressed herein, that (i) all of the parties to the Documents are validly existing and in good standing under the laws of their respective jurisdictions of organization; (ii) all of the parties to the Documents have the power and authority to (a) execute and deliver the Documents, (b) perform their obligations thereunder and (c) consummate the transactions contemplated thereby; (iii) each of the Documents has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by all of the parties thereto; (iv) each of the Documents constitutes a valid and binding obligation of all the parties thereto (other than as expressly addressed in the opinions below as to the Company and PGIF), enforceable against such parties in accordance with its terms; (v) the Debt Securities have been duly authenticated and delivered by the Trustee against payment therefor in accordance with the Agreements; (vi) all of the parties to the Documents will comply with all laws applicable thereto; and (vii) the Debt Securities and the Guarantee conform to the specimen thereof examined by us.

(iii)  the legality, validity, binding effect or enforceability of any provision of the Securities or the Indentures specifying that provisions thereof may be waived only in writing, to the extent that an oral agreement or an implied agreement by trade practice or course of conduct has been created that modifies any provision of such agreement;
(iv)  the legality, validity, binding effect or enforceability of (a) any provision of the Documents containing any purported waiver, release, variation, disclaimer, consent or other agreement of similar effect (all of the foregoing, collectively, a Waiver) by the Company or PGIF under any provision of the Documents to the extent limited by provisions of applicable law (including judicial decisions), or to the extent that such a Waiver applies to a right, claim, duty, defense or ground for discharge otherwise existing or occurring as a matter of law (including judicial decisions), except to the extent that such a Waiver is effective under, and is not prohibited by or void or invalid under, provisions of applicable law (including judicial decisions); or (b) any Waiver in the Guarantee insofar as it relates to causes or circumstances that would operate as a discharge or release of, or defense available to, the Company as a matter of law (including judicial decisions), except to the extent such Waiver is effective under and is not prohibited by or void or invalid under applicable law (including judicial decisions);
(v)           any provision of the Documents purporting to give any person or entity the power to accelerate obligations without any notice to the obligor; and

(b)           we express no opinion as to whether the Guarantee or Article Eleven of the Indenture would be deemed by a court of competent jurisdiction to be within the authorized corporate power of the Company; and
 
(c)           we have assumed consideration that is fair and sufficient to support the agreements of the Company under the Guarantee and Article Eleven of the Indenture has been, and would be deemed by a court of competent jurisdiction to have been, duly received by the Company.
