A majority of the votes cast by shareholders, on an advisory basis, were in favor of holding an advisory vote on the Company's executive compensation every year.  In accordance with this shareholder vote, the Board of Directors approved an annual shareholder advisory vote on the Company's executive compensation as reported in its annual proxy statement.  Annual votes will be held until the next shareholder vote on the frequency of such advisory vote, to occur no later than our Annual Meeting of Shareholders in 2017.
