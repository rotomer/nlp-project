The Procter & Gamble Company: Reg G Reconciliation of Non-GAAP measures
In accordance with the SECs Regulation G, the following provides definitions of the non-GAAP measures used in Procter & Gamble's October 25, 2012 earnings call and associated slides with the reconciliation to the most closely related GAAP measure.  The measures provided are as follows: 
 
1. Organic Sales Growth:
Organic sales growth is a non-GAAP measure of sales growth excluding the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons.  We believe this provides investors with a more complete understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis.  Organic sales is also one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and is a factor in determining their at-risk compensation.  The reconciliation of reported sales growth to organic sales is as follows:
 
*Acquisition/Divestiture Impact includes rounding impacts necessary to reconcile net sales to organic sales.
 
  This is a measure of the Companys diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations excluding certain items that are not judged to be part of the Companys sustainable results or trends.  This includes FY 2013 and 2012 charges related to incremental restructuring charges due to increased focus on productivity and cost savings, charges in FYs 2013, 2012, 2011 and 2010 related to European legal matters, FY 2013 estimated gain on buyout of Iberian joint venture, FY 2012 impairment charges for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets, a significant benefit in FY 2011 from the settlement of U.S. tax litigation primarily related to the valuation of technology donations, a FY 2010 charge related to a tax provision for retiree healthcare subsidy payments in the U.S. healthcare reform legislation, and incremental restructuring charges in FY 2009 to offset the dilutive impact of the Folgers divestiture.  We believe the Core EPS measure provides an important perspective of underlying business trends and results and provides a more comparable measure of year-on-year earnings per share growth.  Core EPS is also one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and is a factor in determining their at-risk compensation.  The tables below provide a reconciliation of diluted net earnings per share to Core EPS:

6. Core Operating Profit Growth:
This is a measure of the Companys operating profit growth adjusted for the fiscal 2012 impairment charges for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets, fiscal year 2013 and 2012 charges related to incremental restructuring charges due to increased focus on productivity and cost savings, and charges in fiscal 2012 and 2011 related to the European legal matters:
 
 
7. Core Effective Tax Rate:
This is a measure of the Companys effective tax rate adjusted for current year charges for incremental restructuring and charges related to the European legal matters.  The table below provides a reconciliation of the effective tax rate to the Core tax rate:
 
 
 
8. Free Cash Flow:
Free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital spending.  We view free cash flow as an important measure because it is one factor in determining the amount of cash available for dividends and discretionary investment.  Free cash flow is also one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and is a factor in determining their at-risk compensation.  The reconciliation of free cash flow is provided below (amounts in millions):
