FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE MAYFIELD VILLAGE, OHIO --July 16, 2003-- The Progressive Corporation today reported second quarter 2003 net income of $286.3 million, or $1.29 per share, compared to $160.4 million, or $.71 per share, in the second quarter last year. Included in net income are net realized gains on securities of $23.1 million, or $.07 per share, for the second quarter 2003 and net realized losses on securities of $3.0 million, or $.01 per share, for the same period last year. Net premiums written and earned increased 27% and 30% to $3,022.8 million and $2,774.9 million, respectively, as compared to the second quarter last year. The Company produced a GAAP combined ratio of 88.8, compared to 93.4 in the same period last year. During the second quarter 2003, the Company had catastrophe losses of $34.1 million, $.10 per share or 1.2 points, compared to $12.0 million, $.03 per share or .6 points, in the same period last year. Recurring investment income was $112.5 million before taxes and $83.6 million after taxes, compared to $117.0 million before taxes and $82.6 million after taxes for the second quarter 2002. See the "Operations Summary" for further information. During the second quarter 2003, in light of recent views expressed by the Securities and Exchange Commission over the use of non-GAAP financial measures, the Company elected to discontinue disclosing operating income (defined by the Company as net income excluding net realized gains and losses on securities and nonrecurring items; the Company had no nonrecurring items during 2003 or 2002). Progressive's Personal Lines business units write insurance for private passenger automobiles and recreation vehicles. Progressive's Commercial Auto business unit writes primary liability, physical damage and other auto-related insurance for automobiles and trucks owned by small businesses.
