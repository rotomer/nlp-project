In July 2003, the Company received notice from the Internal Revenue Service that the Joint Committee of Taxation of Congress had completed its review of a Federal income tax settlement agreed to by the Internal Revenue Service, primarily attributable to the amount of loss reserves deductible for tax purposes. As a result, the Company will receive an income tax refund of approximately $58 million, which the Company had previously recorded as a deferred tax asset (i.e. no impact on results of operations). In addition, the Company will receive interest, which is currently estimated at $30.4 million, or $.09 per share, and is reflected as "Other income." Progressive's Personal Lines business units write insurance for private passenger automobiles and recreation vehicles. Progressive's Commercial Auto business unit writes primary liability, physical damage and other auto-related insurance for automobiles and trucks owned by small businesses. The Company's other businesses principally include writing lenders' collateral protection and directors' and officers' liability insurance. See "Supplemental Information" for July's results. Since this is the first time the Company has provided monthly net income and share repurchase information, an Income Statement of the Trailing 12-months is provided for reference. The Progressive group of insurance companies ranks third in the nation for auto insurance, offering its products by phone at 1-800-PROGRESSIVE, online at progressive.com and through more than 30,000 independent agencies. The Progressive Corporation, the holding company, is publicly traded at NYSE:PGR.
