MONTHLY COMMENTARY ------------------ - - As previously mentioned, the 16% net premiums written growth rate was favorably impacted by the timing of the Memorial Day holiday in 2004, as compared to 2003. If in 2004 the holiday had fallen in fiscal May as it did in 2003, the growth rate for the month would likely have been in the range of 10%-12%. - - The Company continued to experience strong profitability. Only three markets in which the Company writes Personal Lines business were unprofitable for the month (primarily due to the settlement of a lawsuit in one state, a catastrophe loss in another state and higher severity in the third state); for the year-to-date period, all Personal Lines markets were profitable. - - During May, the Company experienced catastrophe losses, which partially contributed to a higher loss/LAE ratio for the period. Overall, frequency and severity for the month are in line with year-to-date results. - - Policies in force growth remained strong, supported by strong renewals. In Personal Lines, 14 markets have year-to-date net premiums written growth of 20% or greater; these markets represent 24% of the total Personal Lines premiums. Thirteen states (36% of total Personal Lines) grew less than 10%. - - In general, the Company saw modest increases in retention measures for the month in most of the Agency and Direct auto tiers. - - At May month-end, the net unrealized gains in the investment portfolio were $423.1 million, a decrease of $220.3 million from year-end 2003. The pretax recurring investment book yield of the portfolio was 3.6% for the month and 3.8% year-to-date. In the fixed-income portfolio, the duration was 2.9 years and the weighted average credit quality was AA. The Progressive group of insurance companies ranks third in the nation for auto insurance based on premiums written, offering its products by phone at 1-800-PROGRESSIVE, online at progressive.com and through more than 30,000 independent agencies and insurance brokers. The Common Shares of The Progressive Corporation, the holding company, are publicly traded at NYSE:PGR.
