EXHIBIT 99 [PROGRESSIVE LOGO] NEWS RELEASE The Progressive Corporation COMPANY CONTACT: 6300 Wilson Mills Road Thomas A. King Mayfield Village, Ohio 44143 (440) 395-2260 http://www.progressive.com FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE PROGRESSIVE RELEASES AUGUST RESULTS AND ANNOUNCES DUTCH AUCTION TENDER OFFER FOR 17.1 MILLION SHARES MAYFIELD VILLAGE, OHIO -- September 13, 2004 -- The Progressive Corporation today reported the following results for August 2004: Results for August 2004, include $13.3 million, 1.3 loss ratio points, of catastrophic losses incurred due to Hurricane Charley. See the Monthly Commentary at the end of this release for further discussion on the losses due to Hurricane Charley and Hurricane Frances. See the "Income Statement" for further month and year-to-date information. The Progressive Corporation also announced today that it is commencing a modified "Dutch auction" tender offer to purchase up to 17.1 million of its outstanding Common Shares, $1.00 par value. Under the terms of the offer, which expires at 12:00 midnight, New York City time on Friday, October 15, 2004 (unless extended), shareholders of the Company may tender some or all of their shares at prices not greater than $88.00 nor less than $78.00 per share. At the close of the tender offer, the Company will determine the lowest per share price in that range which will result in the purchase of 17.1 million shares or such lesser number of shares as may be properly tendered. If the offer is oversubscribed, the Company has the right to purchase up to approximately 4.4 million additional shares without extending the offer, and the Company may select a higher purchase price within the range for all shares purchased -1-
pursuant to the tender offer, if necessary, to purchase such additional shares. All shareholders whose shares are accepted in the offer will receive the purchase price determined by the Company, even if their shares were tendered at a lower price. As of September 10, 2004, the Company had approximately 217.0 million Common Shares outstanding. The closing price of the Common Shares on the New York Stock Exchange on September 10, 2004 was $79.25 per share. The 17.1 million shares proposed to be purchased in the Dutch auction tender offer represent approximately 7.9% of the Common Shares outstanding as of September 10, 2004. The Company intends to pay for tendered shares with cash generated by the sale of securities in the Company's investment portfolios. After evaluating the Company's financial condition, business prospects and capital needs, the Board of Directors has determined that the Company currently has a significant amount of capital on hand in excess of what is needed to support its insurance operations, fund its corporate obligations and prepare for various contingencies. In view of this situation and the Company's publicly stated policy to return capital to shareholders when appropriate, the Board determined that this tender offer would be a prudent use of the Company's excess capital and an efficient means to return capital to shareholders who choose to participate. The tender offer thus represents an opportunity for the Company to return capital to shareholders who elect to tender their shares, while at the same time increasing nontendering shareholders' proportionate interests in Progressive. The Company believes that after completing the tender offer, its remaining capital on hand and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to support the Company's insurance operations, corporate obligations and risk contingencies, including the catastrophic, weather-related losses discussed above. The Company has been advised by its directors and executive officers that they will not tender any shares in the tender offer, other than Peter B. Lewis, the Chairman of the Board of Directors, who has advised the Company that he intends to tender 1.1 million shares. Mr. Lewis will not tender his shares at a specified price, but will accept the price determined by the Company pursuant to the Dutch auction tender offer process. Mr. Lewis has also notified the Company that he has terminated his Rule 10b5-1 trading plans under which an aggregate of 2,392,000 shares could be sold over a two-year period ending July 2006. Prior to termination and as previously disclosed, 446,300 shares had been sold under the plans. Mr. Lewis currently owns beneficially 8.4% of the Company's common shares outstanding. In the event that the Company purchases all 1.1 million shares tendered by Mr. Lewis and the Company purchases a total of 17.1 million shares in the tender offer, Mr. Lewis will own beneficially approximately 17.2 million of the Company's common shares, or approximately 8.6% of the shares outstanding, after completion of the tender offer. Details of the offer will be mailed to the Company's shareholders within the next few days. This announcement is neither an offer to purchase nor a solicitation of an offer to sell shares. THE OFFER IS MADE SOLELY BY THE OFFER TO PURCHASE TO BE DATED SEPTEMBER 14, 2004, AND THE RELATED LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL AND ANY RELATED AMENDMENTS OR SUPPLEMENTS THERETO, WHICH CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE OFFER AND THE COMPANY THAT SHOULD BE READ BEFORE TENDERS ARE MADE. SHAREHOLDERS WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN THE OFFER TO PURCHASE, THE LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL AND RELATED MATERIALS FOR FREE: (1) AT THE SEC'S WEB SITE AT WWW.SEC.GOV; (2) FROM THE INFORMATION AGENT FOR THE TENDER OFFER, MORROW & CO., INC., BY CALLING (800) 607-0088; OR (3) DIRECTLY FROM THE COMPANY BY MAIL AT THE PROGRESSIVE CORPORATION, INVESTOR RELATIONS, 6300 WILSON MILLS ROAD, BOX W33, MAYFIELD VILLAGE, OHIO 44143; BY E-MAIL AT INVESTOR_RELATIONS@PROGRESSIVE.COM; OR BY TELEPHONE AT (440) 395-2258.

Morgan Securities Inc., which is serving as the dealer manager for the offer, by calling (800) 262-0777. -2-
None of the Company, the information agent or the dealer manager is making any recommendation to shareholders as to whether to tender or refrain from tendering their shares into the tender offer or as to the purchase price or prices at which a shareholder may choose to tender its shares. Shareholders must decide how many shares they will tender, if any, and the price within the stated range at which they will offer their shares for purchase by the Company. The Company's Board of Directors also confirmed that the tender offer will not reduce the number of shares available for repurchase, in the open market or otherwise, pursuant to the resolution approved by the Board in April 2003. The Board reaffirmed that the Company has the authority to repurchase the remaining 10,188,101 shares authorized in April 2003 and that the Company may continue to repurchase shares under this authority after the completion of the tender offer, subject to applicable laws. Progressive's Personal Lines business units write insurance for private passenger automobiles and recreation vehicles. Progressive's Commercial Auto business unit writes primary liability, physical damage and other auto-related insurance for automobiles and trucks owned by small businesses. The Company's other businesses principally include writing directors' and officers' liability insurance and managing the Company's run-off businesses.
