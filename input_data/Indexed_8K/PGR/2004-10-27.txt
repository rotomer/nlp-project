Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.
On October 22, 2004, The Progressive Corporation received interrogatories and a subpoena from the Connecticut Attorney General's Office seeking information as part of its investigation into possible violations of antitrust laws by unnamed persons. Progressive understands that the Connecticut Attorney General has issued numerous subpoenas to members of the insurance industry and that Connecticut is one of several states investigating allegations of price-fixing, bid-rigging and other unlawful conduct by certain insurers, brokers or other industry members. Accordingly, many industry companies have received subpoenas and more may be expected in the future if other states initiate similar investigations. Progressive intends to cooperate fully with the investigation.
