Item 1.01 .
Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
          On December 13, 2005, The Progressive Corporation (the "Company") entered into an uncommitted Line of Credit with National City Bank ("NCB") in the principal amount of $125 million. Because the Line of Credit is uncommitted, NCB is not obligated to make advances thereunder, and the Company incurs no commitment fees. Subject to the foregoing, the Company may borrow funds from NCB in increments of at least $5 million at a daily interest rate equal to one month LIBOR plus three hundred seventy-five one thousandths of a percent (.375%). Amounts outstanding under the Line of Credit must be repaid by the Company on demand. The Company entered into the Line of Credit as part of a contingency plan to provide a source of liquidity if an event interrupts the Company's ability to receive or transfer funds. Mr. Jeffrey D. Kelly, a director of the Company, is a Vice Chairman and the Chief Financial Officer of National City Corporation, the parent of NCB. In addition, Dr. Bernadine Healy, a director of the Company, is also a director of National City Corporation. A copy of the Line of Credit is attached hereto as Exhibit 4(A).
          On December 9, 2005, the Company amended two (2) benefit plans and adopted three (3) deferral revocation forms under certain benefit plans, as follows:
          On December 8, 2005, the Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors approved a director compensation schedule for 2006, setting forth retainer and meeting fees and restricted stock awards for non-employee directors. The 2006 Schedule for director compensation is attached hereto as Exhibit 10(F).

No fees, penalties or other charges will be incurred as a result thereof. The $100 million line of credit was attached as an exhibit to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K dated June 18, 2004.
The 2005 non-employee director compensation program was superseded by the 2006 Schedule approved by the Committee and referenced above in Item 1.01. The 2005 schedule is also set forth on the attached Exhibit 10(F).

or such lesser amount as may appear on this Note, or as may be entered in a loan account on Bank's books and records, or both, together with interest, all as provided below. Notwithstanding any provision or inference to the contrary, this Note may be enforced without presentment, protest, or notice of dishonor, all of which are waived by all makers and indorsers of this Note, now or hereafter existing. Any reference to any rate of interest or late charge to be applicable after any notice of demand or the commencement of any Proceeding is made solely for the purpose of determining the rate of interest and late charges applicable under this Note, and shall not diminish or impair Bank's right to enforce this Note at any time.
This Note evidences an arrangement whereby, for Borrower's convenience, Borrower may, without having to execute and deliver a separate note each time, obtain such loans (each a "") as Borrower may from time to time request and as Bank in its sole discretion may from time to time be willing to make, subject in any case to the condition that each Subject Loan shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of Five Million and 00/100ths Dollars ($5,000,000.00) and that the aggregate unpaid principal balance of the Subject Loans shall not at any time exceed the face amount of this Note. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY PROVISION OR INFERENCE TO THE CONTRARY, BANK SHALL HAVE NO OBLIGATION TO EXTEND ANY CREDIT TO OR FOR THE ACCOUNT OF BORROWER BY REASON OF THIS NOTE. Borrower may prepay all or any part of the Subject Loans, at any time without premium or penalty; , that each prepayment shall be in an amount equal to or greater than Five Million and 00/100ths Dollars ($5,000,000.00).

Subject Loan

(b)
provided
A Subject Loan is properly requested if requested orally or in writing not later than 2:00 p.m., Banking-Office Time, of the Banking Day upon which that Subject Loan is to be made. Each request for a Subject Loan shall of itself constitute, both when made and when honored, a representation and warranty by Borrower to Bank that Borrower is entitled to obtain the requested Subject Loan. Bank is hereby irrevocably authorized to make an appropriate entry on this Note, in a loan account on Bank's books and records, or both, whenever Borrower obtains a Subject
2. Loan Requests; Disbursement.
 
Loan. Each such entry shall be prima facie evidence of the data entered, but the making of such an entry shall not be a condition to Borrower's obligation to pay. Bank is hereby directed, absent notice from Borrower to the contrary, to disburse the proceeds of each such Subject Loan to Borrower's general checking account with Bank. Bank shall have no duty to follow, nor any liability for, the application of any proceeds of any Subject Loan.
The unpaid principal balance of each Subject Loan shall at all times bear interest at the Contract Rate, , that so long as any principal of any Subject Loan remains unpaid after Bank shall have given Borrower written notice of demand for any such principal or after the commencement of any Proceeding with respect to Borrower, or any accrued interest on any Subject Loan remains unpaid after the due date of that interest, then, and in each such case, all unpaid principal of this Note and all overdue interest on that principal shall bear interest at a fluctuating rate equal to two percent (2%) per annum above the Prime Rate; that in no event shall any principal of or interest on any Subject Loan bear interest at any time after the giving of any such notice or the commencement of any such Proceeding, whichever shall first occur, at a lesser rate than the rate applicable thereto immediately after the giving of that notice or the commencement of that Proceeding, as the case may be. The "" shall at all times be a fluctuating rate equal to three hundred seventy-five/one-thousandths of one percent (0.375%) per annum plus One Month LIBOR, , that in the event One Month LIBOR is unavailable as a result of Bank's good faith determination of the occurrence of one of the events specified in section 4, the "" shall be a fluctuating rate equal to the Prime Rate.
3. Interest.

Contract Rate
Interest on each Subject Loan shall be payable in arrears on the first (1st) day of each month and on demand. The One Month LIBOR rate shall be adjusted by Bank, as necessary, at the end of each Banking Day during the term hereof. Bank shall not be required to notify Borrower of any adjustment in the One Month LIBOR rate; however, Borrower may request a quote of the prevailing Contract Rate on any Banking Day.
Notwithstanding any provision or inference to the contrary, the Contract Rate shall not be based on One Month LIBOR if Bank shall determine in good faith that any governmental authority has asserted that it is unlawful for Bank to fund, make, or maintain loans bearing interest based on One Month LIBOR, or circumstances affecting the market selected by Bank for the purpose of funding the Subject Loans make it impracticable for Bank to determine One Month LIBOR. Bank's books and records shall be conclusive (absent obvious error) as to whether Bank shall have determined that the Contract Rate is prohibited from being based on One Month LIBOR. If the Contract Rate is prohibited from being based on One Month LIBOR as a result of the occurrence of one of the events referenced in this section 4, then, and in each such case, notwithstanding any provision or inference to the contrary, the then outstanding principal balance of this Note shall, upon Bank giving Borrower notice of Bank's determination of the occurrence of such an event, bear interest at a Contract Rate based on the Prime Rate as contemplated in section 3.

If there shall be enacted any law (including, without limitation, any change in any law or in its interpretation or administration and any request by any governmental authority) relating to any interest rate or any assessment, reserve, or special deposit requirement (except if and to the extent utilized in computation of the Reserve Percentage) against assets held by, deposits in, or loans by Bank or to any tax (other than any tax on Bank's overall net income) and in Bank's sole opinion any such event increases the cost of funding or maintaining any Subject Loan bearing interest based upon One Month LIBOR or reduces the amount of any payment to be made to Bank in respect thereof, then, and in each such case, upon written notice from Bank to Borrower, Borrower shall pay Bank an amount equal to each such cost increase or reduced payment, as the case may be.

No course of dealing in respect of, nor any omission or delay in the exercise of, any right, power, or privilege by Bank shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any further or other exercise thereof or of any other, as each such right, power, or privilege may be exercised either independently or concurrently with others and as often and in such order as Bank may deem expedient. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, neither Bank's acceptance of one or more late payments or charges nor Bank's acceptance of interest on overdue amounts at the respective rates applicable thereto shall constitute a waiver of any right of Bank. Each right, power, or privilege specified or referred to in this Note is in addition to and not in limitation of any other rights, powers, and privileges that Bank may otherwise have or acquire by operation of law, by other contract, or otherwise. Bank shall have the right to apply payments in respect of the indebtedness evidenced by this Note with such allocation to the respective parts thereof as Bank in its sole discretion may from time to time deem advisable.

All fees, interest, and premiums for any given period shall accrue on the first day thereof but not on the last day thereof (unless the last day is the first day) and in each case shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of days in the period.
