(b) On February 6, 2006, The Progressive Corporation issued a press release including the following announcement:
[O]n February 4, 2006, W. Thomas Forrester, the Company's Chief Financial Officer, announced his intention to retire during the first quarter of 2007. Mr. Forrester will serve as the Company's Chief Financial Officer until that time, and participate in the certifications of the Company's 2006 financial statements. CEO and President Glenn Renwick said: "Although Tom's decision to retire next year is not unexpected, we accept the news with mixed feelings. Tom and I will have worked together for more than 20 years and while his retirement will close our professional relationship, I'm very happy for Tom, his retirement plans and our continuing friendship. Tom will continue with all of his responsibilities into 2007 and work with me in the selection of a new CFO. We have a deep talent pool within the organization therefore we do not expect to be conducting an external search for this position."
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
Dated: February 6, 2006
