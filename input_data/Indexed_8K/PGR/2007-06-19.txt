     (c) The Company agrees that if at any time following issuance of an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus any event occurred or occurs as a result of which such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus would conflict with the information in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus or would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances then prevailing, not misleading, the Company will give prompt notice thereof to the Representative and, if requested by the Representative, will
 
prepare and furnish without charge to each Underwriter an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or other document which will correct such conflict, statement or omission; provided, however, that this representation and warranty shall not apply to any statements or omissions in an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus made in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by an Underwriter through the Representative expressly for use therein.
     7. The Company covenants and agrees with the several Underwriters that the Company will pay or cause to be paid the following: (i) the fees, disbursements and expenses of the Company's counsel and accountants in connection with the registration of the Debentures under the Act and all other expenses in connection with the preparation, printing, reproduction and filing of the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and the Prospectus and amendments and supplements thereto and the mailing and delivering of copies thereof to the Underwriters and dealers; (ii) the cost of printing or producing any Agreement among Underwriters, this Agreement, the Indenture, the Blue Sky Memorandum, and closing documents (including any compilations thereof) contemplated by this Agreement or the Indenture; (iii) all expenses in connection with the qualification of the Debentures for offering and sale under state securities laws as provided in Section 5(d) hereof, including the fees and disbursements of counsel for the Underwriters in connection with such qualification and in connection with the Blue Sky survey; (iv) any fees charged by securities rating services for rating the Debentures; (v) the filing fees incident to, and the fees and disbursements of counsel for the Underwriters in connection with, any required review by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. of the terms of the sale of the Debentures; (vi) the cost of preparing the Debentures; (vii) the fees and expenses of the Trustee and any agent of the Trustee and the fees and disbursements of counsel for the Trustee in connection with the Indenture and the Debentures; and (viii) all other costs and expenses incident to the performance of its obligations hereunder which are not otherwise specifically provided for in this Section. It is understood, however, that, except as provided in this Section, and Sections 9 and 12 hereof, the Underwriters will pay all of their own costs and expenses, including the fees of their counsel, transfer taxes on resale of any of the Debentures by them, and any advertising expenses connected with any offers they may make.
     8. The obligations of the Underwriters hereunder shall be subject, in their discretion, to the condition that all representations and warranties and other statements of the Company herein are, at and as of the Time of Delivery, true and correct, the condition that the Company shall have performed all of its obligations hereunder theretofore to be performed, and the following additional conditions:

     (ii) To the best of such counsel's knowledge and other than as set forth in the Prospectus, there are no legal or governmental proceedings pending to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or of which any property of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is the subject which would individually or in the aggregate be reasonably expected to have a material adverse effect on the current or future consolidated financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole; and, to
 
the best of such counsel's knowledge, no such proceedings are threatened by governmental authorities or threatened by others;
     (iii) This Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company;
     (iv) The Debentures have been duly authorized, executed, issued and delivered by the Company and, when executed and authenticated in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture and delivered to and paid for by the Underwriters in accordance with this Agreement, will constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company entitled to the benefits provided by the Indenture; and the Debentures and the Indenture conform in all material respects to the descriptions thereof in the Prospectus;
     (v) Each of the Indenture and the Replacement Capital Covenant has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery of the other parties thereto, constitutes a valid and binding instrument, enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject, as to enforcement, to the Bankruptcy Exceptions; and the Indenture has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act;
     (vi) The issue and sale of the Debentures and the compliance by the Company with all of the provisions of the Debentures and the Indenture and this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions herein and therein contemplated will not result in any violation of the provisions of the Articles of Incorporation or Code of Regulations of the Company or result in the violation of any statute or any order, rule or regulation known to such counsel of any court or governmental agency or body having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any of their properties except in any such instance or instances in which the breach or violation would not have a material adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole;
     (vii) No consent, approval, authorization, order, registration or qualification of or with any such court or governmental agency or body is required for the issue and sale of the Debentures or the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Indenture, except such as have been obtained under the Act and the Trust Indenture Act and such consents, approvals, authorizations, registrations or qualifications as may be required under any state securities or Blue Sky laws or any insurance laws in connection with the purchase and distribution of the Debentures by the Underwriters;
 
     (viii) The statements set forth in the Prospectus under the caption "Description of the Junior Subordinated Debentures", insofar as they purport to constitute a summary of the terms of the Debentures, and under the caption "Certain United States Federal Income and Estate Tax Consequences", insofar as they purport to describe the provisions of the laws and documents referred to therein, are fair summaries thereof;
     (ix) The Company is not and, after giving effect to the offering and sale of the Debentures and the application of the proceeds thereof as described in the Prospectus, will not be an "investment company", as such term is defined in the Investment Company Act;
     (x) The documents incorporated by reference in the Prospectus or any further amendment or supplement thereto made by the Company prior to the Time of Delivery (other than the financial statements and related schedules or other financial or statistical data included or incorporated by reference therein, as to which such counsel need express no opinion), when they became effective or were filed with the Commission, as the case may be, complied as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Act or the Exchange Act, as applicable, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder;
     (xi) The Registration Statement, the Prospectus and any further amendments and supplements thereto, as applicable, made by the Company prior to the Time of Delivery (other than the financial statements and related schedules or other financial or statistical data included or incorporated by reference therein, as to which such counsel need express no opinion) comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Act and the Trust Indenture Act and the rules and regulations thereunder; and they do not know of any amendment to the Registration Statement required to be filed such as would be necessary for the Registration Statement to so comply or of any contracts or other documents of a character required to be filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement or required to be incorporated by reference into the Prospectus or required to be described in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus or the Prospectus which are not filed or incorporated by reference or described as required; and
     (xii) Although they do not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, except for those referred to in the opinion in subsection (viii) of this Section 8(c), such counsel has no reason to believe that (i) the Registration Statement or any further amendment thereto made by the Company prior to the Time of Delivery (other than the financial statements and related schedules or
 
other financial or statistical information contained or incorporated by reference therein, as to which such counsel need express no opinion), when such part or amendment became effective, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; (ii) the Pricing Disclosure Package (other than the financial statements and related schedules or other financial or statistical information contained or incorporated by reference therein, as to which such counsel need express no opinion), as of the Applicable Time, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; or (iii) as of its date and as of the Time of Delivery, the Prospectus or any further amendment or supplement thereto made by the Company prior to the Time of Delivery (other than the financial statements and related schedules or other financial or statistical information contained or incorporated by reference therein, as to which such counsel need express no opinion) contained or contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;
     (d) Charles E. Jarrett, General Counsel for the Company, shall have furnished to the Representative his written opinion, dated the Time of Delivery in form and substance satisfactory to the Representative, to the effect that:
     (i) each Principal Subsidiary of the Company and Progressive County Mutual Insurance Company has been duly incorporated and is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation; and all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of each such Principal Subsidiary have been duly and validly authorized and issued, are fully paid and non-assessable, and (except for directors' qualifying shares) are owned directly or indirectly by the Company, free and clear of all liens, encumbrances, equities or claims;
     (ii) the issue and sale of the Debentures and the compliance by the Company with all of the provisions of the Debentures and the Indenture and this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions herein and therein contemplated will not conflict with or result in a breach or violation of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under, any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement or other agreement or instrument known to such counsel to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company or any of its subsidiaries
 
is bound or to which any of the property or assets of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is subject other than as would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole; and
     (iii) Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries is in violation of its Certificate of Incorporation, Code of Regulations or By-laws or in default in the performance or observance of any material obligation, covenant or condition contained in any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement, lease or other agreement or instrument to which it is a party or by which it or any of its properties may be bound other than as would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole.
     (e) On the date of the Prospectus at a time prior to the execution of this Agreement, at 9:30 a.m., New York City time, on the effective date of any post effective amendment to the Registration Statement filed subsequent to the date of this Agreement and also at the Time of Delivery, PricewaterhouseCoopers L.L.P. shall have furnished to the Representative a letter or letters, dated the respective dates of delivery thereof, in form and substance satisfactory to them, to the effect set forth in Annex I hereto (the executed copy of the letter delivered prior to the execution of this Agreement is attached as Annex I(a) hereto and a form of letter to be delivered on the effective date of any post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement, and as of the Time of Delivery is attached as Annex I(b) hereto);
     (f) (i) Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries shall have sustained since the date of the latest audited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Pricing Prospectus any loss or interference with its business from fire, explosion, flood or other calamity, whether or not covered by insurance, or from any labor dispute or court or governmental action, order or decree, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Pricing Prospectus, and (ii) since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Pricing Prospectus there shall not have been any change in the capital stock, other than as a result of share repurchases authorized by the Company's board of directors and disclosed to you, or long term debt of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the business, financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Pricing Prospectus, the effect of which, in any such case described in clause (i) or (ii), is in the judgment of the Representative so material and adverse as to make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Debentures on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus;
 
     (g) On or after the Applicable Time (i) no downgrading shall have occurred in the rating accorded the Company's debt securities by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization", as that term is defined by the Commission for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Act, and (ii) no such organization shall have publicly announced that it has under surveillance or review, and noting an intended or possible decrease in its rating of any of the Company's debt securities;
     (h) On or after the Applicable Time there shall not have occurred any of the following: (i) a suspension or material limitation in trading in securities generally on the Exchange; (ii) a suspension or material limitation in trading in the Company's securities on the New York Stock Exchange; (iii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities declared by either Federal or New York State authorities or a material disruption in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States; (iv) the outbreak or escalation of hostilities involving the United States or the declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war or (v) the occurrence of any other calamity or crisis or any change in financial, political or economic conditions in the United States or elsewhere, if the effect of any such event specified in clause (iv) or (v) in the judgment of the Representative makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Debentures on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus;
     (i) The Company shall have complied with the provisions of Section 5(e) hereof with respect to the furnishing of prospectuses on the New York Business Day next succeeding the date of this Agreement; and
     (j) The Company shall have furnished or caused to be furnished to the Representative at the Time of Delivery certificates of officers of the Company satisfactory to them as to the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company herein at and as of such time, as to the performance by the Company of all of its obligations hereunder to be performed at or prior to such time, as to the matters set forth in subsection (a) of this Section.
     9. (a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any "issuer information" filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Act, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
 
statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse each Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representative expressly for use therein.
     (b) Each Underwriter will indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus or any such amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representative expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred.
     (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any such action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure to so notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve such indemnifying party from any liability hereunder except to the extent that the indemnifying party is prejudiced as a result thereof and in any event shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of this Section 9. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the
 
extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable out-of-pocket costs of investigation. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
     (d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 9 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Debentures. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above (unless the failure to give such notice does not materially prejudice the indemnifying party), then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits received, but also the relative fault of, the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the
 
omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Debentures underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.
     (e) The obligations of the Company under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act and each broker-dealer affiliate of any Underwriter; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act.
     10. (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Debentures which it has agreed to purchase hereunder, the Representative may in their discretion arrange for the Representative or another party or other parties to purchase such Debentures on the terms contained herein. If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter the Representative does not arrange for the purchase of such Debentures, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to the Representative to purchase such Debentures on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed periods, the Representative notifies the Company that it has so arranged for the purchase of
 
such Debentures, or the Company notifies the Representative that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Debentures, the Representative or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Time of Delivery for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in the opinion of the Representative may thereby be made necessary. The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to this Agreement with respect to such Debentures. Nothing in this Section 10 shall relieve a defaulting underwriter from liability for its default, provided that the foregoing shall not reduce the Company's obligation to mitigate damages in the event of such a default.
     (b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Debentures of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representative and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Debentures which remains unpurchased does not exceed one eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Debentures, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Debentures which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the principal amount of Debentures which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder) of the Debentures of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
     (c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Debentures of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representative and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of Debentures which remains unpurchased exceeds one eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Debentures, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Debentures of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then this Agreement shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters as provided in Section 7 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 9 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
     11. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the several Underwriters,
 
as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Company, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Debentures.
     12. If this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 10 hereof, the Company shall not then be under any liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof; but, if for any other reason, the Debentures are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters through the Representative for all reasonable out of pocket expenses approved in writing by the Representative, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of the Debentures, but the Company shall then be under no further liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof.
     13. In all dealings hereunder, the Representative shall act on behalf of each of the Underwriters, and the parties hereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any Underwriter made or given by the Representative.
     All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing, and if to the Underwriters shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the Representative in care of Goldman, Sachs & Co., One New York Plaza, 42nd Floor, New York, New York 10004, Attention: Registration Department; and if to the Company shall be sent by mail to the address of the Company set forth in the Registration Statement, Attention: Secretary; provided, however, that any notice to an Underwriter pursuant to Section 9(c) hereof shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to such Underwriter at its address set forth in its Underwriters' Questionnaire, or telex constituting such Questionnaire, which address will be supplied to the Company by Goldman, Sachs & Co. upon request. Any such statements, requests, notices or agreements shall take effect upon receipt thereof.
     14. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure solely to the benefit of, the Underwriters, the Company and, to the extent provided in Sections 9 and 11 hereof, the officers and directors of the Company and each person who controls the Company or any Underwriter, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Agreement. No purchaser of any of the Debentures from any Underwriter shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase.
 
     15. Time shall be of the essence of this Agreement.
     16. The Company acknowledges and agrees that (i) the purchase and sale of the Debentures pursuant to this Agreement is an arm's-length commercial transaction between the Company, on the one hand, and the several Underwriters, on the other, (ii) in connection therewith and with the process leading to such transaction each Underwriter is acting solely as a principal and not the agent or fiduciary of the Company, (iii) no Underwriter has assumed an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in favor of the Company with respect to the offering contemplated hereby or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether such Underwriter has advised or is currently advising the Company on other matters) or any other obligation to the Company except the obligations expressly set forth in this Agreement and (iv) the Company has consulted its own legal and financial advisors to the extent it deemed appropriate. The Company agrees that it will not claim that the Underwriters, or any of them, has rendered advisory services of any nature or respect, or owes a fiduciary or similar duty to the Company, in connection with such transaction or the process leading thereto.
     17. This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings (whether written or oral) between the Company and the Underwriters, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof.
     18. 
This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.
     19. The Company and each of the Underwriters hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any and all right to trial by jury in any legal proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.
     20. This Agreement may be executed by any one or more of the parties hereto in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all such respective counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument.
     21. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company is authorized to disclose to any persons the U.S. federal and state income tax treatment and tax structure of the potential transaction and all materials of any kind (including tax opinions and other tax analyses) provided to the Company relating to that treatment and structure, without the Underwriters imposing any limitation of any kind. However, any information relating to the tax treatment and tax structure shall remain confidential (and the foregoing sentence shall not apply) to the extent necessary to enable any person to comply with securities laws.

Scheduled Maturity Date
               (ii) In the event the Issuer has delivered an Officers' Certificate to the Trustee pursuant to clause (v) of this Section 2.02(a) in connection with any Quarterly Interest Payment Date, (x) the principal amount of the Debentures payable on such Quarterly Interest Payment Date shall be the principal amount set forth in the notice of repayment, if any, accompanying such Officers' Certificate, (y) such principal amount shall be repaid on such Quarterly Interest Payment Date pursuant to Article 5 hereof to the extent of net proceeds received by the Issuer to the Date of QCS Notice, without duplication of prior amounts received, of the issuance of Qualifying Capital Securities as contemplated by Section 2.02 (a)(iv), and (z) the remaining Debentures shall remain outstanding and shall be payable on the immediately succeeding Quarterly Interest Payment Date to the extent of net proceeds received by the Issuer to the Date of QCS Notice, without duplication of prior amounts received, of the issuance of Qualifying Capital Securities as contemplated by Section 2.02 (a)(iv), and on each Quarterly Interest Payment Date thereafter to like extent until the Debentures are paid in full, or such earlier date on which they are redeemed pursuant to Article 4 hereof or become due and payable pursuant to Section 5.1 of the Indenture.
               (iii) The obligation of the Issuer to repay the Debentures pursuant to this Section 2.02(a) on any date prior to the Final Maturity Date shall be subject to (x) its obligations under Article Thirteen of the Indenture to the holders of Senior Indebtedness and
 
(y) its obligations under Section 2.05 hereof with respect to the payment of deferred interest on the Debentures.
               (iv) Until the Debentures are paid in full:
                    (A) the Issuer shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts, subject to a Market Disruption Event, to raise sufficient net proceeds from the issuance of Qualifying Capital Securities during a 180-day period ending on the date, not more than 15 and not less than ten Business Days prior to the Scheduled Maturity Date, on which the Issuer delivers the notice required by clause (v) of this Section 2.02(a) and Section 5.01, to permit repayment of the Debentures in full on the Scheduled Maturity Date pursuant to clause (i) of this Section 2.02(a); and
                    (B) if the Issuer is unable for any reason to raise sufficient net proceeds from the issuance of Qualifying Capital Securities to permit repayment in full of the Debentures on the Scheduled Maturity Date or any subsequent Quarterly Interest Payment Date, the Issuer shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts, subject to a Market Disruption Event, to raise sufficient net proceeds from the issuance of Qualifying Capital Securities during a 90-day period ending on the date, not more than 15 and not less than ten Business Days prior to the following Quarterly Interest Payment Date, on which the Issuer delivers the notice required by clause (v) of this Section 2.02(a) and Section 5.01, to permit repayment of the Debentures in full on such following Quarterly Interest Payment Date pursuant to clause (i) of this Section 2.02(a); and
                    (C) the Issuer shall apply any such net proceeds to the repayment of the Debentures as provided in clause (vi) of this
Section 2.02(a).
For the avoidance of doubt, the Issuer is not obligated to sell any securities other than Qualifying Capital Securities to raise net proceeds for repayment of the Debentures pursuant to this Section 2.02(a), or to apply the proceeds of any such sale of other securities to repayment of the Debentures pursuant to this Section 2.02(a), and no Holder of Debentures may require the Issuer to issue any such other securities in satisfaction of its obligations under this Section 2.02(a).
               (v) The Issuer, if it has not raised sufficient net proceeds from the issuance of Qualifying Capital Securities pursuant to clause (iv) above in connection with any Repayment Date, shall deliver an Officers' Certificate to the Trustee (who shall forward such certificate to each Holder of the Debentures) no more than 15 and no less than ten Business Days prior to such Repayment Date (the date of such delivery, the "") stating the amount of net proceeds, if any, raised pursuant to clause (iv) above in connection with such Repayment Date. The Issuer shall be excused from its obligation to use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to sell Qualifying Capital Securities pursuant to clause (iv) above if such Officers' Certificate further certifies that: (A) a Market Disruption Event was existing during the 180-day period preceding the date of such Officers' Certificate or, in the case of any Repayment Date after the Scheduled Maturity Date, the 90-day period preceding the date of such Officers' Certificate; and (B) either (x) the Market Disruption Event continued for the entire 180-day period or 90-day period, as the case may be, or (y) the Market Disruption Event continued for only part of the period but the Issuer was unable after Commercially Reasonable Efforts to raise
Date of QCS Notice
 
sufficient net proceeds during the rest of that period to permit repayment of the Debentures in full. Each Officers' Certificate delivered pursuant to this clause (v), unless no principal amount of Debentures is to be repaid on the applicable Repayment Date, shall be accompanied by a notice of repayment pursuant to Section 5.01 setting forth the principal amount of the Debentures to be repaid on such Repayment Date, which amount shall be determined after giving effect to clause (vi) of this Section 2.02(a). In the event the Issuer fails to deliver an Officer's Certificate to the Trustee in the manner described herein in connection with a Repayment Date, the Issuer shall be deemed to have confirmed that sufficient proceeds have been raised from an issuance of Qualifying Capital Securities, and all outstanding principal will be due on such Repayment Date.
               (vi) Payments in respect of the Debentures on any Repayment Date will be applied, first, to deferred interest on the Debentures to the extent of Eligible Proceeds raised pursuant to Section 2.06; second, to pay current interest on the Debentures to the extent not paid from other sources; and third, to repay the outstanding principal amount of the Debentures, subject to a minimum principal amount of $5,000,000 to be repaid on any Repayment Date; that if the Issuer is obligated to sell Qualifying Capital Securities and apply the net proceeds therefrom to payments of principal of or interest on any Pari Passu Securities in addition to the Debentures, then on any date and for any period, the amount of net proceeds received by the Issuer from those sales and available for such payments shall be applied to the Debentures and those other Pari Passu Securities having the same scheduled maturity date as the Debentures pro rata in accordance with their respective outstanding principal amounts, and no such payments shall be made to any other such Pari Passu Securities having a later scheduled maturity date until the principal of and all accrued and unpaid interest on the Debentures have been paid in full, except to the extent permitted by Sections 3.01 and 2.06(c). If the Issuer raises less than $5,000,000 of net proceeds from the sale of Qualifying Capital Securities during the relevant 180-day or 90-day period, the Issuer will not be required to repay any Debentures on the Scheduled Maturity Date or the next Quarterly Interest Payment Date, as applicable. On the next Quarterly Interest Payment Date as of which the Issuer has raised at least $5,000,000 of net proceeds during the 180-day period (or, if shorter, the period beginning on the date on which the Issuer last repaid any principal amount of Debentures) ending on the date not more than 15 and not less than ten Business Days prior to such Quarterly Interest Payment Date, on which the Issuer delivers the notice required by clause (v) of this Section 2.02(a) and Section 5.01, the Issuer shall be required to repay a principal amount of the Debentures equal to the entire net proceeds from the sale of Qualifying Capital Securities during such 180-day or shorter period on such Quarterly Interest Payment Date.
provided
               (vii) The Issuer shall not amend the Replacement Capital Covenant to impose additional restrictions on the type or amount of Qualifying Capital Securities that the Issuer may include for purposes of determining whether or to what extent repayment, redemption or purchase of the Debentures is permitted under the Replacement Capital Covenant, except with the consent of Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Debentures. Except as aforesaid, the Issuer may amend or supplement the Replacement Capital Covenant in accordance with its terms and without the consent of the Holders of the Debentures.
 
          
(b) Final Maturity Date
          The principal of, and all accrued and unpaid interest on, all outstanding Debentures shall be due and payable on June 15, 2067 or, if such date is not a Business Day, the following Business Day (the ""), regardless of the amount of Qualifying Capital Securities the Issuer may have issued and sold by that time.

Commencing on and including June 15, 2017, the Debentures shall bear interest at an annual rate of Three-Month LIBOR plus 2.0175% (the ""), computed for each Quarterly Interest Period on the basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of days elapsed. Except as provided in Section 2.04(b), interest will accrue from and including each Interest Payment Date to, but excluding, the immediately succeeding Interest Payment Date. Accrued interest that is not paid on the applicable Interest Payment Date, including interest deferred pursuant to Section 2.05, will bear Additional Interest, to the extent permitted by law, at the interest rate in effect from time to time provided in this Section 2.04(a), from the relevant Interest Payment Date, compounded on each subsequent Interest Payment Date.

Section 2.05. Interest Deferral
          
(a) Option to Defer Interest Payments
               (i) Subject to other provisions hereof, the Issuer shall have the right, at any time and from time to time, to defer the payment of interest on the Debentures for one or more consecutive Interest Periods that do not exceed ten years for any single Deferral Period, provided that no Deferral Period shall extend beyond the Final Maturity Date or the earlier repayment or redemption in full of the Debentures. If the Issuer has paid all deferred interest on the Debentures, the Issuer shall have the right to elect to begin a new Deferral Period pursuant to this Section 2.05.
               (ii) At the end of any Deferral Period, the Issuer shall pay all deferred interest on the Debentures (including Additional Interest thereon) to the Persons in whose names the Debentures are registered in the Securities Register at the close of business on the Regular Record Date with respect to the Interest Payment Date at the end of such Deferral Period.
               (iii) The Issuer may elect to pay interest on any Interest Payment Date during any Deferral Period to the extent permitted by Section 2.05(b).
          
(b) Payment of Deferred Interest
          Subject to a Market Disruption Event as described under Section 2.06(b), the Issuer will not pay any deferred interest on the Debentures from any source other than Eligible Proceeds prior to the Final Maturity Date, except at any time that the principal amount of the Debentures has been accelerated and such acceleration has not been rescinded or in the case of a
 
Business Combination to the extent described below in Section 2.05(c). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer may pay current interest from any available funds.
          
(c) Business Combination Exception
          If (i) the Issuer is involved in a Business Combination where immediately after its consummation more than 50% of the voting shares of the surviving entity of such Business Combination, or the Person to whom all or substantially all of the Issuer's properties or assets are conveyed, transferred or leased in such Business Combination, is owned, directly or indirectly, by the shareholders of the other party to such Business Combination, and (ii) at the time the Business Combination is consummated a Deferral Period is continuing, then Section 2.05(b) shall not apply to any payment of deferred interest for such Deferral Period, if such Deferral Period is terminated on the next Interest Payment Date following the date of consummation of the Business Combination.
          
(d) Notice of Deferral
          The Issuer shall give written notice of its election to commence or continue any Deferral Period to the Trustee and the Holders of the Debentures at least one Business Day and not more than 60 Business Days before the next Interest Payment Date. Such notice shall be given to the Trustee and each Holder of Debentures at such Holder's address appearing in the Security Register by first-class mail, postage prepaid.
Section 2.06. Alternative Payment Mechanism
          
(a) Obligation to Issue Qualifying APM Securities
          Immediately following the earlier of (i) the first Interest Payment Date following the commencement of a Deferral Period on which the Issuer pays any current interest on the Debentures (which the Issuer may do from any source of funds) or (ii) the fifth anniversary of the commencement of the Deferral Period, the Issuer, subject to the occurrence and continuation of a Market Disruption Event as described under Section 2.06(b) and subject to Section 2.05(b) and Section 2.06(c), shall issue one or more types of Qualifying APM Securities until the Issuer has raised an amount of Eligible Proceeds at least equal to the aggregate amount of accrued and unpaid deferred interest (including compounding interest thereon) on the Debentures. The Issuer shall apply such Eligible Proceeds on the next Interest Payment Date to the payment of deferred interest in accordance with this Section 2.06. The requirement set forth in this Section 2.06(a) shall be in effect until the end of such Deferral Period. Notwithstanding (and as a qualification to) the foregoing:
               (i) the Issuer shall not be required to issue Common Shares or, if the definition of Qualifying APM Securities has been amended to eliminate Common Shares, Qualifying Warrants prior to the fifth anniversary of the commencement of a Deferral Period, to the extent that the number of Common Shares issued or issuable upon exercise of Qualifying Warrants to be applied for purposes of funding deferred interest hereunder, together with the number of Common Shares previously issued or issuable upon exercise of Qualifying Warrants previously issued during such Deferral Period, to the extent still outstanding, and applied for such purposes, would exceed an amount equal to 2% of the total number of issued and
 
outstanding Common Shares reported in the Issuer's then most recent publicly available consolidated financial statements immediately prior to the date of such issuance (the ""); that the Common Equity Issuance Cap will cease to apply with respect to a Deferral Period following the fifth anniversary of the commencement of such Deferral Period, at which point the Issuer must pay any deferred interest, regardless of the time at which it was deferred, pursuant to this Section 2.06, subject to a Market Disruption Event and the Share Cap Amount; and , , that if the Common Equity Issuance Cap is reached during a Deferral Period and the Issuer subsequently pays all deferred interest, the Common Equity Issuance Cap will cease to apply with respect to such Deferral Period at the termination of such Deferral Period and will not apply again unless and until the Issuer starts a new Deferral Period;
Common Equity Issuance Cap
provided
provided
further
               (ii) the Issuer shall not be permitted to issue Qualifying Non-Cumulative Preferred Shares or Mandatorily Convertible Preferred Shares to the extent that the net proceeds of any issuance of Qualifying Non-Cumulative Preferred Shares and Mandatorily Convertible Preferred Shares, together with the net proceeds of all prior issuances of Qualifying Non-Cumulative Preferred Shares and Mandatorily Convertible Preferred Shares during the current and all prior Deferral Periods, to the extent still outstanding, would exceed 25% of the aggregate principal amount of the Debentures (the ""); and
Preferred Share Issuance Cap
               (iii) notwithstanding the Common Equity Issuance Cap and the Preferred Share Issuance Cap, so long as there are outstanding Debentures, the Issuer shall not be permitted, subject to the provisions of the three immediately succeeding paragraphs, to sell Common Shares, Qualifying Warrants or Mandatorily Convertible Preferred Shares to pay deferred interest on the Debentures if the number of Common Shares to be issued (or which would be issuable upon exercise or conversion of such Qualifying Warrants or Mandatorily Convertible Preferred Shares) to pay such deferred interest would be in excess of an amount (the "", subject to adjustment as provided in the second succeeding paragraph) equal to the greater of (a) 150,000,000 Common Shares the number of Common Shares that the Issuer repurchases or that are added to Shares Available for Issuance (as defined below) pursuant to the second paragraph below, in either case after the date of issuance of the Debentures (the "" of the Share Cap Amount, provided that the Fixed Rate Portion shall not exceed 250,000,000 shares), in the aggregate, during the period the Debentures are outstanding or (b) on any date on which the Issuer is otherwise obligated to sell Qualifying APM Securities pursuant to this Section 2.06, the Issuer's then effective Shares Available for Issuance; that if the issued and outstanding Common Shares are changed into a different number of shares or a different class by reason of any share split, reverse share split, share dividend, reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares or other similar transaction, the Fixed Rate Portion of the Share Cap Amount shall be correspondingly adjusted. If the Issuer issues additional Debentures, then the Share Cap Amount will be increased accordingly.
Share Cap Amount
plus
Fixed Rate Portion
provided
               The Issuer's "" shall be calculated as of any day in two steps. First, from the number of authorized and unissued Common Shares, the maximum number of Common Shares that can be issued under existing options, warrants, convertible securities, any equity-linked contracts, any equity compensation plans for directors,
Shares Available for Issuance
 
officers or employees and other plans and agreements which require or permit the Issuer to issue a determinable number of Common Shares shall be deducted. After deduction of that number of Common Shares from authorized and unissued Common Shares, the remaining available Common Shares shall be allocated on a pro rata basis or on such other basis as the Issuer deems appropriate to the obligation to issue securities under this Section 2.06 and to any other similar commitment that is of an indeterminate nature and under which the Issuer is then required to issue Common Shares. If the Shares Available for Issuance are zero after the two steps described above, there shall be no obligation to obtain additional Common Shares other than the obligation to use commercially reasonable efforts to seek adoption of a shareholder vote at the Issuer's next occurring annual shareholders' meeting to increase the number of authorized Common Shares as described below.
               The Issuer in any event shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to increase Shares Available for Issuance to at least 250,000,000 Common Shares by not later than five years after initial issuance of the Debentures. Once Shares Available for Issuance are at least 250,000,000 Common Shares, then the Share Cap Amount shall automatically be amended to mean 250,000,000 Common Shares minus the number of Common Shares, if any, sold prior to such date to settle deferred interest pursuant to this Section 2.06 and thereafter will not be determined in part by reference to Shares Available for Issuance. Promptly after each increase in the Share Cap Amount of 50,000,000 Common Shares, the Issuer will file a current report on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission giving notice of such increase.
               In addition to the Issuer's obligation described in the preceding paragraph, if the Share Cap Amount has been reached and such amount is not sufficient to allow the Issuer to raise sufficient Eligible Proceeds to pay all deferred interest then accrued in full, the Issuer shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to increase the Share Cap Amount (which it may do in its discretion without the approval of any Holder) (1) only to the extent that the Issuer can do so and simultaneously satisfy its future fixed or contingent obligations under other securities and derivative instruments that provide for settlement or payment in Common Shares or (2) if the Issuer cannot increase the Share Cap Amount as contemplated in the preceding clause (1), by requesting the Issuer's Board of Directors to adopt a resolution for shareholder vote at the next occurring annual shareholders meeting to increase the number of the Issuer's authorized Common Shares for purposes of satisfying the Issuer's obligations to pay deferred interest.
               For the avoidance of doubt, (x) once the Issuer reaches the Common Equity Issuance Cap for a Deferral Period, the Issuer shall not be obligated to issue more Common Shares, or if the definition of Qualifying APM Securities has been amended to eliminate Common Shares, more Qualifying Warrants pursuant to this Section 2.06(a) prior to the fifth anniversary of the commencement of such Deferral Period even if the number of outstanding Common Shares subsequently increases, and (y) so long as the definition of Qualifying APM Securities has not been amended to eliminate Common Shares, the sale of Qualifying Warrants to pay deferred interest is an option that may be exercised at the Issuer's sole discretion, subject to the Common Equity Issuance Cap and the Share Cap Amount, and the Issuer is not obligated to sell Qualifying Warrants or to apply the proceeds of any such sale to pay deferred interest on the Debentures, and no class of holders of the Issuer's securities, or any other party, may require the Issuer to issue Qualifying Warrants in satisfaction of its obligations under this Section 2.06(a).
 
          
(b) Market Disruption Event
          Section 2.06(a) shall not apply, with respect to any Interest Payment Date, if the Issuer shall have provided to the Trustee (which the Trustee will promptly forward upon receipt to each Holder of Debentures) no more than 15 and no less than ten Business Days prior to such Interest Payment Date an Officers' Certificate stating that (i) a Market Disruption Event was existing after the immediately preceding Interest Payment Date and (ii) either (A) the Market Disruption Event continued for the entire period from the Business Day immediately following the preceding Interest Payment Date to the Business Day immediately preceding the date on which such Officers' Certificate is provided or (B) the Market Disruption Event continued for only part of such period, but the Issuer was unable despite using commercially reasonable efforts to raise sufficient Eligible Proceeds during the rest of that period to pay all accrued and unpaid interest.
          
(c) Partial Payment of Deferred Interest
               (i) If the Issuer has raised some but not all Eligible Proceeds necessary to pay all deferred interest on any Interest Payment Date pursuant to this Section 2.06, such Eligible Proceeds shall be applied to pay accrued and unpaid interest on the applicable Interest Payment Date in chronological order based on the date each payment was first deferred, subject to the Common Equity Issuance Cap, the Preferred Shares Issuance Cap and the Share Cap Amount, as applicable, and payment on each installment of deferred interest shall be distributed to Holders of the Debentures on a pro rata basis.
               (ii) If the Issuer has other outstanding Pari Passu Securities under which the Issuer is obligated to sell securities that are Qualifying APM Securities and apply the Eligible Proceeds to the payment of deferred interest or distributions, then on any date and for any period the amount of Eligible Proceeds received by the Issuer from those sales and available for payment of the deferred interest and distributions shall be applied to the Debentures and those other Pari Passu Securities on a pro rata basis up to the Common Equity Issuance Cap or the Preferred Shares Issuance Cap and the Share Cap Amount (or comparable provisions in the instruments governing those other Pari Passu Securities) in proportion to the total amounts that are due on the Debentures and such other Pari Passu Securities.
          
(d) Qualifying Warrants
          If the Issuer sells Qualifying Warrants to pay deferred interest to satisfy its obligations pursuant to this Section 2.06, the Issuer shall use commercially reasonable efforts, subject to the Common Equity Issuance Cap, to set the terms of such Qualifying Warrants so as to raise sufficient proceeds from their issuance to pay all deferred interest on the Debentures in accordance with this Section 2.06.
          
(e) Qualifying APM Securities Definition Change
          The Issuer may, without the consent of any Holders of the Debentures, amend the definition of Qualifying APM Securities in Section 1.01 to eliminate Common Shares or Qualifying Warrants (but not both) and/or Mandatorily Convertible Preferred Shares from the definition of Qualifying APM Securities if, after the date of the first issuance of any Debentures,
 
an accounting standard or interpretive guidance of an existing accounting standard issued by an organization or regulator that has responsibility for establishing or interpreting accounting standards in the United States becomes effective such that there is more than an insubstantial risk that failure to eliminate Common Shares, Qualifying Warrants and/or Mandatorily Convertible Preferred Shares, as the case may be, from the definition would result in a reduction in the Issuer's earnings per share as calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The Issuer shall send written notice to the Trustee (who shall promptly forward such notice to each Holder of the Debentures) in advance of any such change in the definition of Qualifying APM Securities.
Section 2.07. Events of Default
          (a) Solely for purposes of the Debentures, Section 5.1 (other than the last paragraph thereof) of the Indenture shall be deleted and replaced by the following (capitalized terms used in the following text that are not defined in the Indenture but are defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms herein):

     (1) default in the payment of accrued interest in full on the Debentures on any Interest Payment Date (whether or not such Interest Payment Date commenced a Deferral Period) and the failure of the Issuer on or before the conclusion of a ten-year period following such Interest Payment Date to pay interest (including compounded interest) then accrued in full; or
     (2) default in the payment of principal on the Debentures when due, whether on the Scheduled Maturity Date or the Final Maturity Date, upon redemption, upon a declaration of acceleration, or otherwise, except that the failure to use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to issue Qualifying Capital Securities pursuant to Section 2.02(a)(iv) shall not constitute an Event of Default; or
     (3) the entry by a court having jurisdiction in the premises of (A) a decree or order for relief in respect of the Issuer in an involuntary case or proceeding under any applicable Federal or State bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar law or (B) a decree or order adjudging the Issuer a bankrupt or insolvent, or approving as properly filed a petition seeking reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or
 
composition of or in respect of the Issuer under any applicable Federal or State law, or appointing a custodian, receiver, liquidator, assignee, trustee, sequestrator or other similar official of the Issuer or of any substantial part of its property, or ordering the winding up or liquidation of its affairs, and the continuance of any such decree or order for relief or any such other decree or order unstayed and in effect for a period of 90 consecutive days; or
     (4) the commencement by the Issuer of a voluntary case or proceeding under any applicable Federal or State bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar law or of any other case or proceeding to be adjudicated a bankrupt or insolvent, or the consent by it to the entry of a decree or order for relief in respect of the Issuer in an involuntary case or proceeding under any applicable Federal or State bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar law or to the commencement of any bankruptcy or insolvency case or proceeding against it, or the filing by it of a petition or answer or consent seeking reorganization or relief under any applicable Federal or State law, or the consent by it to the filing of such petition or to the appointment of or taking possession by a custodian, receiver, liquidator, assignee, trustee, sequestrator or similar official of the Issuer or of any substantial part of its property, or the making by it of an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the admission by it in writing of its inability to pay its debts generally as they become due, or the taking of corporate action by the Issuer in furtherance of any such action.
     If the Issuer gives a timely written notice of its election to commence or continue a Deferral Period on any Interest Payment Date (and, if such notice continues a Deferral Period, the Deferral Period has not continued for ten years), then no "default" or "Event of Default" shall be deemed to arise from the Issuer's non-payment of interest on such Interest Payment Date.
     If the Issuer fails to pay principal on the Debentures on the Scheduled Maturity Date or any subsequent Interest Payment Date as a result of the failure to raise sufficient proceeds from the issuance of Qualifying Capital Securities despite the Issuer's Commercially Reasonable Efforts to do so pursuant to Section 2.02(a)(iv), such failure shall not constitute a "default" or "Event of Default" hereunder.
     When the Trustee incurs expenses or renders services in connection with an Event of Default specified in clauses (3) and (4) set forth in this Section 5.01, the expenses (including the reasonable charges and expenses of its counsel) and the compensation for such services are intended to constitute expenses of administration under any bankruptcy law.
 
     If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default specified in (3) or (4) above) with respect to the Debentures occurs and is continuing, then in every such case the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Debentures may declare the principal amount of all of the Debentures and interest accrued but unpaid thereon, if any, to be due and payable immediately, by a notice in writing to the Issuer (and to the Trustee if given by the Holders), and upon any such declaration, such amount shall become immediately due and payable. If an Event of Default specified in (3) or (4) above occurs, the principal amount of all the Debentures (or, if any Debentures are Original Issue Discount Securities, such portion of the principal amount of such Debentures as may be specified by the terms thereof) shall automatically, and without any declaration or other action on the part of the Trustee or any Holder, become immediately due and payable.
     At any time after such a declaration of acceleration with respect to the Debentures has been made and before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the Trustee as provided in Article Five of the Indenture, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Debentures by written notice to the Issuer and the Trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences if:
     (x) the Issuer has paid or deposited with the Trustee a sum sufficient to pay:
     (A) all Additional Interest on all Debentures,
     (B) the principal of (and premium, if any, on) the Debentures which has become due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration and all interest accrued thereon at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in the Debentures,
     (C) to the extent that payment of such interest is lawful, interest upon overdue interest at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in the Debentures, and
     (D) all sums paid or advanced by the Trustee hereunder and the agreed upon compensation and reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel; and
     (y) all Events of Default with respect to the Debentures, other than the non-payment of the principal of the Debentures which has become due solely by such declaration of acceleration, have been cured or waived as provided under Section 5.10 of the Indenture.
 
     No such rescission shall affect any subsequent Event of Default or impair any right consequent thereon.
          (b) The Trustee shall provide to the Holders of the Debentures such notices as it shall from time to time provide with respect to the Debentures under Section 5.11 of the Indenture. In addition, the Trustee shall provide to the Holders of the Debentures notice of any Event of Default or event that, with the giving of notice or lapse of time, or both, would become an Event of Default with respect to the Debentures within 90 days after the actual knowledge of a Responsible Officer of the Trustee of such Event of Default or other event. However, except in cases of a default or an Event of Default in payment on the Debentures, the Trustee will be protected in withholding the notice if one of its Responsible Officers determines that withholding of the notice is in the interest of such Holders.
          (c) The Issuer's failure to pay interest on the Debentures during a Deferral Period in accordance with Sections 2.05 and 2.06 of this First Supplemental Indenture shall constitute a default under the Indenture, but in no event shall constitute an Event of Default. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Indenture or this First Supplemental Indenture, the Trustee shall have no obligation to exercise any remedies hereunder unless and except to the extent directed in writing to do so by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Debentures in accordance with and subject to the conditions set forth in Section 5.8 of the Indenture. The Trustee may conclusively assume that Sections 2.05 and 2.06 of this First Supplemental Indenture have been complied with unless the Issuer or the Holders of 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Debentures have given the Trustee written notice to the contrary.
          (d) For the avoidance of doubt, and without prejudice to any other remedies that may be available to the Trustee or the Holders of the Debentures under the Indenture, no breach by the Issuer of any covenant or obligation under the Indenture or the terms of the Debentures or the terms of this First Supplemental Indenture, including the Issuer's obligations under Section 2.02(a)(iv), Section 2.05 or Section 2.06, shall be an Event of Default with respect to the Debentures, other than those specified in this Section 2.07; and except as provided herein and in the Indenture with respect to Events of Default, and as provided in Section 2.07(c) above, the Trustee shall be under no duty or obligation to exercise any remedies or otherwise take any action in respect of any other default that may occur under or in respect of this First Supplemental Indenture or the Indenture.
Section 2.08. Securities Registrar; Paying Agent; Delegation of Trustee Duties
          (a) The Issuer appoints the Trustee as Securities Registrar and Paying Agent with respect to the Debentures.
          (b) Notwithstanding any provision contained herein, to the extent permitted by applicable law, the Trustee may delegate its duty to provide such notices and to perform such other duties as may be required to be provided or performed by the Trustee under the Indenture, and, to the extent such obligation has been so delegated, the Trustee shall not be responsible for monitoring the compliance of, nor be liable for the default or misconduct of, any such designee.
 
     Each Holder, by such Holder's acceptance of the Debentures, agrees that if a bankruptcy event of the Issuer shall occur prior to the redemption or repayment of such Debentures, such Holder shall have no claim for, and thus no right to receive, any deferred interest pursuant to Section 2.05 that has not been paid pursuant to Sections 2.05 and 2.06 to the extent the amount of such interest exceeds the sum of (x) interest that relates to the earliest two years of the portion of the Deferral Period for which interest has not been paid and (y) an amount equal to such Holder's pro rata share of the excess, if any, of the Preferred Shares Issuance Cap over the aggregate amount of net proceeds from the sale of Qualifying Non-Cumulative Preferred Shares and unconverted Mandatorily Convertible Preferred Shares that the Issuer has applied to pay deferred interest pursuant to the alternative payment mechanism set forth in Section 2.06; provided that each Holder is deemed to agree that to the extent the claim for deferred interest exceeds the amount set forth in clause (x), the amount it receives in respect of such excess shall not exceed the amount it would have received had the claim for such excess ranked pari passu with the interests of the holders, if any, of Qualifying Non-Cumulative Preferred Shares.
     Solely for the purposes of the Debentures, the text of Section 3.1 of the Indenture following the first sentence thereof shall be deleted and replaced by the following (capitalized terms used in the following text that are not defined in the Indenture but are defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms herein):
     Payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on the Debentures will be made at the Paying Agent office, in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts; provided, however, that at the option of the Issuer payment of interest may be made (i) by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address shall appear in the Securities Register or (ii) by wire transfer in immediately available funds at such place and to such bank account number as may be designated by the Person entitled thereto as specified in the Securities Register in writing not less than ten days before the relevant Interest Payment Date. The office where the Debentures may be presented or surrendered for payment and the office where the Debentures may be surrendered for transfer or exchange and where notices and demands to or upon the Issuer in respect of the Debentures and the Indenture may be served shall be the Paying Agent office.
     The Debentures shall not be subject to any sinking fund or analogous provisions.
 
Section 2.12. Subordination
     The subordination provisions of Article Thirteen of the Indenture shall apply to the Debentures.
Section 2.13. Defeasance
     The provisions of Section 10.1(B) of the Indenture (relating to discharge of the Indenture) shall apply to the Debentures.
Section 3.01. Dividend and Other Payment Stoppages
     So long as any Debentures remain outstanding, if the Issuer has given notice of its election to defer interest payments on the Debentures but the related Deferral Period has not yet commenced or a Deferral Period is continuing, the Issuer shall not, and shall not permit any Subsidiary to:
          (a) declare or pay any dividends or other distributions on, or redeem, purchase, acquire or make a liquidation payment with respect to, any shares of capital stock of the Issuer;
          (b) make any payment of principal of, or interest or premium, if any, on, or repay, purchase or redeem any of the Issuer's debt securities that rank upon the Issuer's liquidation on a parity with or junior to the Debentures; or
          (c) make any guarantee payments regarding any guarantee issued by the Issuer of securities of any Subsidiary if the guarantee ranks upon the Issuer's liquidation on a parity with or junior to the Debentures;
, , the restrictions in clauses (a), (b) and (c) above do not apply to:
provided
however
               (i) any purchase, redemption or other acquisition of shares of its capital stock by the Issuer in connection with;
     (A) any employment contract, benefit plan or other similar arrangement with or for the benefit of any one or more of its employees, officers, directors, consultants or independent contractors;
     (B) the satisfaction of the Issuer's obligations pursuant to any contract entered into in the ordinary course of business prior to the beginning of the applicable Deferral Period;
     (C) a dividend reinvestment or shareholder purchase plan; or
 
     (D) the issuance of shares of the Issuer's capital stock, or securities convertible into or exercisable for such shares, as consideration in an acquisition transaction, the definitive agreement for which is entered into prior to the applicable Deferral Period;
               (ii) any exchange, redemption or conversion of any class or series of the Issuer's capital stock, or shares of the capital stock of one of its Subsidiaries, for any other class or series of the Issuer's capital stock, or of any class or series of the Issuer's indebtedness for any class or series of the Issuer's capital stock;
               (iii) any purchase of fractional interests in shares of the Issuer's capital stock pursuant to the conversion or exchange provisions of such shares or the securities being converted or exchanged;
               (iv) any declaration of a dividend in connection with any shareholder rights plan, or the issuance of rights, stock or other property under any shareholder rights plan, or the redemption or purchase of rights pursuant thereto; or
               (v) any dividend in the form of stock, warrants, options or other rights where the dividend stock issuable upon exercise of such warrants, options or other rights is the same stock as that on which the dividend is being paid or ranks equally with or junior to such stock;
               (vi) (A) any payment of current or deferred interest on Pari Passu Securities that is made pro rata to the amounts due on such Pari Passu Securities; provided that such payments are made in accordance with Section 2.06(c)(ii) to the extent it applies, and (B) any payments of principal or current or deferred interest on Pari Passu Securities that, if not made, would cause the Issuer to breach the terms of the instrument governing such Pari Passu Securities; or
               (vii) any payment of principal in respect of Pari Passu Securities having the same scheduled maturity date as the Debentures, as required under a provision of such other Pari Passu Securities that is substantially the same as the provisions in Section 2.02(a), and that is made on a pro rata basis among one or more series of Pari Passu Securities having such a provision and the Debentures.
Section 3.02. Additional Limitation on Deferral Over One Year
     If any Deferral Period lasts longer than one year, the Issuer may not redeem or purchase any securities of the Issuer that on the Issuer's bankruptcy or liquidation rank pari passu with or junior to any of its Qualifying APM Securities the proceeds of which were applied, pursuant to Section 2.06, to fund deferred interest on the Debentures during the relevant Deferral Period until the first anniversary of the date on which all deferred interest on the Debentures has been paid. However, if the Issuer is involved in a Business Combination where immediately after its consummation more than 50% of the voting shares of the surviving entity of such Business Combination, or the Person to whom all or substantially all of the Issuer's properties or assets are conveyed, transferred or leased in such Business Combination, is owned, directly or indirectly, by the shareholders of the other party to such Business Combination, then the immediately
 
preceding sentence shall not apply during the Deferral Period that is terminated on the next Interest Payment Date following the date of consummation of such Business Combination.
Section 4.01. Redemption Price
     The Debentures shall be redeemable in accordance with Article Twelve of the Indenture. The Debentures are redeemable in whole or in part at the option of the Issuer at any time and from time to time after the date of this First Supplemental Indenture. In the case of any redemption, the Redemption Price shall be equal to (1) in the case of any redemption on or after June 15, 2017, 100% of the principal amount of the Debentures being redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest to the Redemption Date or (2) in the case of any redemption prior to June 15, 2017, the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Debentures being redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest to the Redemption Date and (ii) the Make-Whole Redemption Price (the price set forth in (1) or (2), as applicable, the ""). If a proposed redemption of Debentures is not to be for all of the Debentures in whole, the Issuer may not effect such redemption unless at least $25,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Debentures, excluding any Debentures held by the Issuer or any of its affiliates, remains outstanding after giving effect to such redemption. The date on which Debentures are to be redeemed pursuant hereto is referred to as the "".

Redemption Date
Section 4.02. Limitation on Partial Redemption
     Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer may not redeem the Debentures in part if the principal amount of the Debentures has been accelerated pursuant to Section 5.1 of the Indenture (as amended by Section 2.07(a) hereof) and such acceleration has not been rescinded. In addition, the Issuer may not redeem the Debentures in part unless all accrued and unpaid interest, including deferred interest, has been paid in full on all Outstanding Debentures for all Interest Periods terminating on or before the Redemption Date.
Section 5.01. Repayments
     The Issuer, not more than 15 nor less than ten Business Days prior to each Repayment Date (unless a shorter notice shall be satisfactory to the Trustee), shall notify the Trustee of the principal amount of Debentures to be repaid on such date pursuant to Section 2.02(a).
Section 5.02. Selection of the Debentures to be Repaid
     If less than all the Debentures are to be repaid on any Repayment Date (unless the Debentures are issued in the form of a Global Security), the particular Debentures to be repaid shall be selected not more than 60 days prior to such Repayment Date by the Trustee, from the Outstanding Debentures not previously repaid or called for redemption, by such method as then may be required by law or if no such legal requirement shall then exist, by lot or such other
 
method as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate and which may provide for the selection for redemption of a portion of the principal amount of any Debentures, that the portion of the principal amount of any Debentures not repaid shall be in an authorized denomination (which shall not be less than the minimum authorized denomination).
provided
     The Trustee shall promptly notify the Issuer in writing of the Debentures selected for partial repayment and the principal amount thereof to be repaid. For all purposes hereof, unless the context otherwise requires, all provisions relating to the repayment of Debentures shall relate, in the case of any Debentures repaid or to be repaid only in part, to the portion of the principal amount of such Debentures which has been or is to be repaid.
Section 5.03. Notice of Repayment
     Notice of repayment shall be given by first-class mail, postage prepaid, mailed not earlier than the 60th day, and not later than the 30 day, prior to the Repayment Date, to each Holder of Debentures to be repaid, at the address of such Holder as it appears in the Security Register.
th
     Each notice of repayment shall identify the Debentures to be repaid (including the Debentures' CUSIP number, if a CUSIP number has been assigned to the Debentures) and shall state:
          (a) the Repayment Date;
          (b) if less than all Outstanding Debentures are to be repaid, the identification (and, in the case of partial repayment, the respective principal amounts) of the particular Debentures to be repaid;
          (c) that on the Repayment Date, the principal amount of the Debentures to be repaid will become due and payable upon each such Debentures or portion thereof, and that interest thereon, if any, shall cease to accrue on and after said date; and
          (d) the place or places where such Debentures are to be surrendered for payment of the principal amount thereof.
     Notice of repayment shall be given by the Issuer or, if the Issuer timely notifies the Trustee, at the Issuer's request, by the Trustee in the name and at the expense of the Issuer and shall be irrevocable. The notice, if mailed in the manner herein provided, shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the Holders receive such notice. In any case, a failure to give such notice by mail or any defect in the notice to any Holder of any Debentures designated for repayment as a whole or in part shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the repayment of any other Debentures.
Section 5.04. Deposit of Repayment Amount
     Prior to 11:00 a.m. New York City time on the Repayment Date specified in the notice of repayment given as provided in Section 5.03, the Issuer will deposit with the Trustee or with one or more Paying Agents (or if the Issuer is acting as its own Paying Agent, the Issuer will segregate and hold in trust as provided in Section 3.4 of the Indenture) an amount of money, in
 
immediately available funds, sufficient to pay the principal amount of, and any accrued interest on, all the Debentures which are to be repaid on that date.

     If any notice of repayment has been given as provided in Section 5.03, the Debentures or portion of the Debentures with respect to which such notice has been given shall become due and payable on the date and at the place or places stated in such notice. On surrender of such Debentures at a place of payment in said notice specified, the said Debentures or the specified portions thereof shall be paid by the Issuer at their principal amount, together with accrued interest to but excluding the Repayment Date; that, except in the case of a repayment in full of all Outstanding Debentures, installments of interest due on or prior to the Repayment Date will be payable to the Holders of such Debentures, registered as such at the close of business on the relevant Regular Record Dates according to their terms and the provisions of Section 3.1 of the Indenture.
provided
     Upon surrender of any Debentures repaid in part only, the Issuer shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and make available for delivery to the Holders thereof, at the expense of the Issuer, a new Debenture, of authorized denominations, in aggregate principal amount equal to the portion of the Debentures not repaid and so presented and having the same Scheduled Maturity Date and other terms. If a Global Security is so surrendered, such new Debentures will be a new Global Security.
     If any Debentures required to be repaid shall not be so repaid upon surrender thereof, the principal of such Debentures shall bear interest from the applicable Repayment Date until paid at the rate prescribed therefor in the Debentures.
Section 6.01. Calculation of Original Issue Discount
     If during any calendar year any original issue discount shall have accrued on the Debentures, the Issuer shall file with each Paying Agent (including the Trustee if it is a Paying Agent) promptly at the end of each calendar year (a) a written notice specifying the amount of original issue discount (including daily rates and accrual periods) accrued on Outstanding Securities as of the end of such year and (b) such other specific information relating to such original issue discount as may then be relevant under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended from time to time.
Section 7.01. Supplemental Indentures Without Consent of Holders
     Solely for purposes of the Debentures, Section 8.1 of the Indenture shall be deleted and replaced with the following (capitalized terms used in the following text that are not defined in the Indenture but are defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms herein):

     The Issuer further promises to pay interest on said principal sum from and including June 21, 2007, or from and including the most recent Interest Payment Date on which interest has been paid or duly provided for, until the principal thereof is paid or made available for payment semi-annually (subject to deferral as set forth herein) in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year, commencing on December 15, 2007 and ending on June 15, 2017, at the rate of 6.70% per annum (computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months), and thereafter to pay interest on said outstanding principal sum quarterly in arrears on March 15, June 15, September 15, and December 15 of each year, commencing on September 15, 2017 at a floating annual rate equal to Three-Month LIBOR (as defined in the First Supplemental Indenture) plus 2.0175% (computed on the basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of days elapsed in the 360-day year). Accrued interest that is not paid on the
 
applicable Interest Payment Date, including interest deferred pursuant to Section 2.05 of the First Supplemental Indenture, will bear Additional Interest, to the extent permitted by law, at the interest rate in effect from time to time provided in Section 2.04(a) of the First Supplemental Indenture, from the relevant Interest Payment Date, compounded on each subsequent Interest Payment Date.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
     We have acted as tax counsel to The Progressive Corporation, an Ohio corporation (the "Corporation"), in connection with the preparation and filing by the Corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") the Registration Statement (the "Registration Statement") on Form S-3 (File No. 333-143824), under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), as it became effective under the Act, and with respect to the issuance and sale of the Corporation's 6.70% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2067 (the "Debentures") to be issued pursuant to an indenture identical in all material respects to the form of Junior Subordinated Indenture (the "Junior Subordinated Indenture") between the Corporation and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the "Trustee") filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement, to be supplemented by a supplemental indenture identical in all material respects to the form of First Supplemental Indenture (the "First Supplemental Indenture" and, together with the Junior Subordinated Indenture, the "Indenture"), between the Corporation and the Trustee filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement. The Debentures will be offered for sale to investors pursuant to the Corporation's prospectus dated June 18, 2007 as supplemented by the prospectus supplement dated June 18, 2007 (the "Prospectus"), filed by the Corporation pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the rules and regulations of the Commission under the Act.
     In delivering this opinion letter, we have reviewed and relied upon: (i) the Prospectus; (ii) the Indenture; (iii) a form of the Debentures; (iv) the form of Replacement Capital Covenant filed on a Current Report on Form 8-K dated June 18, 2007 (the "Replacement Capital Covenant") to be entered into by the Corporation in favor of and for the benefit of each Covered Debtholder; and (v) the executed officer's certificate dated the date hereof; and have made such other investigations as we have deemed necessary or appropriate as a basis for the opinions set forth herein.

     In rendering the opinions described below, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the legal capacity of natural persons, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as forms, duplicates or certified or conformed copies, and the authenticity of the originals of such latter documents. We also have assumed that the transactions related to the issuance of the Debentures will be consummated in accordance with the terms of the documents and forms of documents described herein.
     Based on the foregoing and subject to the qualifications, assumptions and limitations stated herein and in the Prospectus herein and in the Prospectus, we are of the opinion that, (i) although the matter is not free from doubt, the Debentures when issued will be treated as debt for federal income tax purposes, and (ii) the statements made in the Prospectus under the caption, "Certain United States Federal Income and Estate Tax Consequences" insofar as they purport to constitute summaries of matters of United States federal tax law and regulations or legal conclusions with respect thereto, constitute accurate summaries of the matters described therein in all material respects.
     Our opinion is based upon the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended; Treasury Regulations (including temporary and proposed Treasury Regulations) issued thereunder; Internal Revenue Service rulings and pronouncements; and judicial decisions now in effect, all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. Our opinion is limited to the matters expressly stated herein. Our opinion is rendered only as of the date hereof, and its validity could be affected by subsequent changes in applicable law. We have not undertaken and will not undertake to advise you or any other person with respect to any such change subsequent to the date hereof, and we are under no obligation to supplement or revise our opinion to reflect any legal developments or factual matters arising subsequent to the date hereof or the impact of any information, document, certificate, record, statement, representation, covenant, or assumption relied upon herein that becomes incorrect or untrue. In the event that any one or more of the factual matters referred to herein is untrue, inaccurate, or incomplete, our opinion shall be void and of no force or effect, but only to the extent that such untruth, inaccuracy, or incompletion affects the accuracy of the opinion provided herein. Our opinion is provided solely as a legal opinion and not as a guaranty or warranty.
     We express no opinions with respect to the transactions referred to herein or in the Prospectus other than as expressly set forth herein. Moreover, we note that there is no authority directly on point dealing with securities such as the Debentures or transactions of the type described herein and that our opinions are not binding on the Internal Revenue Service or the courts, either of which could take a contrary position. Nevertheless, we believe that the opinions expressed herein, if challenged, would be sustained by a court with jurisdiction in a properly presented case.
     We do not express any opinion herein concerning any law other than the federal tax law of the United States.
