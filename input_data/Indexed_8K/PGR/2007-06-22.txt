Other Events.
     On June 21, 2007, The Progressive Corporation (the "Company"), completed a public offering of the Company's 6.70% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2067 in an aggregate principal amount of $1,000,000,000 (the "Debentures"). The terms of the Debentures are set forth in the Debentures and the Junior Subordinated Indenture dated as of June 21, 2007 (the "Junior Subordinated Indenture"), as supplemented and amended by the First Supplemental Indenture dated as of June 21, 2007 (the "First Supplemental Indenture"), each between the Company and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as trustee. Copies of the Junior Subordinated Indenture, the First Supplemental Indenture and the form of the Debentures are attached to this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibits 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3, respectively.
     The Debentures were issued pursuant to an underwriting agreement dated as of June 18, 2007 (the "Underwriting Agreement"), between the Company and Goldman, Sachs & Co., as the representative of the several underwriters named in Schedule I to the Underwriting Agreement. A copy of the Underwriting Agreement is attached as Exhibit 1.1 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K dated June 18, 2007 and filed on June 19, 2007. The Debentures were offered and sold by the Company pursuant to its registration statement on Form S-3 dated June 18, 2007 (File No. 333-143824).
     In connection with the completion of the offering of the Debentures, on June 21, 2007, the Company also entered into a replacement capital covenant (the "Replacement Capital Covenant"), a copy of which is attached to this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 4.4. Under the Replacement Capital Covenant, the Company agreed, for the benefit of holders of a series of the Company's long-term indebtedness that is senior in priority to the Debentures, as designated by the Company from time to time in accordance with the terms of the Replacement Capital Covenant, that the Company will not repay, redeem, defease or purchase, and that its subsidiaries will not purchase, all or any part of the Debentures before June 15, 2047, unless during a specified measurement period with respect to each such repayment, redemption, defeasance or purchase, the Company and its subsidiaries have issued specified amounts of certain replacement capital securities and otherwise complied with the terms and conditions of the Replacement Capital Covenant.
     The Company has identified its 6.25% Senior Notes due December 1, 2032 (CUSIP 743315 AL7) as the initial series of the Company's senior indebtedness to which the Replacement Capital Covenant will apply (referred to in the Replacement Capital Covenant as the "Initial Covered Debt"). Pursuant to the terms of the Replacement Capital Covenant, the Company will provide to the holder(s) of the Initial Covered Debt a written notice regarding the Replacement Capital Covenant. The form of such notice is attached to this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 4.5.

     (c) that all laws and requirements in respect of the execution and delivery by the Issuer of the Securities and Coupons, if any, have been complied with in all material respects; and
     (d) such other matters as the Trustee may reasonably request.
     The Trustee shall have the right to decline to authenticate and deliver any Securities and Coupons, if any, under this Section if the Trustee, being advised by counsel, determines that such action may not lawfully be taken by the Issuer or if the Trustee in good faith by its board of directors or board of trustees, executive committee, or a trust committee of directors, trustees or Responsible Officers shall determine that such action would expose the Trustee to personal liability to existing Holders.

The seal of the Issuer may be in the form of a facsimile thereof and may be impressed, affixed, imprinted or otherwise reproduced on the Securities. Typographical and other minor errors or defects in any such reproduction of the seal or any such signature shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any Security or Coupon that has been duly authenticated and delivered by the Trustee.
Execution of Securities
     In case any officer of the Issuer who shall have signed any of the Securities or Coupons shall cease to be such officer before the Security or Coupon so signed (or the Security to which the Coupon so signed appertains) shall be authenticated and delivered by the Trustee or disposed of by the Issuer, such Security or Coupon nevertheless may be authenticated and delivered or disposed of as though the person who signed such Security or Coupon had not ceased to be such officer of the Issuer; and any Security or Coupon may be signed on behalf of the Issuer by such persons as, at the actual date of the execution of such Security or Coupon, shall be the proper officers of the Issuer, although at the date of the execution and delivery of this Indenture any such person was not such an officer.
SECTION 2.6 . Only such Securities as shall bear thereon a certificate of authentication substantially in the form hereinbefore recited, executed by the Trustee by the manual signature of one of its authorized signatories, shall be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose. Such certificate by the
Certificate of Authentication
 
Trustee upon any Security executed by the Issuer shall be conclusive evidence that the Security so authenticated has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder and that the Holder is entitled to the benefits of this Indenture. No Coupon shall be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture or shall be valid or obligatory for any purpose until such certificate by the Trustee shall have become duly executed on the Security to which such Coupon appertains.
SECTION 2.7 . The Securities shall be issuable as Registered Securities or Unregistered Securities in such denominations as shall be specified as contemplated by Section 2.3. In the absence of any such specification with respect to the Registered Securities of any series, the Registered Securities of such series shall be issuable in dominations of U.S. $1,000 and any integral multiple thereof. In the absence of any such specification with respect to the Unregistered Securities, Unregistered Securities shall be issued in the denomination of U.S. $1,000. The Securities shall be numbered, lettered, or otherwise distinguished in such manner or in accordance with such plan as the officers of the Issuer executing the same may determine with the approval of the Trustee as evidenced by the execution and authentication thereof.
Denomination and Date of Securities; Payments of Interest
     Each Registered Security shall be dated the date of its authentication. Each Unregistered Security shall be dated as provided in the resolution or resolutions of the Board of Directors of the Issuer or the supplemental indenture referred to in Section 2.3. The Securities of each series shall bear interest, if any, from the date, and such interest shall be payable on the dates, established as contemplated by Section 2.3.
     The person in whose name any Registered Security on the Security Register maintained by the Issuer pursuant to Section 2.8 of any series is registered at the close of business on any record date applicable to a particular series with respect to any interest payment date for such series shall be entitled to receive the interest, if any, payable on such interest payment date notwithstanding any transfer or exchange of such Registered Security subsequent to the record date and prior to such interest payment date, except if and to the extent the Issuer shall default in the payment of the interest due on such interest payment date for such series, in which case such defaulted interest shall be paid to the persons in whose names Outstanding Registered Securities for such series are registered at the close of business on a subsequent record date (which shall be not less than five Business Days prior to the date of payment of such defaulted interest) established by notice given by mail by or on behalf of the Issuer to the holders of Registered Securities not less than 15 days preceding such subsequent record date. The term "record date" as used with respect to any interest payment date (except a date for payment of defaulted interest) shall mean the date specified as such in the terms of the Registered Securities of any particular series, or, if no such date is so specified, if such interest payment date is the first day of a calendar month, the fifteenth day of the next preceding calendar month or, if such interest payment date is the fifteenth day of a calendar month, the first day of such calendar month, whether or not such record date is a Business Day.
     Any defaulted interest payable in respect of any Unregistered Security shall be payable pursuant to such procedures as are satisfactory to the Trustee and in such manner so that there is no discrimination as between the holders of Registered Securities and Unregistered Securities of the same series and notice of the payment date therefor shall be given by the Trustee in the name and at the expense of the Issuer by publication at least once in an Authorized Newspaper. In
 
case an Unregistered Security is surrendered in exchange for a Registered Security after the close of business on any record date for the payment of defaulted interest and before the opening of business on the proposed date of payment of such defaulted interest, the Coupon appertaining to such surrendered Unregistered Security and due for payment on such proposed date of payment will not be surrendered with such surrendered Unregistered Security and interest payable on such proposed date of payment will be made only to the holder of such Coupon on such proposed date.
SECTION 2.8 . (a) The Issuer will keep or cause to be kept at each office or agency to be maintained for the purpose as provided in Section 3.2 a register or registers for each series of Registered Securities issued hereunder (collectively, the "Security Register") in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, it will register, and will register the transfer of, or cause the registration of transfer of, Registered Securities as in this Article provided. Such register shall be in written form in the English language or in any other form capable of being converted into such form within a reasonable time. At all reasonable times such register or registers shall be open for inspection by the Trustee.
Registration, Transfer and Exchange
     Upon due presentation for registration of transfer of any Registered Security of any series at any such office or agency to be maintained for the purpose as provided in Section 3.2, the Issuer shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in the name of the transferee or transferees a new Registered Security or Registered Securities of the same series in authorized denominations for a like aggregate principal amount.
     Unregistered securities (except for any temporary Unregistered Securities) and Coupons (except for Coupons attached to any temporary Unregistered Securities) shall be transferable by delivery.
     Any Registered Security or Registered Securities of any series may be exchanged for a Registered Security or Registered Securities of the same series in other authorized denominations, in an equal aggregate principal amount. Registered Securities of any series to be exchanged shall be surrendered at any office or agency maintained by the Issuer for the purpose as provided in Section 3.2, and the Issuer shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor the Registered Security or Registered Securities of the same series which the Securityholder making the exchange shall be entitled to receive, bearing numbers not contemporaneously outstanding.
     If the Securities of any series are issued in both registered and unregistered form, except as otherwise specified pursuant to Section 2.3, at the option of the Holder thereof, Unregistered Securities of any series may be exchanged for Registered Securities of such series, maturity date and interest rate, in any authorized denominations and in a like aggregate principal amount, upon surrender of such Unregistered Securities to be exchanged at the office or agency of the Issuer that shall be maintained for such purpose in accordance with Section 3.2, with, in the case of Unregistered Securities that have Coupons attached, all unmatured Coupons and all matured Coupons in default thereto appertaining, and upon payment, if the Issuer shall so require, of the charges hereinafter provided. At the option of the Holder thereof, if Unregistered Securities of any series, maturity date, interest rate and original issue date are issued in more than one
 
authorized denomination, except as otherwise specified pursuant to Section 2.3, such Unregistered Securities may be exchanged for Unregistered Securities of such series, maturity date, interest rate and original issue date, in other authorized denominations and in a like aggregate principal amount, upon surrender of such Unregistered Securities to be exchanged at the office or agency of the Issuer that shall be maintained for such purpose in accordance with Section 3.2 or as specified pursuant to Section 2.3, with, in the case of Unregistered Securities that have Coupons attached, all unmatured Coupons and all matured Coupons in default thereto appertaining, and upon payment, if the Issuer shall so require, of the charges hereinafter provided. Unless otherwise specified pursuant to Section 2.3, Registered Securities of any series may not be exchanged for Unregistered Securities of such series. Whenever any Securities, and the Coupons appertaining thereto, if any, are so surrendered for exchange, the Issuer shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the Securities, and the Coupons appertaining thereto, if any, which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Unregistered Security of any series is surrendered at any such office or agency in exchange for a Registered Security of the same series after the close of business at such office or agency on any record date and before the opening of business at such office or agency on the applicable interest payment date, such Unregistered Security shall be surrendered without the Coupon, if any, relating to such interest payment date. All Securities and Coupons surrendered upon any exchange or transfer provided for in this Indenture shall be promptly canceled and disposed of by the Trustee and the Trustee will deliver a certificate of disposition thereof to the Issuer.
     All Registered Securities presented for registration of transfer, exchange, redemption or payment shall (if so required by the Issuer or the Trustee) be duly endorsed by, or be accompanied by a written instrument or instruments of transfer in form satisfactory to the Issuer and the Trustee duly executed by, the Holder or his attorney duly authorized in writing.
     The Issuer may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any exchange or registration of transfer of Securities and shall not be required to exchange or register a transfer of any Securities until such payment is made. No service charge shall be made for any such transaction.
     The Issuer shall not be required to exchange or register a transfer of (a) any Securities of any series for a period of 15 days next preceding the first mailing of notice of redemption of Securities of such series to be redeemed, or (b) any Securities selected, called or being called for redemption except, in the case of any Security where public notice has been given that such Security is to be redeemed in part, the portion thereof not so to be redeemed and except that an Unregistered Security may be exchanged for a Registered Security of the same series being called for redemption.
     All Securities issued upon any transfer or exchange of Securities shall be valid obligations of the Issuer, evidencing the same debt, and entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture, as the Securities surrendered upon such transfer or exchange.
     Notwithstanding anything herein or in the terms of any series of Securities to the contrary, neither the Issuer nor the Trustee (which shall rely on an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel) shall be required to exchange any Unregistered Security for a Registered
 
Security if such exchange would result in adverse Federal income tax consequences to the Issuer (including, without limitation, the inability of the Issuer to deduct from its income, as computed for Federal income tax purposes, the interest payable on the Unregistered Securities) under then applicable United States Federal income tax laws.
     The provisions of clauses (1), (2), (3), (4) and (5) below shall apply only to Global Securities:
     (1) Each Global Security that is a Registered Security authenticated under this Indenture shall be registered in the name of the depositary designated for such Global Security or a nominee thereof and delivered to such depositary or a nominee thereof or custodian therefor, and each such Global Security shall constitute a single Security for all purposes of this Indenture.
     (2) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture or the Securities, no Global Security may be exchanged in whole or in part for Securities registered, and no transfer of a Global Security in whole or in part may be registered, in the name of any Person other than the depositary for such Global Security or a nominee thereof unless (A) such depositary (i) has notified the Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depositary for such Global Security and a successor Depositary has not been appointed by the Issuer within 90 days of receipt by the Issuer of such notification or (ii) has ceased to be a clearing agency registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and a successor Depositary has not been appointed by the Issuer within 90 days after the Issuer became aware of such cessation or (B) there shall have occurred and be continuing an Event of Default with respect to such Global Security.
     (3) Subject to clause (2) above, any exchange of a Global Security for other Securities may be made in whole or in part, and all Securities issued in exchange for a Global Security or any portion thereof shall be registered in such names as the Depositary for such Global Security shall direct.
     (4) Every Security authenticated and delivered upon registration of transfer of, or in exchange for or in lieu of, a Global Security or any portion thereof shall be authenticated and delivered in the form of, and shall be, a Global Security, unless such Security is registered in the name of a Person other than the depositary for such Global Security or a nominee thereof.
     (5) None of the Issuer, the Trustee nor any agent of the Issuer or the Trustee will have any responsibility or liability for the accuracy or completeness of the records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests of a Global Security, for any act or omissions of a depositary or transactions between the depositary and beneficial owners, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interests.
     (b) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Indenture or the Securities, transfers of a Global Security, in whole or in part, exchanges of interests in Global Securities or of other Securities as described in the following two paragraphs below shall be made only in
 
accordance with this Section 2.8. Transfers and exchanges subject to this Section 2.8 shall also be subject to the other provisions of this Indenture that are not inconsistent with this Section 2.8.
     (1) Except as provided in Section 2.8(a), a Global Security may not be transferred, in whole or in part, to any Person other than the depositary or a nominee thereof, and no such transfer to any such other Person may be registered; that this clause (1) shall not prohibit any transfer of a Security that is issued in exchange for a Global Security but is not itself a Global Security. No transfer of a Security to any Person shall be effective under this Indenture or the Securities unless and until such Security has been registered in the name of such Person. Nothing in this clause (1) shall prohibit or render ineffective any transfer of a beneficial interest in a Global Security effected in accordance with the other provisions of this Section 2.8(b).
provided
     (2) Securities other than Global Securities may be exchanged (on transfer or otherwise) for Securities that are not Global Securities or for beneficial interests in a Global Security (if any is then Outstanding) only in accordance with such procedures, as may be from time to time adopted by the Issuer and the Trustee and as are consistent with the depositary's applicable procedures.
SECTION 2.9 . In case any temporary or definitive Security or any Coupon appertaining to any Security shall become mutilated, defaced or be destroyed, lost or stolen, the Issuer in its discretion may execute, and upon the written request of any officer of the Issuer, the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, a new Security of the same series, bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding, in exchange and substitution for the mutilated or defaced Security, or in lieu of and substitution for the Security so destroyed, lost or stolen, with Coupons corresponding to the Coupons appertaining to the Security so mutilated, defaced, destroyed, lost or stolen, or in exchange or substitution for the Security to which such mutilated, defaced, destroyed, lost or stolen Coupons appertained, with Coupons appertaining thereto corresponding to the Coupons so mutilated, defaced, destroyed, lost or stolen. In every case, the applicant for a substitute Security or Coupon shall furnish to the Issuer and to the Trustee and any agent of the Issuer or the Trustee such security or indemnity as may be required by the Issuer, Trustee and said agent to indemnify and defend and to save each of them harmless and, in every case of destruction, loss or theft, evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of such Security and of the ownership thereof.
Mutilated, Defaced, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen Securities
     Upon the issuance of any substitute Security or Coupon, the Issuer may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) and the cost of any indemnity bond connected therewith. In case any Security or Coupon which has matured or is about to mature or has been called for redemption in full shall become mutilated or defaced or be destroyed, lost or stolen, the Issuer may, at its sole discretion, instead of issuing a substitute Security or Coupon, pay or authorize the payment of the same (without surrender thereof except in the case of a mutilated or defaced Security or Coupon), if the applicant for such payment shall furnish to the Issuer and to the Trustee and any agent of the Issuer or the Trustee such security or indemnity as any of them may require to save each of them harmless, and, in every case of destruction, loss or theft, the applicant shall also furnish to the Issuer and the
 
Trustee and any agent of the Issuer or the Trustee evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of such Security or Coupon and of the ownership thereof.
     Every substitute Security or Coupon of any series issued pursuant to the provisions of this Section by virtue of the fact that any such Security or Coupon is destroyed, lost or stolen shall constitute an additional contractual obligation of the Issuer, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Security or Coupon shall be enforceable at any time by anyone and shall be entitled to all the benefits of (but shall be subject to all the limitations of rights set forth in) this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Securities or Coupons of such series duly authenticated and delivered hereunder. All Securities or Coupons shall be held and owned upon the express condition that, to the extent permitted by law, the foregoing provisions are exclusive with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, defaced or destroyed, lost or stolen Securities or Coupons and shall preclude any and all other rights or remedies notwithstanding any law or statute existing or hereafter enacted to the contrary with respect to the replacement or payment of negotiable instruments or other securities without their surrender.
SECTION 2.10 . All Securities and Coupons surrendered for payment, redemption, registration of transfer or exchange, or for credit against any payment in respect of a sinking or analogous fund, if surrendered to the Issuer or any agent of the Issuer or the Trustee, shall be delivered to the Trustee for cancellation or, if surrendered to the Trustee, shall be canceled by it; and no Securities or Coupons shall be issued in lieu thereof except as expressly permitted by any of the provisions of this Indenture. The Trustee shall destroy cancelled Securities and Coupons held by it and deliver a certificate of destruction to the Issuer or shall otherwise comply with its document retention policy and applicable law. If the Issuer shall acquire any of the Securities or Coupons, such acquisition shall not operate as a redemption or satisfaction of the indebtedness represented by such Securities or Coupons unless and until the same are delivered to the Trustee for cancellation.
Cancellation of Securities; Destruction Thereof
SECTION 2.11 . Pending the preparation of definitive Securities for any series, the Issuer may execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver temporary Securities for such series (printed, lithographed, typewritten or otherwise reproduced, in each case in form satisfactory to the Trustee). Temporary Securities of any series shall be issuable as Registered Securities without Coupons, or as Unregistered Securities with or without Coupons attached thereto, of any authorized denomination, and substantially in the form of the definitive Securities of such series, but with such omissions, insertions and variations as may be appropriate for temporary Securities, all as may be determined by the Issuer with the concurrence of the Trustee. Temporary Securities may contain such reference to any provisions of this Indenture as may be appropriate. Every temporary Security shall be executed by the Issuer and be authenticated by the Trustee upon the same conditions and in substantially the same manner, and with like effect, as the definitive Securities. Without unreasonable delay, the Issuer shall execute and shall furnish definitive Securities of such series and thereupon temporary Securities of such series may be surrendered in exchange therefor without charge at each office or agency to be maintained by the Issuer for that purpose pursuant to Section 3.2, and in the case of Unregistered Securities, together with any unmatured Coupons and any matured Coupons in default appertaining thereto, at any office or agency maintained by the Issuer for such purpose as specified pursuant to Section 3.2, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange for such temporary Securities of such series a like aggregate principal amount of
Temporary Securities
 
definitive Securities of the same series in authorized denominations. Until so exchanged, the temporary Securities and any unmatured Coupons appertaining thereto of any series shall be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Securities and any unmatured Coupons appertaining thereto of such series. The provisions of this Section are subject to any restrictions or limitations on the issue and delivery of temporary Unregistered Securities of any series that may be established pursuant to Section 2.3 (including any provision that Unregistered Securities of such series initially be issued in the form of a single global Unregistered Security to be delivered to a depositary or agency of the Issuer located inside or outside the United States and the procedures pursuant to which definitive Unregistered Securities of such series would be issued in exchange for such temporary global Unregistered Security).
SECTION 2.12 . Securities may be issued in the form of one or more Global Securities to be held by a securities depositary. If the Issuer determines at any time that Securities of a series shall no longer be represented by Global Security certificates, the Issuer shall inform the depositary of such determination. If participants of the depositary elect to withdraw their beneficial interests, the Issuer shall issue certificates in definitive form in exchange for such beneficial interests in the Global Security certificates. Any Global Security, or portion thereof, shall be exchangeable for Security certificates registered in the names directed by the depositary, as set forth more fully in Section 2.8. Global Securities shall bear customary legends stating that such Securities are Global Securities.
Global Securities
     As long as the depositary or its nominee is the registered owner of a Global Security certificate, the depositary or its nominee, as the case may be, shall be considered the sole holder of the Global Security certificates and all Securities represented by such certificates for all purposes under this Indenture.
SECTION 3.1 . The Issuer covenants and agrees for the benefit of each series of Securities that it will duly and punctually pay or cause to be paid the principal of, and interest on, each of the Securities of such series at the place or places, at the respective times and in the manner provided in such Securities. Except as specified in Section 2.3, the interest on Securities with Coupons attached (together with any additional amounts payable pursuant to the terms of such Securities) shall be payable only upon presentation and surrender of the several Coupons for such interest installments as are evidenced thereby as they severally mature. Except as specified in Section 2.3, the interest on any temporary Unregistered Securities (together with any additional amounts payable pursuant to the terms of such Securities) shall be paid, as to the installments of interest evidenced by Coupons attached thereto, if any, only upon presentation and surrender thereof, and, as to the other installments of interest, if any, only upon presentation of such Securities for notation thereon of the payment of such interest. Each installment of interest on the Registered Securities of any series may be paid by mailing checks for such interest payable to or upon the written order of the holders of Registered Securities entitled thereto as they shall appear on the registry books of the Issuer.
Payment of Principal and Interest
 
SECTION 3.2 So long as any of the Securities remain outstanding, the Issuer will maintain the following for each series: an office or agency (a) where the Registered Securities may be presented for payment, (b) where the Registered Securities may be presented for registration of transfer and for exchange as in this Indenture provided and (c) where notices and demands to or upon the Issuer in respect of the Registered Securities or of this Indenture may be served.
Offices for Payments, Etc.
     The Issuer will give to the Trustee written notice of the location of any such office or agency and of any change of location thereof. With respect to each series of Securities and Coupons whose terms are established pursuant to Section 2.3, the Issuer hereby designates the Corporate Trust Office as the initial office to be maintained by it for each such purpose. In case the Issuer shall fail to so designate or maintain any such office or agency or shall fail to give such notice of the location or of any change in the location thereof, presentations and demands may be made and notices may be served at the Corporate Trust Office.
SECTION 3.3 . The Issuer, whenever necessary to avoid or fill a vacancy in the office of Trustee, will appoint, in the manner provided in Section 6.10, a Trustee, so that there shall at all times be a Trustee with respect to each series of Securities hereunder.
Appointment to Fill a Vacancy in Office of Trustee
SECTION 3.4 . Whenever the Issuer shall appoint a paying agent other than the Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series, it will cause such paying agent to execute and deliver to the Trustee an instrument in which such agent shall agree with the Trustee, subject to the provisions of this Section,
Paying Agents
     (a) that it will hold all sums received by it as such agent for (i) the payment of the principal of or interest on the Securities of such series (whether such sums have been paid to it by the Issuer or by any other obligor on the Securities of such series) in trust for the benefit of the holders of the Securities of such series or the Coupons appertaining thereto or (ii) the payment of any sums due the Trustee hereunder, and
     (b) that it will give the Trustee notice of any failure by the Issuer (or by any other obligor on the Securities of such series) to make any payment of the principal of or interest on the Securities of such series when the same shall be due and payable.
     The Issuer will, on or prior to each due date of the principal of or interest on the Securities of such series, deposit with the paying agent a sum sufficient to pay such principal or interest so becoming due, and (unless such paying agent is the Trustee) the Issuer will promptly notify the Trustee of any failure to take such action.
     If the Issuer shall act as its own paying agent with respect to the Securities or the Coupons appertaining thereto of any series, it will, on or before each due date of the principal of or interest on the Securities or the Coupons appertaining thereto of such series, set aside, segregate and hold in trust for the benefit of the holders of the Securities or the Coupons appertaining thereto of such series a sum sufficient to pay such principal or interest so becoming due. The Issuer will promptly notify the Trustee of any failure to take such action.
 
     Anything in this Section to the contrary notwithstanding, the Issuer may at any time, for the purpose of obtaining a satisfaction and discharge with respect to one or more or all series of Securities hereunder, or for any other reason, pay or cause to be paid to the Trustee all sums held in trust for any such series by the Issuer or any paying agent hereunder, as required by this Section, such sums to be held by the Trustee upon the trusts herein contained.
     Anything in this Section to the contrary notwithstanding, the agreement to hold sums in trust as provided in this Section is subject to the provisions of Sections 10.3 and 10.4.
SECTION 3.5 . The Issuer will deliver to the Trustee on or before April 30 in each year (beginning with April 30, 2008) a brief certificate (which need not comply with Section 11.5) from the principal executive officer, principal financial officer or principal accounting officer as to his or her knowledge of the Issuer's compliance with all conditions and covenants under this Indenture (such compliance to be determined without respect to any period of grace or requirement of notice provided under the Indenture).

     (b) at such other times as the Trustee may request in writing, within 30 days after receipt by the Issuer of any such request as of a date not more than 15 days prior to the time such information is furnished, that if and so long as the Trustee shall be the Security registrar for such series and all of the Securities of such series are Registered Securities, such list shall not be required to be furnished. The Trustee, at the request of the Issuer, shall provide such list to the Issuer for so long as the Trustee shall be the Security registrar.

SECTION 4.2 .
Preservation and Disclosure of Securityholders' Lists
     (a) The Trustee shall preserve, in as current a form as is reasonably practicable, all information as to the names and addresses of the holders of each series of Securities (i) contained in the most recent list furnished to it as provided in Section 4.1 and (ii) received or maintained by
 
it in the capacity of Security registrar for such series, if so acting. The Trustee may destroy any list furnished to it as provided in Section 4.1 upon receipt of a new list so furnished.
     (b) In case three or more holders of Securities (hereinafter referred to as "applicants") apply in writing to the Trustee and furnish to the Trustee reasonable proof that each such applicant has owned a Security for a period of at least six months preceding the date of such application, and such application states that the applicants desire to communicate with other holders of Securities of a particular series (in which case the applicants must all hold Securities of such series) or with holders of all Securities with respect to their rights under this Indenture or under such Securities and such application is accompanied by a copy of the form of proxy or other communication which such applicants propose to transmit, then the Trustee shall, within five Business Days after the receipt of such application provide the Issuer with notice of such request and, at its election, either
     (i) afford to such applicants access to the information preserved at the time by the Trustee in accordance with the provisions of subsection (a) of this Section, or

     If the Trustee shall elect not to afford to such applicants access to such information, the Trustee, upon the written request of such applicants, shall mail to each Securityholder of such series or all Securities, as the case may be, whose name and address appears in the information preserved at the time by the Trustee in accordance with the provisions of subsection (a) of this Section a copy of the form of proxy or other communication which is specified in such request, with reasonable promptness after a tender to the Trustee of the material to be mailed and of payment, or provision for the payment, of the reasonable expenses of mailing, unless within five days after such tender, the Trustee shall mail to such applicants and file with the Commission, together with a copy of the material to be mailed, a written statement to the effect that, in the opinion of the Trustee, such mailing would be contrary to the best interests of the holders of Securities of such series or all Securities, as the case may be, or would be in violation of applicable law. Such written statement shall specify the basis of such opinion. If the Commission, after opportunity for a hearing upon the objections specified in the written statement so filed, shall enter an order refusing to sustain any of such objections or if, after the entry of an order sustaining one or more of such objections, the Commission shall find, after notice and opportunity for hearing, that all the objections so sustained have been met, and shall enter an order so declaring, the Trustee shall mail copies of such material to all such Securityholders with reasonable promptness after the entry of such order and the renewal of such tender; otherwise the Trustee shall be relieved of any obligation or duty to such applicants respecting their application.
     (c) Each and every holder of Securities and Coupons, by receiving and holding the same, agrees with the Issuer and the Trustee that neither the Issuer nor the Trustee nor any agent
 
of the Issuer or the Trustee shall be held accountable by reason of the disclosure of any such information as to the names and addresses of the holders of Securities in accordance with the provisions of subsection (b) of this Section, regardless of the source from which such information was derived, and that the Trustee shall not be held accountable by reason of mailing any material pursuant to a request made under such subsection (b).

     The foregoing provisions, however, are subject to the condition that if, at any time after the principal (or, if the Securities are Original Issue Discount Securities, such portion of the principal as may be specified in the terms thereof) of the Securities of any series (or of all the Securities, as the case may be) shall have been so declared due and payable, and before any judgment or decree for the payment of the moneys due shall have been obtained or entered as hereinafter provided, the Issuer shall pay or shall deposit with the Trustee a sum sufficient to pay all matured installments of interest upon all the Securities of such series (or of all the Securities, as the case may be) and the principal of any and all Securities of such series (or of all the Securities, as the case may be) which shall have become due otherwise than by acceleration (with interest upon such principal and, to the extent that payment of such interest is enforceable under applicable law, on overdue installments of interest, at the same rate as the rate of interest or Yield to Maturity (in the case of Original Issue Discount Securities) specified in the Securities of such series (or at the respective rates of interest or Yields to Maturity of all the Securities, as the case may be, to the date of such payment or deposit)) and such amount as shall be sufficient to cover reasonable compensation to the Trustee, its agents, attorneys and counsel, and all other expenses and liabilities incurred, and all advances made, by the Trustee except as a result of negligence or bad faith, and all other amounts due to the Trustee or any predecessor Trustee pursuant to Section 6.6, and if any and all Events of Default under the Indenture, other than the nonpayment of the principal of Securities which shall have become due by acceleration, shall have been cured, waived or otherwise remedied as provided herein  then and in every such case the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of all the Securities of such series, each series voting as a separate class (or of all the Securities, as the case may be, voting as a single class), then Outstanding, by written notice to the Issuer and to the Trustee, may waive all defaults with respect to such series (or with respect to all the Securities, as the case may be) and rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences, but no such waiver or rescission and annulment shall extend to or shall affect any subsequent default or shall impair any right consequent thereon.
     For all purposes under this Indenture, if a portion of the principal of any Original Issue Discount Securities shall have been accelerated and declared due and payable pursuant to the provisions hereof, then, from and after such declaration, unless such declaration has been rescinded and annulled, the principal amount of such Original Issue Discount Securities shall be deemed, for all purposes hereunder, to be such portion of the principal thereof as shall be due and payable as a result of such acceleration, and payment of such portion of the principal thereof as shall be due and payable as a result of such acceleration, together with interest, if any, thereon and all other amounts then owing thereunder, shall constitute payment in full of such Original Issue Discount Securities.
SECTION 5.2 . The Issuer covenants that (a) in case default shall be made in the payment of any installment of

the Securities of any series, and to file such other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee (including any claim for agreed upon compensation to the Trustee and each predecessor Trustee, and their respective agents, attorneys and counsel, and for reimbursement of all reasonable expenses and liabilities incurred, and all advances made, by the Trustee and each predecessor Trustee, except as a result of negligence or bad faith, and all other amounts due to the Trustee or any predecessor Trustee pursuant to Section 6.6) and of the Securityholders allowed in any judicial proceedings relative to the Issuer or other obligor upon the Securities of any series, or to the property of the Issuer or such other obligor,

(a) The Trustee, or any trustee or trustees hereafter appointed, at any time may resign with respect to one or more or all series of Securities by giving written notice of resignation to the Issuer. Upon receiving such notice of resignation, the Issuer shall promptly appoint a successor trustee or trustees with respect to the applicable series by written instrument in duplicate, executed by authority of the Board of Directors, one copy of which instrument shall be delivered to the resigning Trustee and one copy to the successor trustee or trustees. If no successor trustee shall have been so appointed with respect to any series and have accepted appointment within 30 days after the mailing of such notice of resignation, the resigning trustee may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor trustee, or any Securityholder who has been a bona fide holder of a Security or Securities of the applicable series for at least six months may, subject to the provisions of Section 5.12, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, petition any such court for the appointment of a successor trustee. Such court thereupon, after such notice, if any, as it may deem proper and prescribe, may appoint a successor trustee.
(b) In case at any time any of the following shall occur:
(i) the Trustee shall fail to comply with the provisions of Section 310(b) of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 with respect to any series of Securities after written request therefor by the Issuer or by any Securityholder who has been a bona fide holder of a Security or Securities of such series for at least six months; or (ii) the Trustee shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of Section 6.8 and shall fail to resign after written request therefor by the Issuer or by any Securityholder; or (iii) the Trustee shall become incapable of acting with respect to any series of Securities, or shall be adjudged a bankrupt or insolvent, or a receiver or liquidator of the Trustee or of its property shall be appointed, or any public officer shall take charge or control of the Trustee or of its property or affairs for the purpose of rehabilitation, conservation or liquidation; then, in any such case, the Issuer may remove the Trustee with respect to the applicable series of Securities and appoint a successor trustee for such series by written instrument, in duplicate, executed by order of the Board of Directors of the Issuer, one copy of which instrument shall be delivered to the Trustee so removed and one copy to the successor trustee, or, subject to the provisions of Section 7.1, any Securityholder who has been a bona fide holder of a Security or Securities of such series for at least six months, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee and the appointment of a successor trustee with respect to such series. Such court may thereupon, after such notice, if any, as it may deem proper and prescribe, remove the Trustee and appoint a successor trustee.
 
(c) The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding at any time may remove the Trustee with respect to securities of such series and appoint a successor trustee with respect to the Securities of such series by delivering to the Trustee so removed, to the successor trustee so appointed and to the Issuer the evidence provided for in Section 7.1 of the action in that regard taken by the Securityholders.
(d) Any resignation or removal of the Trustee with respect to any series and any appointment of a successor trustee with respect to such series pursuant to any of the provisions of this Section 6.9 shall become effective upon acceptance of appointment by the successor trustee as provided in Section 6.10.
SECTION 6.10 . Any successor trustee appointed as provided in Section 6.9 shall execute and deliver to the Issuer and to its predecessor trustee an instrument accepting such appointment hereunder, and thereupon the resignation or removal of the predecessor trustee with respect to all or any applicable series shall become effective and such successor trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all rights, powers, duties and obligations with respect to such series of its predecessor hereunder, with like effect as if originally named as trustee for such series hereunder; but, nevertheless, on the written request of the Issuer or of the successor trustee, upon payment of its charges then unpaid, the trustee ceasing to act, subject to Section 10.4, shall pay over to the successor trustee all moneys at the time held by it hereunder and shall execute and deliver an instrument transferring to such successor trustee all such rights, powers, duties and obligations. Upon request of any such successor trustee, the Issuer shall execute any and all instruments in writing for more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to such successor trustee all such rights and powers. Any trustee ceasing to act, nevertheless, shall retain a prior claim upon all property or funds held or collected by such trustee to secure any amounts then due it pursuant to the provisions of Section 6.6.
Acceptance of Appointment by Successor Trustee
If a successor trustee is appointed with respect to the Securities of one or more (but not all) series, the Issuer, the predecessor trustee and each successor trustee with respect to the Securities of any applicable series shall execute and deliver an indenture supplemental hereto which shall contain such provisions as shall be deemed necessary or desirable to confirm that all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the predecessor trustee with respect to the Securities of any series as to which the predecessor trustee is not retiring shall continue to be vested in the predecessor trustee, and shall add to or change any of the provisions of this Indenture as shall be necessary to provide for or facilitate the administration of the trusts hereunder by more than one trustee, it being understood that nothing herein or in such supplemental indenture shall constitute such trustees as co-trustees of the same trust and that each such trustee shall be deemed to be trustee of a trust or trusts under separate indentures.
No successor trustee with respect to any series of Securities shall accept appointment as provided in this Section 6.10 unless at the time of such acceptance such successor trustee shall be qualified under Section 310(b) of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 and eligible under the provisions of Section 6.8.
Upon acceptance of appointment by any successor trustee as provided in this Section 6.10, the Issuer shall mail notice thereof to the holders of Securities of each series affected, by first-class
 
mail to such holders of Securities of any series for which such successor trustee is acting as trustee at their last addresses as they shall appear in the Security register. If the Issuer fails to mail such notice within ten days after acceptance of appointment by the successor trustee, the successor trustee shall cause such notice to be mailed at the expense of the Issuer.
SECTION 6.11 . Any corporation into which the Trustee may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which the Trustee shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to the corporate trust business of the Trustee, shall be the successor of the Trustee hereunder, without the execution or filing of any paper; the giving of any notice or any further act on the part of any of the parties hereto, anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, that such corporation shall be qualified under Section 310(b) of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 and eligible under the provisions of Section 6.8.
Merger, Conversion, Consolidation or Succession to Business of Trustee
provided,
In case at the time such successor to the Trustee shall succeed to the trusts created by this Indenture any of the Securities of any series shall have been authenticated but not delivered, any such successor to the Trustee may adopt the certificate of authentication of any predecessor trustee and deliver such Securities so authenticated; and, in case at that time any of the Securities of any series shall not have been authenticated, any successor to the Trustee may authenticate such Securities either in the name of any predecessor hereunder or in the name of the successor trustee; and in all such cases such certificate shall have the full force that the Securities of such series or this Indenture have granted to such certificate; , that the right to adopt the certificate of authentication of any predecessor trustee or to authenticate Securities of any series in the name of any predecessor trustee shall apply only to its successor or successors by merger, conversion or consolidation.
provided
SECTION 6.12 . The Trustee shall comply with Section 311(a) of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, excluding any creditor relationship listed in Section 311(b) of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939.
Preferential Collection of Claims Against the Issuer
Any Trustee who has resigned or been removed shall be subject to Section 311(a) of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 to the extent indicated therein.
SECTION 7.1 . Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action provided by this Indenture to be given or taken by a specified percentage in principal amount of the Securityholders of any or all series may be embodied in and evidenced by one or more instruments of substantially similar tenor signed by such specified percentage of Securityholders in person or by agent duly appointed in writing; and, except as herein otherwise expressly provided, such action shall become effective when such instrument or instruments are delivered to the Trustee. Proof of
Evidence of Action Taken by Securityholders
 
execution of any instrument or of a writing appointing any such agent shall be sufficient for any purpose of this Indenture and (subject to Sections 6.1 and 6.2) conclusive in favor of the Trustee and the Issuer, if made in the manner provided in this Article.
SECTION 7.2 . Subject to Sections 6.1 and 6.2, the execution of any instrument by a Securityholder or his agent or proxy may be proved in the following manner:
Proof of Execution of Instruments and of Holding of Securities
The fact and date of the execution by any Holder of any instrument may be proved by the certificate of any notary public or other officer of any jurisdiction authorized to take acknowledgments of deeds or administer oaths that the person executing such instruments acknowledged to him the execution thereof, or by an affidavit of a witness to such execution sworn to before any such notary or other such officer. Where such execution is by or on behalf of any legal entity other than an individual, such certificate or affidavit shall also constitute sufficient proof of the authority of the person executing the same. The fact of the holding by any holder of an Unregistered Security of any series, and the identifying number of such Security and the date of his holding the same, may be proved by the production of such Security or by a certificate executed by any trust company, bank, banker or recognized securities dealer wherever situated satisfactory to the Trustee, if such certificate shall be deemed by the Trustee to be satisfactory. Each such certificate shall be dated and shall state that on the date thereof a Security of such series bearing a specified identifying number was deposited with or exhibited to such trust company, bank, banker or recognized securities dealer by the person named in such certificate. Any such certificate may be issued in respect of one or more Unregistered Securities of one or more series specified therein. The holding by the person named in any such certificate of any Unregistered Securities of any series specified therein shall be presumed to continue for a period of one year from the date of such certificate unless at the time of any determination of such holding (1) another certificate bearing a later date issued in respect of the same Securities shall be produced, or (2) the Security of such series specified in such certificate shall be produced by some other person, or (3) the Security of such series specified in such certificate shall have ceased to be Outstanding. Subject to Sections 6.1 and 6.2, the fact and date of the execution of any such instrument and the amount and numbers of Securities of any series held by the person so executing such instrument and the amount and numbers of any Security or Securities for such series may also be proven in accordance with such reasonable rules and regulations as may be prescribed by the Trustee for such series or in any other manner which the Trustee for such series may deem sufficient.
SECTION 7.3 . The Issuer, the Trustee and any agent of the Issuer or the Trustee may deem and treat the person in whose name any Security shall be registered upon the Security register for such series as the absolute owner of such Security (whether or not such Security shall be overdue and notwithstanding any notation of ownership or other writing thereon) for the purpose of receiving payment of or on account of the principal of and, subject to the provisions of this Indenture, interest on such Security and for all other purposes; and neither the Issuer nor the Trustee nor any agent of the Issuer or the Trustee shall be affected by any notice to the contrary. The Issuer, the Trustee and any agent of the Issuer or the Trustee may treat the holder of any Unregistered Security and the holder of any Coupon as the absolute owner of such Unregistered Security or Coupon (whether or not such
Holders to Be Treated as Owners
 
Unregistered Security or Coupon shall be overdue) for the purpose of receiving payment thereof or on account thereof and for all other purposes and neither the Issuer, the Trustee, nor any agent of the Issuer or the Trustee shall be affected by any notice to the contrary. All such payments so made to any such person, or upon his order, shall be valid, and, to the extent of the sum or sums so paid, effectual to satisfy and discharge the liability for moneys payable upon any such Security or Coupon.
SECTION 7.4 . In determining whether the Holders of the requisite aggregate principal amount of Outstanding Securities of any or all series have concurred in any direction, consent or waiver under this Indenture, Securities which are owned by the Issuer or any other obligor on the Securities with respect to which such determination is being made or by any person directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with the Issuer or any other obligor on the Securities with respect to which such determination is being made shall be disregarded and deemed not to be Outstanding for the purpose of any such determination, except that for the purpose of determining whether the Trustee shall be protected in relying on any such direction, consent or waiver only Securities which the Trustee knows are so owned shall be so disregarded. Securities so owned which have been pledged in good faith may be regarded as Outstanding if the pledgee establishes to the satisfaction of the Trustee the pledgee's right so to act with respect to such Securities and that the pledgee is not the Issuer or any other obligor upon the Securities or any person directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with the Issuer or any other obligor on the Securities. In case of a dispute as to such right, the advice of counsel shall be full protection in respect of any decision made by the Trustee in accordance with such advice. Upon request of the Trustee, the Issuer shall furnish to the Trustee promptly a written statement by two of its officers (which need not comply with Section 11.5) listing and identifying all Securities, if any, known by the Issuer to be owned or held by or for the account of any of the above-described persons; and, subject to Sections 6.1 and 6.2, the Trustee shall be entitled to accept such Officers' Certificate as conclusive evidence of the facts therein set forth and of the fact that all Securities not listed therein are Outstanding for the purpose of any such determination.
Securities Owned by Issuer Deemed Not Outstanding
SECTION 7.5 . At any time prior to (but not after) the evidencing to the Trustee, as provided in Section 7.1, of the taking of any action by the Holders of the percentage in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of any or all series, as the case may be, specified in this Indenture in connection with such action, any holder of a Security the serial number of which is shown by the evidence to be included among the serial numbers of the Securities the Holders of which have consented to such action may, by filing written notice at the Corporate Trust Office and upon proof of holding as provided in this Article, revoke such action so far as concerns such Security. Except as aforesaid, any such action taken by the holder of any Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders and owners of such Security and of any Securities issued in exchange or substitution therefor, irrespective of whether or not any notation in regard thereto is made upon any such Security. Any action taken by the Holders of the percentage in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of any or all series, as the case may be, specified in this Indenture in connection with such action shall be conclusively binding upon the Issuer, the Trustee and the holders of all the Securities affected by such action.
Right of Revocation of Action Taken
 
SECTION 8.1 . The Issuer, when authorized by a resolution of its Board of Directors, and the Trustee may from time to time and at any time enter into an indenture or indentures supplemental hereto (which shall conform to the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 as in force at the date of the execution thereof) for one or more of the following purposes:

(c) to add to the covenants of the Issuer such further covenants, restrictions, conditions or provisions as its Board of Directors and the Trustee shall consider to be for the protection of the holders of Securities or Coupons, and, if the Issuer and Trustee so agree and provide in the supplemental indenture, to make the occurrence, or the occurrence and continuance, of a default in any such additional covenants, restrictions, conditions or provisions an Event of Default permitting the enforcement of all or any of the several remedies provided in this Indenture as herein set forth; that in respect of any such additional covenant, restriction, condition or provision such supplemental indenture may provide for a particular period of grace after default (which period may be shorter or longer than that allowed in the case of other defaults) or may provide for an immediate enforcement upon such an Event of Default or may limit the remedies available to the Trustee upon such an Event of Default or may limit the right of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series to waive such an Event of Default;
provided,
(d) to cure any ambiguity or to correct or supplement any provision contained herein or in any supplemental indenture which may be defective or inconsistent with any other provision contained herein or in any supplemental indenture; or to make such other provisions in regard to matters or questions arising under this Indenture or under any supplemental indenture as the Board of Directors may deem necessary or desirable and which shall not adversely affect the interests of the holders of the Securities;
(e) to provide for the issuance of Securities of any series and related Coupons, if any, as permitted by Sections 2.1 and 2.3 hereof and to establish the form and term thereof;
(f) to evidence and provide for the acceptance of appointment hereunder by a successor trustee with respect to the Securities of one or more series, or of the Coupons appertaining to such Securities, and to add to or change any of the provisions of this Indenture as shall be necessary to provide for or facilitate the administration of the trusts hereunder by more than one trustee, pursuant to the requirements of Section 6.10; and
 
(g) to modify, eliminate or add to the provisions of this Indenture to such extent as shall be necessary to effect and maintain the qualification of this Indenture under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, or under any similar Federal statute hereafter enacted, and to add to this Indenture such other provisions and make such other changes to this Indenture as may be expressly permitted by the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, or under any similar Federal statute hereafter enacted, excluding however, the provisions referred to in section 316(a)(2) of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 or any corresponding provisions in any similar Federal statute hereafter enacted.
The Trustee is hereby authorized to join with the Issuer in the execution of any such supplemental indenture, to make any further appropriate agreements and stipulations which may be therein contained and to accept the conveyance, transfer, assignment, mortgage or pledge of any property thereunder, but the Trustee shall not be obligated to enter into any such supplemental indenture which affects the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under this Indenture or otherwise.
     Any supplemental indenture authorized by the provisions of this Section may be executed without the consent of the holders of any of the Securities at the time Outstanding, notwithstanding any of the provisions of Section 8.2.
SECTION 8.2 . With the consent (evidenced as provided in Article Seven) of the Holders of not less than 66-2/3% in aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of all series affected by such supplemental indenture (voting as one class), the Issuer, when authorized by a resolution of its Board of Directors, and the Trustee, from time to time and at any time, may enter into an indenture or indentures supplemental hereto (which shall conform to the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 as in force at the date of execution thereof) for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of this Indenture or of any supplemental indenture or of modifying in any manner the rights of the holders of the Securities of each such series or the coupons appertaining to such Securities; that no such supplemental indenture shall (a) extend the final maturity of any Security, or reduce the principal amount thereof or the method in which amounts of payments of principal or interest thereon are determined, or reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of interest thereon, or change the coin or currency or units based on or related to currencies of payment thereof, or reduce any amount payable on redemption thereof or reduce the amount of the principal of an Original Issue Discount Security that would be due and payable upon an acceleration of the maturity thereof pursuant to Section 5.1 or the amount thereof provable in bankruptcy pursuant to Section 5.2, or impair or affect the right of any Securityholder to institute suit for the payment thereof or, if the Securities provide therefor, any right of repayment at the option of the Securityholder without the consent of the holder of each Security so affected, or (b) reduce the aforesaid percentage of Securities of any series, the consent of the Holders of which is required for any such supplemental indenture, without the consent of the holder of each Security so affected.

Securityholders as aforesaid and other documents, if any, required by Section 7.1, the Trustee shall join with the Issuer in the execution of such supplemental indenture unless such supplemental indenture affects the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under this Indenture or otherwise, in which case the Trustee may in its discretion, but shall not be obligated to, enter into such supplemental indenture.
It shall not be necessary for the consent of the Securityholders under this Section to approve the particular form of any proposed supplemental indenture, but it shall be sufficient if such consent shall approve the substance thereof.
     Promptly after the execution by the Issuer and the Trustee of any supplemental indenture pursuant to the provisions of this Section 8.2, the Issuer shall mail or publish a notice thereof by first class mail to the holders of then Outstanding Securities of each series affected thereby at their addresses as they shall appear on the registry books of the Issuer, and in each case such notice shall set forth in general terms the substance of such supplemental indenture. Any failure of the Issuer to mail or publish such notice, or any defect therein, shall not, however, in any way impair or affect the validity of any such supplemental indenture.
SECTION 8.3 . Upon the execution of any supplemental indenture pursuant to the provisions hereof, this Indenture shall be and be deemed to be modified and amended in accordance therewith and the respective rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and immunities under this Indenture of the Trustee, the Issuer and the holders of Securities of each series affected thereby shall thereafter be determined, exercised and enforced hereunder subject in all respects to such modifications and amendments, and all the terms and conditions of any such supplemental indenture shall be and be deemed to be part of the terms and conditions of this Indenture for any and all purposes.
Effect of Supplemental Indenture
SECTION 8.4 . The Trustee, subject to the provisions of Sections 6.1 and 6.2, may receive an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel as conclusive evidence that any supplemental indenture executed pursuant to this Article Eight complies with the applicable provisions of this Indenture.

SECTION 8.5 . Securities of any series authenticated and delivered after the execution of any supplemental indenture pursuant to the provisions of this Article may bear a notation in form approved by the Trustee for such series as to any matter provided for by such supplemental indenture. If the Issuer or the Trustee shall so determine, new Securities of any series so modified as to conform, in the opinion of the Trustee and the Board of Directors, to any modification of this Indenture contained in any such supplemental indenture may be prepared by the Issuer, authenticated by the Trustee and delivered in exchange for the Securities of such series then Outstanding.
Notation on Securities in Respect of Supplemental Indentures
SECTION 9.1 . The Issuer covenants that it will not merge or consolidate with any other corporation or sell or convey all or
Issuer May Consolidate, Etc., on Certain Terms
 
substantially all of its assets to any Person, unless (i) either the Issuer shall be the continuing corporation, or the successor corporation or the Person which acquires by sale or conveyance substantially all the assets of the Issuer (if other than the Issuer) shall be a corporation organized under the laws of the United States of America or any State thereof and shall expressly assume the due and punctual payment of the principal of and interest on all the Securities and Coupons, according to their tenor, and the due and punctual performance and observance of all of the covenants and conditions of this Indenture to be performed or observed by the Issuer, by supplemental indenture satisfactory to the Trustee, executed and delivered to the Trustee by such corporation, and (ii) the Issuer or such successor corporation, as the case may be, shall not, immediately after such merger or consolidation, or such sale or conveyance, be in default in any material respect in the performance of any such covenant or condition.
SECTION 9.2 . In case of any such consolidation, merger, sale or conveyance, and following such an assumption by the successor corporation, such successor corporation shall succeed to and be substituted for the Issuer, with the same effect as if it had been named herein. Such successor corporation may cause to be signed, and may issue either in its own name or in the name of the Issuer prior to such succession any or all of the Securities issuable hereunder, together with any Coupons appertaining thereto, which theretofore shall not have been signed by the Issuer and delivered to the Trustee; and, upon the order of such successor corporation instead of the Issuer and subject to all the terms, conditions and limitations in this Indenture prescribed, the Trustee shall authenticate and shall deliver any Securities, together with any Coupons appertaining thereto, which previously shall have been signed and delivered by the officers of the Issuer to the Trustee for authentication, and any Securities, together with any Coupons appertaining thereto, which such successor corporation thereafter shall cause to be signed and delivered to the Trustee for that purpose. All of the Securities, together with any Coupons appertaining thereto, so issued shall in all respects have the same legal rank and benefit under this Indenture as the Securities, together with any Coupons appertaining thereto, theretofore or thereafter issued in accordance with the terms of this Indenture as though all of such Securities and Coupons had been issued at the date of the execution hereof.
Successor Corporation Substituted
     In case of any such consolidation, merger, sale, lease or conveyance, such changes in phraseology and form (but not in substance) may be made in the Securities and Coupons thereafter to be issued as may be appropriate.
     In the event of any such sale or conveyance (other than a conveyance by way of lease), the Issuer or any successor corporation which shall theretofore have become such in the manner described in this Article shall be discharged from all obligations and covenants under this Indenture and the Securities and may be liquidated and dissolved.
SECTION 9.3 . The Trustee, subject to the provisions of Sections 6.1 and 6.2, may receive an Opinion of Counsel, prepared in accordance with Section 11.5, as conclusive evidence that any such consolidation, merger, sale, lease or conveyance, and any such assumption, and any such liquidation or dissolution, complies with the applicable provisions of this Indenture.

provided
 
Indenture, to the payment, either directly or through any Paying Agent (including the Issuer acting as its own Paying Agent) as the Trustee may determine, to the Persons entitled thereto, of the principal, premium, if any, and interest for whose payment such money has been deposited with the Trustee. The Issuer agrees to reimburse the Trustee for any costs or expenses thereafter reasonably and properly incurred and to compensate the Trustee for any services thereafter reasonably and properly rendered by the Trustee in connection with this Indenture or the Securities and Coupons of such series.

sinking fund for the retirement of Securities of a series except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 2.3 for Securities of such series.

Any notice which is mailed in the manner herein provided shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the Holder receives the notice. Failure to give notice by mail, or any defect in the notice to the holder of any Security of a series designated for redemption, as a whole or in part, shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other Security of such series.
Notice of Redemption; Partial Redemptions
The notice of redemption to each such Holder shall specify the principal amount of each Security of such series held by such Holder to be redeemed, the date fixed for redemption, the redemption price, the place or places of payment, that payment will be made upon presentation and surrender of such Securities, and, in the case of Securities with Coupons attached thereto, of all Coupons appertaining thereto maturing after the date fixed for redemption, that such redemption is pursuant to the mandatory or optional sinking fund, or both, if such be the case, that interest accrued to the date fixed for redemption will be paid as specified in such notice and that, on and after said date, interest thereon or on the portions thereof to be redeemed will cease to accrue. In case any Security of a series is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed and shall state that on and after the date fixed for redemption, upon surrender of such Security, a new Security or Securities of such series in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof will be issued.
The notice of redemption of Securities of any series to be redeemed at the option of the Issuer shall be given by the Issuer or, at the Issuer's request, by the Trustee in the name and at the expense of the Issuer.
On the redemption date specified in the notice of redemption given as provided in this Section, the Issuer will deposit with the Trustee or with one or more paying agents (or, if the Issuer is acting as its own paying agent, set aside, segregate and hold in trust as provided in Section 3.4) an amount of money sufficient to redeem on the redemption date all the Securities of such series so called for redemption at the appropriate redemption price, together with accrued interest to the date fixed for redemption. If any or all of the outstanding Securities of a series are to be redeemed, the Issuer will deliver to the Trustee at least 70 days prior to the date fixed for redemption an Officers' Certificate stating the date of redemption and the aggregate principal amount of Securities to be redeemed.
If less than all the Securities of a series are to be redeemed, the Trustee shall select, in such manner as at the time shall be required by law or, if no such legal requirement shall then exist, in such manner as it shall deem appropriate and fair, Securities of such series to be redeemed in whole or in part. Securities may be redeemed in part in multiples equal to the minimum authorized denomination for Securities of such series or any integral multiple thereof. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Issuer in writing of the Securities of such series selected for
 
redemption and, in the case of any Securities of such series selected for partial redemption, the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. For all purposes of this Indenture, unless the context otherwise requires, all provisions relating to the redemption of Securities of any series shall relate, in the case of any Security redeemed or to be redeemed only in part, to the portion of the principal amount of such Security which has been or is to be redeemed.
SECTION 12.3 . If notice of redemption has been given as above provided, the Securities or portions of Securities specified in such notice shall become due and payable on the date and at the place stated in such notice at the applicable redemption price, together with interest accrued to the date fixed for redemption, and on and after said date (unless the Issuer shall default in the payment of such Securities at the redemption price, together with interest accrued to said date) interest on the Securities or portions of Securities so called for redemption shall cease to accrue and the unmatured Coupons, if any, appertaining thereto shall be void and, except as provided in Sections 6.5 and 10.4, such Securities shall cease from and after the date fixed for redemption to be entitled to any benefit or security under this Indenture, and the Holders thereof shall have no right in respect of such Securities except the right to receive the redemption price thereof and unpaid interest to the date fixed for redemption. On presentation and surrender of such Securities, together with all Coupons appertaining thereto maturing after the date fixed for redemption, at a place of payment specified in said notice, said Securities and Coupons or the specified portions thereof shall be paid and redeemed by the Issuer at the applicable redemption price, together with interest accrued thereon to the date fixed for redemption; that any semiannual payment of interest becoming due on the date fixed for redemption shall be payable in the case of Securities with Coupons attached thereto, to the bearers of the Coupons for such interest upon surrender thereof, and in the case of Registered Securities, to the holders of such Securities registered as such on the relevant record date subject to the terms and provisions of Section 2.4 hereof.
Payment of Securities Called for Redemption
provided
If any Security called for redemption shall not be so paid upon surrender thereof for redemption, the principal shall, until paid or duly provided for, bear interest from the date fixed for redemption at the rate of interest or Yield to Maturity (in the case of an Original Issue Discount Security) borne by the Security.
If any Security with Coupons attached thereto is surrendered for redemption and is not accompanied by all such Coupons maturing after the date fixed for redemption, the surrender of such missing Coupon or Coupons may be waived by the Issuer and the Trustee, if there be furnished to each of them such security or indemnity as they may require to save each of them harmless.
Upon presentation of any Security redeemed in part only, the Issuer shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to or on the order of the Holder thereof, at the expense of the Issuer, a new Security or Securities of such series, together with all Coupons, if any, appertaining thereto, of authorized denominations, in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the Security so presented.

officer of the Issuer and delivered to the Trustee at least 40 days prior to the last date on which notice of redemption may be given as being owned of record and beneficially by, and not pledged or hypothecated by either (a) the Issuer or (b) an entity specifically identified in such written statement directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with the Issuer.
SECTION 12.5 . The minimum amount of any sinking fund payment provided for by the terms of Securities of any series is herein referred to as a "mandatory sinking fund payment", and any payment in excess of such minimum amount provided for by the terms of Securities of any series is herein referred to as an "optional sinking fund payment." The date on which a sinking fund payment is to be made is herein referred to as the "sinking fund payment date."
Mandatory and Optional Sinking Funds
In lieu of making all or any part of any mandatory sinking fund payment with respect to any series of Securities in cash, the Issuer at its option may (a) deliver to the Trustee Securities of such series theretofore purchased or otherwise acquired (except upon redemption pursuant to the mandatory sinking fund) by the Issuer or receive credit for Securities of such series (not previously so credited) theretofore purchased or otherwise acquired (except as aforesaid) by the Issuer and delivered to the Trustee for cancellation pursuant to Section 2.10,(b) receive credit for optional sinking fund payments (not previously so credited) made pursuant to this Section, or (c) receive credit for Securities of such series (not previously so credited) redeemed by the Issuer through any optional redemption provision contained in the terms of such series. Securities so delivered or credited shall be received or credited by the Trustee at the sinking fund redemption price specified in such Securities.
On or before the 60 day next preceding each sinking fund payment date for any series, the Issuer will deliver to the Trustee a written statement (which need not contain the statements required by Section 11.5) signed by an authorized officer of the Issuer (a) specifying the portion of the mandatory sinking fund payment to be satisfied by payment of cash and the portion to be satisfied by credit of Securities of such series, (b) if applicable, stating that none of the Securities of such series has theretofore been so credited, (c) stating that no defaults in the payment of interest or Events of Default with respect to such series have occurred (which have not been waived or cured) and are continuing and (d) stating whether or not the Issuer intends to exercise its right to make an optional sinking fund payment with respect to such series and, if so, specifying the amount of such optional sinking fund payment which the Issuer intends to pay on or before the next succeeding sinking fund payment date. Any Securities of such series to be credited and required to be delivered to the Trustee in order for the Issuer to be entitled to credit therefor as aforesaid which have not theretofore been delivered to the Trustee shall be delivered for cancellation pursuant to Section 2.10 to the Trustee with such written statement (or reasonably promptly thereafter if acceptable to the Trustee). Such written statement shall be irrevocable and upon its receipt by the Trustee the Issuer shall become unconditionally obligated to make all the cash payments or payments therein referred to, if any, on or before the next succeeding sinking fund payment date. Failure of the Issuer, on or before any such 60 day, to deliver such written statement and Securities specified in this paragraph, if any, shall not constitute a default, but shall constitute, on and as of such date, the irrevocable election of the Issuer (i) that the mandatory sinking fund payment for such series due on the next succeeding sinking fund payment date shall be paid entirely in cash without the option to deliver or credit
th
th
 
Securities of such series in respect thereof and (ii) that the Issuer will make no optional sinking fund payment with respect to such series as provided in this Section.
If the sinking fund payment or payments (mandatory or optional or both) to be made in cash on the next succeeding sinking fund payment date plus any unused balance of any preceding sinking fund payments made in cash shall exceed $50,000 (or a lesser sum if the Issuer shall so request) with respect to the Securities of any particular series, such cash shall be applied on the next succeeding sinking fund payment date to the redemption of Securities of such series at the sinking fund redemption price, together with accrued interest to the date fixed for redemption. If such amount shall be $50,000 or less and the Issuer makes no such request, then it shall be carried over until a sum in excess of $50,000 is available. The Trustee shall select, in the manner provided in Section 12.2, for redemption on such sinking fund payment date a sufficient principal amount of Securities of such series to absorb said cash, as nearly as may be, and (if requested in writing by the Issuer) shall inform the Issuer of the serial numbers of the Securities of such series (or portions thereof) so selected. Except as aforesaid, any moneys in the sinking fund for such series at the time when any default or Event of Default shall occur, and any moneys thereafter paid into the sinking fund, during the continuance of such default or Event of Default, shall be deemed to have been collected under Article Five and held for the payment of all such Securities. In case such Event of Default shall have been waived as provided in Section 5.10 or the default cured on or before the 60 day preceding the sinking fund payment date in any year, such moneys shall thereafter be applied on the next succeeding sinking fund payment date in accordance with this Section to the redemption of such Securities.
th
SECTION 13.1 . The Issuer, for itself, its successors and assigns, covenants and agrees, and each Holder likewise covenants and agrees by his acceptance thereof, that the obligations of the Issuer to make any payment on account of the principal of and interest on each and all of the Securities shall be subordinate and junior, to the extent and in the manner hereinafter set forth, in right of payment and upon liquidation to the Issuer's obligations to the holders of Senior Debt of the Issuer.
Securities Subordinate to Senior Debt
SECTION 13.2 . No payment on account of principal or interest on the Securities shall be made by the Issuer unless full payment of amounts then due for principal (and premium, if any), sinking funds, and interest on Senior Debt of the Issuer has been made or duly provided for in money or money's worth in accordance with its terms. No payment on account of principal or interest on the Securities shall be made by the Issuer if, at the time of such payment or immediately after giving effect thereto, there shall have occurred an event of default with respect to any Senior Debt of the Issuer or in any instrument under which the same is outstanding, permitting the holders thereof (or a trustee on behalf of the holders thereof) to accelerate the maturity thereof, or an event that, with the giving of notice or the passage of time or both, would constitute such event of default, and such event of default shall not have been cured or waived.
Issuer Not to Pay if Senior Debt of Issuer is in Default
 
SECTION 13.3 . The Issuer agrees that upon (i) the occurrence of any Senior Debt event of default referred to in Section 13.2 above that shall not have been cured or waived or (ii) any payment or distribution of assets of the Issuer of any kind or character, whether in cash, property or securities, to creditors upon any dissolution or winding up or total or partial liquidation or reorganization of the Issuer, whether voluntary or involuntary or in bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, conservatorship or other proceedings, all principal (and premium, if any), sinking fund payments and interest due or to become due upon all Senior Debt of the Issuer shall first be paid in full, or payment thereof provided for in money or money's worth in accordance with its terms, before any payment is made on account of the principal of or interest on the indebtedness evidenced by the Securities, and upon any such dissolution or winding up or liquidation or reorganization, any payment or distribution of assets of the Issuer of any kind or character, whether in cash, property or securities (other than securities of the Issuer or any other Person provided for by a plan of reorganization or readjustment, the payment of which is subordinate, at least to the extent provided in this Section with respect to the Securities, to the payment in full of all Senior Debt, the rights of the Holders of the Senior Debt are not altered by such reorganization or readjustment), to which the Holders of the Securities would, except for the provisions hereof, be entitled, shall be paid by the Issuer or by any receiver, trustee in bankruptcy, liquidating trustee, agent or other person making such payment or distribution, or by the Holders or by the Trustee under this instrument if received by them or it, directly to the holders of Senior Debt of the Issuer (to each such holder on the basis of the respective amounts of Senior Debt held by such holder) or their representatives, to the extent necessary to pay all Senior Debt of the Issuer in full, in money or money's worth, after giving effect to any concurrent payment or distribution to or for the holders of such Senior Debt, before any payment or distribution is made to the Holders of the indebtedness evidenced by the Securities or to the Trustee or to any paying agent (subject, in the case of the Trustee or any paying agent, to the provisions of Section 6.5) under this instrument.

The consolidation of the Issuer with, or the merger of the Issuer into, another corporation or the liquidation or dissolution of the Issuer following the conveyance or transfer of its properties and assets substantially as an entirety to another Person upon the terms and conditions set forth in

SECTION 13.4 . Subject to the prior payment in full of all Senior Debt of the Issuer, the Holders shall be subrogated (equally and ratably with the holders of all indebtedness of the Issuer that by its express terms is subordinated to indebtedness of the Issuer to substantially the same extent as the Securities are subordinated and is entitled to like rights of subrogation) to the rights of the holders of such Senior Debt to receive payments or distributions of cash, property and securities applicable to the Senior Debt of the Issuer until the Securities shall be paid in full.

Upon any payment or distribution of assets of the Issuer referred to in this Article, the Trustee, subject to the provisions of Section 6.1, and the Holders shall be entitled to rely upon an order or decree made by any court of competent jurisdiction in which such dissolution or winding up or liquidation or reorganization or arrangement proceedings are pending or upon a certificate of the trustee in bankruptcy, receiver, conservator, assignee for the benefit of creditors or other person making such payment or distribution, delivered to the Trustee or to the Holders, for the purpose of ascertaining the persons entitled to participate in such distribution, the holders of the Senior Debt, the amount thereof or payable thereon, the amount or amounts paid or distributed thereon and all other facts pertinent or to this Article.
Reliance on Certificate of Liquidating Agent
SECTION 13.6 . Nothing contained in this Article or elsewhere in this Indenture, or in any of the Securities, shall prevent (a) the Issuer, at any time except during the pendency of any dissolution, winding up, liquidation or reorganization or other similar proceedings referred to in Section 13.3 or under the conditions described in Section 13.2, from making payments at any time of principal of (or premium, if any) or interest on the Securities or (b) the application by the Trustee or any paying agent of any moneys deposited with it hereunder to the payment of or on account of the principal of (or premium, if any) or interest on Securities, if, at the time of such application, the Trustee or such paying agent, as the case may be, did not have the written notice provided for in Section 13.7 of any event prohibiting the making of such deposit or if, at the time of such deposit (whether or not in trust) by the Issuer
Payment Permitted if No Default
 
with the Trustee or any paying agent (other than the Issuer), such payment would not have been prohibited by the provisions of this Article.

Trustee Not Charged with Knowledge of Prohibition

               (ii) In the event the Issuer has delivered an Officers' Certificate to the Trustee pursuant to clause (v) of this Section 2.02(a) in connection with any Quarterly Interest Payment Date, (x) the principal amount of the Debentures payable on such Quarterly Interest Payment Date shall be the principal amount set forth in the notice of repayment, if any, accompanying such Officers' Certificate, (y) such principal amount shall be repaid on such Quarterly Interest Payment Date pursuant to Article 5 hereof to the extent of net proceeds received by the Issuer to the Date of QCS Notice, without duplication of prior amounts received, of the issuance of Qualifying Capital Securities as contemplated by Section 2.02 (a)(iv), and (z) the remaining Debentures shall remain outstanding and shall be payable on the immediately succeeding Quarterly Interest Payment Date to the extent of net proceeds received by the Issuer to the Date of QCS Notice, without duplication of prior amounts received, of the issuance of Qualifying Capital Securities as contemplated by Section 2.02 (a)(iv), and on each Quarterly Interest Payment Date thereafter to like extent until the Debentures are paid in full, or such earlier date on which they are redeemed pursuant to Article 4 hereof or become due and payable pursuant to Section 5.1 of the Indenture.
               (iii) The obligation of the Issuer to repay the Debentures pursuant to this Section 2.02(a) on any date prior to the Final Maturity Date shall be subject to (x) its obligations under Article Thirteen of the Indenture to the holders of Senior Indebtedness and
 
(y) its obligations under Section 2.05 hereof with respect to the payment of deferred interest on the Debentures.
               (iv) Until the Debentures are paid in full:
                    (A) the Issuer shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts, subject to a Market Disruption Event, to raise sufficient net proceeds from the issuance of Qualifying Capital Securities during a 180-day period ending on the date, not more than 15 and not less than ten Business Days prior to the Scheduled Maturity Date, on which the Issuer delivers the notice required by clause (v) of this Section 2.02(a) and Section 5.01, to permit repayment of the Debentures in full on the Scheduled Maturity Date pursuant to clause (i) of this Section 2.02(a); and
                    (B) if the Issuer is unable for any reason to raise sufficient net proceeds from the issuance of Qualifying Capital Securities to permit repayment in full of the Debentures on the Scheduled Maturity Date or any subsequent Quarterly Interest Payment Date, the Issuer shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts, subject to a Market Disruption Event, to raise sufficient net proceeds from the issuance of Qualifying Capital Securities during a 90-day period ending on the date, not more than 15 and not less than ten Business Days prior to the following Quarterly Interest Payment Date, on which the Issuer delivers the notice required by clause (v) of this Section 2.02(a) and Section 5.01, to permit repayment of the Debentures in full on such following Quarterly Interest Payment Date pursuant to clause (i) of this Section 2.02(a); and
                    (C) the Issuer shall apply any such net proceeds to the repayment of the Debentures as provided in clause (vi) of this
Section 2.02(a).
For the avoidance of doubt, the Issuer is not obligated to sell any securities other than Qualifying Capital Securities to raise net proceeds for repayment of the Debentures pursuant to this Section 2.02(a), or to apply the proceeds of any such sale of other securities to repayment of the Debentures pursuant to this Section 2.02(a), and no Holder of Debentures may require the Issuer to issue any such other securities in satisfaction of its obligations under this Section 2.02(a).
               (v) The Issuer, if it has not raised sufficient net proceeds from the issuance of Qualifying Capital Securities pursuant to clause (iv) above in connection with any Repayment Date, shall deliver an Officers' Certificate to the Trustee (who shall forward such certificate to each Holder of the Debentures) no more than 15 and no less than ten Business Days prior to such Repayment Date (the date of such delivery, the "") stating the amount of net proceeds, if any, raised pursuant to clause (iv) above in connection with such Repayment Date. The Issuer shall be excused from its obligation to use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to sell Qualifying Capital Securities pursuant to clause (iv) above if such Officers' Certificate further certifies that: (A) a Market Disruption Event was existing during the 180-day period preceding the date of such Officers' Certificate or, in the case of any Repayment Date after the Scheduled Maturity Date, the 90-day period preceding the date of such Officers' Certificate; and (B) either (x) the Market Disruption Event continued for the entire 180-day period or 90-day period, as the case may be, or (y) the Market Disruption Event continued for only part of the period but the Issuer was unable after Commercially Reasonable Efforts to raise
Date of QCS Notice
 
sufficient net proceeds during the rest of that period to permit repayment of the Debentures in full. Each Officers' Certificate delivered pursuant to this clause (v), unless no principal amount of Debentures is to be repaid on the applicable Repayment Date, shall be accompanied by a notice of repayment pursuant to Section 5.01 setting forth the principal amount of the Debentures to be repaid on such Repayment Date, which amount shall be determined after giving effect to clause (vi) of this Section 2.02(a). In the event the Issuer fails to deliver an Officer's Certificate to the Trustee in the manner described herein in connection with a Repayment Date, the Issuer shall be deemed to have confirmed that sufficient proceeds have been raised from an issuance of Qualifying Capital Securities, and all outstanding principal will be due on such Repayment Date.
               (vi) Payments in respect of the Debentures on any Repayment Date will be applied, first, to deferred interest on the Debentures to the extent of Eligible Proceeds raised pursuant to Section 2.06; second, to pay current interest on the Debentures to the extent not paid from other sources; and third, to repay the outstanding principal amount of the Debentures, subject to a minimum principal amount of $5,000,000 to be repaid on any Repayment Date; that if the Issuer is obligated to sell Qualifying Capital Securities and apply the net proceeds therefrom to payments of principal of or interest on any Pari Passu Securities in addition to the Debentures, then on any date and for any period, the amount of net proceeds received by the Issuer from those sales and available for such payments shall be applied to the Debentures and those other Pari Passu Securities having the same scheduled maturity date as the Debentures pro rata in accordance with their respective outstanding principal amounts, and no such payments shall be made to any other such Pari Passu Securities having a later scheduled maturity date until the principal of and all accrued and unpaid interest on the Debentures have been paid in full, except to the extent permitted by Sections 3.01 and 2.06(c). If the Issuer raises less than $5,000,000 of net proceeds from the sale of Qualifying Capital Securities during the relevant 180-day or 90-day period, the Issuer will not be required to repay any Debentures on the Scheduled Maturity Date or the next Quarterly Interest Payment Date, as applicable. On the next Quarterly Interest Payment Date as of which the Issuer has raised at least $5,000,000 of net proceeds during the 180-day period (or, if shorter, the period beginning on the date on which the Issuer last repaid any principal amount of Debentures) ending on the date not more than 15 and not less than ten Business Days prior to such Quarterly Interest Payment Date, on which the Issuer delivers the notice required by clause (v) of this Section 2.02(a) and Section 5.01, the Issuer shall be required to repay a principal amount of the Debentures equal to the entire net proceeds from the sale of Qualifying Capital Securities during such 180-day or shorter period on such Quarterly Interest Payment Date.
provided
               (vii) The Issuer shall not amend the Replacement Capital Covenant to impose additional restrictions on the type or amount of Qualifying Capital Securities that the Issuer may include for purposes of determining whether or to what extent repayment, redemption or purchase of the Debentures is permitted under the Replacement Capital Covenant, except with the consent of Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Debentures. Except as aforesaid, the Issuer may amend or supplement the Replacement Capital Covenant in accordance with its terms and without the consent of the Holders of the Debentures.
 
          
(b) Final Maturity Date
          The principal of, and all accrued and unpaid interest on, all outstanding Debentures shall be due and payable on June 15, 2067 or, if such date is not a Business Day, the following Business Day (the ""), regardless of the amount of Qualifying Capital Securities the Issuer may have issued and sold by that time.

     The Debentures shall be substantially in the form of attached hereto and shall be issued in fully registered definitive form without interest coupons. Principal of and interest on the Debentures will be payable, the transfer of such Debentures will be registrable and such Debentures will be exchangeable for Debentures bearing identical terms and provisions, and notices and demands to or upon the Issuer in respect of the Debentures and the Indenture may be served, at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, and the Issuer appoints the Trustee as its agent for the foregoing purposes, provided that payment of interest may be made at the option of the Issuer by check mailed to the Holders at such address as shall appear in the Securities Register or by wire transfer in immediately available funds to the bank account number of the Holders specified in writing by the Holders not less than ten days before the relevant Interest Payment Date and entered in the Securities Register by the Securities registrar. The Debentures may be presented for registration of transfer or exchange at the Securities Registrar Office.
Exhibit A
     The Debentures initially are issuable solely as Global Securities. The Debentures shall be physically transferred to all beneficial owners in definitive form in exchange for their beneficial interests in a Global Security if the Depositary with respect to such Global Securities notifies the Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for such Global Security or if it ceases to be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and a successor Depositary is not appointed by the Issuer within 90 days of such notice.

(a) Rate of Interest; Accrual
          The Debentures shall bear interest from and including June 21, 2007, to but excluding, June 15, 2017 (or any earlier date on which the Debentures are redeemed pursuant to Article Four), at the rate of 6.70% per annum, computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. Commencing on and including June 15, 2017, the Debentures shall bear interest at an annual rate of Three-Month LIBOR plus 2.0175% (the ""), computed for each Quarterly Interest Period on the basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of days elapsed. Except as provided in Section 2.04(b), interest will accrue from and including each Interest Payment Date to, but excluding, the immediately succeeding Interest Payment Date. Accrued interest that is not paid on the applicable Interest Payment Date, including interest deferred pursuant to Section 2.05, will bear Additional Interest, to the extent permitted by law, at the interest rate in effect from time to time provided in this Section 2.04(a), from the relevant Interest Payment Date, compounded on each subsequent Interest Payment Date.

Section 2.05. Interest Deferral
          
(a) Option to Defer Interest Payments
               (i) Subject to other provisions hereof, the Issuer shall have the right, at any time and from time to time, to defer the payment of interest on the Debentures for one or more consecutive Interest Periods that do not exceed ten years for any single Deferral Period, provided that no Deferral Period shall extend beyond the Final Maturity Date or the earlier repayment or redemption in full of the Debentures. If the Issuer has paid all deferred interest on the Debentures, the Issuer shall have the right to elect to begin a new Deferral Period pursuant to this Section 2.05.
               (ii) At the end of any Deferral Period, the Issuer shall pay all deferred interest on the Debentures (including Additional Interest thereon) to the Persons in whose names the Debentures are registered in the Securities Register at the close of business on the Regular Record Date with respect to the Interest Payment Date at the end of such Deferral Period.
               (iii) The Issuer may elect to pay interest on any Interest Payment Date during any Deferral Period to the extent permitted by Section 2.05(b).
          
(b) Payment of Deferred Interest
          Subject to a Market Disruption Event as described under Section 2.06(b), the Issuer will not pay any deferred interest on the Debentures from any source other than Eligible Proceeds prior to the Final Maturity Date, except at any time that the principal amount of the Debentures has been accelerated and such acceleration has not been rescinded or in the case of a
 
Business Combination to the extent described below in Section 2.05(c). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer may pay current interest from any available funds.
          
(c) Business Combination Exception
          If (i) the Issuer is involved in a Business Combination where immediately after its consummation more than 50% of the voting shares of the surviving entity of such Business Combination, or the Person to whom all or substantially all of the Issuer's properties or assets are conveyed, transferred or leased in such Business Combination, is owned, directly or indirectly, by the shareholders of the other party to such Business Combination, and (ii) at the time the Business Combination is consummated a Deferral Period is continuing, then Section 2.05(b) shall not apply to any payment of deferred interest for such Deferral Period, if such Deferral Period is terminated on the next Interest Payment Date following the date of consummation of the Business Combination.
          
(d) Notice of Deferral
          The Issuer shall give written notice of its election to commence or continue any Deferral Period to the Trustee and the Holders of the Debentures at least one Business Day and not more than 60 Business Days before the next Interest Payment Date. Such notice shall be given to the Trustee and each Holder of Debentures at such Holder's address appearing in the Security Register by first-class mail, postage prepaid.
Section 2.06. Alternative Payment Mechanism
          
(a) Obligation to Issue Qualifying APM Securities
          Immediately following the earlier of (i) the first Interest Payment Date following the commencement of a Deferral Period on which the Issuer pays any current interest on the Debentures (which the Issuer may do from any source of funds) or (ii) the fifth anniversary of the commencement of the Deferral Period, the Issuer, subject to the occurrence and continuation of a Market Disruption Event as described under Section 2.06(b) and subject to Section 2.05(b) and Section 2.06(c), shall issue one or more types of Qualifying APM Securities until the Issuer has raised an amount of Eligible Proceeds at least equal to the aggregate amount of accrued and unpaid deferred interest (including compounding interest thereon) on the Debentures. The Issuer shall apply such Eligible Proceeds on the next Interest Payment Date to the payment of deferred interest in accordance with this Section 2.06. The requirement set forth in this Section 2.06(a) shall be in effect until the end of such Deferral Period. Notwithstanding (and as a qualification to) the foregoing:
               (i) the Issuer shall not be required to issue Common Shares or, if the definition of Qualifying APM Securities has been amended to eliminate Common Shares, Qualifying Warrants prior to the fifth anniversary of the commencement of a Deferral Period, to the extent that the number of Common Shares issued or issuable upon exercise of Qualifying Warrants to be applied for purposes of funding deferred interest hereunder, together with the number of Common Shares previously issued or issuable upon exercise of Qualifying Warrants previously issued during such Deferral Period, to the extent still outstanding, and applied for such purposes, would exceed an amount equal to 2% of the total number of issued and
 
outstanding Common Shares reported in the Issuer's then most recent publicly available consolidated financial statements immediately prior to the date of such issuance (the ""); that the Common Equity Issuance Cap will cease to apply with respect to a Deferral Period following the fifth anniversary of the commencement of such Deferral Period, at which point the Issuer must pay any deferred interest, regardless of the time at which it was deferred, pursuant to this Section 2.06, subject to a Market Disruption Event and the Share Cap Amount; and , , that if the Common Equity Issuance Cap is reached during a Deferral Period and the Issuer subsequently pays all deferred interest, the Common Equity Issuance Cap will cease to apply with respect to such Deferral Period at the termination of such Deferral Period and will not apply again unless and until the Issuer starts a new Deferral Period;
Common Equity Issuance Cap
provided
provided
further
               (ii) the Issuer shall not be permitted to issue Qualifying Non-Cumulative Preferred Shares or Mandatorily Convertible Preferred Shares to the extent that the net proceeds of any issuance of Qualifying Non-Cumulative Preferred Shares and Mandatorily Convertible Preferred Shares, together with the net proceeds of all prior issuances of Qualifying Non-Cumulative Preferred Shares and Mandatorily Convertible Preferred Shares during the current and all prior Deferral Periods, to the extent still outstanding, would exceed 25% of the aggregate principal amount of the Debentures (the ""); and
Preferred Share Issuance Cap
               (iii) notwithstanding the Common Equity Issuance Cap and the Preferred Share Issuance Cap, so long as there are outstanding Debentures, the Issuer shall not be permitted, subject to the provisions of the three immediately succeeding paragraphs, to sell Common Shares, Qualifying Warrants or Mandatorily Convertible Preferred Shares to pay deferred interest on the Debentures if the number of Common Shares to be issued (or which would be issuable upon exercise or conversion of such Qualifying Warrants or Mandatorily Convertible Preferred Shares) to pay such deferred interest would be in excess of an amount (the "", subject to adjustment as provided in the second succeeding paragraph) equal to the greater of (a) 150,000,000 Common Shares the number of Common Shares that the Issuer repurchases or that are added to Shares Available for Issuance (as defined below) pursuant to the second paragraph below, in either case after the date of issuance of the Debentures (the "" of the Share Cap Amount, provided that the Fixed Rate Portion shall not exceed 250,000,000 shares), in the aggregate, during the period the Debentures are outstanding or (b) on any date on which the Issuer is otherwise obligated to sell Qualifying APM Securities pursuant to this Section 2.06, the Issuer's then effective Shares Available for Issuance; that if the issued and outstanding Common Shares are changed into a different number of shares or a different class by reason of any share split, reverse share split, share dividend, reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares or other similar transaction, the Fixed Rate Portion of the Share Cap Amount shall be correspondingly adjusted. If the Issuer issues additional Debentures, then the Share Cap Amount will be increased accordingly.
Share Cap Amount
plus
Fixed Rate Portion
provided
               The Issuer's "" shall be calculated as of any day in two steps. First, from the number of authorized and unissued Common Shares, the maximum number of Common Shares that can be issued under existing options, warrants, convertible securities, any equity-linked contracts, any equity compensation plans for directors,
Shares Available for Issuance
 
officers or employees and other plans and agreements which require or permit the Issuer to issue a determinable number of Common Shares shall be deducted. After deduction of that number of Common Shares from authorized and unissued Common Shares, the remaining available Common Shares shall be allocated on a pro rata basis or on such other basis as the Issuer deems appropriate to the obligation to issue securities under this Section 2.06 and to any other similar commitment that is of an indeterminate nature and under which the Issuer is then required to issue Common Shares. If the Shares Available for Issuance are zero after the two steps described above, there shall be no obligation to obtain additional Common Shares other than the obligation to use commercially reasonable efforts to seek adoption of a shareholder vote at the Issuer's next occurring annual shareholders' meeting to increase the number of authorized Common Shares as described below.
               The Issuer in any event shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to increase Shares Available for Issuance to at least 250,000,000 Common Shares by not later than five years after initial issuance of the Debentures. Once Shares Available for Issuance are at least 250,000,000 Common Shares, then the Share Cap Amount shall automatically be amended to mean 250,000,000 Common Shares minus the number of Common Shares, if any, sold prior to such date to settle deferred interest pursuant to this Section 2.06 and thereafter will not be determined in part by reference to Shares Available for Issuance. Promptly after each increase in the Share Cap Amount of 50,000,000 Common Shares, the Issuer will file a current report on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission giving notice of such increase.
               In addition to the Issuer's obligation described in the preceding paragraph, if the Share Cap Amount has been reached and such amount is not sufficient to allow the Issuer to raise sufficient Eligible Proceeds to pay all deferred interest then accrued in full, the Issuer shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to increase the Share Cap Amount (which it may do in its discretion without the approval of any Holder) (1) only to the extent that the Issuer can do so and simultaneously satisfy its future fixed or contingent obligations under other securities and derivative instruments that provide for settlement or payment in Common Shares or (2) if the Issuer cannot increase the Share Cap Amount as contemplated in the preceding clause (1), by requesting the Issuer's Board of Directors to adopt a resolution for shareholder vote at the next occurring annual shareholders meeting to increase the number of the Issuer's authorized Common Shares for purposes of satisfying the Issuer's obligations to pay deferred interest.
               For the avoidance of doubt, (x) once the Issuer reaches the Common Equity Issuance Cap for a Deferral Period, the Issuer shall not be obligated to issue more Common Shares, or if the definition of Qualifying APM Securities has been amended to eliminate Common Shares, more Qualifying Warrants pursuant to this Section 2.06(a) prior to the fifth anniversary of the commencement of such Deferral Period even if the number of outstanding Common Shares subsequently increases, and (y) so long as the definition of Qualifying APM Securities has not been amended to eliminate Common Shares, the sale of Qualifying Warrants to pay deferred interest is an option that may be exercised at the Issuer's sole discretion, subject to the Common Equity Issuance Cap and the Share Cap Amount, and the Issuer is not obligated to sell Qualifying Warrants or to apply the proceeds of any such sale to pay deferred interest on the Debentures, and no class of holders of the Issuer's securities, or any other party, may require the Issuer to issue Qualifying Warrants in satisfaction of its obligations under this Section 2.06(a).
 
          
(b) Market Disruption Event
          Section 2.06(a) shall not apply, with respect to any Interest Payment Date, if the Issuer shall have provided to the Trustee (which the Trustee will promptly forward upon receipt to each Holder of Debentures) no more than 15 and no less than ten Business Days prior to such Interest Payment Date an Officers' Certificate stating that (i) a Market Disruption Event was existing after the immediately preceding Interest Payment Date and (ii) either (A) the Market Disruption Event continued for the entire period from the Business Day immediately following the preceding Interest Payment Date to the Business Day immediately preceding the date on which such Officers' Certificate is provided or (B) the Market Disruption Event continued for only part of such period, but the Issuer was unable despite using commercially reasonable efforts to raise sufficient Eligible Proceeds during the rest of that period to pay all accrued and unpaid interest.
          
(c) Partial Payment of Deferred Interest
               (i) If the Issuer has raised some but not all Eligible Proceeds necessary to pay all deferred interest on any Interest Payment Date pursuant to this Section 2.06, such Eligible Proceeds shall be applied to pay accrued and unpaid interest on the applicable Interest Payment Date in chronological order based on the date each payment was first deferred, subject to the Common Equity Issuance Cap, the Preferred Shares Issuance Cap and the Share Cap Amount, as applicable, and payment on each installment of deferred interest shall be distributed to Holders of the Debentures on a pro rata basis.
               (ii) If the Issuer has other outstanding Pari Passu Securities under which the Issuer is obligated to sell securities that are Qualifying APM Securities and apply the Eligible Proceeds to the payment of deferred interest or distributions, then on any date and for any period the amount of Eligible Proceeds received by the Issuer from those sales and available for payment of the deferred interest and distributions shall be applied to the Debentures and those other Pari Passu Securities on a pro rata basis up to the Common Equity Issuance Cap or the Preferred Shares Issuance Cap and the Share Cap Amount (or comparable provisions in the instruments governing those other Pari Passu Securities) in proportion to the total amounts that are due on the Debentures and such other Pari Passu Securities.
          
(d) Qualifying Warrants
          If the Issuer sells Qualifying Warrants to pay deferred interest to satisfy its obligations pursuant to this Section 2.06, the Issuer shall use commercially reasonable efforts, subject to the Common Equity Issuance Cap, to set the terms of such Qualifying Warrants so as to raise sufficient proceeds from their issuance to pay all deferred interest on the Debentures in accordance with this Section 2.06.
          
(e) Qualifying APM Securities Definition Change
          The Issuer may, without the consent of any Holders of the Debentures, amend the definition of Qualifying APM Securities in Section 1.01 to eliminate Common Shares or Qualifying Warrants (but not both) and/or Mandatorily Convertible Preferred Shares from the definition of Qualifying APM Securities if, after the date of the first issuance of any Debentures,
 
an accounting standard or interpretive guidance of an existing accounting standard issued by an organization or regulator that has responsibility for establishing or interpreting accounting standards in the United States becomes effective such that there is more than an insubstantial risk that failure to eliminate Common Shares, Qualifying Warrants and/or Mandatorily Convertible Preferred Shares, as the case may be, from the definition would result in a reduction in the Issuer's earnings per share as calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The Issuer shall send written notice to the Trustee (who shall promptly forward such notice to each Holder of the Debentures) in advance of any such change in the definition of Qualifying APM Securities.
Section 2.07. Events of Default
          (a) Solely for purposes of the Debentures, Section 5.1 (other than the last paragraph thereof) of the Indenture shall be deleted and replaced by the following (capitalized terms used in the following text that are not defined in the Indenture but are defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms herein):
SECTION 5.1. .
Events of Default Defined; Acceleration of Maturity; Waiver of Default

     (2) default in the payment of principal on the Debentures when due, whether on the Scheduled Maturity Date or the Final Maturity Date, upon redemption, upon a declaration of acceleration, or otherwise, except that the failure to use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to issue Qualifying Capital Securities pursuant to Section 2.02(a)(iv) shall not constitute an Event of Default; or
     (3) the entry by a court having jurisdiction in the premises of (A) a decree or order for relief in respect of the Issuer in an involuntary case or proceeding under any applicable Federal or State bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar law or (B) a decree or order adjudging the Issuer a bankrupt or insolvent, or approving as properly filed a petition seeking reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or
 
composition of or in respect of the Issuer under any applicable Federal or State law, or appointing a custodian, receiver, liquidator, assignee, trustee, sequestrator or other similar official of the Issuer or of any substantial part of its property, or ordering the winding up or liquidation of its affairs, and the continuance of any such decree or order for relief or any such other decree or order unstayed and in effect for a period of 90 consecutive days; or
     (4) the commencement by the Issuer of a voluntary case or proceeding under any applicable Federal or State bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar law or of any other case or proceeding to be adjudicated a bankrupt or insolvent, or the consent by it to the entry of a decree or order for relief in respect of the Issuer in an involuntary case or proceeding under any applicable Federal or State bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar law or to the commencement of any bankruptcy or insolvency case or proceeding against it, or the filing by it of a petition or answer or consent seeking reorganization or relief under any applicable Federal or State law, or the consent by it to the filing of such petition or to the appointment of or taking possession by a custodian, receiver, liquidator, assignee, trustee, sequestrator or similar official of the Issuer or of any substantial part of its property, or the making by it of an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the admission by it in writing of its inability to pay its debts generally as they become due, or the taking of corporate action by the Issuer in furtherance of any such action.
     If the Issuer gives a timely written notice of its election to commence or continue a Deferral Period on any Interest Payment Date (and, if such notice continues a Deferral Period, the Deferral Period has not continued for ten years), then no "default" or "Event of Default" shall be deemed to arise from the Issuer's non-payment of interest on such Interest Payment Date.
     If the Issuer fails to pay principal on the Debentures on the Scheduled Maturity Date or any subsequent Interest Payment Date as a result of the failure to raise sufficient proceeds from the issuance of Qualifying Capital Securities despite the Issuer's Commercially Reasonable Efforts to do so pursuant to Section 2.02(a)(iv), such failure shall not constitute a "default" or "Event of Default" hereunder.
     When the Trustee incurs expenses or renders services in connection with an Event of Default specified in clauses (3) and (4) set forth in this Section 5.01, the expenses (including the reasonable charges and expenses of its counsel) and the compensation for such services are intended to constitute expenses of administration under any bankruptcy law.
 
     If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default specified in (3) or (4) above) with respect to the Debentures occurs and is continuing, then in every such case the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Debentures may declare the principal amount of all of the Debentures and interest accrued but unpaid thereon, if any, to be due and payable immediately, by a notice in writing to the Issuer (and to the Trustee if given by the Holders), and upon any such declaration, such amount shall become immediately due and payable. If an Event of Default specified in (3) or (4) above occurs, the principal amount of all the Debentures (or, if any Debentures are Original Issue Discount Securities, such portion of the principal amount of such Debentures as may be specified by the terms thereof) shall automatically, and without any declaration or other action on the part of the Trustee or any Holder, become immediately due and payable.
     At any time after such a declaration of acceleration with respect to the Debentures has been made and before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the Trustee as provided in Article Five of the Indenture, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Debentures by written notice to the Issuer and the Trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences if:
     (x) the Issuer has paid or deposited with the Trustee a sum sufficient to pay:
     (A) all Additional Interest on all Debentures,
     (B) the principal of (and premium, if any, on) the Debentures which has become due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration and all interest accrued thereon at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in the Debentures,
     (C) to the extent that payment of such interest is lawful, interest upon overdue interest at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in the Debentures, and
     (D) all sums paid or advanced by the Trustee hereunder and the agreed upon compensation and reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel; and
     (y) all Events of Default with respect to the Debentures, other than the non-payment of the principal of the Debentures which has become due solely by such declaration of acceleration, have been cured or waived as provided under Section 5.10 of the Indenture.
 
     No such rescission shall affect any subsequent Event of Default or impair any right consequent thereon.
          (b) The Trustee shall provide to the Holders of the Debentures such notices as it shall from time to time provide with respect to the Debentures under Section 5.11 of the Indenture. In addition, the Trustee shall provide to the Holders of the Debentures notice of any Event of Default or event that, with the giving of notice or lapse of time, or both, would become an Event of Default with respect to the Debentures within 90 days after the actual knowledge of a Responsible Officer of the Trustee of such Event of Default or other event. However, except in cases of a default or an Event of Default in payment on the Debentures, the Trustee will be protected in withholding the notice if one of its Responsible Officers determines that withholding of the notice is in the interest of such Holders.
          (c) The Issuer's failure to pay interest on the Debentures during a Deferral Period in accordance with Sections 2.05 and 2.06 of this First Supplemental Indenture shall constitute a default under the Indenture, but in no event shall constitute an Event of Default. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Indenture or this First Supplemental Indenture, the Trustee shall have no obligation to exercise any remedies hereunder unless and except to the extent directed in writing to do so by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Debentures in accordance with and subject to the conditions set forth in Section 5.8 of the Indenture. The Trustee may conclusively assume that Sections 2.05 and 2.06 of this First Supplemental Indenture have been complied with unless the Issuer or the Holders of 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Debentures have given the Trustee written notice to the contrary.
          (d) For the avoidance of doubt, and without prejudice to any other remedies that may be available to the Trustee or the Holders of the Debentures under the Indenture, no breach by the Issuer of any covenant or obligation under the Indenture or the terms of the Debentures or the terms of this First Supplemental Indenture, including the Issuer's obligations under Section 2.02(a)(iv), Section 2.05 or Section 2.06, shall be an Event of Default with respect to the Debentures, other than those specified in this Section 2.07; and except as provided herein and in the Indenture with respect to Events of Default, and as provided in Section 2.07(c) above, the Trustee shall be under no duty or obligation to exercise any remedies or otherwise take any action in respect of any other default that may occur under or in respect of this First Supplemental Indenture or the Indenture.
Section 2.08. Securities Registrar; Paying Agent; Delegation of Trustee Duties
          (a) The Issuer appoints the Trustee as Securities Registrar and Paying Agent with respect to the Debentures.
          (b) Notwithstanding any provision contained herein, to the extent permitted by applicable law, the Trustee may delegate its duty to provide such notices and to perform such other duties as may be required to be provided or performed by the Trustee under the Indenture, and, to the extent such obligation has been so delegated, the Trustee shall not be responsible for monitoring the compliance of, nor be liable for the default or misconduct of, any such designee.
 
     Each Holder, by such Holder's acceptance of the Debentures, agrees that if a bankruptcy event of the Issuer shall occur prior to the redemption or repayment of such Debentures, such Holder shall have no claim for, and thus no right to receive, any deferred interest pursuant to Section 2.05 that has not been paid pursuant to Sections 2.05 and 2.06 to the extent the amount of such interest exceeds the sum of (x) interest that relates to the earliest two years of the portion of the Deferral Period for which interest has not been paid and (y) an amount equal to such Holder's pro rata share of the excess, if any, of the Preferred Shares Issuance Cap over the aggregate amount of net proceeds from the sale of Qualifying Non-Cumulative Preferred Shares and unconverted Mandatorily Convertible Preferred Shares that the Issuer has applied to pay deferred interest pursuant to the alternative payment mechanism set forth in Section 2.06; provided that each Holder is deemed to agree that to the extent the claim for deferred interest exceeds the amount set forth in clause (x), the amount it receives in respect of such excess shall not exceed the amount it would have received had the claim for such excess ranked pari passu with the interests of the holders, if any, of Qualifying Non-Cumulative Preferred Shares.
     Solely for the purposes of the Debentures, the text of Section 3.1 of the Indenture following the first sentence thereof shall be deleted and replaced by the following (capitalized terms used in the following text that are not defined in the Indenture but are defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms herein):
     Payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on the Debentures will be made at the Paying Agent office, in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts; provided, however, that at the option of the Issuer payment of interest may be made (i) by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address shall appear in the Securities Register or (ii) by wire transfer in immediately available funds at such place and to such bank account number as may be designated by the Person entitled thereto as specified in the Securities Register in writing not less than ten days before the relevant Interest Payment Date. The office where the Debentures may be presented or surrendered for payment and the office where the Debentures may be surrendered for transfer or exchange and where notices and demands to or upon the Issuer in respect of the Debentures and the Indenture may be served shall be the Paying Agent office.
     The Debentures shall not be subject to any sinking fund or analogous provisions.
 
Section 2.12. Subordination
     The subordination provisions of Article Thirteen of the Indenture shall apply to the Debentures.
Section 2.13. Defeasance
     The provisions of Section 10.1(B) of the Indenture (relating to discharge of the Indenture) shall apply to the Debentures.
Section 3.01. Dividend and Other Payment Stoppages
     So long as any Debentures remain outstanding, if the Issuer has given notice of its election to defer interest payments on the Debentures but the related Deferral Period has not yet commenced or a Deferral Period is continuing, the Issuer shall not, and shall not permit any Subsidiary to:
          (a) declare or pay any dividends or other distributions on, or redeem, purchase, acquire or make a liquidation payment with respect to, any shares of capital stock of the Issuer;
          (b) make any payment of principal of, or interest or premium, if any, on, or repay, purchase or redeem any of the Issuer's debt securities that rank upon the Issuer's liquidation on a parity with or junior to the Debentures; or
          (c) make any guarantee payments regarding any guarantee issued by the Issuer of securities of any Subsidiary if the guarantee ranks upon the Issuer's liquidation on a parity with or junior to the Debentures;
, , the restrictions in clauses (a), (b) and (c) above do not apply to:
provided
however

     (A) any employment contract, benefit plan or other similar arrangement with or for the benefit of any one or more of its employees, officers, directors, consultants or independent contractors;
     (B) the satisfaction of the Issuer's obligations pursuant to any contract entered into in the ordinary course of business prior to the beginning of the applicable Deferral Period;
     (C) a dividend reinvestment or shareholder purchase plan; or
 
     (D) the issuance of shares of the Issuer's capital stock, or securities convertible into or exercisable for such shares, as consideration in an acquisition transaction, the definitive agreement for which is entered into prior to the applicable Deferral Period;
               (ii) any exchange, redemption or conversion of any class or series of the Issuer's capital stock, or shares of the capital stock of one of its Subsidiaries, for any other class or series of the Issuer's capital stock, or of any class or series of the Issuer's indebtedness for any class or series of the Issuer's capital stock;
               (iii) any purchase of fractional interests in shares of the Issuer's capital stock pursuant to the conversion or exchange provisions of such shares or the securities being converted or exchanged;
               (iv) any declaration of a dividend in connection with any shareholder rights plan, or the issuance of rights, stock or other property under any shareholder rights plan, or the redemption or purchase of rights pursuant thereto; or
               (v) any dividend in the form of stock, warrants, options or other rights where the dividend stock issuable upon exercise of such warrants, options or other rights is the same stock as that on which the dividend is being paid or ranks equally with or junior to such stock;
               (vi) (A) any payment of current or deferred interest on Pari Passu Securities that is made pro rata to the amounts due on such Pari Passu Securities; provided that such payments are made in accordance with Section 2.06(c)(ii) to the extent it applies, and (B) any payments of principal or current or deferred interest on Pari Passu Securities that, if not made, would cause the Issuer to breach the terms of the instrument governing such Pari Passu Securities; or
               (vii) any payment of principal in respect of Pari Passu Securities having the same scheduled maturity date as the Debentures, as required under a provision of such other Pari Passu Securities that is substantially the same as the provisions in Section 2.02(a), and that is made on a pro rata basis among one or more series of Pari Passu Securities having such a provision and the Debentures.
Section 3.02. Additional Limitation on Deferral Over One Year
     If any Deferral Period lasts longer than one year, the Issuer may not redeem or purchase any securities of the Issuer that on the Issuer's bankruptcy or liquidation rank pari passu with or junior to any of its Qualifying APM Securities the proceeds of which were applied, pursuant to Section 2.06, to fund deferred interest on the Debentures during the relevant Deferral Period until the first anniversary of the date on which all deferred interest on the Debentures has been paid. However, if the Issuer is involved in a Business Combination where immediately after its consummation more than 50% of the voting shares of the surviving entity of such Business Combination, or the Person to whom all or substantially all of the Issuer's properties or assets are conveyed, transferred or leased in such Business Combination, is owned, directly or indirectly, by the shareholders of the other party to such Business Combination, then the immediately

In addition, the Issuer may not redeem the Debentures in part unless all accrued and unpaid interest, including deferred interest, has been paid in full on all Outstanding Debentures for all Interest Periods terminating on or before the Redemption Date.
Section 5.01. Repayments
     The Issuer, not more than 15 nor less than ten Business Days prior to each Repayment Date (unless a shorter notice shall be satisfactory to the Trustee), shall notify the Trustee of the principal amount of Debentures to be repaid on such date pursuant to Section 2.02(a).
Section 5.02. Selection of the Debentures to be Repaid
     If less than all the Debentures are to be repaid on any Repayment Date (unless the Debentures are issued in the form of a Global Security), the particular Debentures to be repaid shall be selected not more than 60 days prior to such Repayment Date by the Trustee, from the Outstanding Debentures not previously repaid or called for redemption, by such method as then may be required by law or if no such legal requirement shall then exist, by lot or such other
 
method as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate and which may provide for the selection for redemption of a portion of the principal amount of any Debentures, that the portion of the principal amount of any Debentures not repaid shall be in an authorized denomination (which shall not be less than the minimum authorized denomination).
provided
     The Trustee shall promptly notify the Issuer in writing of the Debentures selected for partial repayment and the principal amount thereof to be repaid. For all purposes hereof, unless the context otherwise requires, all provisions relating to the repayment of Debentures shall relate, in the case of any Debentures repaid or to be repaid only in part, to the portion of the principal amount of such Debentures which has been or is to be repaid.
Section 5.03. Notice of Repayment
     Notice of repayment shall be given by first-class mail, postage prepaid, mailed not earlier than the 60th day, and not later than the 30 day, prior to the Repayment Date, to each Holder of Debentures to be repaid, at the address of such Holder as it appears in the Security Register.

The notice, if mailed in the manner herein provided, shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the Holders receive such notice. In any case, a failure to give such notice by mail or any defect in the notice to any Holder of any Debentures designated for repayment as a whole or in part shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the repayment of any other Debentures.
Section 5.04. Deposit of Repayment Amount
     Prior to 11:00 a.m. New York City time on the Repayment Date specified in the notice of repayment given as provided in Section 5.03, the Issuer will deposit with the Trustee or with one or more Paying Agents (or if the Issuer is acting as its own Paying Agent, the Issuer will segregate and hold in trust as provided in Section 3.4 of the Indenture) an amount of money, in

On surrender of such Debentures at a place of payment in said notice specified, the said Debentures or the specified portions thereof shall be paid by the Issuer at their principal amount, together with accrued interest to but excluding the Repayment Date; that, except in the case of a repayment in full of all Outstanding Debentures, installments of interest due on or prior to the Repayment Date will be payable to the Holders of such Debentures, registered as such at the close of business on the relevant Regular Record Dates according to their terms and the provisions of Section 3.1 of the Indenture.
provided
     Upon surrender of any Debentures repaid in part only, the Issuer shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and make available for delivery to the Holders thereof, at the expense of the Issuer, a new Debenture, of authorized denominations, in aggregate principal amount equal to the portion of the Debentures not repaid and so presented and having the same Scheduled Maturity Date and other terms. If a Global Security is so surrendered, such new Debentures will be a new Global Security.
     If any Debentures required to be repaid shall not be so repaid upon surrender thereof, the principal of such Debentures shall bear interest from the applicable Repayment Date until paid at the rate prescribed therefor in the Debentures.
Section 6.01. Calculation of Original Issue Discount
     If during any calendar year any original issue discount shall have accrued on the Debentures, the Issuer shall file with each Paying Agent (including the Trustee if it is a Paying Agent) promptly at the end of each calendar year (a) a written notice specifying the amount of original issue discount (including daily rates and accrual periods) accrued on Outstanding Securities as of the end of such year and (b) such other specific information relating to such original issue discount as may then be relevant under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended from time to time.

     The Issuer further promises to pay interest on said principal sum from and including June 21, 2007, or from and including the most recent Interest Payment Date on which interest has been paid or duly provided for, until the principal thereof is paid or made available for payment semi-annually (subject to deferral as set forth herein) in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year, commencing on December 15, 2007 and ending on June 15, 2017, at the rate of 6.70% per annum (computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months), and thereafter to pay interest on said outstanding principal sum quarterly in arrears on March 15, June 15, September 15, and December 15 of each year, commencing on September 15, 2017 at a floating annual rate equal to Three-Month LIBOR (as defined in the First Supplemental Indenture) plus 2.0175% (computed on the basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of days elapsed in the 360-day year). Accrued interest that is not paid on the
 
applicable Interest Payment Date, including interest deferred pursuant to Section 2.05 of the First Supplemental Indenture, will bear Additional Interest, to the extent permitted by law, at the interest rate in effect from time to time provided in Section 2.04(a) of the First Supplemental Indenture, from the relevant Interest Payment Date, compounded on each subsequent Interest Payment Date.
     In the event that any Semi-Annual Interest Payment Date on which interest is payable on this Security is not a Business Day, then payment of the interest payable on such date will be made on the immediately succeeding day that is a Business Day (and, in the case of payments on or prior to June 15, 2017, without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay) with the same force and effect as if made on the date the payment was originally payable. In the event that any Quarterly Interest Payment Date on which interest is payable on this Security is not a Business Day, then payment of the interest payable on such date shall be postponed to the immediately succeeding day that is a Business Day, that if such Business Day is in the immediately succeeding calendar month, such Interest Payment Date shall be the immediately preceding Business Day, and interest will accrue to but excluding the date on which the interest is actually paid.
