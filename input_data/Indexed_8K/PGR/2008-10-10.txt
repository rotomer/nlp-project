Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On October 10, 2008, The Progressive Corporation issued a news release containing financial results for the Company and its subsidiaries for the month of, and year-to-date period ended, September 2008 and selected quarterly financial results. A copy of the news release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.
Item 2.06 Material Impairments.
On October 7, 2008, the Company decided to write down $1,100.9 million in securities that were determined to have had an "other-than-temporary" decline in market value as of September 30, 2008. These determinations primarily reflect the market-related issues associated with the disruption in the mortgage and other credit markets, which created a significant deterioration in both the valuation of the securities as well as our view of near term recoverability of the valuation decline. This write-down included: (i) $1,033.9 million of preferred stocks, or 35% of the total preferred stock at cost; (ii) $43.8 million of corporate debt on American General and American General Finance, which are wholly-owned subsidiaries of American International Group; (iii) $14.5 million of structured debt securities; and (iv) $8.7 million of common stocks. The Company does not anticipate that these impairment charges will result in future cash expenditures by the Company.
When a security has an unrealized loss in fair value that is deemed to be other-than-temporary, the Company reduces the book value of the security to its current market value, recognizing the decline as a realized loss in the income statement. For additional information, see the comments on pages 8 through 10 of the Company's Press Release attached hereto as Exhibit 99. An additional discussion of the Company's "Critical Accounting Policy: Other-than-Temporary Impairment" can be found in included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007.

Operating Results
 
 
 
Investment Results
 
 
 
 
1
Includes $1,310.9 million of redeemable preferred stocks and $529.6 million of nonredeemable preferred stocks.
2
Fair value includes $22.1 million of net unrealized losses not written down in September, which are reflected in other comprehensive income as part of shareholders' equity.
3
The 36 issuers are in the following sectors: Financial-55%; Agency-0%; Industrial-33%; and Utility-12%.
na = not applicable
 
 
 
 
 
Since we maintain an available-for-sale portfolio, changes in the fair value of our securities are reflected as unrealized gains (losses) in accumulated other comprehensive income on a monthly basis. As a result, a portion of the write-downs recognized in net income in September had previously been recognized in other comprehensive income, and did not have a further impact on our shareholders' equity, book value or investment total return. Therefore, only the net $764.0 million change during the month impacted shareholders' equity, book value or total return.

Safe Harbor Statement Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995: Statements in this release that are not historical fact are forward-looking statements that are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events and results to differ materially from those discussed herein. These risks and uncertainties include, without limitation, uncertainties related to estimates, assumptions and projections generally; inflation and changes in economic conditions (including changes in interest rates and financial markets); the financial condition of, and other issues relating to the strength of and liquidity available to, issuers of securities held in our investment portfolios; the accuracy and adequacy of our pricing and loss reserving methodologies; the competitiveness of our pricing and the effectiveness of our initiatives to retain more customers; initiatives by competitors and the effectiveness of our response; our ability to obtain regulatory approval for requested rate changes and the timing thereof; the effectiveness of our brand strategy and advertising campaigns relative to those of competitors; legislative and regulatory developments; disputes relating to intellectual property rights; the outcome of litigation pending or that may be filed against us; weather conditions (including the severity and frequency of storms, hurricanes, snowfalls, hail and winter conditions); changes in driving patterns and loss trends; acts of war and terrorist activities; our ability to maintain the uninterrupted operation of our facilities, systems (including information technology systems) and business functions; court decisions and trends in litigation and health care and auto repair costs; and other matters described from time to time in our releases and publications, and in our periodic reports and other documents filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, investors should be aware that generally accepted accounting principles prescribe when a company may reserve for particular risks, including litigation exposures. Accordingly, results for a given reporting period could be significantly affected if and when a reserve is established for one or more contingencies. Also, our regular reserve reviews may result in adjustments of varying magnitude as additional information regarding pending loss and loss adjustment expense reserves becomes known. Reported results, therefore, may be volatile in certain accounting periods.
