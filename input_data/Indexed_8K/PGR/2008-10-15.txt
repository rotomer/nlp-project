On October 15, 2008, The Progressive Corporation issued a press release correcting a footnote originally included in its earnings release issued on October 10, 2008. The October 15 press release included the following:
On page 9 of the release, footnote 1 to the table should have stated: "Includes $1,310.9 million of nonredeemable preferred stocks and $529.6 million of redeemable preferred stocks." In the original release, the redeemable and nonredeemable preferred stock amounts had been reversed. All amounts disclosed in the corresponding table, as well as in the condensed balance sheet on page 6 of the release, are correct as originally stated.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
Dated: October 15, 2008
