(e) On March 8, 2010, the Executive Committee of the Board of Directors of The Progressive Corporation (the "Company") approved the Second Amendment to The Progressive Corporation 2010 Equity Incentive Plan (the "Plan"), which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1. The Second Amendment modifies the Plan to provide that a buy out of outstanding stock options or stock appreciation rights may not occur if the exercise price for the applicable award is higher than the fair market value of the Company's stock on the date of the transaction. The Plan, including the modifications made by the Second Amendment, remains subject to shareholder approval at our Annual Meeting of Shareholders in April 2010. Accordingly, our 2010 Proxy Statement will include a detailed summary of the Plan provisions, as amended.

Exhibit 10.1
WHEREAS, The Progressive Corporation 2010 Equity Incentive Plan, as previously amended (the "Plan") has been approved by the Board of Directors and will be submitted to shareholders for approval at the Company's upcoming Annual Meeting of Shareholders; and
WHEREAS, it is deemed desirable to amend the Plan;
NOW, THEREFORE, the Plan is hereby amended as follows:
 
(d) The Company, based on such terms and conditions as may be approved by the Committee in its discretion, at any time may buy out, for a payment in cash, any Option previously granted, based on such terms and conditions as the Committee shall establish and agree upon with the Participant, provided that: (i) no such buy out shall be permitted if the Option Exercise Price of the applicable Option is higher than the Fair Market Value of the Stock on the date of such transaction; and (ii) no such transaction involving a Section 16 Participant shall be structured or effected in a manner that would violate, or result in any liability on the part of the Participant under, Section 16 of the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.
Buyout Provisions.
 
(vi) Unless varied by the Committee, Stock Appreciation Rights shall be subject to the terms and conditions specified for Stock Options in Sections 8(b)(vi) and (vii), and 8(d), except that: (A) a buy out shall not be permitted if the exercise price applicable to such Stock Appreciation Right is higher than the Fair Market Value of the Stock on the date of such transaction; and (B) the terms and conditions applicable to any Stock Appreciation Right held by a Section 16 Participant shall not be varied in a manner that would cause the exercise or cancellation of such Stock Appreciation Right to fail to qualify for any applicable exemption from Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act provided by Rule 16b-3 thereunder.
