Exhibit 99
 
 
 
 
 
MAYFIELD VILLAGE, OHIO  June 10, 2010  The Progressive Corporation ("Progressive" or the "Company") today announced that it has commenced a solicitation of consents (the "Consent Solicitation") from holders of record on June 9, 2010 of its 6.25% Senior Notes due 2032 (the "Notes") to terminate the Replacement Capital Covenant (the "RCC") relating to the Notes. The RCC was granted by Progressive in June 2007 to the holders of the Notes in connection with the Company's issuance of its 6.70% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2067 (the "Debentures"). The proposed termination of the RCC requires the consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes. The termination of the RCC is a condition to the completion of the Tender Offer, discussed below. The complete terms and conditions of the Consent Solicitation are as set forth in the Company's Consent Solicitation Statement dated June 10, 2010 (the "Statement") and the related Letter of Consent, to be distributed to holders of the Notes for their consideration. Holders are urged to read the Statement and Letter of Consent carefully.
The Consent Solicitation will expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on Wednesday, June 23, 2010, unless extended or earlier terminated by the Company (the "Consent Expiration Time"). If the Company receives the consent of holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes, holders who validly deliver and do not validly revoke their consent in the manner described in the Statement by the Consent Expiration Time will be eligible to receive a consent fee of $5.00 for each $1,000 principal amount of Notes for which their consent has been delivered. Consents that have been validly delivered may be validly revoked until, but not after, the Consent Expiration Time. If the proposed termination of the RCC is approved, the termination will be binding on all holders of the Notes, including those that did not deliver their consent, and only holders validly delivering their consent will receive the consent fee.
Progressive also announced today that it has commenced an offer to purchase for cash (the "Tender Offer") up to $350 million in aggregate principal amount of the Debentures. The aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Debentures is currently $1 billion. The complete terms and conditions of the Tender Offer are set forth in the Company's Offer to Purchase dated June 10, 2010 and the related Letter of Transmittal, to be distributed to holders of the Debentures for their consideration. Holders are urged to read the Offer to Purchase and Letter of Transmittal carefully. The Tender Offer is not contingent on any minimum amount of Debentures being tendered, but it is contingent on our obtaining the consent of holders of the Notes to the termination of the RCC, among other conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase. The Company plans to fund the Tender Offer with cash on hand.
Holders who validly tender and do not validly withdraw their Debentures in accordance with the terms of the Offer to Purchase will be eligible to receive the following consideration, as applicable:
 
 
No tenders may be withdrawn after 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on Wednesday, June 23, 2010, except in limited circumstances described in the Offer to Purchase. All holders whose Debentures are tendered and accepted for payment will also receive accrued and unpaid interest up to but not including the settlement date of the Tender Offer.
The Tender Offer will expire at 11:59 p.m. on Thursday, July 8, 2010, unless extended or earlier terminated by the Company (the "Tender Expiration Date"). The Company reserves the right to increase the maximum amount of Debentures that may be repurchased under the Tender Offer. If the amount of Debentures validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or prior to the Tender Expiration Date exceeds $350 million (or an increased maximum amount selected by the Company), the Company will accept for payment Debentures up to the maximum amount on a pro rata basis from among the validly tendered Debentures.
