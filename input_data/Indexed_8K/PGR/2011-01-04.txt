Effective December 31, 2010, The Progressive Corporation (the "Company") entered into Amendment No. 2 ("Amendment No. 2") to its 364-Day Secured Liquidity Credit Facility Agreement (as previously amended, the "Credit Agreement") with PNC Bank, National Association ("PNC"). The Credit Agreement provides the Company with a line of credit in the principal amount of $125 million (which amount may be increased at the Company's request, but subject to PNC's discretion, up to a maximum aggregate principal amount of $150 million) (the "Line of Credit"), secured by certain assets of the Company. The Line of Credit has been established to provide the Company with access to funds in the event of a disruption in the Company's normal cash management or treasury operations, or in any of the systems or facilities that support such operations, including a disruption in the country's or the world's financial markets. No borrowings have been made on the line of credit since its inception on December 31, 2008.
Pursuant to Amendment No. 2, among other matters:
