(viii) The statements set forth in the Prospectus under the captions "Description of Notes" and "Description of Debt Securities" and in the Pricing Disclosure Package under the captions "Description of Notes" and "Description of Debt Securities", when taken together with the information in the final term sheet comprising a part of the Pricing Disclosure Package, insofar as they purport to constitute a summary of the terms of the Notes, and the statements set forth in the Prospectus under the caption "Certain United States Federal Income Tax Consequences", insofar as they purport to describe the provisions of the laws and documents referred to therein, are fair summaries thereof;

(xii) Although they do not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, except for those referred to in the opinion in subsection (viii) of this Section 8(c), such counsel has no reason to believe that (i) the Registration Statement or any further amendment thereto made by the Company prior to the Time of Delivery (other than the financial statements and related schedules or other financial or statistical information contained or incorporated by reference therein, as to which such counsel need express no opinion), when such part or amendment became effective, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; (ii) the Pricing Disclosure Package (other than the financial statements and related schedules or other financial or statistical information contained or incorporated by reference therein, as to which such counsel need express no opinion), as of the Applicable Time, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; or (iii) as of its date and as of the Time of Delivery, the Prospectus or any further amendment or supplement thereto made by the Company prior to the Time of Delivery (other than the financial statements and related schedules or other financial or statistical information contained or incorporated by reference therein, as to which such counsel need express no opinion) contained or contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact

(ii) the issue and sale of the Notes and the compliance by the Company with all of the provisions of the Notes and the Indenture and this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions herein and therein contemplated will not conflict with or result in a breach or violation of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under, any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement or other agreement or instrument known to such counsel to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is bound or to which any of the property or assets of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is subject other than as would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole; and

Prospectus, and (ii) since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Pricing Prospectus there shall not have been any change in the capital stock (other than as a result of share repurchases authorized by the Company's board of directors in amount that does not exceed the amount that would enable the Company to rely upon the safe harbor provisions of Rule 10b-18 promulgated under the Exchange Act (without giving effect to the carve out set forth in subsection (b)(4) of Rule 10b-18 in relation to weekly block purchases)) or long term debt of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the business, financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Pricing Prospectus, the effect of which, in any such case described in clause (i) or (ii), is in the judgment of the Underwriter so material and adverse as to make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Notes on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus;
(g) On or after the Applicable Time (i) no downgrading shall have occurred in the rating accorded the Company's debt securities by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization", as that term is defined by the Commission for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Act, and (ii) no such organization shall have publicly announced that it has under surveillance or review, and noting an intended or possible decrease in its rating of any of the Company's debt securities;

(i) The Company shall have complied with the provisions of Section 5(e) hereof with respect to the furnishing of prospectuses on the New York Business Day next succeeding the date of this Agreement; and

9. (a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless the Underwriter against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Underwriter may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a
 
material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any "issuer information" filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Act, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse the Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by the Underwriter expressly for use therein.
(b) The Underwriter will indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus or any such amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by the Underwriter expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred.
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any such action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure to so notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve such indemnifying party from any liability hereunder except to the extent that the indemnifying party is prejudiced as a result thereof and in any event shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of this Section 9. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for
 
any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable out-of-pocket costs of investigation. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 9 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriter on the other from the offering of the Notes. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above (unless the failure to give such notice does not materially prejudice the indemnifying party), then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits received, but also the relative fault of, the Company on the one hand and the Underwriter on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriter on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriter, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriter on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriter agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriter were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), the Underwriter shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Notes underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which the Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No
 
person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
(e) The obligations of the Company under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls the Underwriter within the meaning of the Act and each broker-dealer affiliate of the Underwriter; and the obligations of the Underwriter under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the Underwriter may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act.
10. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the Underwriter, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of the Underwriter or any controlling person of the Underwriter, or the Company, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Notes.
11. If for any reason other than a default by the Underwriter in its obligation to purchase the Notes hereunder the Notes are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein, the Company will reimburse the Underwriter for all reasonable out of pocket expenses approved in writing by the Underwriter, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriter in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of the Notes, but the Company shall then be under no further liability to the Underwriter except as provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof.
12. All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing, and if to the Underwriter shall be delivered or sent by mail to Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, Eleven Madison Avenue, New York, New York 10010-3629, Attention: LCD-IBD, with a copy to Sidley Austin LLP, 787 Seventh Avenue, New York, New York 10019, Attention: Robert Mandell; and if to the Company shall be sent by mail to the address of the Company set forth in the Registration Statement, Attention: Secretary. Any such statements, requests, notices or agreements shall take effect upon receipt thereof.
13. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure solely to the benefit of, the Underwriter, the Company and, to the extent provided in Sections 9 and 10 hereof, the officers and directors of the Company and each person who controls the Company or the Underwriter, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Agreement. No purchaser of any of the Notes from the Underwriter shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase.
14. Time shall be of the essence of this Agreement.
15. The Company acknowledges and agrees that (i) the purchase and sale of the Notes pursuant to this Agreement is an arm's-length commercial transaction between the Company, on
 
the one hand, and the Underwriter, on the other, (ii) in connection therewith and with the process leading to such transaction the Underwriter is acting solely as a principal and not the agent or fiduciary of the Company, (iii) the Underwriter has not assumed an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in favor of the Company with respect to the offering contemplated hereby or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether such Underwriter has advised or is currently advising the Company on other matters) or any other obligation to the Company except the obligations expressly set forth in this Agreement and (iv) the Company has consulted its own legal and financial advisors to the extent it deemed appropriate. The Company agrees that it will not claim that the Underwriter has rendered advisory services of any nature or respect, or owes a fiduciary or similar duty to the Company, in connection with such transaction or the process leading thereto.
16. This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings (whether written or oral) between the Company and the Underwriter with respect to the subject matter hereof.
17.
This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.
18. The Company and the Underwriter hereby irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any and all right to trial by jury in any legal proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.
19. This Agreement may be executed by any one or more of the parties hereto in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all such respective counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument.
20. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company is authorized to disclose to any persons the U.S. federal and state income tax treatment and tax structure of the potential transaction and all materials of any kind (including tax opinions and other tax analyses) provided to the Company relating to that treatment and structure, without the Underwriter imposing any limitation of any kind. However, any information relating to the tax treatment and tax structure shall remain confidential (and the foregoing sentence shall not apply) to the extent necessary to enable any person to comply with securities laws. For this purpose, "tax structure" is limited to any facts that may be relevant to that treatment.
 
If the foregoing is in accordance with your understanding, please sign and return to us counterparts hereof, and upon the acceptance hereof by the Underwriter, this letter and such acceptance hereof shall constitute a binding agreement between the Underwriter and the Company.

Reference is made to the further provisions of this Note set forth on the reverse hereof. Such further provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as though fully set forth at this place.
This Note shall not be valid or become obligatory for any purpose until the certificate of authentication hereon shall have been signed by the Trustee under the Indenture referred to on the reverse hereof.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, The Progressive Corporation has caused this instrument to be signed by its duly authorized officers and has caused its corporate seal to be affixed hereto or imprinted hereon.
 
 
Dated: August 22, 2011
This is one of the Securities, of the series designated herein, referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.
 
This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of debentures, notes, bonds or other evidences of indebtedness of the Issuer (hereinafter called the "Securities") of the series hereinafter specified, all issued or to be issued under and pursuant to an indenture dated as of September 15, 1993, as heretofore supplemented and amended (herein called the "Indenture"), between the Issuer and U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee"), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a description of the rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and immunities thereunder of the Trustee, the Issuer and the Holders of the Securities. The Securities may be issued in one or more series, which different series may be issued in various aggregate principal amounts, may mature at different times, may bear interest (if any) at different rates, may be subject to different redemption provisions (if any), may be subject to different sinking, purchase or analogous funds (if any) and may otherwise vary as in the Indenture provided. This Security is one of a series designated as the "3.75% Senior Notes due 2021" of the Issuer (herein called the "Notes") initially limited in aggregate principal amount to $500,000,000. The Issuer may, without the consent of Holders, increase the principal amount of the Notes in the future by issuing additional Notes on the same terms and conditions and with the same CUSIP Number(s) as the Notes.
If any Interest Payment Date or the Maturity Date or any earlier Redemption Date falls on any date that is not a Business Day, then the related payment will be made on the next succeeding Business Day, without any interest or other additional payment in respect of the delay. "Business Day" means any day, other than a Saturday or Sunday, that is not a day on which banking institutions or trust companies are generally authorized or required by law, regulation or executive order to close in The City of New York.
In case an Event of Default, as defined in the Indenture, with respect to the Notes shall have occurred and be continuing, the principal hereof may be declared, and upon such declaration shall become, due and payable, in the manner, with the effect and subject to the conditions provided in the Indenture.
The Indenture contains provisions permitting the Issuer and the Trustee, with the consent of the Holders of not less than 66-2/3% in aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding (as defined in the Indenture) of all series to be affected (voting as one class), evidenced as in the Indenture provided, to execute supplemental
indentures adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of the Indenture or of any supplemental indenture or modifying in any manner the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each such series; provided, however, that no such supplemental indenture shall, among other things, (i) extend the final maturity of any Security, or reduce the principal amount thereof, or reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of any interest thereon, or impair or affect the rights of any Holder to institute suit for the payment thereof, without the consent of the Holder of each Security so affected or (ii) reduce the aforesaid percentage of Securities, the Holders of which are required to consent to any such supplemental indenture, without the consent of the Holder of each Security so affected. It is also provided in the Indenture that, with respect to certain defaults or Events of Default regarding the Securities of any series, prior to any declaration accelerating the maturity of such Securities, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount Outstanding of the Securities of such series may on behalf of the Holders of all the Securities of such series waive any such past default or Event of Default and its consequences. The preceding sentence shall not, however, apply to a default in the payment of the principal of or premium, if any, or interest on any of the Securities. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note (unless revoked as provided in the Indenture) shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders and owners of this Note and any Note which may be issued in exchange or substitution herefor, irrespective of whether or not any notation thereof is made upon this Note or such other Note.
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Issuer, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Note in the manner, at the respective times, at the rate and in the coin or currency herein prescribed.
The Notes are issuable in registered form without coupons in minimum denominations of $2,000 and any integral multiple of $1,000 at the office or agency of the Issuer at the office of the Trustee in Boston, Massachusetts, and in the manner and subject to the limitations provided in the Indenture, but without the payment of any service charge. Notes may be exchanged for a like aggregate principal amount of Notes of other authorized denominations.
The Notes are subject to redemption upon not more than 60 or less than 30 days' notice by mail, in whole at any time or in part from time to time at the option of the Issuer on any date (a "Redemption Date"), at a redemption price equal to the accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount being redeemed to the redemption date plus the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed and (ii) the sum of the present values of the Remaining Scheduled Payments (as defined below) of the Notes to be redeemed, discounted to the redemption date, on a semiannual basis
(assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months), at rate equal to the Treasury Rate (defined below), plus 30 basis points.
"Remaining Scheduled Payments" means, with respect to any redemption, the remaining scheduled payments of the principal and interest, exclusive of interest accrued to the Redemption Date, that would be due after the Redemption Date of the Notes to be redeemed assuming such Notes were not redeemed and were held until the Maturity Date.
"Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any redemption, an annual rate equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue (as defined below), assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for the Redemption Date.
"Comparable Treasury Issue" means, with respect to any redemption, the United States Treasury security selected by an Independent Investment Banker as having an actual or interpolated maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Notes to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of such Notes.
"Independent Investment Banker" means one of the Reference Treasury Dealers selected by the Issuer.
"Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any redemption, (i) the average of three Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations (as defined below) obtained by the Trustee for the Redemption Date after excluding the highest and lowest of five Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations obtained or (ii) if the Trustee obtains fewer than five Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations obtained.
"Reference Treasury Dealer" means, with respect to any redemption, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC or any of its affiliates (so long as it is and continues to be a primary U.S. Government securities dealer in The City of New York) and any four other primary U.S. Government securities dealers in The City of New York chosen by the Issuer. If any of the foregoing ceases to be a primary U.S. Government securities dealer in The City of New York, the Issuer will appoint in its place another nationally recognized investment banking firm that is a primary U.S. Government securities dealer in The City of New York.
"Reference Treasury Dealer Quotation" means, with respect to any redemption, the average, as determined by the Trustee, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable
Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Trustee by a Reference Treasury Dealer at 3:30 p.m., New York City time, on the third business day preceding the Redemption Date.
In the event of redemption of this Note in part only, a new Note or Notes of this series and of like tenor for the unredeemed portion hereof will be issued in the name of the Holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof.
Upon due presentment for registration of transfer of this Note at the office or agency of the Issuer at the office of the Trustee in Boston, Massachusetts, a new Note or Notes of authorized denominations for an equal aggregate principal amount will be issued to the transferee in exchange therefor, subject to the limitations provided in the Indenture, without charge except for any tax or other governmental charge imposed in connection therewith.
The Issuer, the Trustee and any authorized agent of the Issuer or the Trustee may deem and treat the registered Holder hereof as the absolute owner of this Note (whether or not this Note shall be overdue and notwithstanding any notation of ownership or other writing hereon), for the purpose of receiving payment of, or on account of, the principal hereof and, subject to the provisions on the face hereof, interest hereon, and for all other purposes, and neither the Issuer nor the Trustee nor any authorized agent of the Issuer or the Trustee shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
No recourse under or upon any obligation, covenant or agreement of the Issuer in the Indenture or any indenture supplemental thereto or in any Note, or because of the creation of any indebtedness represented thereby, shall be had against any incorporator, shareholder, officer or director, as such, of the Issuer or of any successor corporation, either directly or through the Issuer or any successor corporation, under any rule of law, statute or constitutional provision or by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding or otherwise, all such liability being expressly waived and released by the acceptance hereof and as part of the consideration for the issue hereof.
Terms used herein which are defined in the Indenture shall have the respective meanings assigned thereto in the Indenture.
