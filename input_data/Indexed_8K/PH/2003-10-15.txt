Exhibit 99.1
 
 
PARKER EARNS 48 CENTS FOR THE QUARTER WITH IMPROVING TREND IN OPERATING MARGINS
 
Cleveland, Ohio: October 15, 2003Parker Hannifin Corporation (NYSE: PH) today reported net income for the fiscal first quarter ended September 30, 2003 of $56.7 million, or 48 cents per diluted share, compared with last year's quarterly net income of $61 million, or 52 cents per diluted share. Quarterly sales remained flat at $1.59 billion, reflecting a favorable currency effect which offset lower unit volume. Realignment costs reduced earnings by four cents per diluted share this year, and one cent per diluted share last year.
 
Operating Results
 
With no recovery in industrial, mobile and aerospace demand, few of the company's operating units recorded year-over-year growth, yet all marked sequential improvements in operating margin.
 
"Our hard work is steadily paying off," said Parker CEO Don Washkewicz. "We have yet to see a sustained positive trend in order rates. We're implementing the Win Strategy throughout the company to build long-term earning power and enhanced cash flows from operations. Division by division, it is working. "
 
In the North American Industrial units, first-quarter operating income was $46.6 million on $685.3 million in sales, for an operating margin of 6.8 percent.
 
In the International Industrial businesses, first-quarter operating income was $31.3 million on sales of $422.1 million, for an operating margin of 7.4 percent.
 
In the company's Climate & Industrial Controls unit (previously included in the "Other" category), first-quarter operating income was $17.5 million on sales of $156 million, for an operating margin of 11.2 percent.
 
Parker Aerospace generated first-quarter operating income of $34 million on sales of $266.8 million, for an operating margin of 12.7 percent.
 
In the "Other" segment, comprised of Wynn Specialty Chemicals and Astron metal buildings, quarterly operating income was $5.7 million on $56.7 million in sales, for an operating margin of 10.1 percent.
 
The company posted another strong quarter of cash generated from operations. "We're extremely focused on consistent margin improvement and sustaining robust cash flow to invest in growth. This year, we're using new incentives to strengthen organic growth in high potential markets, which we believe will advance the quality of our earnings in the future," said Washkewicz.
 
Outlook
 
Noting no change in its fiscal-year 2004 outlook, the company said it expects sales to grow marginally, while further improvement in year-over-year operating margins is expected for every segment except Aerospace. For the purpose of planning, Parker assumed no economic recovery during the year, but noted that the company's international results were bolstered by increasing demand in Asia and Latin America.
 
In addition to the information provided herein, Parker advises shareholders to note order trends, for which the company makes a disclosure several business days after the conclusion of each month. This information is available on the company's investor information web site, at .

This presentation reconciles sales amounts reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP to sales amounts adjusted to remove the effects of acquisitions and divestitures made within the prior four quarters as well as the effects of currency exchange rates on sales.  The effects of acquisitions and divestitures and currency exchange rates are removed to allow investors and the company to meaningfully evaluate changes in sales on a comparable basis from period to period.
