PARKER'S FISCAL Q2 NET INCOME UP 49 PERCENT; CASH FLOW REMAINS STRONG
 
Cleveland, Ohio: January 20, 2004  Parker Hannifin Corporation (NYSE: PH) today reported a 49-percent increase in fiscal second-quarter net income to $55.8 million, or 47 cents per diluted share, on sales of $1.62 billion for the period ended December 31, 2003. For the same period last year, the company reported quarterly net income of $37.6 million, or 32 cents per diluted share on sales of $1.52 billion.
 
"This quarter's results come from improved volume, combined with solid operating performance as we see the benefits from our strategic financial performance initiatives," said Parker CEO Don Washkewicz. "All of the company's operating segments recorded year-over-year margin improvement except Aerospace, which still achieved a double-digit operating margin."
 
Leading the gain was the North American Industrial segment, which improved operating margin to 7.5 percent on a five percent increase in sales. The company noted improved strength in construction, heavy-duty truck and semiconductor markets. International Industrial units increased sales 18.1 percent (attributed mostly to currency rate changes) and operating margin was 6.7 percent.
 
In the company's Climate & Industrial Controls segment (previously included in the "Other" segment), second-quarter sales were relatively flat while operating margin increased to 7.2 percent.
 
In Aerospace, sales were 1.2 percent lower and operating margin was 11.3 percent.
 
In the "Other" segment, comprised of Wynn Specialty Chemicals and Astron metal buildings, sales were 11.4 percent higher than the prior year second quarter (mostly the result of currency rate changes) and operating margin improved to 7.0 percent.
 
Year-to-Date Results
 
For the first six months of fiscal 2004, the company recorded net income of $112.5 million, or 95 cents per diluted share on sales of $3.21 billion. Net income is up 14.1 percent over last year's $98.5 million, or 84 cents per diluted share on sales of $3.10 billion.
 
The company again noted strong cash flow from operations of $378.2 million, or 12 percent of sales, and will continue to look for growth opportunities, as evidenced by its recent tender offer for shares of Denison International plc, which is expected to close in the third fiscal quarter.
 
"Acquisitions are still an important part of our accelerated growth plan," said Washkewicz. "We're very excited about Denison's solid, profitable performance in Europe and significant presence in Asia, especially in China. We look forward to adding the Denison product line to Parker's and expanding our total systems capabilities."
 
Outlook
 
For the second half of fiscal-year 2004, the company said it expects sales in the Industrial and Other segments to increase modestly, with continued profitability improvements. Sales and margins are expected to be down slightly in the Climate & Industrial Controls segment. In Aerospace, the company said sales should stabilize, but it did not expect near-term margins to improve without a corresponding improvement in aftermarket volume.
 
"While we are pleased to see some improvement in this quarter's operating performance and in recent order trends, we remain hopeful market conditions will continue to improve," said Washkewicz. "Our balance sheet is getting healthier and we're staying focused on our Win Strategy to drive growth, profitability and cash flow."
