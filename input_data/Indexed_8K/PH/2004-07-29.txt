PARKER EARNINGS ACCELERATE WITH RECORD SALES AND CASH FROM OPERATIONS
 
 
 
Cleveland, Ohio: July 29, 2004  Parker Hannifin Corporation (NYSE: PH) today marked new records in sales and cash flow for fiscal-year 2004, as sales topped $7 billion for the first time in the company's 86-year history, and cash from operations reached a record $662.4 million, surpassing last year's result of $557.5 million. This year's record cash from operations was achieved even with the company's discretionary contribution to its retirement and benefits plans of approximately $146 million, compared with $108 million contributed last year.
 
For the full year, Parker posted a 76-percent increase in net income, at $345.8 million, or $2.91 per diluted share. Revenues reached a record $7.11 billion, up 11 percent, including a 5.6-percent increase in organic volume. Last year, the company earned $196.3 million, or $1.68 per diluted share, on sales of $6.41 billion. The current year's results include a five-cent divestiture gain and a reduction of nine cents per diluted share in realignment costs, compared with a four-cent divestiture gain and a reduction of 16 cents per diluted share in realignment costs last year.
 
Fourth-quarter net income for the period ended June 30, 2004 was up 156 percent, at $125.5 million, or $1.05 per diluted share, on sales of $1.99 billion, compared with last year's quarterly income of $49.1 million, or 42 cents per diluted share, on sales of $1.66 billion. Included in the current quarter's earnings is a five-cent divestiture gain and a two-cent reduction from realignment costs, while last year's earnings reflected a four-cent divestiture gain and a reduction of six cents per share in realignment costs. Revenue growth in the current quarter includes a 15-percent increase in organic volume, a two-percent increase from currency translation and three-percent growth from acquisitions not reflected in the prior-year comparison.
 
"With the broad based recovery of all our industrial markets, and aerospace at the beginning of a rebound, our growth engine is firing on all cylinders," said Parker CEO Don Washkewicz. "The recovery didn't really start
 
to pick up until January, so we've only had the wind at our backs for half a year. Yet our margins are up dramatically, inventories remain lean and cash flow has never been stronger. We are executing our Win Strategy, and as long as this recovery is sustained, we see a lot more growth potential in our business.
 
"Our message to Parker employees is to keep up the great work. Our goal is to maintain the gains we worked so hard to achieve, and extend them  by executing our strategic initiatives, staying lean and focused  and shifting growth into high gear. Today, we're winning more competitive bids on our systems and portfolio strength, global expansion, and innovation exceeding our customers' expectations."

Sales and operating income were up in all of the company's segments, with an overall 109-percent increase in operating income for the fourth quarter, and up 45 percent for the full year.
 
The North American Industrial units led the improvement, with operating income up 230 percent in the fourth quarter, and 98 percent for the year.

The most significant margin improvements were made in Europe, despite additional realignment costs this year. In all of 2004, the international businesses recorded operating income of $159.6 million, on sales of $1.97 billion, for an 8.1-percent operating margin, compared with 6.1 percent the prior year.

Outlook
 
Parker cited a positive outlook for fiscal-year 2005, noting an expectation for continued expansion in its diverse markets, with some possible tempering in heavy-duty trucks and semiconductors.
 
"As our markets continue to recover, we feel we have positioned Parker to gain a greater share of business in core and emerging markets where we have an unrivaled breadth of products and bring added engineering value, especially in aerospace, mobile, refrigeration, life sciences and clean-energy markets such as wind power and fuel cells," said Washkewicz.
 
The company projected earnings for fiscal-year 2005 to mark a new record, ranging from $3.30 to $3.70 per diluted share. In the first quarter, earnings are expected to range between 70 and 80 cents per diluted share, reflecting the company's typical pattern of earnings momentum, with more of the year's earnings occurring in the second half.

Non-GAAP Financial Measure
This presentation reconciles sales amounts reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP to sales amounts adjusted to remove the effects of acquisitions and divestitures made within the prior four quarters as well as the effects of currency exchange rates on sales. The effects of acquisitions and divestitures and currency exchange rates are removed to allow investors and the company to meaningfully evaluate changes in sales on a comparable basis from period to period.
