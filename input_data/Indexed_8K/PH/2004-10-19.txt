PARKER POSTS RECORD QUARTERLY SALES AND EARNINGS, EPS AT $1.11
 
Cleveland, Ohio: October 19, 2004  Parker Hannifin Corporation (NYSE: PH) today reported record quarterly net income and earnings for the period ended September 30, 2004, while also marking a record $1.95 billion in fiscal first-quarter sales. Net income increased 134 percent to $132.8 million, or $1.11 per diluted share, compared with last year's quarterly net income of $56.7 million, or 48 cents per diluted share, on $1.59 billion in sales. In the current quarter, earnings were reduced by seven cents per diluted share for an investment write-down and a one-time pension adjustment resulting from a plan restructuring.
 
The company generated $160 million in cash from operations during the quarter, or 8.2 percent of sales, compared with $144 million, or 9.1 percent of sales a year ago. "Our balance sheet remains strong and we will continue to invest in growth opportunities, including acquisitions that are expected to be accretive to earnings such as our recent announcements welcoming Sporlan Valve Company to the Parker family," said Parker CEO Don Washkewicz.
 
"Thanks to our employees executing our Win Strategy, Parker is winning on many fronts. Outside of North America, we achieved profitability exceeding 10 percent this quarter, and our acquisitions are doing very well," added Washkewicz. "We're rapidly improving our financial performance, while focusing on four areas of growth: (1) Growing our market share in Total Parker Systems; (2) Growing globally with our customers in emerging markets; (3) Adding strategic acquisitions that bring great technology to our motion and control portfolio; and (4) Cultivating innovation to accelerate internal growth."
 
Operating Results
 
units posted first-quarter sales of $832.3 million, up 25 percent from last year. Operating income in the current quarter was $119.8 million, for an operating margin of 14.4 percent, compared with 6.4 percent last year.
Parker's North American Industrial
 
businesses achieved first-quarter operating income of $66.5 million and an operating margin of 12.1 percent, compared with 7.4 percent last year. Sales increased 30 percent to $549 million, with acquisitions and currency translation contributing more than half of the increase.
The International Industrial
 
sales increased 16 percent over the prior year to $331.1 million. First-quarter operating income improved to $51.3 million, for a 15.5-percent operating margin, compared with 13.2 percent a year ago.

business posted first-quarter operating income of $15.8 million on sales of $165.5 million, for an operating margin of 9.6 percent, compared with 11.2 percent last year.

Outlook
 
"We're encouraged by continued strength in the global economy and improvements we've seen in most segments of our business, including industrial international and the up tick in aerospace aftermarket," said Washkewicz. "Our main concerns at this point in the recovery are inflationary pressures from oil and raw material shortages and the prospects for higher interest rates."
 
The company raised its second quarter and full-year earnings estimates for fiscal year 2005, indicating it expects to earn between $.85 and $1.05 per diluted share in the second quarter. Full-year earnings are estimated to be between $4.30 and $4.70 per diluted share.

Non-GAAP Financial Measure
This presentation reconciles sales amounts reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP to sales amounts adjusted to remove the effects of acquisitions and divestitures made within the prior four quarters as well as the effects of currency exchange rates on sales. The effects of acquisitions and divestitures and currency exchange rates are removed to allow investors and the company to meaningfully evaluate changes in sales on a comparable basis from period to period.
