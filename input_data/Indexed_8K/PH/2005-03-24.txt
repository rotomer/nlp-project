Item 2.05 Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities
 
On March 18, 2005, executive management of Parker Hannifin Corporation (the "Company") committed the Company to a plan of closure of a manufacturing facility in Hilden, Germany. The facility was acquired as part of the February 2004 acquisition of Denison International. The decision to close the Hilden, Germany facility results from the completion of the Company's acquisition integration analysis. The facility closure is expected to be completed by June 2006. The Company has initiated negotiations with the German Local Works Council and has offered a cash severance package to the affected employees of approximately $4.3 million, all of which will be recognized as expense in the third quarter ending March 31, 2005.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, hereunto duly authorized.
