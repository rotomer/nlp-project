PARKER HANNIFIN REPORTS RECORD YEAR-END SALES, EARNINGS, AND CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS; ANNOUNCES Q4 EPS UP 31 PERCENT TO $1.34
 
Cleveland, Ohio: July 28, 2005  Parker Hannifin Corporation (NYSE: PH) today reported new records in sales, earnings and cash flow from operations for fiscal-year 2005. Sales topped $8 billion for the first time in the company's 87-year history; diluted earnings per share for the year were also at an all-time high; and cash flow from operations reached a record $871.8 million, or 10.6 percent of sales, surpassing last year's record of $649.5 million, or 9.3 percent of sales.
 
For the full year, Parker posted a 63-percent increase in income from continuing operations, at $548.0 million, or a 61-percent increase in earnings per diluted share of $4.55. Revenues reached a record $8.22 billion, up 17 percent. Last year, the company earned $336.2 million from continuing operations, or $2.82 per diluted share, on sales of $7.0 billion. Income from discontinued operations for fiscal 2005 was $56.7 million, or 47 cents per diluted share, which includes profit from operations and the gain on the divestiture of the Wynn Oil specialty chemicals business.
 
Fourth-quarter income from continuing operations increased 32 percent to $161.4 million, or a 31-percent increase in earnings per diluted share of $1.34 on sales of $2.21 billion for the period ended June 30, 2005, compared to income from continuing operations of $122.6 million, or $1.02 cents per diluted share on sales of $1.96 billion in the same period last year.
 
"We have just completed an exceptional year, driving significant shareholder value as evidenced by our Return on Invested Capital (ROIC), which should rank us among the upper tier of our peer group. We demonstrated that Parker can achieve significant growth, and produce the cash to invest in yet another year of strong results in fiscal 2006," said Chairman and CEO Don Washkewicz. "Parker employees made an incredible effort to execute our Win Strategy, and we have a solid foundation in place to build the future of our company. This will be seen as another great period in Parker's rich history of profitable growth."
 
Segment Results
 
In the North American Industrial segment, fourth-quarter operating income improved 16 percent to $128.4 million on sales of $940.1 million. For the full year, North American Industrial operating income was up 61 percent to $468.2 million on sales of $3.52 billion.
 
The International Industrial segment fourth-quarter operating income increased 36 percent to $76.0 million on sales of $642.9 million. For the full year, International Industrial operating income was up 67 percent to $267.2 million on sales of $2.40 billion.

For the full year, the Climate & Industrial Controls segment recorded operating income up four percent to $74.8 million on sales of $794.3 million.

Outlook
 
In fiscal year 2006, Parker for the first time will be expensing equity based compensation as required by FAS 123R. Without the impact of this accounting change, the fiscal-year 2006 earnings from continuing operations are projected to range from $5.00 to $5.40 per diluted share. With the impact of the accounting change, the company projects earnings from continuing operations for fiscal-year 2006 to range from $4.80 to $5.25 per diluted share, including an expense of approximately 15 to 20 cents per diluted share related to FAS 123R. Removal of the FAS 123R accounting change allows investors and the company to meaningfully evaluate future projected performance on a comparable basis with prior periods which were not impacted by the accounting change.
 
"Nearly all of our major end markets are performing very well and we are particularly pleased with the strong demand we're seeing in Aerospace. The performance of our traditional markets, plus the potential of our new growth platforms, lead us to project another year of solid sales and earnings in fiscal 2006," added Washkewicz.
 
"Going forward, we will continue to drive our Win Strategy goals of premier customer service and financial performance; with an even greater emphasis on profitable growth.
 
"Our focus for fiscal 2006 is on growth through innovation. We have the financial capacity to expand our business through strategic acquisitions and we plan to increase our investment in new product development, all in an effort to best serve our customers."
