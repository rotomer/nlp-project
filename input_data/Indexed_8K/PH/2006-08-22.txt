Please confirm your receipt of this Notice and indicate your acknowledgment and agreement to the terms specified herein by signing and returning a copy of this Notice to Tom Piraino.

Exhibit 10.3
Name: XXX
PID: XXX
The Human Resources and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Committee") of Parker-Hannifin Corporation (the "Company") has granted to you, under the Company's 2003 Stock Incentive Plan (the "Plan"), stock options ("Options") with tandem stock appreciation rights ("SARs") with respect to the number of common shares of the Company ("Common Shares") set forth below. Your Options/SARs under this grant have a grant price ("Grant Price") that is 100% of the fair market value (the "Fair Market Value") of the Common Shares, which is taken as the reported closing price of the Common Shares on the New York Stock Exchange-Composite Transactions on the date of the grant. This grant will expire at the time indicated below unless an earlier lapse date ("Lapse Date") applies due to one of the status changes described in this notice.
 
Each Option granted hereunder entitles you to purchase the Common Shares covered by the option at the Grant Price. Each SAR granted hereunder entitles you to receive the increase in value (the "Appreciation") of one Common Share from the grant date to the date the SAR is exercised with respect to all or any portion of the Common Shares.
You may exercise all or any portion of this grant as either Options or SARs but not both. The exercise of any portion of the grant as Options automatically cancels the corresponding SARs, and the exercise of any portion of the grant as SARs automatically cancels the corresponding Options.
Upon the exercise of an SAR, the Appreciation shall be paid to you in Common Shares having a value equivalent to the Appreciation determined in the manner described below. The Company reserves the right to settle the Appreciation in cash in lieu of Common Shares, at its sole election. Appreciation shall be calculated by subtracting the Grant Price from the last determinable Fair Market Value of the Common Shares (which shall be the Fair Market Value on the day prior to exercise, referred to hereafter as the "Prior Day's Close") and multiplying the result by the number of SARs exercised. To determine the number of Common Shares to be issued upon settlement, the Appreciation shall be divided by the Prior Day's Close, and fractional shares shall be rounded down to the nearest whole share with no cash consideration being paid for the fractional remainder.
.
SAR Calculation

While you are an active employee, this grant shall vest in one-third increments as follows:
.
Vesting Period
provided, however, in the event of a Change in Control of the Company (as defined in the Plan), all of the Options/SARs granted hereunder shall immediately vest and become exercisable.
If your continuous full-time employment is terminated at any time prior to a vesting date as a result of retirement, permanent disability or death, any unvested Options/SARs shall continue to vest according to the schedule set forth above.
Following vesting, your Options/SARs are exercisable in accordance with the terms hereof only while you are a full-time employee of the Company or one of its Subsidiaries at any time until the Expiration Date or Lapse Date as to all or any portion of the Common Shares subject to the vested Options/SARs. Vested Options/SARs may also be exercised upon termination of full-time employment in accordance with the specific status change rules set forth below.
If your continuous full-time employment is terminated at any time prior to a vesting date for any reason death, permanent disability or retirement under the applicable retirement plan or policy of the Company, any unvested Options/SARs at such date of termination shall lapse immediately upon termination.
.
Effect of Status Changes
other than
Vested Options/SARs may be exercised in whole or in part after termination of full-time employment before the Lapse Date shown in the right-hand column corresponding to the described status change:
 
Page 3
To exercise any portion of this grant, you shall be required to complete and deliver a notice of exercise in the prescribed format to the Company for processing on the Exercise Date. The Exercise Date shall be deemed to be the first business day on which the Company receives, prior to the established cut-off time, (i) the notice of exercise and (ii) if the grant is being exercised as Options, the exercise price which may be paid in cash or with other Common Shares of the Company. If you tender Common Shares of the Company to satisfy the exercise price, such shares will be valued at the Prior Day's Close.
.
Exercise and Settlement Procedures
To settle the exercise of the Options/SARs, the Company will instruct its stock transfer agent to issue to you the net number of Common Shares you are entitled to receive. If any portion of the grant is exercised as SARs, the Company may, in its sole discretion, alternatively elect to settle in cash, in which case the Company will pay you the appropriate dollar amount in settlement thereof.
If any vested portion of this grant has a positive value but remains unexercised on the business day preceding the Expiration Date or a Lapse Date, such grant remainder shall automatically self-exercise as SARs on the Expiration Date to prevent forfeiture.
.
Automatic Self-Exercise Prior to Expiration
If you are a U.S. citizen, you do not realize income upon the grant of these Options/SARs. In certain foreign countries, however, you may be taxed upon grant. In any year in which you exercise a part or all of such Options/SARs, the excess of the fair market value of the Common Shares on the Exercise Date over the Grant Price will be taxed as compensation at ordinary income rates and you will be subject to U.S. or foreign income tax withholding, as applicable. For U.S. citizens, such withholding shall include federal, state, local, FICA, Medicare, or other statutorily-required taxes ("Taxes"). Such Taxes be paid to the Company at the time of exercise by surrendering to the Company a portion of the Common Shares received in settlement upon exercise. If, however, the Company elects to settle the exercise of SARs in cash instead of stock, the Taxes due upon exercise shall be deducted from the cash settlement prior to payment.
.
Compensation and Payment of Income Withholding Taxes
must
The Company will withhold for Taxes the number of shares having an aggregate value based on the Prior Day's Close at least equal to the amount required to be withheld by law. If the value of the withheld shares exceeds the withholding tax amount due, such excess (which will be less than the value of one Common Share) shall be credited to federal income tax withholding.
.
Tax Withholding Calculation
. If you (or a permitted transferee as provided below) tender Common Shares of the Company to satisfy the exercise price on an Option, you will receive one (1) restorative or "reload" grant of SARs effective on the Exercise Date equivalent to the number of Common Shares surrendered to satisfy the exercise price (the "Reload SARs"). The Reload SARs will have a Grant Price equal to the Fair Market Value of the Common Shares on the Exercise Date. Except as otherwise specified herein, no Reload SARs may be exercised (a) prior to the completion of one (1) year of continuous full-time employment following the Exercise Date; and (b) unless you have retained ownership of the Common Shares resulting from the Option exercise on the Exercise Date (less a sufficient number of Common Shares to satisfy withholding tax obligations) for a period of one (1) year from the Exercise Date. No more than one (1) grant of Reload SARs shall be made

hereunder. All other terms and conditions of the Reload SARs will be identical to those contained herein, including without limitation the expiration and termination of the Reload SARs.
Your Options/SARs are not transferable (other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution) except to (a) your spouse, children or grandchildren, (b) one or more trusts for the benefit of such family members; or (c) partnerships in which such family members are the only partners; , that you do not receive any consideration for the transfer. Any transferred Options/SARs shall continue to be subject to the same terms and conditions that were applicable immediately prior to its transfer (except that such transferred Options/SARs shall not be further transferable by the transferee ).

Dear :
                
On August 16, 2006, the Human Resources and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Committee") authorized a target incentive bonus award (the "Award") to you under the Corporation's Performance Bonus Plan ("Bonus Plan"). This award is made subject to the Corporation's Performance Bonus Plan, which was approved by the shareholders of the Corporation on October 26, 2005, so that payments made hereunder will be qualified as "performance-based compensation" for purposes of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and Section 1.162-27 of the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder. Your Award is in the target amount of $ (the "Target Amount"). The Award is subject to the following terms and conditions:

The payout under the Award (the "Payout") will be based upon the Corporation's actual operating cash flow less capital expenditures (free cash flow) expressed as a percent of the Corporation's sales ("FCF Margin") for fiscal year 2007 (the "Performance Period").

You will receive a Payout of 100% of your Target Amount if a 6.1% FCF Margin for the Performance Period is achieved. FCF Margin above or below 6.1% for the Performance Period will result in a lesser or greater Payout than the Target Amount on a basis (see Table 1 below). The minimum threshold for any Payout under the Award is 3.1% FCF Margin during the Performance Period.
pro rata
 
2. The Payout earned under the Award will be paid at the end of the Performance Period. Your Payout will be reduced on a basis to reflect the actual amount of time you serve in an eligible position during the Performance Period.
pro rata
3. If you retire (at or after age 60, or earlier with the consent of the Committee), die or become disabled during the Performance Period, you will be entitled to receive a share of the Payout ultimately earned during the Performance Period based upon the number of full months worked during the Performance Period. Termination of employment for any other reason during the Performance Period will result in forfeiture of your Award.

Exhibit 10.6
TO:    [Name]
August , 2006
    
Dear :
                
On August 16, 2006, the Human Resources and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Committee") authorized an LTI award (the "Award") to you under the Corporation's Performance Bonus Plan, which was approved by the shareholders of the Corporation on October 26, 2005, so that payments made hereunder may be qualified as "performance-based compensation" for purposes of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and Section 1.162-27 of the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder. Your Award is in the target amount of restricted shares of the Common Stock of the Corporation (the "Target Amount"). The Award is subject to the following terms and conditions:
                
1. The payout under the Award will be determined by comparing the Corporation's results to the performance of the Corporation's peer group listed on attached Exhibit A ("Peers") for the measurements indicated below (the "Performance Measures") for fiscal years 2007, 2008 and 2009 (the "Performance Period"). The Target Amount will be weighted as follows for each Performance Measure (each a "Weighted Target"):
 
Revenue growth, EPS and ROC for the Corporation and the Peers shall be calculated by reference to sales and income from continuing operations.
You will receive a payout of 100% of the Weighted Target for each Performance Measure if the Corporation ranks in the 55
th
percentile among the Peers in the applicable Performance Measure. Percentile rankings above or below the 55
th
percentile for the Performance Period among the Peers for any Performance Measure will result in a lesser or greater payout for each Weighted Target in accordance with the following table:
 
For each Performance Measure, the Corporation's ranking must be above the 35
th
percentile among the Peers for the Performance Period in order to receive a payout for the applicable Weighted Target. The total payout under the Award ("Payout") will be determined by adding together the payouts for each of the Performance Measures.
In light of the impact of the adoption of FAS 123R by the Corporation on July 1, 2005 (which requires the expensing of equity-based compensation), in order to make a valid Peer comparison when the date of adoption for the Corporation and any of its Peers is not the same, the calculation of each Performance Measure for each Peer who has not adopted FAS 123R will be adjusted to include the pro forma expense for equity-based compensation reported by such Peers in the footnotes to their published financial statements; provided, however, that if such pro forma expense is not readily available for all such Peers, then the calculation of each Performance Measure for the Corporation and each Peer which has adopted FAS 123R will be adjusted to remove the effect of the expense for equity-based compensation.
Peers which do not publish stand-alone financial results for the entire Performance Period as a result of going private, acquisition, or any similar transaction will be removed from the list of Peers. Peers which merge during the Performance Period will remain as Peers only if they are the surviving entity of the merger. Any Peer which has publicly announced the need to restate its financial statements for any portion of the Performance Period, but has not yet published such restatement, will be excluded from the Peer comparisons for any Performance Metric in which its result is better than the Corporation's result. Any Peer which has not published financial statements for the entire Performance Period due to the publicly announced need to restate its financial statements will be removed from the list of Peers.
2. The Payout earned under the Award will be paid after the end of the Performance Period.
3. If you retire (at or after age 60, or earlier with the consent of the Committee), die or become disabled during the Performance Period, you will be entitled to receive a share of the Payout ultimately earned during the Performance Period based upon the number of full calendar quarters worked during the Performance Period. Termination of employment for any other reason during the Performance Period will result in forfeiture of your Award.
pro rata
4. Except as otherwise provided herein, if you are actively employed by the Corporation at the time of the Payout, you will receive the Payout in the form of restricted shares of the Common Stock of the Corporation (the "Restricted Shares"). The Restricted Shares will be subject to the terms and conditions imposed by the Committee at the time of issuance.
5. You may elect, in accordance with rules established by the Corporation, to receive your Payout in the form of a credit to your Executive Deferral Plan ("EDP") account. If such an election is timely made, you will receive your Payout in the form of a credit to your EDP account as of July 1, 2009 in an amount equal to the number of Restricted Shares earned under the Award multiplied by the closing price of the Corporation's Common Shares on the New York Stock Exchange on June 30, 2009 (the "Cash Equivalent")
6. If you are not an active employee of the Corporation at the time of the Payout pursuant to the Award, your Payout will be in the form of cash equal to the Cash Equivalent, unless you have made the EDP election specified in Section 5.
7. In the event of a "Change in Control of the Company" (as defined in the Corporation's Change in Control Severance Agreements), you will receive an amount in cash under the Award within fifteen (15) days following the date of the Change in Control equal to the greater of (a) the amount equal to (i) the Target Amount of Restricted Shares multiplied by (ii) the Stock Price (as hereinafter defined); or (b) the amount equal to (i) what your Payout in Restricted Shares would have been had the Corporation's percentile ranking against the Peers for each of the Performance Measures during the Performance Period through the end of the fiscal quarter immediately preceding the date of the Change in Control continued throughout the Performance Period at the same level, multiplied by (ii) the Stock Price. As used herein, the "Stock Price" shall mean the closing price for the Corporation's shares on the New York Stock Exchange on July 1, 2006, or on the date of the Change in Control, whichever is higher.
8. You will receive the Payout in the form described above following certification of the calculation of the Performance Measures and the Payout by the Committee at the end of the Performance Period. The Committee retains the ability to reduce the Payout at its sole discretion. The amount of the Payout is also subject to the payout limitations set forth in Section 5(c) of the Bonus Plan.
9. The Award is subject to all terms, conditions and provisions of the Bonus Plan to the extent not specifically addressed herein. In the event of any conflict between the terms of the Bonus Plan and the Award, the Bonus Plan shall prevail.
Please acknowledge receipt of the Award and indicate your agreement with the terms hereof by signing and returning a copy to me as soon as possible.
