ANNEX I
 
     The opinion will be subject to customary qualifications, limitations and assumptions.
     We have participated in the preparation of the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Prospectus and the Prospectus (certain of the documents incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, Time of Sale Prospectus and Prospectus, having previously been prepared and filed by the Company without our participation). From time to time we have had discussions with certain officers, directors and employees of the Company, with representatives of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and/or Deloitte & Touche LLP, the independent registered public accounting firms who examined certain of the financial statements of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, Time of Sale Prospectus and Prospectus, with your representatives and your counsel concerning the information contained in or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, Time of Sale Prospectus and Prospectus, and the proposed responses to various items in Form S-3. Based solely upon our participation and discussions described above, we are of the view that the Registration Statement (including all information deemed to be part of and included therein pursuant to Rule 430B under the Securities Act, as of ___, 20___, which is the date you have identified as the earlier of the date the Time of Sale Prospectus was first used or the date of the first contract of sale of the Notes (such date, the "Effective Date"), and the Prospectus, as of its date, complied as to form in all material respects to the requirements of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") thereunder, except that we express no view with respect to (i) the financial statements, financial schedules and other financial data included or incorporated by reference therein or (ii) the information referred to under the caption "Experts" as having been included or incorporated by reference therein on the authority of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and/or Deloitte & Touche LLP as experts.
                    
 
     We have not independently verified and are not passing upon, and do not assume any responsibility for, the accuracy, completeness or fairness (except as and to the extent set forth in paragraph (7) above) of the information included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, Time of Sale Prospectus and Prospectus. Based on the participation and discussions set forth above, however, no facts have come to our attention that cause us to believe that the Registration Statement (including all information deemed to be part of and included therein pursuant to Rule 430B under the Securities Act), as of the Effective Date, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, that the Time of Sale Prospectus, as of __:00 [a.m.] [p.m.] on ___, 20___(which is the time that you have informed us was prior to the first contract of sale of any Notes by the Agents), included any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or that the Prospectus, as of its date or on the date hereof, included or includes any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except that we express no view with respect to (i) the financial statements, financial schedules and other financial data included or incorporated by reference therein or (ii) the information referred to under the caption "Experts" as having been included or incorporated by reference therein on the authority of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and/or Deloitte & Touche LLP as experts.

     Re:
Prospectus Supplement for up to $3,000,000,000 Medium-Term Notes, Series A
Ladies and Gentlemen:
     We have acted as special tax counsel to Parker-Hannifin Corporation (the "Company") in connection with the issuance of up to $3,000,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company's Medium-Term Notes, Series A (the "Notes"), as set forth in the Company's Prospectus (the "Prospectus"), dated August 26, 2010, and the Company's Prospectus Supplement (the "Prospectus Supplement"), dated September 7, 2010.
     In connection with our opinion, we have reviewed and are relying upon the Registration Statement on Form S-3ASR (File No. 333-169069) of which the Prospectus and Prospectus Supplement are a part (the "Registration Statement"), including the exhibits thereto, the representations contained in a letter dated today addressed to us from the Company, and such other documents, records and instruments as we have deemed necessary or appropriate for purposes of this opinion.
     This opinion is based upon current provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, current Treasury regulations issued thereunder, current published administrative rulings and procedures of the Internal Revenue Service, and judicial decisions published to date, all of which are subject to change or differing interpretation, possibly with retroactive effect.
     Based upon and subject to the foregoing and subject to the limitations set forth herein, it is our opinion that the material federal income tax consequences to holders of the Notes will be as described under the heading "U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations" in the Prospectus Supplement. You have not requested, and we do not express, an opinion concerning any other tax consequences of the issuance of the Notes.
     We consent to the filing of this opinion as Exhibit 8.1 to the Registration Statement. In giving this consent, we do not admit that we come within the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act of 1933 or the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission thereunder.
Very truly yours,
