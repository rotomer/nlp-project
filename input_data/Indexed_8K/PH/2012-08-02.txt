Parker Reports Year End Results with Record Sales, Net Income and EPS
CLEVELAND, August 2, 2012
-- Parker Hannifin Corporation (NYSE: PH), the global leader in motion and control technologies, today reported results for the fiscal 2012 fourth quarter and year ended June 30, 2012. Fiscal 2012 sales were a record at $13.1 billion, an increase of 6.5 percent from $12.3 billion in the prior year. Net income for the year was also a record at $1.2 billion, an increase of 9.3 percent compared with $1.1 billion in fiscal 2011. Fiscal 2012 earnings per diluted share were a record at $7.45, an increase of 17.0 percent compared with $6.37 in the previous year. Cash flow from operations for fiscal 2012 was $1.5 billion, or 11.6 percent of sales, compared with cash flow from operations of $1.2 billion, or 9.5 percent of sales, in the prior year period. Cash flow from operations in fiscal 2011 included a discretionary contribution to the companys pension plan of $400 million.
#PageNum#
Fiscal 2012 fourth quarter sales of $3.4 billion were equivalent to the same quarter a year ago and included a negative 4 percent impact from foreign currency translation. Net income for the fiscal 2012 fourth quarter was $302.3 million, an increase of 2.6 percent compared with $294.7 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. Earnings per diluted share for the fiscal 2012 fourth quarter were $1.96, an increase of 9.5 percent compared with $1.79 in last years fourth quarter. Cash flow from operations for the fiscal 2012 fourth quarter was $523.9 million, or 15.4 percent of sales, compared with cash flow from operations of $367.0 million, or 10.8 percent of sales, in the prior year period. Cash flow from operations in the fiscal 2011 fourth quarter included a discretionary contribution to the companys pension plan of $200 million.
I am very pleased that we were able to achieve record performance in fiscal year 2012, despite moderate growth in the global economy, said Chairman, CEO and President, Don Washkewicz. Of particular note, we surpassed 15 percent annual total segment operating margin for the first time in our history, which is a target we set when we initiated the Win Strategy. This years performance confirms Parkers operational transformation into a fundamentally stronger company and reflects the contribution of our global team.
Our fourth quarter performance exceeded expectations largely on the strength of our business in North America, as International markets remain soft. Total sales this quarter were essentially unchanged compared with the prior year quarter as organic growth of 3 percent and acquisition growth of 1 percent were offset by negative foreign currency translation of 4 percent. We experienced strong growth in our Industrial North America and Aerospace segments, which was offset by a decline in the Industrial International segment. We were particularly pleased that we achieved total segment operating margin of 15.5 percent, a 70 basis point improvement over the prior year quarter, despite a moderate demand environment.
Fourth Quarter Segment Results
In the Industrial North America segment, fiscal 2012 fourth quarter sales increased 9.0 percent to $1.34 billion, and operating income was $249.1 million compared with $207.3 million in the same period a year ago.
In the Industrial International segment, fourth quarter sales decreased 10.4 percent to $1.24 billion, and operating income was $163.9 million compared with $202.8 million in the same period a year ago.
In the Aerospace segment, fourth quarter sales increased 8.5 percent to $566.0 million, and operating income was $85.3 million compared with $70.7 million in the same period a year ago.
In the Climate and Industrial Controls segment, fourth quarter sales decreased 3.0 percent to $268.5 million, and operating income was $31.5 million compared with $22.5 million in the same period a year ago.
Orders
Parker reported a decrease of 1 percent in orders for the quarter ended June 30, 2012, compared with the same quarter a year ago. The company reported the following orders by operating segment:

Fiscal 2013 Outlook
For fiscal 2013, the company has issued guidance for earnings from continuing operations in the range of $7.10 to $7.90 per diluted share. Fiscal 2013 guidance includes an expected increase in domestic qualified pension expense of approximately $0.35 per diluted share due to accounting regulations which require the use of a lower discount rate based on current market conditions.
Washkewicz added, Our earnings guidance for fiscal 2013 anticipates another record year for Parker at the midpoint of our guidance range and continued stronger operational performance, despite an expected increase in pension expense. We will continue to stay the course with a strong focus on the fundamentals of the Win Strategy, which will allow us to deliver another strong year of performance as we continue to invest in profitable growth through new product and systems innovation, strategic acquisitions, and continued expansion of our distribution network.

Notes on Orders
Orders provide near-term perspective on the company's outlook, particularly when viewed in the context of prior and future quarterly order rates. However, orders are not in themselves an indication of future performance. All comparisons are at constant currency exchange rates, with the prior year restated to the current-year rates. All exclude acquisitions until they can be reflected in both the numerator and denominator. Aerospace comparisons are rolling 12-month average computations. The total Parker orders number is derived from a weighted average of the year-over-year quarterly percent change in orders for the Industrial North America, Industrial International, and Climate and Industrial Controls segments, and the year-over-year 12-month rolling average of orders for the Aerospace segment.
Forward-Looking Statements
Forward-looking statements contained in this and other written and oral reports are made based on known events and circumstances at the time of release, and as such, are subject in the future to unforeseen uncertainties and risks. All statements regarding future performance, earnings projections, events or developments are forward-looking statements. It is possible that the future performance and earnings projections of the company, including its individual segments, may differ materially from current expectations, depending on economic conditions within its mobile, industrial and aerospace markets, and the company's ability to maintain and achieve anticipated benefits associated with announced realignment activities, strategic initiatives to improve operating margins, actions taken to combat the effects of the current economic environment, and growth, innovation and global diversification initiatives. A change in the economic conditions in individual markets may have a particularly volatile effect on segment performance. Among other factors which may affect future performance are: changes in business relationships with and purchases by or from major customers, suppliers or distributors, including delays or cancellations in shipments, disputes regarding contract terms or significant changes in financial condition, changes in contract cost and revenue estimates for new development programs and changes in product mix; ability to identify acceptable strategic acquisition targets; uncertainties surrounding timing, successful completion or integration of acquisitions; ability to realize anticipated cost savings from business realignment activities; threats associated with and efforts to combat terrorism; uncertainties surrounding the ultimate resolution of outstanding legal proceedings, including the outcome of any appeals; competitive market conditions and resulting effects on sales and pricing; increases in raw material costs that cannot be recovered in product pricing; the companys ability to manage costs related to insurance and employee retirement and health care benefits; and global economic factors, including manufacturing activity, air travel trends, currency exchange rates, difficulties entering new markets and general economic conditions such as inflation, deflation, interest rates and credit availability. The company makes these statements as of the date of this disclosure, and undertakes no obligation to update them unless otherwise required by law.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures This presentation reconciles sales amounts reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP to sales amounts adjusted to remove the effects of acquisitions made within the prior four quarters and the effects of currency exchange rates. This presentation also reconciles cash flow from operating activities as a percent of sales in accordance with U.S. GAAP to cash flow from operating activities as a percent of sales without the effect of a discretionary pension plan contribution. The effects of acquisitions, currency exchange rates and the discretionary pension plan contribution are removed to allow investors and the company to meaningfully evaluate changes in sales and cash flow from operating activities as a percent of sales on a comparable basis from period to period.
