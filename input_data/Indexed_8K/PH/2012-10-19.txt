Parker Reports Fiscal 2013 First Quarter Sales, Net Income and Earnings per Share
CLEVELAND, October 19, 2012
-- Parker Hannifin Corporation (NYSE: PH), the global leader in motion and control technologies, today reported results for the fiscal 2013 first quarter ended September 30, 2012. Fiscal 2013 first quarter sales were $3.21 billion compared with $3.23 billion in the prior year quarter. Net income was $239.9 million compared with $298.2 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2012. Fiscal 2013 first quarter earnings per diluted share were $1.57 compared with $1.91 in the prior year quarter.
We delivered a solid level of earnings this quarter, in spite of ongoing weakness in international markets and softness in North America, said Chairman, CEO and President, Don Washkewicz.
Segment Results
In the Industrial North America segment, first quarter sales increased 5.1 percent to $1.27 billion, and operating income was $227.2 million compared with $223.2 million in the same period a year ago.
In the Industrial International segment, first quarter sales decreased 8.7 percent to $1.18 billion, and operating income was $151.8 million compared with $208.2 million in the same period a year ago.
In the Aerospace segment, first quarter sales increased 8.8 percent to $541.1 million, and operating income was $61.9 million compared with $68.6 million in the same period a year ago.
   
In the Climate and Industrial Controls segment, first quarter sales decreased 4.8 percent to $230.9 million, and operating income was $21.7 million compared with $19.8 million in the same period a year ago.
Orders
Parker reported a decrease of 6 percent in orders for the quarter ending September 30, 2012, compared with the same quarter a year ago. The company reported the following orders by operating segment:
Outlook
For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2013, the company has revised guidance for earnings from continuing operations to the range of $6.15 to $6.75 per diluted share. Previous guidance for earnings from continuing operations was $7.10 to $7.90 per diluted share. Fiscal 2013 guidance includes an expected year-over-year increase in domestic qualified pension expense of approximately $0.35 per diluted share due to accounting regulations which require the use of a lower discount rate based on current market conditions.
Washkewicz added, The economic picture remains uncertain going into the first half of calendar 2013. We will continue to manage our costs and maintain a strong balance sheet. We have revised our estimated range for diluted earnings per share to align with changes in global economic conditions. So far this year, we have strengthened our portfolio by completing five acquisitions and one divestiture. The acquisitions will add approximately $243 million in annualized sales. The integration costs associated with these acquisitions are included in our full year earnings guidance.

Notes on Orders
Orders provide near-term perspective on the company's outlook, particularly when viewed in the context of prior and future quarterly order rates. However, orders are not in themselves an indication of future performance. All comparisons are at constant currency exchange rates, with the prior year restated to the current-year rates. All exclude acquisitions until they can be reflected in both the numerator and denominator. Aerospace comparisons are rolling 12-month average computations. The total Parker orders number is derived from a weighted average of the year-over-year quarterly percent change in orders for the Industrial North America, Industrial International, and Climate and Industrial Controls segments, and the year-over-year 12-month rolling average of orders for the Aerospace segment.
Forward-Looking Statements
Forward-looking statements contained in this and other written and oral reports are made based on known events and circumstances at the time of release, and as such, are subject in the future to unforeseen uncertainties and risks. All statements regarding future performance, earnings projections, events or developments are forward-looking statements. It is possible that the future performance and earnings projections of the company, including its individual segments, may differ materially from current expectations, depending on economic conditions within its mobile, industrial and aerospace markets, and the company's ability to maintain and achieve anticipated benefits associated with announced realignment activities, strategic initiatives to improve operating margins, actions taken to combat the effects of the current economic environment, and growth, innovation and global diversification initiatives. A change in the economic conditions in individual markets may have a particularly volatile effect on segment performance. Among other factors which may affect future performance are: changes in business relationships with and purchases by or from major customers, suppliers or distributors, including delays or cancellations in shipments, disputes regarding contract terms or significant changes in financial condition, changes in contract cost and revenue estimates for new development programs and changes in product mix; ability to identify acceptable strategic acquisition targets; uncertainties surrounding timing, successful completion or integration of acquisitions; ability to realize anticipated cost savings from business realignment activities; threats associated with and efforts to combat terrorism; uncertainties surrounding the ultimate resolution of outstanding legal proceedings, including the outcome of any appeals; competitive market conditions and resulting effects on sales and pricing; increases in raw material costs that cannot be recovered in product pricing; the company's ability to manage costs related to insurance and employee retirement and health care benefits; and global economic factors, including manufacturing activity, air travel trends, currency exchange rates, difficulties entering new markets and general economic conditions such as inflation, deflation, interest rates and credit availability. The company makes these statements as of the date of this disclosure, and undertakes no obligation to update them unless otherwise required by law.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures This presentation reconciles sales amounts reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP to sales amounts adjusted to remove the effects of acquisitions made within the prior four quarters and the effects of currency exchange rates. This presentation also reconciles cash flow from operating activities as a percent of sales in accordance with U.S. GAAP to cash flow from operating activities as a percent of sales without the effect of a discretionary pension plan contribution. The effects of acquisitions, currency exchange rates and the discretionary pension plan contribution are removed to allow investors and the company to meaningfully evaluate changes in sales and cash flow from operating activities as a percent of sales on a comparable basis from period to period. 3
