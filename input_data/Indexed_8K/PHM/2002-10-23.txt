EXHIBIT 99.1 [PULTE HOMES LETTERHEAD] FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE PULTE HOMES ANNOUNCES THIRD QUARTER FINANCIAL RESULTS - - COMPANY RAISES GUIDANCE RANGE FOR 2002 EARNINGS TO $7.05 TO $7.15 PER SHARE - - COMPANY OFFERS INITIAL EARNINGS GUIDANCE FOR 2003 OF $7.85 TO $8.25 PER SHARE - - THIRD QUARTER NET INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS INCREASES 37% TO $114 MILLION, OR $1.83 PER SHARE - - THIRD QUARTER NET NEW HOME ORDERS INCREASE 48% TO 8,005 HOUSES - - QUARTER-END BACKLOG AT 13,675 HOMES, VALUED AT $3.5 BILLION - - PULTE BOARD AUTHORIZES $100 MILLION STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM BLOOMFIELD HILLS, MI, OCTOBER 22, 2002 - Pulte Homes, Inc. (NYSE: PHM) announced today record financial results for its third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2002. For the quarter, net income from continuing operations increased 37% to a record $113.5 million, or $1.83 per share, as compared to $83.2 million, or $1.53 per share, last year. Shares used in calculating third-quarter EPS increased 14% over the same period last year reflecting stock issued as part of the Company's merger with Del Webb that was effective July 31, 2001. Consolidated revenues for the quarter were $1.9 billion, an increase of 25% over prior year revenues of $1.5 billion. Higher revenues for the period reflect continued strength in Pulte's overall business and its expanded operations following last year's merger with Del Webb. Revenues from domestic homebuilding settlements for the quarter increased $315.8 million, or 22%, to a third quarter record of $1.8 billion. Higher revenues for the period resulted from a 16% increase in unit settlements to 7,280, up from 6,253 settlements last year, and a 5% increase in average selling price to $241,000 per home. Third quarter domestic homebuilding gross profit increased 24% to $353.3 million, as compared to prior year gross profit of $285.7 million. Domestic homebuilding margins increased 30 basis points in the period to 20.2%. Land sales during the quarter generated $28.7 million in revenues and $6.7 million in gross profit, as compared to $20.7 million and $3.9 million, respectively, last year. Land sales are an important element of the Company's domestic homebuilding operations, but can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter depending upon the timing of individual transactions. Domestic net new home orders for the quarter were 8,005, an increase of 48% over prior year orders of 5,411 homes (excluding 3,823 Del Webb houses in backlog acquired at the time of the merger). Pulte's backlog as of September 30, 2002, was valued at $3.5 billion (13,675 homes), as compared to a value of $2.8 billion (11,772 homes) last year.
"Our increased sales reflect a number of positive factors including strength in consumer demand, new community openings and initiatives to increase sales pace within several of our larger active adult communities," said O'Brien. The Company's financial services operations reported third quarter pre-tax income of $19.2 million, more than double prior year pre-tax income of $9.3 million. The improvement in third quarter financial results reflects higher loan originations of 5,740, up 16%, with a principal value of $945.1 million. In addition, the Company's mortgage operation continued to benefit from a favorable interest rate environment. For the quarter, Pulte Mortgage's capture rate was 77.6%, as compared to 74.4% last year. For the third quarter, Pulte's International operations reported pre-tax income of $.4 million, as compared to a pre-tax loss of $1.8 million for the comparable period last year. Gains for the quarter primarily reflect improved performance from the Company's operations in Argentina, while its operations in Mexico and Puerto Rico remained stable. Pulte Homes reported net income for the quarter of $123.4 million, or $1.99 per share. Net income for the quarter is inclusive of $9.9 million, or $0.16 per share, reported in the Company's discontinued operations, and related to the recognition of income tax benefits resulting from the favorable resolution of certain tax matters associated with its thrift operations that were discontinued in 1994. "Following last year's merger with Del Webb, Pulte has moved quickly to integrate the operations, while maintaining a strong financial position," said Roger A. Cregg, Senior Vice President and CFO. "We ended the quarter with total shareholder equity of $2.6 billion, book value of $42.36 per share, and a net-debt-to-total-capitalization of 39.7%. Over this most recent 12 month period we have generated a return on equity of 17%, while strengthening the Company's overall market position." In a separate release, Pulte Homes also announced today that its Board of Directors has approved a stock repurchase plan of up to $100 million. Shares will be purchased from time-to-time in the open market, depending upon market conditions. NINE-MONTH RESULTS For the nine months ended September 30, 2002, Pulte Homes reported record net income from continuing operations of $272.6 million, or $4.42 per share, up 49% over prior year net income of $182.9 million, or $3.89 per share last year. Shares used in calculating nine-month EPS increased 31% to 61.7 million, primarily as a result of the Company's merger with Del Webb effective July 2001. Consolidated revenues for the period were $4.9 billion, up from $3.4 billion for the first nine months of last year. Pulte Homes' revenues from domestic homebuilding settlements increased 43% over the prior year period to $4.6 billion. Higher revenues for the period resulted from a 8% increase in average selling price to $239,000, combined with a 33% increase in the number of homes closed. The increase in average selling price and unit volumes reflect the inclusion of Del Webb operations and favorable building conditions during the period. Gross margins for the domestic homebuilding operations were unchanged at 20.0%, as pre-tax income increased 40% to $440.3 million.
For the first nine months, Pulte's financial services operations reported pre-tax income of $47.6 million, up significantly from prior year pre-tax income of $23.5 million. Benefiting from the Company's higher closing volumes and an increased capture rate, mortgage originations jumped 23% to 14,960 loans, with a principal value of $2.4 billion. Pulte's mortgage operations also benefited from a favorable interest rate environment. Pulte's International operations reported net income for the first nine months of $1.8 million, as compared to a pre-tax loss of $2.1 million last year. The improved financial performance was driven by gains in the Company's operations in Mexico and Argentina, partially offset by reduced performance in its Puerto Rico communities. "Given our strong nine-month results and excellent backlog, Pulte Homes is raising guidance for full-year 2002 earnings to $7.05 to $7.15 per share, up from previous guidance of $6.75 to $7.00 per share," said Cregg. "We are also establishing our initial guidance for 2003 earnings of $7.85 to $8.25 per share. This guidance is based on recent demand trends and our preliminary budget reviews. Our guidance also assumes that economic conditions remain stable or improve in 2003, such that housing demand approaches what we are experiencing currently."
