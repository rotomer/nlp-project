(NYSE: PHM) announced today record financial results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2003. First quarter net income from continuing operations was a record $86.3 million, an increase of 26% over prior year first quarter net income of $68.6 million. First quarter earnings per diluted share of $1.39 represents an increase of 24% over prior year earnings per diluted share of $1.12. The Company's consolidated revenues for the quarter were $1.6 billion, compared with prior year revenues of $1.4 billion. The 13% jump in revenues for the period reflects higher sales in Pulte Homes' domestic and international operations, as well as increased revenues within the Company's financial services segment. Pulte Homes ended the quarter with a net debt to total capitalization ratio of approximately 38%, down from approximately 43% at the same point last year. Under its $100 million stock repurchase authorization, Pulte Homes bought back 395,400 shares during the quarter. "Our strong financial results have provided the Company with tremendous flexibility to take advantage of opportunities when they appear," said Mark J. O'Brien, President and CEO. "The Company has purchased its own stock and acquired strategic land assets in the vital Southern California market, all while strengthening its balance sheet. Given the strong start to the year, we are raising our earnings guidance for 2003 to a range of $8.15 to $8.45 per share, up from prior guidance of $7.85 to $8.25 per share. Our current guidance assumes 62.5 million shares outstanding and an effective tax rate of 38%." First quarter revenues from domestic homebuilding settlements increased 11% to $1.4 billion. Higher revenues for the period were the result of a 5% increase in closings to 5,785 houses, combined with a 5% increase in average selling price to $250,000. The higher average selling price during the period reflects a combination of changes in the mix of houses closed, as well as price increases realized during the quarter.
First quarter domestic homebuilding gross profit increased 16% to $303.4 million, as compared to prior year gross profit of $262.7 million. Domestic homebuilding margins improved 90 basis points to 21.0%, as the Company continued to benefit from a sound pricing environment and ongoing efforts to lower its construction costs. "Pulte Homes' first quarter results reflect continued success in implementing our strategy of serving all the major customer segments: first time, first move up, second move up and active adult," said Mr. O'Brien. "This strategy drives growth through greater market share gains and allows Pulte Homes to serve the largest universe of potential homebuyers." Land sales and related gross profit in the quarter were $32.9 million and $8.8 million, respectively, compared with $23.6 million and $8.4 million, respectively, in the prior year. Although the year-over-year contribution from land activity was fairly comparable for the first quarter, land sales can fluctuate significantly depending upon the timing of specific transactions. Domestic net new home orders for the quarter were 8,233, up 2% over prior year first quarter orders of 8,088 homes. Pulte's ending backlog was valued at a record $3.6 billion (13,053 homes), compared with a value of $2.8 billion (11,264 homes) last year. The Company's financial services operations reported first quarter pre-tax income of $17.1 million, up 40% over prior year pre-tax income of $12.3 million. Improved performance for the quarter reflects higher originations of 5,162 mortgages, up 22%, combined with a favorable interest rate environment. The mortgage capture rate for the quarter increased over 5 percentage points to over 80%. A conference call discussing Pulte's first quarter results will be held today at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time, and web cast live via Pulte.com.
