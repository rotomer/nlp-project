Vice President (248) 433-4597 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Media Relations Contact: Valerie Dolenga Pulte Homes, Inc. Corporate Communications (248) 433-4633 PULTE HOMES REPORTS RECORD SECOND QUARTER RESULTS; EARNINGS PER SHARE CLIMB 34% TO $1.95 BACKLOG EXCEEDS A RECORD $4.2 BILLION (15,199 HOUSES) AS NET NEW ORDERS INCREASE 11% TO A PERIOD RECORD 9,191 HOUSES COMPANY AGAIN RAISES EARNINGS GUIDANCE FOR 2003 BLOOMFIELD HILLS, MI, JULY 24, 2003 - Pulte Homes (NYSE: PHM) announced today record financial results for its second quarter and six months ended June 30, 2003. For the quarter, net income from continuing operations increased 35% to a record $122.0 million, as compared to $90.4 million for the comparable prior year period. Second quarter earnings per diluted share of $1.95 represent an increase of 34% over prior year earnings per diluted share of $1.45. Consolidated revenues for the quarter were $2.0 billion, an increase of 16% over prior year revenues of $1.7 billion. "Pulte Homes' strong operating and financial performance, combined with a backlog valued at more than $4.2 billion, puts the Company in an excellent position to deliver record full-year results. The Company is again raising its earnings guidance for 2003 to the new range of $9.00 to $9.25 per share, representing an increase of 25% or more over last year's results," said Richard J. Dugas, Jr., President and CEO of Pulte Homes. Revenues from domestic homebuilding settlements increased 17% to a second-quarter record of $1.8 billion. Higher revenues for the quarter resulted from an 8% increase in average selling price to $259,000, combined with an 8% increase in home closings to 7,112 units. The increase in average selling price reflects a combination of price increases and a favorable change in the mix of product closed during the period. Second quarter domestic homebuilding pretax income increased 37% to $197.6 million, as compared to prior year pretax income of $144.6 million. For the period, the Company realized a 190 basis point increase in gross margins from home sales to 21.8%, while SG&A expense as a percent of home settlement revenues was unchanged at 10.3%. Land sales during the quarter generated $31.3 million in revenues and $9.1 million in gross margin, as compared to $34.1 million and $10.6 million, respectively, last year. According to the Company, land sales are an important element of its domestic homebuilding operations, but can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter depending upon the timing of individual transactions.
Domestic net new home orders for the quarter were 9,191 up 11% over prior year second-quarter orders of 8,279 homes. The Company reported increased sales in all areas of the country: Northeast up 38%, Southeast up 7%, Midwest up 14%, Central up 1%, and the West up 12%. Pulte Homes' backlog as of June 30, 2003, was valued at $4.2 billion (15,199 homes), as compared to a value of $3.3 billion (12,950 homes) last year. "We saw a strengthening demand trend over the quarter, with new community openings helping to drive increased traffic and supporting strong order rates," said Dugas. "As the only builder with the stated strategy of serving all the major customer segments - first time, first move up, second move up and active adult - we continue to see ample opportunity to grow our share of the US housing market." The Company's financial services operations reported second quarter pre-tax income of $20.9 million, up 29% over prior year pre-tax income of $16.2 million. The improvement in second quarter financial results reflects a 36% increase in the number of loan originations to 6,776, a favorable interest rate environment and a higher capture rate of approximately 83% as compared to 77% last year. For the second quarter, Pulte's International operations reported pre-tax income of $0.4 million, as compared to a pre-tax income of $1.9 million for the comparable period last year. Mortgage funding delays in Mexico, resulting in reduced closings for the period, was one of the key contributors to lower earnings for the period. SIX MONTH RESULTS For the six months ended June 30, 2003, Pulte Homes' net income from continuing operations increased 31% to $208.3 million, as compared to prior year net income of $159.0 million. Diluted earnings per share for the first six months were $3.34 per share, an increase of 30% over prior year earnings per diluted share of $2.57. Consolidated revenues for the period were $3.5 billion, up from $3.1 billion for the first six months of last year. Revenues from domestic homebuilding settlements for the period were $3.3 billion, up 14% over the prior year. Higher revenues for the period resulted from a 7% increase in average selling price to $255,000, combined with a 7% increase in the number of homes closed. The increase in average selling price for the period reflects a combination of price increases and a favorable change in the mix of product closed during the period. Six month domestic homebuilding pretax income increased 29% to $336.1 million, as compared to prior year pretax income of $260.4 million. Gross margins from home sales for the period increased 140 basis points to 21.4%, offset by a 20 basis point increase in SG&A expense as a percent of home settlement revenues. Land sales for the period generated $18.0 million in gross margin, as compared to $19.0 million last year. For the first six months, Pulte's financial services operations reported pre-tax income of $38.0 million, up 34% from prior year pre-tax income of $28.4 million. The improvement was driven by a 29% increase in loan originations, a favorable interest rate environment and a higher capture rate of approximately 82% as compared to 76% last year. Pulte's International operations reported a net loss for the first six months of $.6 million, as compared to pre-tax income of $1.4 million last year. Gains in the Company's Puerto Rico operations were offset by weaker results in Mexico and Argentina.
