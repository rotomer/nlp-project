(NYSE: PHM) announced today record financial results for its third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2003. For the quarter, net income from continuing operations increased 42% to a record $161.0 million, as compared to $113.5 million last year. Third quarter earnings per diluted share increased 40% to $2.56, as compared to prior year earnings per diluted share of $1.83. Consolidated revenues for the quarter totaled $2.4 billion, as compared to $1.9 billion last year. "Pulte Homes continues to successfully implement its strategy of expanding market share through customer segmentation," said Richard J. Dugas, Jr., President and CEO of Pulte Homes. "As the only builder serving the first time, first and second move up and active adult buyers, we see tremendous opportunity to sustain the growth of our business." "Our strong third quarter results, combined with a backlog valued at $4.7 billion, puts Pulte Homes in position to deliver record results for 2003. We are again raising earnings guidance for the year to a range of $9.50 to $9.75 per share and we are also establishing our initial earnings goal for 2004 of $11.50 to $12.00 per share from continuing operations. Higher earnings for 2003 will drive an approximately 200 basis point increase in return on capital, as the Company continues to focus on improving overall returns." 4
Revenues from domestic homebuilding settlements for the quarter increased $521.2 million, or 30%, to a third quarter record of $2.3 billion. Higher revenues for the period resulted from a 19% increase in unit settlements to 8,637, up from 7,280 settlements last year, combined with a 9% increase in average selling price to $263,000 per home. The higher average selling price reflects increases in selling prices realized during the quarter and a favorable change in the mix of product delivered. Third quarter domestic homebuilding pretax income increased 46% to $263.0 million, as compared to prior pretax income of $179.8 million. Pretax income for the period reflects a 120 basis point increase in gross margins from home sales, resulting from higher prices, a favorable product mix and an improvement in overall construction efficiencies. Selling, General & Administrative expenses as a percent of home settlement revenues were up 10 basis points, primarily as a result of startup costs associated with an increased number of new community openings. Land sales during the quarter generated $39.8 million in revenues and $7.2 million in gross profit, as compared to $28.7 million and $6.7 million, respectively, last year. Land sales are an important element of the Company's domestic homebuilding operations, but can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter depending upon the timing of individual transactions. Domestic net new home orders for the quarter were 9,100, an increase of 14% over prior year orders of 8,005 homes. Reported net new home orders for the period are exclusive of 984 homes in backlog acquired as part of the purchase of assets from Sivage-Thomas Homes. Pulte's backlog as of September 30, 2003, was valued at $4.7 billion (16,646 homes), as compared to $3.5 billion (13,675 homes) last year. The Company's financial services operations reported third quarter pre-tax income of $13.4 million, a decrease of 30% from the prior year. Loan originations for the quarter increased 33% to 7,634 loans. Higher mortgage volumes for the period were offset by a less favorable interest rate environment experienced during the quarter. For the quarter, Pulte Mortgage's capture rate was 83%, as compared to 78% last year. For the third quarter, Pulte's International operations reported pre-tax income of $.8 million, as compared to pre-tax income of $.4 million for the comparable period last year. Gains for the quarter reflect improved performance from the Company's operations in Mexico, where a slight increase in average selling price drove enhanced margins and pre-tax income. The Company also reported that it is in the process of evaluating various long-term strategic alternatives with regard to its International operations. "Modest gains in International reflect actions taken to drive performance, rationalize land investments and enhance current returns, while various alternative long-term business strategies are considered," said Mr. Dugas. During the third quarter of 2003, the Company recorded a non-cash, after tax gain of $7.9 million related to the favorable resolution of certain tax matters in connection with its thrift operations, which were discontinued in 1994. NINE-MONTH RESULTS For the nine months ended September 30, 2003, Pulte Homes' net income from continuing operations increased 36% to $369.3 million, as compared to prior year net income of $272.6 million. Diluted earnings per share for the first nine months were $5.91 per share, an increase of 34% over prior year earnings per diluted share of $4.42. Consolidated revenues for the period were $5.9 billion, up from $4.9 billion for the first nine months of last year. Nine-month revenues from domestic homebuilding settlements for the period were $5.6 billion, up 20% over the prior year. Higher revenues for the period resulted from an 8% increase in average selling price to $258,000, combined with an 11% increase in the number of homes closed. The increase in average selling price for the period reflects a combination of price increases and a favorable change in the mix of product closed during the period. 5
Nine-month domestic homebuilding pretax income increased 36% to $599.1 million, as compared to prior year pre-tax income of $440.3 million. Gross margins from home sales for the period increased 140 basis points to 21.4%. This improvement was partially offset by a 10 basis point increase in SG&A expense as a percent of home settlement revenues. Land sales for the period generated $25.1 million in gross margin, as compared to $25.6 million last year. For the first nine months, Pulte's financial services operations reported pre-tax income of $51.4 million, up 8% from prior year pre-tax income of $47.6 million. The improvement was driven by a 31% increase in loan originations and a higher capture rate of approximately 82%, as compared to 77% last year. Pulte's International operations reported net income for the nine months of $.2 million, as compared to pre-tax income of $1.8 million last year. Gains in the Company's Puerto Rico operations were offset by weaker results in Mexico and Argentina.
