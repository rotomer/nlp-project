For the quarter, net income from continuing operations increased 44% to a record $248.0 million, as compared to $172.0 million in 2002. Fourth quarter earnings per diluted share from continuing operations increased 40% to $1.95 (split adjusted), as compared to prior year earnings per diluted share of $1.39 (split adjusted). All "per share" results have been adjusted for the Company's two-for-one stock split that was announced on December 11, 2003, and effective as of January 2, 2004.
Bloomfield Hills, MI, January 28, 2004
     Consolidated fourth quarter revenues for the Company increased 23% to a record $3.1 billion. For the year, Pulte reported record consolidated revenues of $9.0 billion, representing a 21% increase over the prior year and the first time the Company's revenues have topped $9 billion.
     "The strength of our fourth quarter and full year results reflects the success of Pulte's unique segmentation strategy that emphasizes serving all major buyer segments. In addition, we continue to focus on driving more of every revenue dollar to the bottom line," said Richard J. Dugas, Jr., President and CEO of Pulte Homes. "Our success in these areas has also resulted in the Company achieving targeted improvements in returns on equity and invested capital."
     "Given our record backlog, accelerating order rates and improving margins, we are raising our earnings guidance for 2004," added Mr. Dugas. "Based on current market conditions, we project 2004 earnings from continuing operations to be in the range of $6.00 to $6.25 per diluted share, or a growth rate of 22% to 27% over 2003."
 
Fourth Quarter Results
     Revenues from domestic homebuilding settlements for the fourth quarter increased 24% to a record $2.9 billion. Higher revenues for the period were the result of a 6% increase in average selling price to $261,000, combined with a 17% increase in total home deliveries to a fourth quarter record 11,159 houses. The higher average selling price for the period reflects a combination of price increases and changes in the mix of homes delivered.
     Fourth quarter domestic homebuilding pretax income increased 43% to $399.7 million, as compared to prior year pretax income of $278.8 million. Pretax income for the period reflects a 150 basis point increase in gross margins from home sales resulting from price increases realized during the quarter, a favorable product mix and an improvement in overall operating efficiencies. Selling, General & Administrative expenses as a percent of home settlement revenues increased 20 basis points to 8.6%.
     Land sales during the quarter generated $115.3 million in revenues and $40.8 million in gross profits, as compared to $89.8 million and $27.4 million, respectively, in 2002. Land sales are an important component of the Company's domestic homebuilding operations, but can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter depending upon the timing of individual land transactions.
     Domestic net new home orders for the quarter were 8,465, up 31% from the prior year fourth quarter orders of 6,458 homes. Pulte's ending backlog for its domestic operations was valued at $4.1 billion (13,952 homes), as compared to $2.9 billion (10,605 homes) in 2002.
     Fourth quarter pretax income for the Company's financial services operations totaled $17.5 million, down slightly from prior year pretax income of $19.1 million as gains associated with increased loan origination volumes were partially offset by a less favorable interest rate environment. Higher homebuilding volumes, combined with an expanded capture rate of 83%, helped to drive loan production for the period to 9,083 loans.
     For the fourth quarter, Pulte's International operations reported pretax income of $3.1 million, as compared to $3.3 million in 2002. Improved fourth quarter performance in the Company's Mexico and Puerto Rico operations was offset by reduced profitability in Argentina. As previously announced, the Company is in the process of evaluating various long-term strategic alternatives with regard to its International operations.
Full Year Results
     For the year ended December 31, 2003, Pulte Homes' net income from continuing operations increased 39% to $617.3 million, as compared to prior year net income of $444.6 million. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for 2003 were $4.91 per share (split adjusted), an increase of 36% over prior year earnings per diluted share of $3.60. Consolidated revenues for the period were $9.0 billion, up from $7.5 billion in 2002.
     Revenues from domestic homebuilding settlements for 2003 were $8.5 billion, up 21% over the prior year. Higher revenues for the period resulted from a 7% increase in average selling price to $259,000, combined with a 13% increase in the number of homes closed which totaled a record 32,693 homes. The increase in average selling price for the period reflects a combination of price increases and a favorable change in the mix of product closed during the period.
     Domestic homebuilding pretax income for the year increased 39% to a record $998.8 million, as compared to prior year pretax income of $719.0 million. Gross margins from home sales for the period increased 120 basis points to 20.6%. This improvement was partially offset by a 20 basis point increase in SG&A expense as a percent of home settlement revenues. Land sales for the year generated $65.9 million in gross margin, as compared to $53.0 million in 2002.
 
     For 2003, Pulte's financial services operations reported pretax income of $68.8 million, up 3% from prior year pretax income of $66.7 million. The improvement was driven by an increase in loan originations and a higher capture rate of approximately 83%, as compared to 78% in 2002.
     Pulte's International operations reported pretax income for 2003 was $3.3 million, as compared to pretax income of $5.1 million in 2002. Gains in the Company's Puerto Rico operations were offset by weaker results in Mexico and Argentina.
