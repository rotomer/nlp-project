Bloomfield Hills, MI, April 26, 2004
     For the quarter, Pulte's consolidated revenues were $2.04 billion, an increase of 31% over prior year revenues of $1.55 billion.
     "With our unique customer segmentation strategy and an unmatched land pipeline, Pulte is continuing to expand its share of the U.S. housing market as reflected in our 31% increase in net new orders," said Richard J. Dugas, Jr., President and CEO of Pulte Homes. "Given Pulte's strong market position and excellent first-quarter results, we are raising our earnings guidance for 2004 to a range of $7.00 to $7.25 per diluted share, up from prior guidance of $6.00 to $6.25 per diluted share."
     First quarter revenues from domestic homebuilding settlements increased 34% to $1.9 billion. Higher revenues for the period were the result of a 22% increase in closings to 7,039 houses, combined with a 10% increase in average selling price to $276,000. The higher average selling price resulted from favorable changes in the mix of houses closed combined with price increases realized during the quarter.
     First quarter domestic homebuilding pretax income increased 61% to $222.5 million, compared with prior year first quarter pretax income of $138.4 million. Pretax income for the quarter benefited from an approximately 180 basis point improvement in gross margins from home sales to 21.9%
 
reflecting price increases realized during the quarter, a favorable product mix and initiatives to improve overall operating efficiencies. The Company was also successful in lowering domestic homebuilding selling, general & administrative expenses as a percent of home settlement revenues for the quarter by approximately 100 basis points to 10.6%.
     Land sales and related gross profit in the first quarter were $23.1 million and $3.5 million, respectively, compared with $32.9 million and $8.8 million, respectively, in the prior year. Land sales are an important part of Pulte's overall land management strategy, but sales can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter depending upon the timing of individual land transactions.
     Domestic net new home orders for the quarter were 10,751, up 31% over prior year first quarter orders of 8,233 homes. Pulte's ending backlog was valued at a record $5.4 billion (17,664 homes), compared with a value of $3.6 billion (13,053 homes) last year.
     "Our organization remains focused on the four areas we have identified as the drivers to continued business success for Pulte Homes: growth through segmentation, operational excellence, people development and financial discipline," said Dugas. "Our ability to drive sales, to raise prices and margins and to strengthen our overall operations in large part reflects the strides we are making in each area."
     The Company's financial services operations reported first quarter pretax income of $10.1 million, down from prior year pretax income of $17.1 million. Loan originations for the quarter increased 18% to 6,113, but a less favorable interest rate environment and higher overhead costs in support of better customer service combined to lower reported pretax income. Mortgage capture rates for the quarter increased to 86.1%, compared with 80.5% last year.
     For the first quarter, Pulte's International operations reported pretax income of $.2 million, compared with a pretax loss of $1.0 million last year. The Company continues to evaluate various long-term strategic initiatives with regard to its International operations.
