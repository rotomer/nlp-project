      Pulte Homes (NYSE: PHM) announced today record financial results for its second quarter and six months ended June 30, 2004. For the quarter, net income from continuing operations increased 54% to a record $187.7 million, compared with $122.0 million for the prior year second quarter. Second quarter earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $1.45 represent an increase of 48% over prior year earnings of $0.98 per diluted share. Consolidated revenues for the quarter were $2.5 billion, an increase of 29% over prior year revenues of $2.0 billion.
Bloomfield Hills, MI, July 26, 2004
     "Pulte Homes' strong operating performance reflects our continued focus on the key areas of growth through segmentation, operational excellence, people development and financial discipline," said Richard J. Dugas, Jr., President and CEO of Pulte Homes. "We continued to expand market share, while raising prices in a number of markets across the country. Through higher prices and more efficient building practices, we offset the impact of higher raw material costs and have, in fact, been able to significantly increase margins."
     "Given our record backlog totaling almost 20,000 homes and our expectations for continued margin expansion, the Company is again raising its earnings guidance for 2004 continuing operations to the new range of $7.80 to $8.00 per diluted share. This new guidance represents an increase in net income from continuing operations of approximately 70% over last year's results," said Dugas.
Second Quarter Results
     Revenues from domestic homebuilding settlements increased 30% to a second-quarter record of $2.4 billion. Higher revenues for the quarter resulted from a 9% increase in average selling price to $282,000, combined with a 19% increase in home closings to 8,480 homes. The increase in average selling price reflects a combination of price increases and a favorable change in the mix of product closed during the period.
 
     Second quarter domestic homebuilding pretax income increased 61% to $318.1 million, compared with prior year pretax income of $197.6 million. For the period, the Company realized a 130 basis point increase in gross margins from home sales to 22.1%, while SG&A expenses as a percent of home settlement revenues dropped by 100 basis points over the same period last year.
     Land sales during the quarter generated $55.7 million in revenues and $13.6 million in gross margins, compared with $31.3 million and $9.1 million, respectively, last year. Land sales are an important element of Pulte's domestic homebuilding operations, but can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter depending upon the timing of individual transactions.
     Domestic net new home orders for the quarter were a record 10,776, up 17% over prior year second-quarter orders of 9,191 homes. Pulte's backlog as of June 30, 2004, was valued at $6.3 billion (19,960 homes), compared with a value of $4.2 billion (15,199 homes) last year.
     The Company's financial services operations reported second quarter pretax income of $8.4 million, down from prior year pretax income of $20.9 million. Loan originations for the second quarter increased 17% to 7,957 mortgages valued at $1.5 billion, but a less favorable interest rate environment, a product mix shift and higher overhead costs in support of better customer service worked to lower pretax income. Mortgage capture rates for the quarter increased to 88.4%, compared with 83.2% last year.
     For the second quarter, Pulte's International operations reported pretax income of $0.1 million, compared with a pretax income of $0.4 million for the second quarter last year. Improved performance in the Company's Mexico and Puerto Rico operations was offset by reduced closings in Argentina. Pulte continues to evaluate different strategic alternatives with regard to its International operations as part of a broader initiative to drive enhanced financial results.
Six Month Results
     For the six months ended June 30, 2004, Pulte Homes' net income from continuing operations increased 53% to $319.5 million, compared with prior year net income from continuing operations of $208.3 million. Earnings from continuing operations for the first six months were $2.48 per diluted share, an increase of 49% over prior year earnings per diluted share of $1.67. Consolidated revenues for the period were $4.6 billion, up from $3.5 billion for the first six months of last year.
     Revenues from domestic homebuilding settlements for the period were $4.3 billion, up 32% over the prior year. Higher revenues for the period resulted from a 9% increase in average selling price to $279,000, combined with a 20% increase in the number of homes closed. The increase in average selling price for the period reflects a combination of price increases and a favorable change in the mix of product closed during the period.
     Six month domestic homebuilding pretax income increased 61% to $540.6 million, compared with prior year pretax income of $336.1 million. Pretax margins as a percentage of home settlement revenues for the period increased by 230 basis points, driven by a 150 basis point increase in gross margins from home sales and a 90 basis point reduction in SG&A expense as a percent of home settlement revenues. Land sales for the period generated $17.2 million in gross margin, compared with $18.0 million last year.
 
     For the first six months, Pulte's financial services operations reported pretax income of $18.5 million, compared with $38.0 million in the prior year. Loan originations for the six-month period increased 18% to 14,070 mortgages valued at $2.6 billion, but a less favorable interest rate environment and higher overhead costs in support of better customer service worked to lower pretax income. Mortgage capture rates for the period increased to 87.4%, compared with 82.0% last year.
     Pulte's International operations reported pretax income for the first six months of $0.4 million, compared with a pretax loss of $0.6 million last year. Gains in the Company's Mexico and Puerto Rico operations were offset by weaker results in Argentina.
     "A house cannot be moved, so by definition, demand is very local in nature and will vary considerably by market and buyer segment," said Dugas. "Pulte is the country's most diversified builder in terms of markets and customer segments served. This diversity offers critical advantages for driving growth, while also supporting more consistent operating and financial performance. Our record six-month results reflect the benefits of this diversity as we increased sign ups and revenues, while realizing better operating performance."
