FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 Pulte Homes (NYSE: PHM) announced today that it expects third quarter earnings from continuing operations to be in the range of $1.95 to $2.05 per fully-diluted share as compared to previously issued guidance of $2.00 to $2.10 per share. For the full year, the Company expects earnings from continuing operations to be in the range of $7.40 to $7.70 per fully-diluted share. The Company's previous guidance for the year had been in the range of $7.80 to $8.00. The change in guidance is based primarily on lower than expected pricing and unit volume from the Company's operations in Las Vegas.
Bloomfield Hills, MI, October 4, 2004
Pulte also announced that preliminary signups for its third quarter ended September 30, 2004 increased approximately 11 percent over the same period last year. The Company experienced robust sales during the period in many of its markets including the West region, which showed an increase of 3 percent, despite weakness at certain price points within the Company's Las Vegas operations.
"Pulte's Las Vegas operations have raised prices aggressively, with some communities implementing price increases well above the 50% increases experienced in the broader Las Vegas market," said Richard J. Dugas, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer. "Consumer acceptance of these increases at certain price levels has apparently reached a ceiling, suggesting that prices have become higher than what the market will support. Pulte has already implemented actions to lower local market pricing to better align the Company's operations with current market conditions."
Based on the lower sign up and closing volumes that Pulte expects to realize from its Las Vegas operations, the Company has revised its earnings guidance. "Pulte is in position to deliver greater than 50% year-over-year growth in earnings per share," said Dugas. "These results, along with strong new order rates we are experiencing in most of our regions, should enable the Company to drive additional growth in 2005."
