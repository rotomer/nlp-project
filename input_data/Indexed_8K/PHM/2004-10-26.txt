 Pulte Homes, Inc. (NYSE: PHM) announced today record financial results for its third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2004. For the quarter, income from continuing operations increased 61% to a record $259.2 million, compared with $161 million last year. Third quarter earnings from continuing operations increased 55% to $1.99 per diluted share, compared with prior year earnings per diluted share of $1.28. Consolidated revenues for the quarter totaled $3 billion, compared with $2.4 billion last year.
Bloomfield Hills, MI, October 25, 2004
"Pulte's strong third quarter and nine month financial results continue to benefit from our focus on four key areas of operational improvement, namely market share growth through segmentation, operational excellence, people development and financial discipline," said Richard J. Dugas, Jr., President and CEO of Pulte Homes. "Successful implementation of key underlying initiatives has helped to deliver increased sales, higher margins, greater overhead leverage and higher earnings.
"Our strong third quarter results position Pulte to deliver another year of record financial results with 2004 earnings expected to be in the range of the Company's October 4, 2004 guidance of $7.40 to $7.70 per diluted share," said Dugas. "Given Pulte Homes' strong market position and our ability to further expand our share of the U.S. housing market, we expect continued growth in 2005 as earnings from continuing operations increase to the range of $9.00 to $9.50 per diluted share."
As announced on October 4, 2004, Pulte Homes lowered pricing in Las Vegas to better align its communities with pricing in the market. This action was in response to a period of slow sign ups and increased cancellation rates which the Company attributed to its then above-market pricing. On October 4, 2004, the Company issued a press release detailing the impact of lower than expected pricing and unit volume from its Las Vegas operations and the resulting impact on earnings guidance.
Third Quarter Results
Revenues from domestic homebuilding settlements for the quarter increased 24% to $2.8 billion, compared with $2.3 billion in the prior year. Higher revenues for the period resulted from a 12% increase in unit settlements to 9,669 homes, up from 8,637 settlements last year, combined with an 11% increase in average selling price to $291,000 per home. The higher average sales price reflects increases in selling price realized during the quarter and a favorable change in the mix of product delivered.
Third quarter domestic homebuilding pretax income increased to $429.6 million, up from prior year pretax income of $263 million. Gains in pretax income for the period reflect a 310 basis point increase in gross margins from home sales, resulting from higher prices, a favorable product mix and an improvement in overall construction efficiencies. Selling, general & administrative expenses as a percentage of home settlement revenues declined by 40 basis points as the Company continued to achieve greater overhead leverage.
Land sales during the quarter were as expected, generating $69.1 million in revenues and $19.8 million in gross profit, compared with $39.8 million and $7.2 million, respectively, last year. Land sales are an important element of the Company's domestic homebuilding operations, but can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter depending upon the timing of individual transactions.
Domestic net new home orders for the quarter were 10,109, an increase of 11% over prior year orders of 9,100 homes. Reported net new home orders for the third quarter of 2003 are exclusive of 984 homes in backlog acquired as part of the purchase of assets from Sivage-Thomas Homes in July 2003. Pulte's backlog as of September 30, 2004 was valued at $6.4 billion (20,400 homes), compared with $4.7 billion (16,646 homes) last year.
"Our reported net new orders were up a strong 11% for the quarter, even with the issues we faced in Las Vegas," said Dugas. "Excluding Las Vegas, Pulte's net new orders were up 24% over last year, and we would note that response to our new pricing has been positive and has resulted in a significant increase in buyer interest and sales activity in Las Vegas."
The Company's financial services operations reported third quarter pretax income of $11.3 million, a decrease of 16% from the prior year. Loan originations for the quarter increased 16% to 8,846 loans; however, higher mortgage volumes were offset by a less favorable interest rate environment and a continued shift in product mix. For the quarter, Pulte Mortgage's capture rate was 87.3%, compared with 83.1% last year.
For the third quarter, Pulte's International operations reported pretax income of $1.6 million, compared with pretax income of $800 thousand for the same period last year. Gains for the quarter reflect improved performance from the Company's operations in Puerto Rico and Argentina, offset by a reduction in closings in Pulte's Mexico operations. Pulte continues to evaluate different strategic alternatives with regard to its International operations as part of a broader initiative to drive enhanced financial results.
During the third quarter of 2004, the Company recorded a non-cash, after tax gain of $10.8 million related to the favorable resolution of certain tax matters in connection with its thrift operations, which were discontinued in 1994.
Nine-Month Results
For the nine months ended September 30, 2004, Pulte Homes' net income from continuing operations increased 57% to $578.7 million, compared with prior year net income of $369.3 million. Earnings per diluted share from continuing operations for the first nine months were $4.47 per share, an increase of 52% over prior year earnings per diluted share of $2.95. Consolidated revenues for the period were $7.5 billion, up from $5.9 billion for the first nine months of last year.
Nine-month revenues from domestic homebuilding settlements for the period were $7.2 billion, up 29% over the prior year. Higher revenues for the period resulted from a 10% increase in average selling price to $284,000, combined with a 17% increase in the number of homes closed. The increase in average selling price for the period reflects a combination of price increases and a favorable change in the mix of product closed during the period.
Nine-month domestic homebuilding pretax income increased 62% to $970.3 million, compared with prior year pretax income of $599.1 million. Gross margins from home sales for the period increased 210 basis points to 22.6%. Reflecting the Company's focus on realizing better overhead leverage, selling, general & administrative expenses as a percent of home settlement revenues decreased by 70 basis points, compared with the prior year. Land sales for the period generated $36.9 million in gross margin, compared with $25.1 million last year.
For the nine-month period, Pulte's financial services operations reported pretax income of $29.8 million, down from prior year pretax income of $51.4 million. Loan originations for the nine-month period increased 17% to 22,916 mortgages valued at $4.4 billion, but a less favorable interest rate environment, a shift in product mix and higher overhead costs in support of better customer service had a negative impact on pretax income. Mortgage capture rate for the period increased to 87.3%, compared with 82.4% last year.
Pulte's International operations reported pretax income for the nine months of $2 million, as higher closings in Mexico helped to increase pretax income from $200 thousand last year.
