Media Relations
     - Pulte Homes, Inc. (NYSE: PHM) today announced record financial results for its fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2004. For the quarter, income from continuing operations increased 68% to a record $418.2 million, compared with $248.5 million in 2003. Fourth quarter earnings from continuing operations increased 64% to $3.20 per diluted share, compared with prior year earnings from continuing operations of $1.95 per diluted share. Consolidated fourth quarter revenues for the Company increased 35% to a record $4.2 billion.
Bloomfield Hills, MI, February 2, 2005
     For the year, Pulte Homes reported record consolidated revenues of $11.7 billion, an increase of 30% over the prior year and the first time the Company's revenues have topped $11 billion. Full year earnings from continuing operations rose 56% to $7.67 per diluted share, compared with $4.93 in the prior year. Pulte's financial results for the fourth quarter and the full years of 2004 and 2003 have been adjusted to reflect the previously announced sale of the Company's Argentina operations in early January 2005. As of December 31, 2004, Pulte's Argentina operations have been classified as held for sale and presented as discontinued operations.
 
     "Pulte's fourth quarter results complete a record breaking year in which our revenues increased 30% to more than $11.7 billion, while our earnings from continuing operations increased 56% to a record $7.67 per diluted share," said Richard J. Dugas, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer. "As strong as 2004 was, Pulte is entering 2005 in an even better position with a record backlog valued at $5.2 billion and a strong land pipeline capable of supporting our growth targets for 2005."
     "Given our record backlog, solid demand environment and robust community pipeline, we are reaffirming previous guidance for 2005 earnings from continuing operations of $9.00 to $9.50 per diluted share, representing a year-over-year increase of 17% to 24%," said Dugas.
Fourth Quarter Results
     Revenues from domestic homebuilding settlements for the fourth quarter increased 35% to a record $3.9 billion. Higher revenues for the period were the result of a 13% increase in average selling price to $294,000 combined with a 20% increase in total home deliveries to a fourth quarter record of 13,424 homes. The higher average selling price for the period reflects a combination of price increases realized during the quarter and changes in the mix of homes delivered.
     Fourth quarter domestic homebuilding pretax income increased 66% to $663.2 million, compared with prior year pretax income of $399.7 million. Pretax income for the period benefited from a 180 basis point increase in gross margins from home settlements resulting from higher prices, a favorable product mix and an improvement in overall operating efficiencies. Selling, General & Administrative expenses as a percent of home settlement revenues dropped 110 basis points to 7.5%.
     Land sales during the quarter generated $157.5 million in revenues and $62.9 million in gross profits, compared with $115.3 million and $40.8 million, respectively, in 2003. Land sales are an important component of the Company's domestic homebuilding operations, but can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter depending upon the timing of individual land transactions.
     Domestic net new home orders for the quarter were 8,940, up 6% from the prior year fourth quarter orders of 8,465 homes. "Demand remained strong during the quarter, with our domestic operations delivering a 6% increase in net new sign ups," said Dugas. "Order activity in Las Vegas responded as planned following price adjustments announced in October, but the anticipated higher cancellation rates experienced during the period distort reported fourth quarter net sign ups. Excluding the Las Vegas market, Pulte's fourth quarter net new home orders increased 17% over the prior year."
     Pulte's ending backlog for its domestic operations was valued at $5.2 billion, an increase of 24% over the prior year. Year end unit backlog was 15,916 homes, an increase of 14% compared with 13,952 at the end of 2003.
     Fourth quarter pretax income for the Company's financial services operations totaled $17.7 million, up slightly from prior year pretax income of $17.5 million as gains associated with increased loan origination volumes were partially offset by a less favorable interest rate environment and higher overhead costs associated with initiatives to drive better customer service. Higher homebuilding volumes, combined with a 550 basis point increase in capture rate
 
to 88.8%, helped drive loan production for the period to 12,316 loans, representing $2.4 billion in principal value.
     For the fourth quarter, Pulte's International operations reported pretax income of $6.6 million, compared with $4 million in 2003. Increased unit closings and revenues in the Company's Mexico and Puerto Rico operations drove the improved performance for the quarter. Pulte continues to evaluate different strategic alternatives with regard to its International operations as part of a broader initiative to drive enhanced financial results. As part of this process, Pulte Homes sold all of its Argentina operations in early January 2005. Although the sale was completed subsequent to the close of 2004, as a result of this transaction, the Company reported Pulte Argentina as a Discontinued Operation in the fourth quarter and recorded an after-tax charge of approximately $20.6 million.
Full Year Results
     For the year ended December 31, 2004, Pulte Homes' income from continuing operations increased 61% to $998 million, compared with prior year income of $619.2 million. Earnings from continuing operations for 2004 were $7.67 per diluted share, an increase of 56% over prior year earnings from continuing operations of $4.93 per diluted share. Consolidated revenues for 2004 were a record $11.7 billion, up from $9 billion in 2003. Pulte's earnings for the fourth quarter and the full years of 2004 and 2003 have been adjusted to reflect the sale of the Company's Argentina operations, which are now reported as held for sale and presented as discontinued operations.
     Revenues from domestic homebuilding settlements for 2004 increased 31% to $11.1 billion. Higher revenues for the period resulted from an 11% increase in average selling price to $287,000 combined with an 18% increase in the number of homes closed which totaled a record 38,612 homes. The increase in average selling price for the period reflects a combination of price increases and a favorable change in the mix of product closed during the period.
     Domestic homebuilding pretax income for the year increased 64% to a record $1.6 billion, compared with prior year pretax income of $998.8 million. Gross margins from home sales for the period increased 200 basis points to 22.6%, while Selling, General & Administrative costs as a percentage of settlement revenues dropped 90 basis points to 8.8%. Land sales for the year generated $99.8 million in gross margin, compared with $65.9 million in 2003.
     For 2004, Pulte's financial services operations reported pretax income of $47.4 million, a decrease of 31% from prior year pretax income of $68.8 million, as gains associated with increased loan origination volumes were offset by a less favorable interest rate environment and higher overhead costs associated with initiatives to drive better customer service. Higher homebuilding volumes, combined with a 580 basis point increase in capture rate to 87.8%, helped drive loan originations for the period to 35,232 loans, representing $6.7 billion in principal value.
     Pulte's International operations reported pretax income for 2004 was $10.4 million, compared with pretax income of $6.3 million in 2003. Increased unit closings and revenues in the Company's Mexico and Puerto Rico operations drove the improved performance for the year.
