- Pulte Homes, Inc. (NYSE: PHM) announced today record financial results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2005. First quarter income from continuing operations was a record $218.3 million, an increase of 65% over prior year first quarter income of $132.2 million. First quarter earnings from continuing operations of $1.66 per diluted share represents an increase of 63% over prior year earnings from continuing operations of $1.02 per diluted share.
Bloomfield Hills, MI, April 27, 2005
For the quarter, Pulte's consolidated revenues were $2.55 billion, an increase of 26% over prior year revenues of $2.03 billion.
"We are extremely pleased with the performance of our operations in the first quarter, particularly in the areas of revenue growth, margin expansion and our 22% increase in the value of first quarter orders," said Richard J. Dugas, Jr., President and CEO of Pulte Homes. "Given the strength of our first quarter results, combined with a record backlog and opportunities to further expand Pulte Homes' share of the new home market, we are in an excellent position to deliver record earnings in 2005. We now expect full year 2005 earnings to be in the range of $9.35 to $9.85 per diluted share, up from prior guidance of $9.00 to $9.50 per diluted share."
First quarter revenues from domestic homebuilding settlements increased 27% to $2.5 billion. Higher revenues for the period were the result of a 14% increase in closings to 8,019 homes, combined with an 11% increase in average selling price to $307,000. The higher average selling price resulted from favorable changes in the mix of houses closed combined with price increases realized during the quarter.
First quarter domestic homebuilding pretax income increased 62% to $359.6 million, compared with prior year first quarter pretax income of $222.5 million. Pretax income for the quarter benefited from an approximately 270 basis point improvement in gross margins from home sales to 24.6%. Margin expansion was driven by price increases realized during the quarter, a favorable product mix and initiatives to improve overall operating efficiencies. The Company was also successful in lowering domestic homebuilding selling, general & administrative expenses as a percent of home settlement revenues for the quarter by approximately 30 basis points to 10.3%.
Land sales and related gross profit in the first quarter were essentially unchanged at $24.2 million and $3.4 million, respectively, compared with $23.1 million and $3.5 million, respectively, in the prior year. Land sales are an important part of Pulte Homes' overall land management strategy, but sales can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter depending upon the timing of individual land transactions.
Domestic net new home orders for the quarter were 12,067, up 12% over prior year first quarter orders of 10,751 homes. The Company's ending backlog was valued at a record $6.5 billion (totaling 19,964 homes), compared with a value of $5.4 billion (17,664 homes) last year.
"Our results continue to benefit from Pulte Homes' strategy of serving all major buyer segments including first time, first and second move up and particularly in active adult through our Del Webb brand," said Mr. Dugas. "As the year progresses, we will continue to see the impact of efforts begun several years ago to expand the Del Webb brand into new cities, as we introduce these spectacular communities in such markets as Detroit, Denver, Jacksonville and Charlotte."
The Company's financial services operations reported first quarter pretax income of $10.1 million, compared with prior year pretax income of $10.1 million. Loan originations for the first quarter increased 24% to 7,592 mortgages.
For the first quarter, Pulte's International operations reported pretax income of $1.3 million, compared with pretax income of $787 thousand last year. First quarter results for both years have been adjusted to reflect the previously announced sale of the Company's Argentina operations in January 2005.
