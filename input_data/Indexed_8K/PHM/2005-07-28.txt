Bloomfield Hills, MI, July 27, 2005
     "Pulte Homes' unique customer segmentation strategy and our unmatched position with active adult buyers are enabling the Company to further expand its share of the U.S. housing market as reflected in our 26 percent increase in sign ups," said Richard J. Dugas, Jr., President and CEO of Pulte Homes. "As a result of our record year-to-date results and expectations for continued strength in our operations, the Company is again raising its 2005 earnings guidance for continuing operations to the new range of $10.00 to $10.50 per diluted share," said Dugas.
     In a separate release issued today, Pulte Homes announced that its Board of Directors has declared a two-for-one stock split to be effected in the form of a 100 percent stock dividend. The additional shares of common stock will be distributed on September 1, 2005, to the shareholders of record as of August 15, 2005. The effect of this stock split will be reflected in the Company's third quarter financial results.

Second Quarter Results
     Revenues from domestic homebuilding settlements increased 32% to a second-quarter record of $3.2 billion. Higher revenues for the quarter resulted from a 20% increase in home closings to 10,194 homes, combined with a 10% increase in average selling price to $310,000. The increase in average selling price reflects a combination of price increases and changes in the mix of product closed during the period.
     Second quarter domestic homebuilding pretax income increased 57% to $498.5 million, compared with prior year pretax income of $318.1 million. For the period, the Company realized a 170 basis point increase in gross margins from home sales to 23.8%, while SG&A expenses as a percent of home settlement revenues dropped by 80 basis points from the same period last year.
     Land sales during the quarter generated $57.5 million in revenues and $4 million in gross margins, compared with $55.7 million and $13.6 million, respectively, last year. Land sales are an important element of Pulte's domestic homebuilding operations, but can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter depending upon the timing of individual transactions.
     Domestic net new home orders for the quarter were a record 13,581 homes, valued at $4.4 billion, up 26% and 33%, respectively, over prior year second-quarter results. Pulte's backlog as of June 30, 2005, was valued at $7.8 billion (23,351 homes), compared with a value of $6.3 billion (19,960 homes) last year.
     The Company's financial services operations reported second quarter pretax income of $15.5 million, up 86% from prior year pretax income of $8.4 million. Higher pretax income for the quarter was driven by a 19% increase in originations to 9,445 loans valued at $1.8 billion, combined with a more favorable interest rate environment. Mortgage capture rate for the quarter was 88.0%, compared with 88.4% last year.
     For the second quarter, Pulte's International operations reported pretax loss of $478,000, compared with pretax income of $1.4 million last year. Higher costs for the period offset improved performance in the Company's Mexico and Puerto Rico operations. Pulte continues to evaluate different strategic alternatives with regard to its International operations as part of a broader initiative to drive enhanced financial results.
Six Month Results
     For the six months ended June 30, 2005, Pulte Homes' income from continuing operations increased 63% to $522.1 million, compared with prior year income from continuing operations of $320.6 million. Earnings from continuing operations for the first six months were $3.97 per diluted share, an increase of 59% over prior year earnings of $2.49 per diluted share. Consolidated revenues for the period were $5.8 billion, up from $4.5 billion for the first six months of last year.
 
     Revenues from domestic homebuilding settlements for the period were a record $5.6 billion, up 30% over the prior year. Higher revenues for the period resulted from a 10% increase in average selling price to $308,000, combined with a 17% increase in the number of homes closed. The increase in average selling price for the period reflects a combination of price increases and a change in the mix of product closed during the period.
     Six month domestic homebuilding pretax income increased 59% to $858.1 million, compared with prior year pretax income of $540.6 million. Pretax margins as a percentage of home settlement revenues for the period increased 280 basis points to 15.3%, driven by a 210 basis point increase in gross margins from home sales and a 60 basis point reduction in SG&A expense as a percent of home settlement revenues. Land sales for the period generated $7.4 million in gross margin, compared with $17.2 million last year.
     For the first six months, Pulte's financial services operations reported pretax income of $25.6 million, compared with $18.5 million in the prior year. Higher loan originations for the six-month period, up 21% to 17,037 mortgages valued at $3.3 billion, and a more favorable interest rate environment helped to drive the improved performance. Mortgage capture rate for the period increased to 88.3%, compared with 87.4% last year.
     Pulte's International operations reported pretax income for the first six months of $782,000, compared with pretax income of $2.2 million last year. Gains in the Company's Puerto Rico operations were offset by lower pretax income from Mexico.
     "We are very pleased by the record results Pulte has delivered for the second quarter and first half of 2005, " said Dugas. "We continue to believe our diversification strategy in terms of markets and customers served is critical to driving sustained growth and more consistent operating and financial performance."
