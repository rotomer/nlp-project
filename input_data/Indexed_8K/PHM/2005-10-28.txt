For the quarter, income from continuing operations increased 50% to a record $387.7 million, compared with $259.1 million last year. Third quarter earnings from continuing operations increased 48% to $1.47 per diluted share, compared with prior year earnings of $.99 per diluted share. Earnings per share for both periods have been adjusted for the Company's previously announced 2:1 stock split effective September 1, 2005.
Bloomfield Hills, MI, October 26, 2005
     Pulte Homes's consolidated revenues for the quarter totaled $3.8 billion, compared with $3 billion last year.
     "Pulte's record third quarter results include a 48% increase in earnings per share, $4 billion in new orders and a backlog valued at $8 billion," said Richard J. Dugas, Jr., President and CEO of Pulte Homes. "Pulte's financial results reflect the benefits we continue to gain from our diversified operations, from initiatives to drive improved operating performance and our financial discipline."
     "Given the strength of our year-to-date performance, Pulte expects to deliver another year of excellent financial results with full-year 2005 earnings in the range of $5.35 to $5.45 per diluted share," said Dugas. "Beyond 2005, Pulte's unique strategy of serving all buyer segments: first time, first and second move up and active adult, should enable the company to further expand its share of the U.S. housing market."
     In a separate release, Pulte Homes announced that its Board of Directors had increased the Company's share buyback authorization by $100 million. "Pulte had used substantially all of the funds available under its existing repurchase authorization," said Roger A. Cregg,

Third Quarter Results
     Revenues from domestic homebuilding settlements for the quarter increased 32% to $3.7 billion, compared with $2.8 billion in the prior year. Higher revenues for the period resulted from a 21% increase in unit settlements to 11,747 homes, up from 9,669 settlements last year, combined with a 9% increase in average selling price to $317,000 per home. The higher average sales price reflects increases in selling price realized during the quarter and a favorable change in the mix of product delivered.
     Third quarter domestic homebuilding pretax income increased 44% to $618 million, up from prior year pretax income of $429.6 million. Pretax income for the period benefited from higher revenues partially offset by an increase in material costs, combined with a 160 basis point decrease in selling, general & administrative expenses as a percentage of home settlement revenues reflecting the Company's continued efforts to drive greater overhead leverage.
     Land sales during the quarter generated $25.1 million in revenues and $1.4 million in gross profit, compared with $69.1 million and $19.8 million, respectively, last year. Land sales are an important element of the Company's domestic homebuilding operations, but can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter depending upon the timing of individual transactions.
     Domestic net new home orders for the quarter were 12,062, an increase of 19% over prior year orders of 10,109 homes. Pulte's backlog as of September 30, 2005 was valued at $8 billion (23,666 homes), compared with $6.4 billion (20,400 homes) last year.
     The Company's financial services operations reported third quarter pretax income of $19 million, an increase of 69% from the prior year. Higher loan originations for the quarter, up 24% to 10,985 loans, combined with a more favorable interest rate environment during the quarter drove the gains. For the quarter, Pulte Mortgage's capture rate was 88.8%, compared with 87.3% last year.
     For the third quarter, Pulte's International operations reported pretax income of $1.4 million, compared with pretax income of $1.6 million for the same period last year. Pulte continues to evaluate different strategic alternatives with regard to its International operations as part of a broader initiative to drive enhanced financial results.
     During the third quarter of 2005, the Company recorded a non-cash, after tax gain of $7.8 million in discontinued operations related to the favorable resolution of certain tax matters in connection with its thrift operations, which were discontinued in 1994.
Nine-Month Results
     For the nine months ended September 30, 2005, Pulte Homes's income from continuing operations increased 57% to $910 million, compared with prior year net income of $579.8 million. Earnings from continuing operations for the first nine months were $3.46 per diluted share, an increase of 54% over prior year earnings of $2.24 per diluted share. Earnings per share for both periods have been adjusted for the Company's previously announced 2:1 stock split effective September 1, 2005. Consolidated revenues for the period were $9.7 billion, up from $7.5 billion for the first nine months of last year.
     Nine-month revenues from domestic homebuilding settlements for the period were $9.3 billion, up 31% over the prior year. Higher revenues for the period resulted from a 10% increase in average selling price to $312,000, combined with a 19% increase in the number of homes closed. The increase in average selling price for the period reflects a combination of price increases and a favorable change in the mix of product closed during the period.

     For the nine-month period, Pulte's financial services operations reported pretax income of $44.7 million, up from prior year pretax income of $29.8 million.
