(NYSE: PHM) today announced record financial results for its fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2005. For the quarter, income from continuing operations increased 28% to a record $531.7 million, compared with $415.2 million in 2004. Fourth quarter earnings from continuing operations increased 28% to $2.03 per diluted share, compared with prior year earnings from continuing operations of $1.59 per diluted share. Quarterly and annual earnings per share for both years have been adjusted for the Company's 2:1 stock split effected September 1, 2005 and for the reclassification of Pulte's Mexico business to Discontinued Operations following its sale as announced on December 27, 2005. Consolidated fourth quarter revenues for the Company increased 24% to $5.1 billion. For the full year 2005, Pulte Homes reported record consolidated revenues of $14.7 billion, an increase of 28% over the prior year. Full year earnings from continuing operations gained 43% to $5.47 per diluted share, compared with $3.82 in the prior year. "We are very pleased with Pulte's fourth quarter and full year operating and financial results," said Richard J. Dugas, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer. "The strength of Pulte's diversified 1
business model, particularly our customer segment diversity that includes an unmatched position serving the exploding Active Adult population with our Del Webb brand, once again allowed Pulte to post excellent new order growth that is among the strongest in our industry. Fundamentally, our strategy of serving all major buyer segments and geographies offers opportunities for increased growth and more consistent financial performance." "Through the scale, scope and diversification advantages Pulte maintains, we see opportunity for further growth in 2006. We continue to target 2006 earnings growth of roughly 10% to 15%, which is in-line with current guidance for earnings of $6.00 to $6.25 per share," said Dugas. In a separate release, Pulte Homes announced that its Board of Directors has authorized the Company to repurchase up to an additional $200 million of its outstanding stock. "During the fourth quarter of 2005, we repurchased approximately $102 million worth of our outstanding shares, which used all but approximately $20 million of the previous authorization," said Roger A. Cregg, Executive Vice President and CFO. "Given current market conditions, we see an opportunity to invest in our business through the purchase of land assets and our own stock." FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS Revenues from homebuilding settlements for the fourth quarter increased 28% to a record $5 billion. Higher revenues for the period were the result of a 9% increase in average selling price to $321,000 combined with a 17% increase in total home deliveries to 15,670 homes. The higher average selling price for the period reflects a combination of price increases realized during the quarter and changes in the mix of homes delivered. Fourth quarter homebuilding pretax income increased 23% to $820.5 million, compared with prior year pretax income of $664.8 million. Pretax income for the period benefited from a 130 basis point decrease in Selling, General & Administrative expenses as a percent of home settlement revenues, partially offset by a 40 basis point decrease in gross margins from home settlements. In addition, land sales during the quarter generated $9.3 million in gross profits, compared with $62.9 million in 2004. Land sales are an important component of the Company's domestic homebuilding operations, but can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter depending upon the timing of individual land transactions. The dollar value of net new home orders for the quarter was $3.3 billion, or 9,821 homes, up 24% from the prior year fourth quarter order value of $2.7 billion, or 8,940 homes. Ending backlog for Pulte's homebuilding operations was valued at $6.3 billion, an increase of 22% over the prior year. Yearend unit backlog totaled 17,817 homes, an increase of 12% compared with 15,916 at the end of 2004. Fourth quarter pretax income for the Company's financial services operations totaled $25.9 million, compared with prior year pretax income of $17.7 million. The 47% increase in pretax income was driven by an increase in loan originations and a more favorable interest rate environment. Higher homebuilding volumes, combined with a 180 basis point increase in capture rate to 90.6%, helped drive loan production for the period to 14,972 loans, representing $3 billion in principal value. Effective with the sale of Pulte Mexico as announced on December 27, 2005, Pulte's Mexican business operations were reclassified into Discontinued Operations. In addition, the Company recorded fourth quarter income in discontinued operations associated with the previously announced judgment in the Company's breach of contract case against the United States government. As reported in a November 18, 2005 press release, the company received $48.7 million from the conclusion of this case, with the funds to be used for general corporate purposes. 2
FULL YEAR RESULTS For the year ended December 31, 2005, Pulte Homes' income from continuing operations increased 45% to $1.4 billion, compared with prior year income of $993.6 million. Earnings from continuing operations for 2005 were $5.47 per diluted share, an increase of 43% over prior year earnings from continuing operations of $3.82 per diluted share. Annual earnings per share for both years have been adjusted for the Company's 2:1 stock split effected September 1, 2005 and for the reclassification of Pulte's Mexico business operations to Discontinued Operations following the sale of its homebuilding operations announced on December 27, 2005. Consolidated revenues for 2005 were a record $14.7 billion, up 28% from $11.5 billion in 2004. Revenues from homebuilding settlements for 2005 increased 30% to $14.4 billion. Higher revenues for the period resulted from a 10% increase in average selling price to $315,000 combined with an 18% increase in the number of homes closed which totaled a record 45,630 homes. The increase in average selling price for the period reflects a combination of price increases and a favorable change in the mix of product closed during the period. Homebuilding pretax income for the year increased 41% to a record $2.3 billion, compared with prior year pretax income of $1.6 billion. Gross margins from home sales for the period increased 80 basis points to 23.4%, while Selling, General & Administrative costs as a percentage of settlement revenues dropped approximately 110 basis points to 7.7%. Land sales for the year generated $18.2 million in pretax income, compared with $99.8 million in 2004. For 2005, Pulte's financial services operations reported pretax income of $70.6 million, an increase of 49% over prior year pretax income of $47.4 million. Higher homebuilding volumes, combined with a 140 basis point increase in capture rate to 89.2%, helped drive loan originations for the period to 42,994 loans, representing $8.5 billion in principal value.
