Certain terms used herein are defined in Section 17 hereof. 1. Representations and Warranties. The Company represents and warrants to, and agrees with, each Underwriter as set forth below in this Section 1. (a) The Company meets the requirements for use of Form S-3 under the Act and has prepared and filed with the Commission a registration statement (the file number of which is set forth in Schedule I hereto) on Form S-3, including a related basic prospectus, for registration under the Act of the offering and sale of the Securities which is effective under the Act (including any amendments thereto filed prior to the Applicable Time). The Company may have filed one or more amendments thereto, including a Preliminary Final Prospectus, each of which has previously been furnished to you. The Company will file with the Commission a Final Prospectus Supplement relating to the Securities, which shall contain all information required by the Act and the rules thereunder to be included in such Final Prospectus Supplement similar in all substantive respects to the most recent Preliminary Final Prospectus and shall contain only such information as (i) may be included in the final term sheet as prepared and filed with the Commission pursuant to Section 5(a) of this Agreement and (ii) such specific additional information and other changes (beyond that contained in the most recent Preliminary Final Prospectus) as the Company has advised you, prior to the Applicable Time, will be included or made therein. The Registration Statement, at the Applicable Time (and, if any Option Securities are purchased, at the Date of Delivery), meets the requirements set forth in Rule 415(a)(1)(x). (b) (1) At the time of filing the Registration Statement, (2) at the time of the most recent amendment thereto for the purposes of complying with Section 10(a)(3) of the Act (whether such amendment was by post-effective amendment, incorporated report filed pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act or form of prospectus), (3) at the time the Company or any person acting on its behalf (within the meaning, for this clause only, of Rule 163(c)) made any offer relating to the Securities in reliance on the exemption of Rule 163 and (4) at the date hereof, the Company was and is a "well-known seasoned issuer" as defined in Rule 405. The Registration Statement is an "automatic shelf registration statement," as defined in Rule 405, and the Securities, since their registration on the Registration Statement, have been and remain eligible for registration by the Company on a Rule 405 "automatic shelf registration statement". The Company has not received from the Commission any notice pursuant to Rule 401(g)(2) objecting to the use of the automatic shelf registration statement form. (c) At the time of filing the Registration Statement, at the earliest time thereafter that the Company or another offering participant made a bona fide offer (within the meaning of Rule 164(h)(2)) of the Securities and at the date hereof, the Company was not and is not an "ineligible issuer," as defined in Rule 405, without taking account of any determination by the Commission pursuant to Rule 405 that it is not necessary that the Company be considered an "ineligible issuer." 2
(d) Any offer that is a written communication relating to the Securities made prior to the filing of the initial Registration Statement by the Company or any person acting on its behalf (within the meaning, for this paragraph only, of Rule 163(c)) has been filed with the Commission in accordance with the exemption provided by Rule 163 and otherwise complied with the requirements of Rule 163, including without limitation the legending requirement, to qualify such offer for the exemption from Section 5(c) of the Act provided by Rule 163. (e) Each Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, as of its issue date and at all subsequent times through the completion of the public offer and sale of the Securities or until any earlier date that the issuer notified or notifies the Underwriters as described in Section 5(l), did not, does not and will not include any information that conflicted, conflicts or will conflict with the information contained in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, including any document incorporated by reference therein and any preliminary or other prospectus deemed to be a part thereof that has not been superseded or modified. (f) (i) The Registration Statement complied and will comply in all material respects on the Effective Date and on the Closing Date (and, if any Option Securities are purchased, at the Date of Delivery), and any amendment to the Registration Statement filed after the date hereof will comply in all material respects when filed with the Commission, to the requirements of the Act, the Exchange Act and the Trust Indenture Act, as applicable; (ii) the most recent Preliminary Prospectus complied, and the Final Prospectus (and any supplement thereto) will comply, in all material respects when filed with the Commission pursuant to 424(b) and on the Closing Date (and, if any Option Securities are purchased, at the Date of Delivery) to the requirements of the Act; (iii) the documents incorporated by reference in the most recent Preliminary Prospectus or the Final Prospectus complied, and any further documents to be filed and so incorporated will comply, when filed with the Commission, in all material respects to the requirements of the Exchange Act or the Act, as applicable; (iv) each Issuer Free Writing Prospectus complied or will comply in all material respects to the requirements of the Act on the date of first use, and the Company has complied with any filing requirements applicable to such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus pursuant to the Act; and (v) on the Effective Date and on the Closing Date (and, if any Option Securities are purchased, at the Date of Delivery), the Indenture did and will comply in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Trust Indenture Act, and upon due execution and delivery of the Supplemental Indenture, the Indenture will so comply. (g) On the Effective Date and at the Applicable Time (and, if any Option Securities are purchased, at the Date of Delivery), the Registration Statement did not or will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading; on the Effective Date and on the Closing Date (and, if any Option Securities are purchased, at the Date of Delivery) the Indenture did or will comply in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Trust Indenture Act and the rules thereunder; the Disclosure Package did not, or as of the Applicable Time (and, if any Option Securities are purchased, at the Date of Delivery) will not, contain any untrue 3
statement of material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading; when considered together with the Disclosure Package as of the Applicable Time (and, if any Option Securities are purchased, at the Date of Delivery), each Issuer Free Writing Prospectus (i) when considered together with the Disclosure Package as of the Applicable Time, and (ii) as of its issue date and as of the Closing Date (and, if any Option Securities are purchased, at the Date of Delivery) did not or will not contain any untrue statement of material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading; and, on the Effective Date, the Final Prospectus, if not filed pursuant to Rule 424(b), will not, and on the date of any filing pursuant to Rule 424(b) and on the Closing Date (and, if any Option Securities are purchased, at the Date of Delivery), the Final Prospectus (together with any supplement thereto) will not, include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; provided, however, that the Company makes no representations or warranties as to (i) that part of the Registration Statement which shall constitute the Statement of Eligibility and Qualification (Form T-1) under the Trust Indenture Act of the Trustee or (ii) the information contained in or omitted from the Registration Statement, the Final Prospectus (or any supplement thereto) or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representative specifically for inclusion in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Final Prospectus (or any supplement thereto). If there occurs an event or development as a result of which the Disclosure Package would include an untrue statement of a material fact or would omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances then prevailing, not misleading, the Company will notify promptly the Underwriters so that any use of the Disclosure Package may cease until it is amended or supplemented. (h) The documents incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference in the Final Prospectus at the time they were or hereafter are filed with the Commission complied and will comply in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder, and, when read together with the other information in the Final Prospectus, at the time each was issued and on the Closing Date (and, if any Option Securities are purchased, at the Date of Delivery), did not and will not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading.

(j) All the issued and outstanding equity interests of each subsidiary of the Company have been duly and validly authorized and issued and are fully paid and nonassessable, and, except as otherwise set forth in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus, all issued and outstanding equity interests of such subsidiaries are owned by the Company either directly or through wholly-owned subsidiaries, free and clear of any perfected security interest or any other security interests, claims, liens or encumbrances of any kind. None of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Subsidiary Guarantors was issued in violation of any preemptive or similar rights arising by operation of law, or under the charter or by-laws of such Subsidiary Guarantor or under any agreement to which the Company or such Subsidiary Guarantor is a party. (k) Each of the Company and its subsidiaries has been duly incorporated and is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is chartered or organized with full corporate power and authority to own or lease, as the case may be, and to operate its properties and conduct its business as described in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus, and is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing under the laws of each jurisdiction which requires such qualification; except in such jurisdictions in which the failure to so qualify would not have a Material Adverse Effect or a material adverse effect on the enforceability of this Agreement, the Indenture, the Securities or any of the Guarantees. (l) The Company's authorized equity capitalization is as set forth in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus; and the Securities conform in all material respects to the description thereof contained in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus; and, except as set forth in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus, no options, warrants, or other rights to purchase, agreements or other obligations to issue, or rights to convert any obligations into or exchange any securities for, shares of capital stock of or ownership interests in the Company are outstanding. (m) (i) The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby; (ii) the Company and each Subsidiary Guarantor has all requisite power and authority to execute, deliver and perform each of its obligations under the Indenture; and (iii) the Company and each of the Subsidiary Guarantors has all requisite power and authority to execute, deliver and perform each of its obligations under the Securities. (n) (i) This Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company; (ii) the Indenture meets the requirements for qualification under the Trust Indenture Act and has been duly and validly authorized and, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery thereof by the Trustee, when executed and delivered by the Company, will constitute a legal, valid, binding instrument enforceable against the Company and each Subsidiary Guarantor in accordance with its terms (subject, as to the 5
enforcement of remedies, to applicable bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium or other laws affecting creditors' rights generally from time to time in effect and to general principles of equity); (iii) the Securities have been duly and validly authorized by the Company and, when executed by the Company and each Subsidiary Guarantor party thereto and authenticated by the Trustee in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture and when delivered to and paid for by the Underwriters in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Indenture, will have been duly executed, issued and delivered and will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company, entitled to the benefits of the Indenture, and enforceable against the Company and each Subsidiary Guarantor in accordance with their respective terms (subject, as to the enforcement of remedies, to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or other laws affecting creditors' rights generally from time to time in effect and to general principles of equity); and (iv) the Guarantees have been duly and validly authorized, executed and delivered by the Subsidiary Guarantors, and when such Guarantees are executed and endorsed upon the Securities and delivered in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, such Guarantees will constitute valid binding obligations of the Subsidiary Guarantors entitled to the benefits of the Indenture, enforceable against the Subsidiary Guarantors in accordance with their terms (subject, as to the enforcement of remedies, to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or other laws affecting creditors' rights generally from time to time in effect and to general principles of equity). (o) There is no franchise, contract or other document of a character required to be described in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Final Prospectus, or to be filed as an exhibit thereto, which is not described or filed as required; (p) The Company is not and, after giving effect to the offering and sale of the Securities and the application of the proceeds thereof as described in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus, will not be an "investment company" as defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. (q) No consent, approval, authorization, filing with or order of any court or governmental agency or body is required in connection with the transactions contemplated herein, except such as have been obtained under the Act and the Trust Indenture Act and such as may be required under the blue sky laws of any jurisdiction in connection with the purchase and distribution of the Securities by the Underwriters in the manner contemplated herein and in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus. (r) Neither the execution and delivery of the Indenture, this Agreement, the issue and sale of the Securities, the Guarantees, nor the consummation of any other of the transactions herein or therein contemplated, nor the fulfillment of the terms hereof or thereof will, whether with or without the giving of notice or passage of time or both, conflict with, result in a breach or violation or default or imposition of any lien, charge or encumbrance upon any property or assets of the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor pursuant to, (i) the charter or by-laws of the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor; (ii) the terms of any indenture, contract, lease, mortgage, deed of trust, note agreement, loan agreement, or other agreement, obligation, condition, covenant or instrument to which the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor is a party or bound or to which its or their 6
property is subject; or (iii) any statute, law, rule, regulation, judgment, order or decree applicable to the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor or any court, regulatory body, administrative agency, governmental body, arbitrator or other authority having jurisdiction over the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor or any of its or their properties, other than, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) above only, such breaches, violations, defaults, liens, charges or encumbrances which, singly or in the aggregate, would not have a Material Adverse Effect. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement, the Indenture, the issue and sale of the Securities and, in the case of the Subsidiary Guarantors, the Guarantees, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein and therein (including the issuance and sale of the Securities and the use of the proceeds from the sale of the Securities as described in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus under the caption "Use of Proceeds") and compliance by each of the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors with its obligations hereunder and thereunder will not, whether with or without the giving of notice or passage of time or both, conflict with or constitute a breach of, or default or Repayment Event (as defined below) under, or result in the creation or imposition of any lien, charge or encumbrance upon any property or assets of the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor pursuant to, the Agreements and Instruments, except for such conflicts, breaches or defaults or liens, charges or encumbrances that, singly or in the aggregate, would not result in a Material Adverse Effect, nor will such action result in a breach or violation of the provisions of the charter or bylaws of the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor or any applicable law, statute, judgment, writ, decree, order, rule or regulation applicable to it or any of its properties, assets or operations. As used herein, a "Repayment Event" means any event or condition which gives the holder of any note, debenture or other evidence or indebtedness (or any person acting on such holders' behalf) the right to require the repurchase, redemption or repayment of all or a portion of such indebtedness by the Company or any of its subsidiaries. (s) No holders of securities of the Company have rights to the registration of such securities under the Registration Statement. (t) The consolidated historical financial statements and schedules of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries included in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus and the Registration Statement present fairly in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Company as of the dates and for the periods indicated, comply as to form with the applicable accounting requirements of the Act and have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods involved (except as otherwise noted therein). The selected consolidated financial data set forth under the caption "Selected Consolidated Financial Information" in the Final Prospectus, the Disclosure Package and Registration Statement fairly present, on the basis stated in the Final Prospectus, the Disclosure Package and the Registration Statement, the information included therein. (u) No action, suit or proceeding by or before any court or governmental agency, authority or body or any arbitrator involving the Company or any of its subsidiaries or its or their property is pending or, to the best knowledge of the Company, threatened that (i) 7
is required to be disclosed in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus, (ii) could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the performance of this Agreement, the Indenture, or the Securities, or the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby; or (iii) could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. All pending legal or governmental proceedings to which the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor is a party or of which any of their respective property assets is the subject which are not described in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus, including ordinary routine litigation incidental to the business, could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. There are no contracts or documents of the Company or any of its subsidiaries which are required to be filed as exhibits to the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus by the Securities Act which have not been so filed. (v) Each of the Company and each of its subsidiaries owns or leases all such properties as are necessary to the conduct of its operations as presently conducted. (w) Neither the Company nor any subsidiary is in violation or default of (i) any provision of its charter or bylaws, (ii) the terms of any indenture, contract, lease, mortgage, deed of trust, note agreement, loan agreement or other agreement, obligation, condition, covenant or instrument to which it is a party or bound or to which its property is subject, or (iii) any statute, law, rule, regulation, judgment, order or decree of any court, regulatory body, administrative agency, governmental body, arbitrator or other authority having jurisdiction over the Company or such subsidiary or any of its properties, as applicable, other than, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) above only, such violations or defaults which, singly or in the aggregate, would not have a Material Adverse Effect. (x) Ernst & Young, LLP, who have certified certain financial statements of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries and delivered their report with respect to the audited consolidated financial statements and schedules included in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus, are independent public accountants with respect to the Company within the meaning of the Act and the applicable published rules and regulations thereunder. (y) The Company and its subsidiaries have filed all foreign, federal, state and local tax returns that are required to be filed or has requested extensions thereof (except in any case in which the failure so to file would not have a Material Adverse Effect), and has paid all taxes required to be paid by it and any other assessment, fine or penalty levied against it, to the extent that any of the foregoing is due and payable, except for any such assessment, fine or penalty that is currently being contested in good faith and by appropriate proceedings, and for which the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors, as applicable, have provided adequate charges, accruals and reserves in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or as would not have a Material Adverse Effect. There is no tax deficiency or actual or proposed tax assessment that has been asserted against the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor that would have, singly or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. 8
(z) No labor problem or dispute with the employees of the Company or any of its subsidiaries exists or, to the Company's knowledge, is threatened or imminent, and the Company is not aware of any existing labor disturbance by the employees of any of its or its subsidiaries' principal suppliers, contractors or customers, that could have a Material Adverse Effect, except as set forth in or contemplated in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto). (aa) The Company and each of its subsidiaries are insured by insurers of recognized financial responsibility against such losses and risks and in such amounts as are prudent and customary in the businesses in which they are engaged; all policies of insurance and fidelity or surety bonds insuring the Company or any of its subsidiaries or their respective businesses, assets, employees, officers and directors are in full force and effect; the Company and its subsidiaries are in compliance with the terms of such policies and instruments in all material respects; and there are no claims by the Company or any of its subsidiaries under any such policy or instrument as to which any insurance company is denying liability or defending under a reservation of rights clause; neither the Company nor any such subsidiary has been refused any insurance coverage sought or applied for; and neither the Company nor any such subsidiary has any reason to believe that it will not be able to renew its existing insurance coverage as and when such coverage expires or to obtain similar coverage from similar insurers as may be necessary to continue its business at a cost that would not have a Material Adverse Effect, except as set forth in or contemplated in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto). (bb) No subsidiary of the Company is currently prohibited, directly or indirectly, from paying any dividends to the Company, from making any other distribution on such subsidiary's capital stock, from repaying to the Company any loans or advances to such subsidiary from the Company or from transferring any of such subsidiary's property or assets to the Company or any other subsidiary of the Company, except as described in or contemplated by the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus. There is no tax deficiency or actual or proposed tax assessment that has been asserted against the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor that would have, singly or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. (cc) The Company and its subsidiaries possess all licenses, certificates, permits and other authorizations issued by the appropriate federal, state or foreign regulatory authorities necessary to conduct their respective businesses, and neither the Company nor any such subsidiary has received any notice of proceedings relating to the revocation or modification of any such certificate, authorization or permit which, singly or in the aggregate, if the subject of an unfavorable decision, ruling or finding, would have a Material Adverse Effect, except as set forth in or contemplated in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto). (dd) The Company and each of its subsidiaries maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that (i) transactions are executed in accordance with management's general or specific authorizations; (ii) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in 9
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles and to maintain asset accountability; (iii) access to assets is permitted only in accordance with management's general or specific authorization; and (iv) the recorded accountability for assets is compared with the existing assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences. (ee) The Company has not taken, directly or indirectly, any action designed to or that would constitute or that might reasonably be expected to cause or result in, under the Exchange Act or otherwise, stabilization or manipulation of the price of any security of the Company to facilitate the sale or resale of the Securities. (ff) The Company and its subsidiaries are (i) in compliance with any and all applicable foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of human health and safety, the environment or hazardous or toxic substances or wastes, pollutants or contaminants ("Environmental Laws"), (ii) have received and are in compliance with all permits, licenses or other approvals required of them under applicable Environmental Laws to conduct their respective businesses and (iii) have not received notice of any actual or potential liability for the investigation or remediation of any disposal or release of hazardous or toxic substances or wastes, pollutants or contaminants, except where such non-compliance with Environmental Laws, failure to receive required permits, licenses or other approvals, or liability would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect, except as set forth in or contemplated in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto). Except as set forth in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus, neither the Company nor any of the subsidiaries has been named as a "potentially responsible party" under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended. (gg) In the ordinary course of its business, the Company periodically reviews the effect of Environmental Laws on the business, operations and properties of the Company and its subsidiaries, in the course of which it identifies and evaluates associated costs and liabilities (including, without limitation, any capital or operating expenditures required for clean-up, closure of properties or compliance with Environmental Laws, or any permit, license or approval, any related constraints on operating activities and any potential liabilities to third parties). On the basis of such review, the Company has reasonably concluded that such associated costs and liabilities would not, singly or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect, except as set forth in or contemplated in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto). (hh) Each of the Company and its subsidiaries has fulfilled its obligations, if any, under the minimum funding standards of Section 302 of the United States Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"), and the regulations and published interpretations thereunder with respect to each "plan" (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA and such regulations and published interpretations) in which employees of the Company and its subsidiaries are eligible to participate and each such plan is in compliance in all material respects with the presently applicable provisions of ERISA and such regulations and published interpretations. The Company and its subsidiaries have 10
not incurred any unpaid liability to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (other than for the payment of premiums in the ordinary course) or to any such plan under Title IV of ERISA. (ii) Other than First Heights Holding Corp., Pulte Financial Companies, Inc., Pulte Mortgage LLC (formerly Pulte Mortgage Corporation), Pulte Diversified Companies Inc. and North American Builders Indemnity Corporation, the Subsidiary Guarantors are the only significant subsidiaries of the Company as defined by Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X.

Delivery and Payment. (a) Delivery of and payment for the Initial Securities shall be made on the date and at the time specified in Schedule I hereto or at such time on such later date not more than three Business Days after the foregoing date as the Representative shall designate, 13

(C) in any other circumstances which do not require the publication by the Company of a prospectus pursuant to Article 3 of the Prospectus Directive. For the purposes of this provision, the expression "an offer of the Securities to the public" in relation to any Securities in any Relevant Member State means the communication in any form and by any means of sufficient information on the terms of the offer and the Securities to be offered so as to enable an investor to decide to purchase or subscribe the Securities, as the same may be varied in that Member State by any means implementing the Prospectus Directive in that Member State, and the expression "Prospectus Directive" means Directive 2003/71/EC and includes any relevant implementing measure in each Relevant Member State.

The Company will cause the final term sheet substantially in the form of Exhibit A attached hereto to be filed in a form approved by the Representative with the Commission pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Act within the time period prescribed, and such final term sheet will be a Permitted Free Writing Prospectus for purposes of this Agreement.

The Company will promptly file with the Commission any amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or the Final Prospectus that may, in the judgment of the Company after consultation with the Representative, be required by the Act or the Commission. The Company will promptly advise the Representative (i) when the final term sheet shall have been filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Act, (ii) when the Final Prospectus, and any supplement thereto, shall have been filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Act, (iii) when, prior to termination of the offering of the Securities, any amendment to the Registration Statement shall have been filed or become effective, (iv) of any request by the Commission or its staff for any amendment of the Registration Statement, or any Rule 15

The Company will use its best efforts to prevent the issuance of any such stop order or the suspension of any such qualification and, if issued, to obtain as soon as possible the withdrawal thereof, including if necessary by filing an amendment to the Registration Statement or a new registration statement and using its best efforts to have such amendment or new registration statement declared effective. (b) If, at any time when a prospectus relating to the Securities is required to be delivered under the Act, any event occurs as a result of which the Final Prospectus as then supplemented would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein in the light of the circumstances under which they were made not misleading, or if it shall be necessary to amend the Registration Statement or supplement the Final Prospectus to comply with the Act or the Exchange Act or the respective rules thereunder, the Company promptly will (1) notify the Representative of such event, (2) prepare and file with the Commission, subject to the second sentence of paragraph (a) of this Section 5, an amendment or supplement which will correct such statement or omission or effect such compliance and (3) supply any supplemented Final Prospectus to you in such quantities as you may reasonably request. (c) As soon as practicable, the Company will make generally available to its security holders and to the Representative an earnings statement or statements of the Company and its subsidiaries which will satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Act and Rule 158 under the Act. (d) The Company will furnish to the Representative and counsel for the Underwriters, without charge, signed copies of the Registration Statement (including exhibits thereto) and to each other Underwriter a copy of the Registration Statement (without exhibits thereto) and, so long as delivery of a prospectus by an Underwriter or dealer may be required by the Act, as many copies of each Preliminary Final Prospectus, if any, and the Final Prospectus and any supplement thereto and each Issuer Free Writing Prospectus as the Representative may reasonably request. The Company will pay the expenses of printing or other production of all documents relating to the offering. (e) The Company will arrange, if necessary, for the qualification of the Securities for sale under the laws of such jurisdictions as the Representative may designate, will maintain such qualifications in effect so long as required for the distribution of the 16
Securities and will pay any fee of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., in connection with its review of the offering; provided that in no event shall the Company be obligated to qualify to do business in any jurisdiction where it is not now so qualified or to take any action that would subject it to service of process in suits, other than those arising out of the offering or sale of the Securities, in any jurisdiction where it is not now so subject. The Company will promptly advise the Representative of the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of the Securities for sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose and use its best efforts to obtain the withdrawal or lifting of such suspension at the earliest possible time. (f) The Company will not, without the prior written consent of the Representative, offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge, or otherwise dispose of, (or enter into any transaction which is designed to, or might reasonably be expected to, result in the disposition (whether by actual disposition or effective economic disposition due to cash settlement or otherwise) by the Company or any affiliate of the Company or any person in privity with the Company or any affiliate of the Company) directly or indirectly, including the filing (or participation in the filing) of a registration statement with the Commission in respect of, or establish or increase a put equivalent position or liquidate or decrease a call equivalent position within the meaning of Section 16 of the Exchange Act, any debt securities issued or guaranteed by the Company (other than the Securities) or publicly announce an intention to effect any such transaction, until the Business Day set forth on Schedule I hereto. (g) The Company will not take and will cause its controlled affiliates (within the meaning of Rule 144 under the Act) not to take, directly or indirectly, any action designed to or that would constitute or that might reasonably be expected to cause or result in, under the Exchange Act or otherwise, stabilization or manipulation of the price of any security of the Company to facilitate the sale or resale of the Securities. (h) The Company will cooperate with the Representative and use its best efforts to permit the Securities to be eligible for clearance and settlement through The Depository Trust Company. (i) The Company will use the net proceeds received by it from the sale of the Securities solely in the manner specified in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus under the caption "Use of Proceeds". (j) The Company represents and agrees that, unless it obtains the prior consent of the Representative, and the Representative represents and agrees that, unless it obtains the prior consent of the Company, it has not made and will not make any offer relating to the Securities that would constitute an "issuer free writing prospectus," as defined in Rule 433, or that would otherwise constitute a "free writing prospectus," as defined in Rule 405, required to be filed with the Commission; provided, however, prior to the preparation of the final term sheet in accordance with Section 5(a), the Underwriters are authorized to use the information with respect to the final terms of the Securities in communications conveying information relating to the offering to investors. Any such 17
free writing prospectus consented to by the Company and the Representative is hereinafter referred to as a "Permitted Free Writing Prospectus." The Company represents that it has treated or agrees that it will treat each Permitted Free Writing Prospectus as an "issuer free writing prospectus," as defined in Rule 433, and has complied and will comply with the requirements of Rule 164 and Rule 433 applicable to any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, including timely filing with the Commission where required, legending and record keeping. (k) If at any time following issuance of an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus there occurred or occurs an event or development as a result of which such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus conflicted or would conflict with the information contained in the Registration Statement (or any other registration statement relating to the Securities) or Final Prospectus or any preliminary prospectus or included or would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or would omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances prevailing at that subsequent time, not misleading, the Company will promptly notify the Representative and will promptly amend or supplement, at its own expense, such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus to eliminate or correct such conflict, untrue statement or omission. (l) The registration statement relating to the Securities is an "automatic shelf registration statement," as defined in Rule 405, that initially became effective within three years of the date hereof. If immediately prior to the third anniversary (the "Renewal Deadline") of the initial Effective Date of the automatic shelf registration statement relating to the Securities, any of the Securities remain unsold by the Underwriters, the Company will prior to the Renewal Deadline file, if it has not already done so and is eligible to do so, a new automatic shelf registration statement relating to the Securities, in a form satisfactory to the Representative. If the Company is no longer eligible to file an automatic shelf registration statement, the Company will prior to the Renewal Deadline, if it has not already done so, file a new shelf registration statement relating to the Securities, in a form satisfactory to the Representative, and will use its best efforts to cause such registration statement to be declared effective within 180 days after the Renewal Deadline. The Company will take all other action necessary or appropriate to permit the public offering and sale of the Securities to continue as contemplated in the expired registration statement relating to the Securities. References herein to the Registration Statement relating to the Securities shall include such new automatic shelf registration statement or such new shelf registration statement, as the case may be. (m) The Company has not received from the Commission any notice pursuant to Rule 401(g)(2) objecting to use of the automatic shelf registration statement form. If at any time when Securities remain unsold by the Underwriters the Company receives from the Commission a notice pursuant to Rule 401(g)(2) or otherwise ceases to be eligible to use the automatic shelf registration statement form, the Company will (i) promptly notify the Representative, (ii) promptly file a new registration statement or post-effective amendment on the proper form relating to the Securities, in a form satisfactory to the Representative, (iii) use its best efforts to cause such registration statement or post-effective amendment to be declared effective as soon as practicable, and (iv) promptly notify the Representative of such effectiveness. The Company will take all other action 18
necessary or appropriate to permit the public offering and sale of the Securities to continue as contemplated in the registration statement that was subject of the Rule 401(g)(2) notice or for which the Company has otherwise become ineligible. References herein to the registration statement relating to the Securities shall include such new registration statement or post-effective amendment, as the case may be. (n) The Company shall pay or have paid the required Commission filing fees relating to the Securities within the time required by Rule 456(b)(1) without regard to the proviso therein and otherwise in accordance with Rules 456(b) and 457(r). (o) The Company has not distributed, and will not distribute or authorize or permit any person acting on its behalf to, prior to the later of the Closing Time and the termination of the Underwriters' distribution of the Securities, any offering material in connection with the offering and sale of the Securities other than (A) the Registration Statement, (B) the Basic Prospectus, (C) any preliminary prospectus, (D) the Final Prospectus, (E) any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus reviewed and consented to by the Representative pursuant to this Agreement or (F) any free writing prospectus that the Company and the Representative agree to treat as part of the Disclosure Package. (p) The Company will use its best efforts to effect the listing of the Securities, prior to the Closing Date, on the New York Stock Exchange. (q) The Company agrees not to, and to ensure that no "affiliate" (as defined in Rule 501(b) of the Act) of the Company will, sell, offer for sale or solicit offers to buy or otherwise negotiate in respect of any "security" (as defined in the Act) that would be integrated with the sale of the Securities. (r) The Company agrees to comply with the representation letter of the Company to DTC relating to the approval of the Securities by DTC for "book entry" transfer. (s) For so long as the Underwriter shall hold any of the Securities, the Company agrees to furnish to the Underwriter copies of all reports and other communications (financial or otherwise) furnished by the Company to the Trustee or to the holders of the Securities and, as soon as available, copies of any reports or financial statements furnished to or filed by the Company with the Commission or any national securities exchange on which any class of securities of the Company may be listed. 6.

(g) Subsequent to the Applicable Time, there shall not have been any decrease in the rating of any of the Company's debt securities by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" (as defined for purposes of Rule 436(g) under the Act) or any notice given or announcement made of any intended or potential decrease in any such rating or of a possible change in any such rating that does not indicate the direction of the possible change.

(k) Subsequent to the date of the most recent financial statements in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any amendment or supplement thereto after the date hereof), other than as described in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus or contemplated hereby or thereby, neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries shall have incurred any liabilities or obligations, direct or contingent not in the ordinary course of business that are material to the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or entered into any transactions not in the ordinary course of business that are material to the business, condition (financial or other) or results of operations or prospects of the Company, taken as a whole, and there shall not have been any adverse change in the capital stock or long-term indebtedness of the Company or any of its subsidiaries that is material to the business, condition (financial or other) or results of operations or prospects of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole. (l) On the Closing Date and on each Date of Delivery, the Securities shall be rated at least Baa3 by Moody's Investor's Service Inc. and BBB- by Standard & Poor's Corporation, and the Company shall have delivered to the Underwriters a letter, dated the Closing Date or the Date of Delivery, as applicable, from each such rating agency, or other evidence satisfactory to the Underwriters, confirming that the Securities have such ratings; and since the date hereof, there shall not have been any decrease in the rating of any of the Company's debt securities by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" (as defined for purposes of Rule 436(g) under the Securities Act) or any notice given of any intended or potential decrease in any such rating or of a possible change in any such rating that does not indicate the direction of the possible change.

Indemnification and Contribution. (a) The Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors, jointly and severally, agree to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, the directors, officers, employees and agents of each Underwriter and each person who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or other Federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in (A) the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Final Prospectus, the Final Prospectus, the Disclosure Package or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, (B) any "issuer information" used or referred to in any "free writing prospectus" (as defined in Rule 405 under the Act) used or referred to by the Underwriter, (C) any "road show" (as defined in Rule 433 under the Act) not constituting an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or (D) any blue sky application or other document prepared or executed by the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor (or based upon an written information furnished by the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor) specifically for the purpose of qualifying any or all of the notes under the securities laws of any state or other jurisdiction (any such application, document or information being hereinafter called a "Blue Sky Application"); or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state in any such documents a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; provided, however, that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representative specifically for inclusion therein. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability that the Company may otherwise have. (b) Each Underwriter severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who signs the Registration Statement, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, but only with reference to written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representative specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability that any Underwriter may otherwise have. The Company acknowledges that the statements set forth (i) in the last paragraph of the cover page regarding delivery of the Securities and, (ii) under the heading "Underwriting" (a) the list of Underwriters and their respective participation in the sale of the Securities, (b) the sentences related to concessions and reallowances and (c) the paragraph related to stabilization, syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids in any Preliminary Final Prospectus and the 29
Final Prospectus constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the several Underwriters for inclusion in any Preliminary Final Prospectus or the Final Prospectus. (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 8 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 8, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel of the indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); provided, however, that such counsel shall be satisfactory to the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. An indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding. (d) In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors and the Underwriters severally agree to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending same) (collectively "Losses") to which the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors on the one hand and by the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities; provided, however, that in no case shall any Underwriter (except as may be provided in any agreement among underwriters relating to the offering of the Securities) be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount or commission applicable to 30
the Securities purchased by such Underwriter hereunder. If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors and the Underwriters severally shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company or the Subsidiary Guarantors on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Benefits received by the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by it, and benefits received by the Underwriters shall be deemed to be equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions, in each case as set forth on the cover page of the Final Prospectus. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the Company or the Subsidiary Guarantors on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 8, each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee and agent of an Underwriter shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of the Company who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (d). 9. Default by an Underwriter. If any one or more Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Securities agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter or Underwriters hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the principal amount of Securities set forth opposite their names in Schedule II hereto bears to the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase; provided, however, that in the event that the aggregate principal amount of Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth in Schedule II hereto, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Securities, and if such nondefaulting Underwriters do not purchase all the Securities, this Agreement will terminate without liability to any nondefaulting Underwriter or the Company. In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 9, the Closing Date or the Date of Delivery, as applicable, shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding five Business Days, as the Representative shall determine in order that the required changes in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus or in any other documents or 31
arrangements may be effected. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Company and any nondefaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder. 10. Termination. This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Representative, by notice given to the Company prior to delivery of and payment for the Securities, if at any time prior to such time (i) trading in the Company's Common Stock shall have been suspended by the Commission or the New York Stock Exchange or trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange shall have been suspended or limited or minimum prices shall have been established on such Exchange, (ii) there shall have occurred a material disruption in clearance or settlement systems in the United States, (iii) a banking moratorium shall have been declared either by Federal or New York State authorities or (iv) there shall have occurred any material adverse change in the financial markets in the United States or the markets for investment grade securities in the United States outbreak or escalation of hostilities, declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war, or other calamity or crisis the effect of which on financial markets is such as to make it, in the sole judgment of the Representative, impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or delivery of the Securities as contemplated by the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any amendment or supplement thereto). 11. Representations and Indemnities to Survive. The respective agreements, representations, warranties, indemnities and other statements of the Company or its officers and of the Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or the Company or any of the officers, directors, employees, agents or controlling persons referred to in Section 8 hereof, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Securities. The provisions of Sections 7 and 8 hereof shall survive the termination or cancellation of this Agreement. 12. No Advisory or Fiduciary Relationship. The Company acknowledges and agrees that (a) the purchase and sale of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement, including the determination of the public offering price of the Securities and any related discounts and commissions, is an arm's-length commercial transaction between the Company on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, (b) in connection with the offering contemplated hereby and the process leading to such transaction the Underwriters are and have been acting solely as a principal and is not the agent or fiduciary of the Company, or its stockholders, creditors, employees or any other party, (c) the Underwriters have not assumed nor will they assume an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in favor of the Company with respect to the offering contemplated hereby or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether the Underwriters have advised or are currently advising the Company or any of its affiliates on other matters) and the Underwriters do not have any obligation to the Company with respect to the offering contemplated hereby except the obligations expressly set forth in this Agreement, (d) the Underwriters and its affiliates may be engaged in a broad range of transactions that involve interests that differ from those of the Company, and (e) the Underwriters have not provided any legal, accounting, regulatory or tax advice with respect to the offering contemplated hereby and the Company has consulted its own legal, accounting, regulatory and tax advisors to the extent it deemed appropriate. 32

(b) Restrictions on Transfer of a Certificated Note for a Beneficial Interest in a Global Note. A Certificated Note may not be exchanged for a beneficial interest in a Global Note except upon satisfaction of the requirements set forth below. Upon receipt by the Trustee of a Certificated Note, duly endorsed or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form reasonably satisfactory to the Company and the Registrar, together with written instructions directing the Trustee to make, or to direct the Trustee to make, an adjustment on its books and records with respect to such Global Note to reflect an increase in the aggregate principal amount of the Notes represented by the Global Note, such instructions to contain information regarding the Depositary account to be credited with such increase, then the Trustee shall cancel such Certificated Note and cause, or direct the Trustee to cause, in accordance with the standing instructions and procedures existing between the Depositary and the Trustee, the aggregate principal amount of Notes represented by the Global Note to be increased by the aggregate principal amount of the Certificated Note to be exchanged and shall credit or cause to be credited to the account of the Person specified in such instructions a beneficial interest in the Global Note equal to the principal amount of the Certificated Note so canceled. If no Global Notes are then outstanding and the Global Note has not been previously exchanged for Certificated Notes pursuant to Section 4.02 of this Indenture Supplement, the Company shall issue and the Trustee shall authenticate, upon written order of the Company in the form of an Officers' Certificate, a new Global Note in the appropriate principal amount. (c) Transfer and Exchange of Global Notes. (i) The transfer and exchange of Global Notes or beneficial interests therein shall be effected through the Depositary, in accordance with this Indenture Supplement (including applicable restrictions on transfer set forth herein, if any) and the procedures of the Depositary therefor. A transferor of a beneficial interest in a Global Note shall deliver a written order given in accordance with the Depositary's procedures containing information regarding the participant account of the Depositary to be credited with a beneficial interest in such Global Note or another Global Note and such account shall be credited in accordance with such order with a beneficial interest in the applicable Global Note and the account of the Person making the transfer shall be debited by an amount equal to the beneficial interest in the Global Note being transferred. (ii) If the proposed transfer is a transfer of a beneficial interest in one Global Note to a beneficial interest in another Global Note, the Registrar shall reflect on its books and records the date and an increase in the principal amount of the Global Note to which such interest is being transferred in an amount equal to the principal amount of the interest to be so transferred, and the Registrar shall reflect on its books and records the date and a corresponding decrease in the principal amount of Global Note from which such interest is being transferred. (iii) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Indenture Supplement (other than the provisions set forth in Section 4.02 of this Indenture Supplement), a Global Note -8-
may not be transferred as a whole except by the Depositary to a nominee of the Depositary or by a nominee of the Depositary to the Depositary or another nominee of the Depositary or by the Depositary or any such nominee to a successor Depositary or a nominee of such successor Depositary. (d) Cancellation or Adjustment of Global Note. At such time as all beneficial interests in a Global Note have either been exchanged for Certificated Notes, transferred, redeemed, repurchased or canceled, such Global Note shall be returned by the Depositary to the Trustee for cancellation or retained and canceled by the Trustee. At any time prior to such cancellation, if any beneficial interest in a Global Note is exchanged for Certificated Notes, transferred in exchange for an interest in another Global Note, redeemed, repurchased or canceled, the principal amount of Notes represented by such Global Note shall be reduced and an adjustment shall be made on the books and records of the Trustee (if it is then the custodian for such Global Note) with respect to such Global Note, by the Trustee or the custodian, to reflect such reduction. (e) Obligations with Respect to Transfers of Notes. (i) To permit registrations of transfers and exchanges, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate, Certificated Notes and Global Notes at the Registrar's request. (ii) No service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any transfer tax, assessments, or similar governmental charge payable in connection therewith (other than any such transfer taxes, assessments or similar governmental charge payable upon exchange or transfer pursuant to Sections 906, 1107 and 1305 of the Indenture). (iii) Prior to the due presentation for registration of transfer of any Note, the Company, the Trustee, the Paying Agent or the Registrar may deem and treat the Person in whose name a Note is registered as the absolute owner of such Note for the purpose of receiving payment of principal of and interest on such Note and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not such Note is overdue, and none of the Company, the Trustee, the Paying Agent or the Registrar shall be affected by notice to the contrary. (iv) The Company shall not be required to make and the Registrar need not register transfers or exchanges of Notes selected for redemption (except, in the case of Notes to be redeemed in part, the portion thereof not to be redeemed) or any Notes for a period of 15 days before the mailing of a notice of redemption of Notes to be redeemed. (v) All Notes issued upon any transfer or exchange pursuant to the terms of this Indenture Supplement shall evidence the same debt and shall be entitled to the same benefits under the Indenture as the Notes surrendered upon such transfer or exchange. (f) No Obligation of the Trustee. (i) The Trustee shall have no responsibility or obligation to any beneficial owner of a Global Note, a member of, or a participant in the Depositary or any other Person with respect to the accuracy of the records of the Depositary or its nominee or of -9-
any participant or member thereof, with respect to any ownership interest in the Notes or with respect to the delivery to any participant, member, beneficial owner or other Person (other than the Depositary) of any notice (including any notice of redemption or repurchase) or the payment of any amount, under or with respect to such Notes. All notices and communications to be given to the Holders and all payments to be made to Holders under the Notes shall be given or made only to the registered Holders (which shall be the Depositary or its nominee in the case of a Global Note).

May 16, 2006 Page 2 Senior Note Guarantees and the execution and delivery by the Guarantors thereof were authorized by resolutions duly adopted by the board of directors (or similar governing body) of each Guarantor (the "Guarantor Resolutions"). The 2046 Senior Notes will be issued pursuant to an indenture supplement (the "Indenture Supplement") to be entered into under the Indenture (the "Senior Indenture") dated as of October 24, 1995 between the Company and J.P. Morgan Trust Company, National Association, as Trustee (the "Trustee"), as previously amended by thirteen indenture supplements thereto. A Prospectus Supplement dated May 10, 2006 (the "Prospectus Supplement") relating to the 2046 Senior Notes and the 2046 Senior Note Guarantees was filed with the SEC on May 12, 2006. In rendering the opinions expressed below, we have examined and relied upon a copy of the Registration Statement, the exhibits filed therewith and the Prospectus Supplement. We have also examined originals, or copies of originals certified to our satisfaction, of such agreements, documents, certificates and statements of government officials and other instruments, and have examined such questions of law and have satisfied ourselves to such matters of fact, as we have considered relevant and necessary as a basis for this letter. We have assumed the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the genuineness of all signatures, the legal capacity of all persons and the conformity with the original documents of any copies thereof submitted to us for examination. Based on the foregoing, we are of the opinion that: 1. The 2046 Senior Notes will be legally issued and binding obligations of the Company (subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer or other laws of general applicability relating to or affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and by the effect of general principles of equity, regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) when: (i) the Indenture Supplement relating thereto shall have been executed and delivered by the Company, each of the Guarantors and the Trustee and (ii) the 2046 Senior Notes shall have been duly executed and authenticated and issued as provided in the Senior Indenture, the Indenture Supplement, the Board Resolutions and the Finance Committee Resolutions and shall have been duly delivered to the purchasers thereof against payment of the agreed consideration therefor. 2. The 2046 Senior Note Guarantees will be legally issued and binding obligations of the Guarantors (subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer or other laws of general applicability relating to or affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and by the effect of general principles of equity, regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) when: (i) the Indenture Supplement relating thereto shall have been executed and delivered by the Company, each of the Guarantors and the Trustee; (ii) the 2046 Senior Notes to which the 2046 Senior Note Guarantees relate shall have been duly issued as set forth in paragraph 1 above; (iii) the 2046 Senior Note Guarantees shall have been duly executed, countersigned and issued in accordance
[SIDLEY LOGO] Pulte Homes, Inc. May 16, 2006 Page 3 with the Senior Indenture, the Indenture Supplement and the Guarantor Resolutions and shall have been delivered to the purchasers of the 2046 Senior Notes to which such 2046 Senior Note Guarantees relate against payment of the agreed consideration therefor. For the purposes of this letter, we have assumed that, at the time of the issuance, sale and delivery of each 2046 Senior Notes and the 2046 Senior Note Guarantees: (i) such 2046 Senior Notes and the 2046 Senior Note Guarantees being offered will be issued and sold as contemplated in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus Supplement; (ii) the terms of any 2046 Senior Notes or 2046 Senior Note Guarantees will not violate any applicable law or result in a default under or breach of any agreement or instrument binding upon the Company or any Guarantor, and will comply with any requirements or restrictions imposed by any court or governmental body having jurisdiction over the Company or any Guarantor; (iii) the authorization thereof by the Company or the Guarantors will not have been modified or rescinded, and there will not have occurred any change in law affecting the validity, legally binding character or enforceability thereof; (iv) the Senior Indenture will not have been modified or amended subsequent to the date of the Indenture Supplement; and (v) the Articles of Incorporation of the Company or any Guarantor (or similar governing instrument), as currently in effect, will not have been modified or amended and will be in full force and effect. We have further assumed that each Indenture Supplement will be governed by the laws of the State of New York. With respect to any instrument or agreement executed or to be executed by any party, we have assumed, to the extent relevant to the opinions set forth herein, that (i) such party (if not a natural person) has been duly formed or organized and is validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of formation or organization and (ii) such party has full right, power and authority to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under each instrument or agreement to which it is a party and each such instrument or agreement has been duly authorized (if applicable), executed and delivered by, and is a valid, binding and enforceable agreement or obligation, as the case may be, of such party. We have also assumed that no event has occurred or will occur that would cause the release of the Guarantee by any Guarantor under the terms of the Senior Indenture. We hereby consent to the filing of this letter as an Exhibit to the Registration Statement and to all references to our firm included in or made a part of the Registration Statement. In giving such consent, we do not thereby admit that we are in the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act or the rules or regulations promulgated thereunder.
