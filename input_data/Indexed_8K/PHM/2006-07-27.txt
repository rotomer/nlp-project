EXHIBIT 99.1
           Pulte Homes (NYSE: PHM) announced today financial results for its second quarter and six months ended June 30, 2006. For the quarter, income from continuing operations declined 20% to $243.9 million, compared with $305.2 million for the prior year second quarter. Second quarter earnings from continuing operations of $.94 per diluted share represents a decrease of 19%, compared with prior year earnings of $1.16 per diluted share. Consolidated revenues for the quarter were $3.4 billion, an increase of 3% over prior year revenues of $3.3 billion.
Bloomfield Hills, MI, July 26, 2006
          "Our second quarter results reflect the changing dynamics being experienced in the homebuilding industry," said Richard J. Dugas, Jr., President and CEO of Pulte Homes. "After several years of limited house inventory and robust demand, the supply of homes for sale continues to increase, while greater buyer uncertainty about purchasing a home at this time is being further impacted by their inability to sell existing homes and the effect higher prices and interest rates are having on overall affordability.
          "We continue to adjust key business tactics to effectively meet the more challenging operating environment we face in many markets today. Based on current market conditions, we expect full year earnings to be in the range of $4.00 to $4.30 per diluted share," said Dugas.
 
Second Quarter Results
          Revenues from homebuilding settlements increased 5% to a second-quarter record of $3.3 billion. Higher revenues for the quarter resulted from an 8% increase in average selling price to $335,000, partially offset by a 3% decrease in closings to 9,879 homes. The increase in average selling price reflects a combination of price increases and changes in the mix of product closed during the period.
          Second quarter homebuilding pretax income declined 24% to $380.8 million, compared with prior year pretax income of $499.4 million. Pretax income for the period was negatively impacted by a 270 basis point decline in gross margins to 21.1%, which was partially offset by a 50 basis point decrease in SG&A expenses as a percent of home settlement revenues. Homebuilding pretax income for the second quarter of 2006 is inclusive of approximately $62 million of charges resulting from adjustments to land inventory and land held for sale, and the write- off of deposits and pre-acquisition costs associated with land transactions the Company no longer plans to pursue.
          Net new home orders for the quarter were 9,455 homes, valued at $3.1 billion, which represent declines of 30% and 29%, respectively, from prior year second-quarter results. Pulte Homes' backlog as of June 30, 2006, was valued at $6.9 billion (19,516 homes), compared with a value of $7.8 billion (23,351 homes) last year.
          The Company's financial services operations reported second quarter pretax income of $15.1 million, essentially unchanged from prior year pretax income of $15.5 million. Second quarter originations of 9,498 loans was comparable to the prior year, while the dollar value increased 11% to $2 billion. Mortgage capture rate for the quarter was 91%, compared with 88% for the same quarter last year.
Six Month Results
          For the six months ended June 30, 2006, Pulte Homes' income from continuing operations was $506.5 million, compared with prior year income from continuing operations of $522.7 million. Earnings from continuing operations for the first six months were $1.95 per diluted share, a decrease of 2% from prior year earnings of $1.99 per diluted share. Consolidated revenues for the period were $6.3 billion, up from $5.8 billion for the first six months of last year.
          Revenues from homebuilding settlements for the period were a record $6.2 billion, up 10% over the prior year. Higher revenues for the period resulted from a 9% increase in average selling price to $335,000, combined with a 1% increase in the number of homes closed. The increase in average selling price for the period reflects a combination of price increases and a change in the mix of product closed during the period.
          Six month homebuilding pretax income declined 12% to $758.4 million, compared with prior year pretax income of $859 million. Pretax margins as a percentage of home settlement revenues for the period decreased 310 basis points to 12.2%, driven by a 210 basis point decline in gross margins from home sales and lower land profitability, partially offset by a 40 basis point reduction in SG&A expense as a percent of home settlement revenues.
 
          For the first six months, Pulte's financial services operations reported pretax income of $64.4 million, compared with $25.6 million in the prior year. Higher loan originations for the six-month period, up 3% to 17,589 mortgages valued at $3.8 billion, and a more favorable mix of loan products originated during the period, helped to drive the improved performance. In addition, results reflect a first-quarter gain of approximately $31.6 million from the sale by Pulte Mortgage LLC of its investment in a Mexico-based mortgage-banking company.
