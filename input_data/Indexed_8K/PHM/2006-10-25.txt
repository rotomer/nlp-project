Exhibit 99.1
      Pulte Homes (NYSE: PHM) announced today financial results for its third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2006. For the quarter, income from continuing operations declined 50% to $191.5 million, compared with $382.4 million for the prior year third quarter. Third quarter earnings from continuing operations of $.74 per diluted share represents a decrease of 49%, compared with prior year earnings of $1.45 per diluted share. Consolidated revenues for the quarter were $3.6 billion, a decline of 6% from prior year revenues of $3.8 billion.
Bloomfield Hills, MI, October 25, 2006
     "The operating landscape for new home sales remained challenging during the third quarter, as high inventory levels, affordability issues, elevated cancellation rates and a general lack of buyer confidence continued to weigh on new home demand," said Richard J. Dugas, Jr., President and CEO of Pulte Homes. "In response to these more difficult market conditions, we continue to shorten our land pipeline, reduce production volumes and to balance home price and profitability with sales pace."
Third Quarter Results
     Revenues from homebuilding settlements in the third quarter decreased 6% to $3.5 billion, compared with $3.7 billion last year. The change in revenue for the quarter reflects a 6% increase in average selling price to $335,000, offset by an 11% decrease in closings to 10,440 homes. The increase in average selling price primarily reflects geographic changes in the mix of homes closed during the period.
 
     Third quarter homebuilding pretax income declined 54% to $286.1 million, compared with prior year pretax income of $619.4 million. Pretax income for the period reflects a 670 basis point decline in gross margins to 17.1%, combined with a 70-basis point increase in SG&A as a percentage of home sale revenues. Homebuilding pretax income for the third quarter of 2006 is inclusive of approximately $87.7 million of charges resulting from adjustments to land inventory and land held for sale, and the write-off of deposits and pre-acquisition costs associated with land transactions the Company no longer plans to pursue. These charges reduced reported pretax margins by approximately 250 basis points.
     Net new home orders for the third quarter were 7,299 homes, valued at $2.4 billion, which represent declines of 39% and 40%, respectively, from prior year third-quarter results. Pulte Homes' backlog as of September 30, 2006, was valued at $5.8 billion (16,375 homes), compared with a value of $8.0 billion (23,666 homes) last year.
     The Company's financial services operations reported a 12% increase in third quarter pretax income to $21.4 million, as the business benefited from a positive mix of mortgage products and a more favorable interest rate environment. Mortgage capture rate for the quarter was 91%, compared with 89% for the same quarter last year.
Nine Month Results
     For the nine months ended September 30, 2006, Pulte Homes' income from continuing operations was $697.9 million, compared with prior year income from continuing operations of $905.2 million. Earnings from continuing operations for the first nine months were $2.70 per diluted share, a decrease of 22% from prior year earnings of $3.44 per diluted share. Consolidated revenues for the period were $9.9 billion, up from $9.6 billion for the first nine months of last year.
     Revenues from homebuilding settlements for the period were $9.7 billion, an increase of 4% over the prior year. Higher revenues for the period resulted from a 7% increase in average selling price to $335,000, partially offset by a 3% decrease in the number of homes closed to 28,921. The increase in average selling price for the period reflects a combination of price increases and a change in the mix of product closed during the period.
     Nine month homebuilding pretax income declined 29% to $1.04 billion, compared with prior year pretax income of $1.48 billion. Pretax margins as a percentage of home settlement revenues for the period decreased 500 basis points to 10.8%, reflecting a 380 basis point decline in gross margins from home sales, and lower land profitability. Homebuilding pretax income for the first nine months is inclusive of approximately $155 million of charges resulting from adjustments to land inventory and land held for sale, and the write-off of deposits and pre-acquisition costs associated with land transactions the Company no longer plans to pursue.
     For the first nine months, Pulte's financial services operations reported pretax income of $85.8 million, compared with $44.7 million in the prior year. In addition, results reflect a first-quarter gain of approximately $31.6 million from the sale by Pulte Mortgage LLC of its investment in a Mexico-based mortgage-banking company.
 
Guidance Update
     "We continue to operate with the expectation that business conditions remain difficult for at least the near term and, as a result, that additional charges are still possible if conditions erode further. Given the ongoing weakness in new home sales and closings, visibility as to future earnings performance is limited, but at this time we estimate fourth quarter earnings in the range of $.30 to $.70 per diluted share, inclusive of potential pretax land-related charges of up to $150 million," said Dugas. "While these charges are not a certainty, we think it is appropriate to incorporate the potential impact into our near-term guidance."
