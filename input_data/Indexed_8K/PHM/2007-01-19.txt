EXHIBIT 99.1
     
PULTE HOMES REPORTS PRELIMINARY RESULTS FOR FOURTH QUARTER 2006
      Pulte Homes (NYSE: PHM) today announced its preliminary and unaudited financial results for its fourth quarter 2006, and provided an update of its impairment and land-related charges. The Company expects fourth quarter results to be in the range of a loss of $.05 to earnings of $.05 per diluted share from continuing operations. Pulte Homes had previously issued earnings guidance in the range of $.30 to $.70 per diluted share, guiding to the lower end of the range in its earnings conference call for the third quarter.
Bloomfield Hills, MI, January 18, 2007
     "As we stated during our third quarter earnings release, Pulte Homes continues to navigate through a challenging operating environment, with demand for new homes during the fourth quarter still far below pre-2006 levels," said Richard J. Dugas, Jr., President and CEO of Pulte Homes. "Pulte's operating approach during this downturn has been to improve our balance sheet metrics, as well as right-size our land inventory, house inventory and SG&A levels. We continue to reduce the number of homes we are starting, as evidenced by our meaningful reduction in speculative units under construction during the quarter. In addition, we experienced a stabilization to a slight improvement in our fourth quarter cancellation rate compared with the third quarter, as this metric showed progressive improvement throughout the period."
 
     The Company closed 12,566 homes during the fourth quarter of 2006, a decline of 20% from the fourth quarter of 2005. Net new orders for the quarter were 6,446 homes, a 34% decrease from last year's fourth quarter. For the full year 2006, home closings were 41,487, down 9% compared with 2005. Net new orders for the full year 2006 decreased 29% from the prior year to 33,925 homes. Unit backlog of 10,255 as of the end of the fourth quarter was valued at $3.6 billion.
     The Company is in the process of completing its valuation analysis of land inventory, land held for sale, deposits and pre-acquisition costs, and its investment in unconsolidated joint ventures. On a preliminary basis, Pulte Homes anticipates that these impairments and land-related charges will be in the range of $330 million to $350 million for the fourth quarter, or $.83 to $.88 per diluted share. The Company previously issued guidance of $150 million for impairments and land-related charges. "With our ongoing focus on the balance sheet, we continue to evaluate land positions, renegotiate contracts and, if necessary, forfeit deposits and pre-acquisition costs," said Roger A. Cregg, Executive Vice President and CFO of Pulte Homes. "The net debt-to-total capitalization ratio for the Company was approximately 31% at year-end, with a cash position of approximately $550 million, and no debt outstanding on our revolving credit facility."
     Pulte Homes will release its fourth quarter and full year 2006 earnings results following market close on Wednesday, January 31, 2007. The Company will webcast its conference call to discuss the fourth quarter results on Thursday, February 1, 2007 at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time. To listen to the webcast, log on at five minutes prior to the call. An archive of the conference call will be available on the Pulte Homes web site.
