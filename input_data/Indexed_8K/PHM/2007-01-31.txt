Exhibit 99.1
           Pulte Homes (NYSE: PHM) announced today financial results for its fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2006. For the quarter, the Company reported a loss from continuing operations of $8.3 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, compared with $532 million of income from continuing operations for the prior year fourth quarter, or $2.03 per diluted share. Consolidated revenues for the quarter were $4.4 billion, a decline of 14% from prior year revenues of $5.1 billion.
Bloomfield Hills, MI, January 31, 2007
          For the full year 2006, Pulte Homes reported consolidated revenues of $14.3 billion, a decrease of 3% from the prior year. Full year earnings from continuing operations were $2.67 per diluted share, compared with $5.47 in the prior year.
          "Pulte made meaningful progress during the fourth quarter by improving our house and land inventory positions, adjusting our SG&A levels and positioning ourselves for success in the future," said Richard J. Dugas, Jr., President and CEO of Pulte Homes. "In addition, we witnessed some promising signs of stabilization at the conclusion of the quarter, and into the first month of 2007, although it's too early to tell how strong and sustainable this may prove to be in the months ahead. The cancellation rate, which declined to 34.7% in the fourth quarter from 35.8% in the third quarter, continued to improve into January 2007. Going forward, Pulte will maintain its keen focus on balance sheet improvement, while working diligently to build pre-sold inventory as the selling season unfolds."
 
Fourth Quarter Results
          Revenues from homebuilding settlements in the fourth quarter decreased 15% to $4.3 billion, compared with $5.0 billion last year. The change in revenue for the quarter reflects a 6% increase in average selling price to $341,000, offset by a 20% decrease in closings to 12,566 homes. The increase in average selling price primarily reflects geographic changes in the mix of homes closed during the period.
          Fourth quarter homebuilding pretax loss was approximately $34 million, compared with prior year pretax income of $820.5 million. Pretax loss for the period reflects a decline in gross margins to 11.0% from 22.3%, combined with an increase in SG&A as a percentage of home sale revenues to 7.2% compared with 6.2%. Homebuilding pretax income for the fourth quarter of 2006 is inclusive of approximately $350 million, or $0.88 per diluted share, of charges resulting from adjustments to land inventory and land held for sale, including the Company's investment in unconsolidated joint ventures, and the write-off of deposits and pre-acquisition costs associated with land transactions the Company no longer plans to pursue.
          Net new home orders for the fourth quarter were 6,446 homes, valued at $2.1 billion, which represent declines of 34% and 38%, respectively, from prior year fourth-quarter results. Pulte Homes' backlog as of December 31, 2006, was valued at $3.6 billion (10,255 homes), compared with a value of $6.3 billion (17,817 homes) last year. At the end of the quarter, the Company's debt-to-capitalization ratio was 35.0%, and its net debt-to-capitalization ratio was 31.2%.
          The Company's financial services operations reported a 14% increase in fourth quarter pretax income to $29.7 million, as the business benefited from a positive mix of mortgage products and a more favorable interest rate environment. Mortgage capture rate for the quarter was 93.3%, compared with 90.6% for the same quarter last year.
Full Year Results
          For the year ended December 31, 2006, Pulte Homes' income from continuing operations was $689.6 million, compared with prior year income from continuing operations of $1.4 billion. Earnings from continuing operations for 2006 were $2.67 per diluted share, a decrease of 51% from prior year earnings of $5.47 per diluted share. Consolidated revenues for 2006 were $14.3 billion, down by 3% from $14.7 billion in 2005.
          Revenues from homebuilding settlements for 2006 were $14 billion, a decrease of 3% from the prior year. The decline was primarily attributable to a 9% decrease in the number of homes closed to 41,487, partially offset by a 7% increase in the average selling price to $337,000. The increase in average selling price for the period reflects a combination of changes in product mix and geographic mix of homes closed during the period.
          Homebuilding pretax income for 2006 was approximately $1 billion, compared with prior year pretax income of $2.3 billion. Pretax margins as a percentage of home settlement revenues for 2006 decreased 880 basis points to 7.2%, reflecting a 600-basis point decline in gross margins from home sales, and lower profitability on land sales. Homebuilding pretax income for 2006 is inclusive of approximately $505 million, or $1.24 per diluted share, of charges resulting from adjustments to land inventory and land held for sale, including the Company's investment in unconsolidated joint ventures, and the write-off of deposits and pre-acquisition costs associated with land transactions the Company no longer plans to pursue.
 
          For 2006, Pulte's financial services operations reported pretax income of $115.5 million, compared with $70.6 million in the prior year. In addition, 2006 results reflect a first-quarter gain of approximately $31.6 million from the sale by Pulte Mortgage LLC of its investment in a Mexico-based mortgage-banking company.
First Quarter 2007 Guidance
          "Our earnings visibility going forward remains limited due to rapidly changing market conditions and uncertainty regarding possible future land-related charges," said Dugas. "For the first quarter of 2007, we are providing earnings guidance in the range from break-even to a loss of $.10 per diluted share, exclusive of any additional land-related charges. Given this fluid environment, we are not in a position at this time to provide full-year guidance for 2007."
