Exhibit 99.1
      Pulte Homes (NYSE: PHM) today announced preliminary and unaudited financial results for its first quarter 2007. The Company expects a first quarter loss in the range of $0.34 to $0.38 per diluted share from continuing operations, including impairments and land-related charges of approximately $130 million to $140 million. Pulte Homes had previously issued earnings guidance for the first quarter of break-even to a loss of $.10 per diluted share, exclusive of any impairments or land-related charges.

     In addition, the Company announced its net new orders, closings and cancellation rates for the quarter. Net new orders were 8,499, down 21% compared with the first quarter of 2006. Pulte Homes closed 5,420 homes during the quarter, 37% lower than the first quarter of 2006. The cancellation rate was 24% for the first quarter of 2007, compared with 35% for the fourth quarter of 2006. There were 13,334 units in backlog at the end of the first quarter 2007, valued at $4.7 billion.
     "The operating environment for homebuilding continues to be challenging, with orders and closings remaining under pressure," said Richard J. Dugas, Jr., president and CEO of Pulte Homes. "While we experienced improvement in our cancellation rate compared with the fourth quarter, the housing market remains difficult. We continue to focus on maintaining a healthy balance sheet and properly managing house and land inventory levels."
 
     The Company is in the process of completing its valuation analysis of land inventory, land held for sale, deposits and pre-acquisition costs, and its investment in unconsolidated joint ventures. As stated earlier, Pulte Homes anticipates that these impairments and land-related charges will be in the range of $130 million to $140 million for the first quarter on a pre-tax basis, or approximately $0.32 to $0.34 per diluted share on an after-tax basis.
     Pulte Homes will release its first quarter 2007 earnings results following market close on Wednesday, April 25, 2007. The Company will webcast its conference call to discuss the first quarter results on Thursday, April 26, 2007 at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time. To listen to the webcast, log on at five minutes prior to the call. An archive of the conference call will be available on the Pulte Homes web site.
