           Pulte Homes (NYSE: PHM) announced today financial results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2007. For the quarter, the Company reported a net loss of $85.7 million, or $0.33 per diluted share, compared with $262.6 million of net income for the prior year first quarter, or $1.01 per diluted share. Consolidated revenues for the quarter were $1.9 billion, a decline of 37% from prior year revenues of $3 billion.
Bloomfield Hills, MI, April 25, 2007
          "Overall, the homebuilding environment remained challenging during the first quarter of 2007, as elevated inventory levels combined with weak consumer confidence for housing continue to place pressure on results," said Richard J. Dugas, Jr., President and CEO of Pulte Homes. "During this period of market weakness, Pulte continues to focus on maintaining a healthy balance sheet and adjusting our house and land inventory levels to better match current market conditions."
          Revenues from homebuilding settlements in the first quarter decreased 38% to $1.8 billion compared with $2.9 billion last year. The change in revenue for the quarter reflects a 37% decrease in closings to 5,420 homes, and a 2% decrease in average selling price to $330,000.
          First quarter homebuilding pre-tax loss was approximately $148.4 million, compared with prior year pre-tax income of $377.6 million. The pre-tax loss for the period reflects a decline in
 
gross margins to 11% from 23% in the prior year quarter, combined with an increase in SG&A as a percentage of home sale revenues to 16% compared with 10% for the same period last year. Homebuilding pre-tax loss for the first quarter of 2007 is inclusive of approximately $132.1 million of pre-tax charges, or $0.31 per diluted share on an after-tax basis, resulting from adjustments to land inventory and land held for sale, and the write-off of deposits and pre-acquisition costs associated with land transactions the Company no longer plans to pursue.
          Net new home orders for the first quarter were 8,499 homes, valued at $2.9 billion, both representing declines of 21% from prior year first quarter results. Pulte Homes' ending backlog as of March 31, 2007 was valued at $4.7 billion (13,334 homes), compared with a value of $7.1 billion (19,940 homes) at the end of last year's first quarter. At the end of the first quarter 2007, the Company's debt-to-capitalization ratio was 35%.
          The Company's financial services operations reported pre-tax income of $13.2 million for the first quarter 2007 compared with $49.3 million of pre-tax income for the prior year's quarter. The first quarter 2006 results reflect a gain of approximately $31.6 million from the sale by Pulte Mortgage LLC of its investment in a Mexico-based mortgage-banking unit. The decrease in first quarter 2007 pre-tax income was primarily due to lower mortgage originations funded during the quarter compared with the prior year's quarter. The mortgage capture rate for the quarter was 93%, compared with 89.3% for the same quarter last year.
Second Quarter 2007 Guidance
          "For the second quarter of 2007, we are providing guidance in the range from break-even to a loss of $.10 per diluted share, exclusive of any additional land-related charges," said Dugas. "Due to the lack of earnings visibility, difficult market conditions that exist today and uncertainty regarding possible land-related charges going forward, we are not in a position at this time to provide guidance for the remainder of 2007."
          A conference call discussing Pulte Homes' first quarter 2007 results will be held Thursday, April 26, 2007 at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time, and web cast live via Pulte.com. Interested investors can access the call via the Company's home page at .
