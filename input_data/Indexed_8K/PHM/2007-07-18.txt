      Pulte Homes (NYSE: PHM) today announced preliminary, unaudited financial and operating results for its second quarter 2007. The Company expects a loss in the range of $2.00 to $2.10 per share from continuing operations for the quarter, including impairments, land-related charges and restructuring charges.
Bloomfield Hills, MI, July 17, 2007
     The Company is in the process of completing its valuation analysis of land inventory, land held for sale, deposits and pre-acquisition costs, and its investments in unconsolidated joint ventures. Pulte Homes anticipates that these impairments and land-related charges will be in the range of $740 million to $770 million for the second quarter 2007 on a pre-tax basis, or approximately $1.85 to $1.92 per share on an after-tax basis. On May 29, 2007, the Company announced its restructuring plan designed to reduce costs and improve operating efficiencies. Pulte Homes expects to record a charge of approximately $40 million on a pre-tax basis in the second quarter 2007 related to this restructuring, or approximately $0.10 per share on an after-tax basis. Pulte Homes had previously issued earnings guidance for the 2007 second quarter of break-even to a loss of $0.10 per share, exclusive of any impairments or land-related charges.
 
This prior guidance also did not include charges related to the previously announced restructuring plan.
     Net new orders were 7,532 for the second quarter of 2007, down 20% compared with the second quarter of 2006. Pulte Homes closed 5,938 homes during the quarter, 40% lower than the prior year quarter. There were 14,928 units in backlog at the end of the second quarter 2007, valued at $5.2 billion.
     "The difficult conditions that plagued the homebuilding industry in the first quarter of 2007 worsened in the second quarter, with increased competitive pricing pressures, elevated levels of new and resale home inventory, and weak consumer sentiment for housing affecting the entire industry," said Richard J. Dugas, Jr., President and CEO of Pulte Homes. "Our strategy of maintaining a healthy balance sheet through properly managing house and land inventory levels along with dramatically lowering SG&A costs continues to be our focus during this challenging operating environment."
     Pulte Homes will release its second quarter 2007 earnings results following market close on Wednesday, July 25, 2007. The Company will webcast its conference call to discuss the second quarter results on Thursday, July 26, 2007 at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time. To listen to the webcast, log on at five minutes prior to the call. An archive of the conference call will be available on the Pulte Homes web site.
