EXHIBIT 99.1
      Pulte Homes (NYSE: PHM) announced today financial results for its third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2007. For the quarter, the Company reported a loss from continuing operations of $787.9 million, or $3.12 per share, compared with income from continuing operations of $191.5 million for the prior year third quarter, or $0.74 per diluted share. The third quarter 2007 loss included $1.18 billion on a pre-tax basis, or $3.33 per share after-tax, recorded for impairments, land-related charges and impairment of goodwill, compared with $87.7 million, or $0.22 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2006.
Bloomfield Hills, MI, October 24, 2007
     Consolidated revenues for the quarter were $2.5 billion, a decline of 31% from prior year revenues of $3.6 billion.
 
"The operating environment continues to be challenged with elevated levels of new and resale home inventory, tightening of mortgage liquidity, and weak consumer sentiment for housing," said Richard J. Dugas, Jr., President and CEO of Pulte Homes. "In the midst of these conditions, in the third quarter we were profitable on a pre-impairment basis, which exceeded the higher end of the guidance we previously provided of $0.10 to $0.20 per diluted share, exclusive of impairments or land-related charges. We also modestly improved our cash position, while reducing outstanding debt under the revolving credit facility. We remain focused on maintaining a strong, transparent balance sheet, generating additional cash, and managing SG&A costs to better match this challenging operating environment."
The Company ended the quarter with $102 million in cash and paid down $148 million of debt outstanding under its $1.86 billion revolving credit facility since June 30, 2007. Pulte's debt-to-capitalization ratio was 40.3%, as of September 30, 2007, compared with 39.5% one year ago.
Third Quarter Results
     Revenues from homebuilding settlements in the third quarter decreased 31% to $2.4 billion compared with $3.5 billion last year. The change in revenue for the quarter reflects a 28% decrease in closings to 7,468 homes, and a 4% decrease in average selling price to $322,000.
     Third quarter homebuilding pre-tax loss was approximately $1.1 billion, compared with prior year pre-tax income of $286.1 million. The pre-tax loss for the period reflects a decline in gross margins to -12.2% from 17.1% in the prior year quarter. Homebuilding SG&A expense decreased 15% compared with the prior year quarter, but increased to 9.8% as a percentage of home sale revenues compared with 8% for the same period last year. Homebuilding pre-tax loss for the third quarter is inclusive of approximately $842 million of pre-tax charges, or $2.10 per share on an after-tax basis, resulting from adjustments to land inventory and land held for sale, including the Company's investment in unconsolidated joint ventures, and the write-off of deposits and other related costs associated with land transactions the Company no longer plans to pursue. The homebuilding pre-tax loss also includes goodwill impairment of $336 million, or $1.23 per share on an after-tax basis, recorded during the quarter.
     Net new home orders for the third quarter were 4,582 homes, valued at $1.3 billion, which represent declines of 37% and 47%, respectively, from prior year third quarter results. Pulte Homes' ending backlog as of September 30, 2007 was valued at $4.1 billion (12,042 homes), compared with a value of $5.8 billion (16,375 homes) at the end of last year's third quarter.
     The Company's financial services operations reported pre-tax income of $12.9 million for the third quarter 2007 compared with $21.4 million of pre-tax income for the prior year's quarter. The decrease in third quarter 2007 pre-tax income was primarily due to a 38% decline in mortgage loans originated during the quarter compared with the prior year's quarter. The mortgage capture rate for the quarter was approximately 92%, compared with 91% for the same quarter last year.
 
Nine Month Results
     For the nine months ended September 30, 2007, Pulte Homes' loss from continuing operations was $1.38 billion, or $5.48 per share, compared with prior year income from continuing operations of $697.9 million, or $2.70 per diluted share. Consolidated revenues for the period were $6.4 billion, down from $9.9 billion for the first nine months of last year.
     Revenues from homebuilding settlements for the period were $6.1 billion, down 37% from the prior year. Lower revenues for the period resulted from a 3% decrease in average selling price to $324,000, combined with a 35% decrease in the number of homes closed to 18,826.
     Homebuilding pre-tax loss for the period was approximately $2.05 billion, compared with pre-tax income of $1.04 billion for the prior year period. The pre-tax loss for the period reflects a decline in gross margins to -7.4% from 20.2% in the prior year period. Homebuilding SG&A expense declined 2% for the current year period compared with the prior year period, but increased to 13.3% as a percentage of home sale revenues compared with 8.6% for the same period last year. Homebuilding pre-tax loss for the first nine months of 2007 is inclusive of approximately $1.7 billion of pre-tax charges, or $4.29 per share on an after-tax basis, resulting from adjustments to land inventory and land held for sale, including the Company's investment in unconsolidated joint ventures, and the write-off of deposits and other related costs associated with land transactions the Company no longer plans to pursue. Homebuilding pre-tax loss also includes goodwill impairment of $336 million, or $1.23 per share on an after-tax basis, recorded during the period. A pre-tax restructuring charge of approximately $47 million was recorded during the period related to the restructuring plan announced by the Company on May 29, 2007.
     For the first nine months of 2007, Pulte's financial services operations reported pre-tax income of $32.7 million, compared with $85.8 million in the prior year. The prior year results reflect a first-quarter gain of approximately $31.6 million from the sale by Pulte Mortgage LLC of its investment in a Mexico-based mortgage-banking company. In addition, lower loan originations for the nine-month period, down 40% to 16,719 mortgages, also contributed to the decline.
Fourth Quarter 2007 Guidance
     "In part due to our relatively strong backlog position, combined with our lower overhead spending, for the fourth quarter of 2007 we are projecting income from continuing operations in the range from break-even to $0.10 per diluted share, exclusive of any additional impairments, land-related charges or goodwill impairment," said Dugas. "Due to the lack of longer-term earnings visibility and the difficult market conditions that persist, we are not at this time providing guidance for any period beyond the fourth quarter of this year."
