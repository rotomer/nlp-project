Exhibit 99.1
           Pulte Homes (NYSE: PHM) announced today financial results for its fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2007. For the quarter, the Company reported a pre-tax loss from continuing operations of $453.8 million, compared with an $18.1 million pre-tax loss for the prior year fourth quarter. The fourth quarter 2007 pre-tax loss included $543.3 million of charges related to inventory impairments, other land-related charges and impairment of goodwill. These charges were equal to $1.28 per share on an after-tax

basis, before consideration of the valuation allowance related to the deferred tax assets discussed below. In the fourth quarter of 2006, these charges totaled $349.9 million, or $0.64 per share on an after-tax basis.
          An after-tax, non-cash valuation allowance of $622 million, or $2.46 per share, was recorded during the fourth quarter of 2007 by the Company related to its deferred tax assets in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109 "Accounting for Income Taxes." This allowance is reflected as a charge to fourth quarter income tax expense and a reduction of the Company's deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2007. Including this valuation allowance, the Company recorded a loss from continuing operations of $893.3 million, or $3.54 per share, for the fourth quarter 2007, compared with a loss of $8.3 million, or $0.03 per share, for the prior year fourth quarter.
          Consolidated revenues for the quarter were $2.9 billion, a decline of 34% from prior year revenues of $4.4 billion.
          For the full year 2007, Pulte Homes reported consolidated revenues of $9.3 billion, a decrease of 35% from the prior year. The Company had a loss from continuing operations of $9.02 per share, compared with earnings of $2.67 per diluted share in the prior year.
          "The challenging market conditions that plagued the homebuilding industry for the first nine months of 2007 worsened in the fourth quarter," said Richard J. Dugas, Jr., President and CEO of Pulte Homes. "Levels of new and existing home inventory remain elevated, buyer demand for new homes continues to be weak, and mortgage availability is still a problem for many prospective homebuyers. However, in the midst of this difficult operating environment, we were able to exceed our goal of $1 billion of cash at year-end and exceed our guidance previously provided related to income from operations of break-even to $0.10 per diluted share, exclusive of any impairments or land-related charges. We were also successful in lowering overhead spending and improving our house and land inventory positions. Pulte will continue to focus on generating cash and strengthening the balance sheet as we navigate through this ongoing industry downturn."
          The Company ended the year with $1.1 billion in cash and no debt outstanding under its $1.86 billion revolving credit facility.
Fourth Quarter Results
          Revenues from homebuilding settlements in the fourth quarter decreased 35% to $2.8 billion, compared with $4.3 billion last year. The change in revenue for the quarter reflects a 31% decrease in closings to 8,714 homes and a 6% decrease in average selling price to $319,000.
          Fourth quarter homebuilding pre-tax loss from continuing operations was $459.2 million, compared with a $34.1 million pre-tax loss for the prior year quarter. The pre-tax loss for the period reflects a decline in gross margins from 11% to less than one percent. Homebuilding SG&A expense decreased $59.3 million, or 19%, compared with the prior year quarter. Homebuilding pre-tax loss for the fourth quarter 2007 is inclusive of approximately $508.9 million of pre-tax charges, or $1.18 per share on an after-tax basis (before consideration of the deferred tax valuation allowance), resulting from adjustments to land inventory and land held for
 
sale, including the Company's investments in unconsolidated joint ventures, and the write-off of deposits and other related costs associated with land transactions the Company no longer plans to pursue. In the fourth quarter of 2006, these charges totaled $349.9 million, or $0.64 per share on an after-tax basis. The homebuilding pre-tax loss for the fourth quarter of 2007 also includes goodwill impairment of $34.4 million, or $0.10 per share on an after-tax basis (before consideration of the deferred tax valuation allowance). An after-tax valuation allowance of $622 million, or $2.46 per share, was recorded during the quarter associated with the Company's deferred tax assets.
          Net new home orders for the fourth quarter were 4,562 homes, valued at $1.2 billion, which represent declines of 29% and 41%, respectively, from prior year fourth quarter results. Pulte Homes' ending backlog as of December 31, 2007 was valued at $2.5 billion (7,890 homes), compared with a value of $3.6 billion (10,255 homes) at the end of last year's fourth quarter.
          The Company's financial services operations reported pre-tax income of $10.3 million for the fourth quarter 2007, compared with $29.7 million of pre-tax income for the prior year's quarter. The decrease in fourth quarter 2007 pre-tax income was primarily due to a 47% decline in mortgage loans originated during the quarter compared with the prior year's quarter. The mortgage capture rate for the quarter was approximately 91%, compared with 93% for the same quarter last year.
Full Year Results
          For the year 2007, Pulte Homes' loss from continuing operations was $2.3 billion, or $9.02 per share, compared with prior year income from continuing operations of $689.6 million, or $2.67 per diluted share. Consolidated revenues for the year were $9.3 billion, down from $14.3 billion for the prior year.
          Revenues from homebuilding settlements for the period were $8.9 billion, down 36% from the prior year. Lower revenues for the year resulted from a 4% decrease in average selling price to $322,000, combined with a 34% decrease in the number of homes closed to 27,540.
          Homebuilding pre-tax loss for 2007 was $2.5 billion, compared with pre-tax income of approximately $1 billion for the prior year. The pre-tax loss reflects a decline in gross margins to -5% from 17.4% in the prior year. Homebuilding SG&A expense declined $75.2 million, or 7%, for the current year compared with the prior year. Homebuilding pre-tax loss for 2007 is inclusive of approximately $2.2 billion of pre-tax charges, or $5.48 per share on an after-tax basis (before consideration of the deferred tax valuation allowance), resulting from adjustments to land inventory and land held for sale, including the Company's investments in unconsolidated joint ventures, and the write-off of deposits and other related costs associated with land transactions the Company no longer plans to pursue. For 2006, these charges totaled $505 million, or $1.24 per share on an after-tax basis. Homebuilding pre-tax loss for 2007 also includes goodwill impairment of $370 million, or $1.33 per share on an after-tax basis (before consideration of the deferred tax valuation allowance), and a pre-tax restructuring charge of approximately $45.7 million, or $0.11 per share on an after-tax basis (before consideration of the deferred tax valuation allowance), related to the restructuring plan announced by the Company during its second quarter. An after-tax valuation allowance of $622 million, or $2.47 per share, was recorded in 2007 associated with the Company's deferred tax assets.
 
          Pulte's financial services operations reported pre-tax income of $43 million for 2007, compared with $115.5 million in the prior year. The prior year results reflect a first-quarter gain of approximately $31.6 million from the sale by Pulte Mortgage LLC of its investment in a Mexico-based mortgage-banking company. In addition, lower loan originations for the year, down 42% to 23,404 mortgages, also contributed to the decline.
First Quarter 2008 Guidance
          "Given the ongoing weakness in the homebuilding industry, for the first quarter of 2008 we are projecting a net loss from continuing operations in the range from $0.15 to $0.30 per share, exclusive of a tax benefit and any additional impairments or land-related charges," said Dugas. "This projection reflects the ongoing tough operating environment for homebuilding. However, with our focus on inventory and cash management, we are targeting to end 2008 with a cash position of $2 billion to $2.2 billion, inclusive of an additional $650 million to $850 million generated from operations and a $250 million tax refund."
