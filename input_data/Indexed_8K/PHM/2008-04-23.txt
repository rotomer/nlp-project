Exhibit 99.1
      Pulte Homes (NYSE: PHM) announced today financial results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2008. For the quarter, the Company reported a net loss of $696.1 million, or $2.75 per share, compared with an $85.7 million net loss for the prior year first quarter, or $0.34 per share. The first quarter 2008 net loss included $663.6 million of pre-tax charges related to inventory impairments and other land-related charges. Impairments and land-related charges for the prior year quarter were $132.1 million. Consolidated revenues for the quarter were $1.4 billion, a decline of 23% from prior year revenues of $1.9 billion.
Bloomfield Hills, MI, April 23, 2008
"The difficult housing environment continued to erode during the first quarter of 2008," said Richard J. Dugas, Jr., President and CEO of Pulte Homes. "Buyer demand for new homes continues to be soft, home prices remain under pressure, and overall buyer confidence is weak.
     "Despite these market challenges, Pulte continues to make progress on its cash position, selling homes and reducing its cost structure. We exceeded our guidance previously provided of a loss of $0.15 to $0.30 per share from continuing operations, exclusive of any impairments or land-related charges. This performance was accomplished through a company-wide commitment to sell and close homes during the quarter and continued efforts to control overhead. We also reduced both our level of speculative inventory and number of controlled lots. We ended the quarter with a $1.1 billion cash balance, inclusive of a $212 million tax
 
refund, and no debt outstanding under our $1.6 billion revolving credit facility. Pulte will continue to position the company to capitalize on any market stabilization and eventual recovery."
     Revenues from homebuilding settlements in the first quarter decreased 22% to $1.4 billion compared with $1.8 billion last year. The change in revenue for the quarter reflects a 13% decrease in closings to 4,733 homes, and an 11% decrease in average selling price to $295,000.
     First quarter homebuilding pre-tax loss was $705.1 million, compared with a $148.4 million pre-tax loss for the prior year quarter. The pre-tax loss for the 2008 first quarter reflects a decline in gross margins primarily related to the impact of impairments recorded in connection with our land inventory. Homebuilding SG&A expense decreased $79.7 million, or 28%, compared with the prior year quarter. During the first quarter of 2008, the Company recorded $663.6 million of impairments and land-related charges, including $598.8 million related to land impairments, $0.3 million associated with the write-off of land deposits and pre-acquisition costs, and $64.5 million of impairments of land held for sale. For the prior year quarter, these impairments and land-related charges totaled $132.1 million.
     Net new home orders for the first quarter were 5,402 homes, valued at $1.5 billion, which represent declines of 36% and 50%, respectively, from prior year first quarter results. Pulte Homes' ending backlog as of March 31, 2008 was valued at $2.6 billion (8,559 homes), compared with a value of $4.7 billion (13,334 homes) at the end of last year's first quarter. At the end of the first quarter 2008, the Company's debt-to-capitalization ratio was 49%, and on a net debt-to-capitalization basis was 40%.
     The Company's financial services operations reported pre-tax income of $15 million for the first quarter 2008, compared with $13.2 million of pre-tax income for the prior year's quarter. The increase in first quarter 2008 pre-tax income was partially due to a shift in the mix of mortgage loans closed toward more profitable agency-backed products. This was partially offset by a 32% decline in mortgage loans originated during the quarter compared with the prior year's quarter. The mortgage capture rate for the quarter was 89.9%, compared with 93% for the same quarter last year.
Second Quarter 2008 Guidance
     "For the second quarter of 2008 we are projecting a net loss from continuing operations in the range from $0.10 to $0.20 per share, exclusive of a tax benefit and any additional impairments or land-related charges," said Dugas. "Pulte also remains focused on inventory reduction and cash management, and continues to target a cash position by the end of 2008 of $2.0 billion to $2.2 billion."
