Item 1.02 Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement
On May 8, 2008, Pulte Mortgage LLC ("Pulte Mortgage") and Calyon New York Branch ("Calyon"), as Administrative Agent, agreed to terminate Pulte Mortgage's $100 million asset-backed commercial paper program. As a result of the termination, Pulte Mortgage repaid the outstanding principal balance of $100 million. Pursuant to the terms of the commercial paper program, the participating lenders had the right to declare a termination date and terminate the lender commitments if any of Moody's Investors Service, Standard and Poor's Corporation, or Fitch Ratings rated any of the senior unsecured debt of Pulte Homes, Inc. at or below Ba2, BB, or BB, respectively. Calyon, as Administrative Agent, exercised such right after Standard and Poor's Corporation rated such debt BB. Based on expected origination volumes, Pulte Mortgage believes it has capacity through its bank revolving credit facility and other sources to meet its anticipated financing needs.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
