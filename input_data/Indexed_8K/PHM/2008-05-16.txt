 Pulte Homes, Inc. (NYSE: PHM) today announced the commencement of a cash tender offer for any and all of its outstanding 4.875% Senior Notes due 2009 (the "Notes".) The terms and conditions of the tender offer are described in the Offer to Purchase and related Letter of Transmittal.
Bloomfield Hills, Mich., May 13, 2008
     The consideration offered for each $1,000 principal amount of Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn prior to May 27, 2008, unless extended (the "Early Tender Date") pursuant to the tender offer will be equal to $1,000. Holders will receive $970 if their Notes are validly tendered after the Early Tender Date but prior to the Expiration Date (as defined below) and are accepted for purchase by the Company.
     The tender offer will expire at 12:00 midnight, New York City time, on June 10, 2008, unless extended (the "Expiration Date.")
     Tenders of Notes may be validly withdrawn at any time up until 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Early Tender Date. Tenders of Notes may not be validly withdrawn after 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Early Tender Date, unless extended or otherwise required by law.

The Company expects that the Early Settlement Date will be May 29, 2008, but such date is subject to change pending the satisfaction of the conditions of the tender offer. The Notes that are tendered after the Early Tender Date and prior to the Expiration Date will, subject to the terms and conditions of the tender offer, be accepted for payment at or promptly after the Expiration Date, and payment for all validly tendered Notes not earlier accepted will be made promptly thereafter.
