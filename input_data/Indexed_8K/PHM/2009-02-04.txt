 Pulte Homes (NYSE: PHM) announced today financial results for its fourth quarter ended December 31, 2008. For the quarter, the Company reported a net loss of $338.2 million, or $1.33 per share, compared with a $874.7 million net loss for the prior year fourth quarter, or $3.46 per share. The fourth quarter 2008 net loss included $380 million of pre-tax charges related to inventory impairments and other land-related charges. Impairments and land-related charges for the prior year quarter were $509 million. Consolidated revenues for the quarter were $1.7 billion, a decline of 43% from prior year quarter revenues of $2.9 billion.
Bloomfield Hills, Mich., February 4, 2009
"The homebuilding operating environment took yet another step down during the fourth quarter of 2008," said Richard J. Dugas, Jr., President and CEO of Pulte Homes. "During the quarter, consumers faced unprecedented levels of financial uncertainty that dramatically impacted purchases of all large-ticket items, especially homes. Sinking consumer confidence, excess foreclosure inventory and continued very tight mortgage availability put dramatic downward pressure on the homebuilding market. These factors, combined with an exceptionally weak economy and a surge in unemployment across all industries left many potential home purchasers on the sidelines to wait for a more certain view of the future.
"Despite this strong downward market momentum, Pulte achieved its stated cash goal as we generated significant positive cash flow during the quarter. We ended the year with nearly $1.7 billion in cash, no debt outstanding under our revolving credit facility and took further action to restructure our company overhead to better match anticipated reduced volume for 2009. Pulte's strong
 
beginning cash position, anticipated tax refunds, and expected positive operating cash flow in 2009 leave us well positioned to capitalize on opportunities once stability in the housing sector begins to materialize."
Fourth Quarter Results
Revenues from homebuilding settlements in the fourth quarter decreased 45% to $1.5 billion, compared with $2.8 billion in last year's fourth quarter. The change in revenue for the quarter reflects a 37% decrease in closings to 5,474 homes, and a 13% decrease in average selling price to $278,000.
Fourth quarter homebuilding pre-tax loss was $466.3 million, compared with a $459.2 million pre-tax loss for the prior year quarter. Homebuilding SG&A expense totaled $205 million for the quarter, including $15 million of severance-related charges. During the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company recorded $380 million of impairments and land-related charges, including $205 million related to land impairments, $14 million associated with the write-off of land deposits and pre-acquisition costs, $146 million of impairments of land held for sale and $15 million related to the Company's investment in unconsolidated joint ventures. For the prior year quarter, impairments and land-related charges totaled $509 million. In addition, goodwill impairments of $5 million were recorded during the 2008 fourth quarter, compared with $34 million for the prior year quarter.
Net new home orders for the fourth quarter were 1,763 homes, a decline of 61% from the prior year fourth quarter. Pulte Homes' ending backlog as of December 31, 2008 was valued at $631 million (2,174 homes), compared with a value of $2.5 billion (7,890 homes) at the end of last year's fourth quarter. At the end of the fourth quarter 2008, the Company's debt-to-capitalization ratio was 52.8%, and on a net debt-to-capitalization basis was 34.8%.
The Company's financial services operations reported pre-tax loss of $7.9 million for the fourth quarter 2008, compared with $10.3 million of pre-tax income for the prior year's quarter. This fourth quarter 2008 pre-tax loss was primarily due to a 42% decline in mortgage loans originated during the quarter compared with the prior year quarter combined with an increase in loan loss reserves. The mortgage capture rate for the quarter was 92%, compared with 91% for the same quarter last year.
Full Year Results
For the year ended December 31, 2008, Pulte Homes' net loss was $1.5 billion, or $5.81 per share, compared with a $2.3 billion, or $8.94 per share, net loss for the prior year. Consolidated revenues for 2008 were $6.3 billion, down 32% from $9.3 billion for the prior year.
Revenues from homebuilding settlements for the period were approximately $6 billion, down 33% from the prior year. Lower revenues for the period resulted from a 12% decrease in average selling price to $284,000, combined with a 24% decrease in the number of homes closed to 21,022.
 
Homebuilding pre-tax loss for 2008 was $1.7 billion, compared with a $2.5 billion pre-tax loss for the prior year. Homebuilding SG&A expense decreased $284 million, or 27%, compared with last year. During 2008, the Company recorded $1.5 billion of impairments and land-related charges, including $1.2 billion related to land impairments, $33 million associated with the write-off of land deposits and pre-acquisition costs, $271 million of impairments of land held for sale, and $18 million related to the Company's investment in unconsolidated joint ventures. For 2007, these impairments and land-related charges totaled $2.2 billion. Homebuilding pre-tax loss for the year also includes goodwill impairments of $5 million compared with $370 million in the prior year.
Pulte's financial services operations reported pre-tax income of $28 million in 2008 compared with $43 million in the prior year. The 35% decrease in mortgage loans originated during the year was the primary cause for this decrease, partially offset by a positive shift in the mix of mortgage loans toward more profitable agency-backed products.
