Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
Agreement and Plan of Merger
On April 7, 2009, Pulte Homes, Inc., a Michigan corporation ("Pulte"), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") with Centex Corporation, a Nevada corporation ("Centex"), and Pi Nevada Building Company, a Nevada corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Pulte ("Merger Sub"). The Merger Agreement provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into Centex, with Centex surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of Pulte (the "Merger").
Subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, which has been unanimously approved and adopted by boards of directors of both Pulte and Centex, at the effective time of the Merger (the "Effective Time"), each share of Centex common stock ("Centex Common Stock"), par value $0.25 per share, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than those shares owned by Pulte or Merger Sub or held by Centex immediately prior to the Effective Time, will be converted into the right to receive 0.975 of a share (the "Exchange Ratio") of Pulte common stock ("Pulte Common Stock"), par value $0.01 per share (the "Merger Consideration"). No fractional shares of Pulte Common Stock will be issued in the Merger, and Centex's stockholders will receive cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, of Pulte Common Stock.
Each outstanding vested and unvested Centex stock option will be converted into a vested Pulte stock option, with adjustments to reflect the exchange ratio. Each award of restricted Centex Common Stock will vest and be converted into the Merger Consideration. Each award of Centex restricted or deferred stock units will vest and be converted into units with respect to Pulte Common Stock, with adjustments to reflect the exchange ratio. Each award of Centex performance units will vest and be converted into an amount in cash reflecting the Fair Market Value (as defined in the Merger Agreement) of Centex Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time.
Pulte and Centex have made customary representations, warranties and covenants in the Merger Agreement, including, among others, covenants to conduct their respective businesses in the ordinary course during the interim period between the execution of the Merger Agreement and consummation of the Merger, and that Centex will not (i) solicit or knowingly encourage inquiries or proposals relating to alternative business combination transactions or (ii) subject to certain exceptions, engage in discussions or negotiations regarding, or provide any non-public information in connection with, alternative business combination transactions. The Merger is also subject to customary conditions, including (i) Centex's stockholders approval of the Merger Agreement, (ii) Pulte's shareholders approval of the Share Issuance and the Charter Amendment (each as defined in the Merger Agreement) and (iii) the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act. The Merger Agreement also provides for certain termination rights for both Pulte and Centex. Upon termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, Pulte may be required to pay Centex a termination fee of $51 million or $102 million and Centex may be required to pay Pulte a termination fee of $24 million or $48 million.

The Merger is intended to qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The Merger Agreement also provides that Pulte will appoint, as of the Effective Time, four current directors of Centex to the Board of Directors of Pulte. In connection with the Merger Agreement, Centex also entered into Voting Agreements with certain directors and officers of Pulte and Pulte entered into Voting Agreements (the "Pulte Voting Agreements") with certain directors and officers of Centex, pursuant to which such directors and officers have agreed to vote their shares of Centex or Pulte, as applicable, in support of the transaction.
The foregoing summary of the Merger Agreement is qualified in its entirety by the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 2.1 to this report and is incorporated herein by reference. The Merger Agreement, which has been included to provide investors with information regarding its terms, contains representations and warranties of each of Pulte and Centex. The Merger Agreement is not intended to provide any other factual information about Pulte, Centex or Merger Sub. The assertions embodied in those representations and warranties were made for purposes of the Merger Agreement and are subject to qualifications and limitations agreed to by the respective parties in connection with negotiating the terms of the Merger Agreement. In addition, certain representations and warranties were made as of a specific date, may be subject to a contractual standard of materiality different from what might be viewed as material to stockholders, or may have been used for purposes of allocating risk between the respective parties rather than establishing matters as facts. Accordingly, you should not rely on the representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement as characterizations of the actual state of facts about Pulte, Centex or Merger Sub. Investors should read the Merger Agreement together with the other information concerning Pulte and Centex that each company publicly files in reports and statements with the SEC.
Consulting Agreement
On April 7, 2009, Pulte entered into a Consulting Agreement (the "Consulting Agreement") with Timothy R. Eller, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Centex, to become effective as of the Effective Time. The Consulting Agreement provides that at the Effective Time Mr. Eller (i) will resign his positions with Centex and become Vice Chairman of Pulte's board of directors and a consultant to Pulte, reporting to Pulte's Chief Executive Officer, with the consulting period and board service to continue for 24 months following the Effective Time and (ii) will be entitled to all payments and benefits under the Centex Corporation Plan Regarding Severance After a Change in Control resulting from a termination for good reason, plus $293,000, and all of his Centex equity awards will vest in full, with his stock options becoming exercisable for their full term.
The Consulting Agreement also provides that Pulte (i) will pay to Mr. Eller board fees equal to the fees paid to other non-chairman directors of Pulte, an annual consulting fee of $750,000 and an annual performance bonus of $300,000, (ii) will grant to Mr. Eller on the closing date options to purchase 650,000 shares of Pulte Common Stock having a 10-year term and an exercise price per share equal to the fair market value of a share of Pulte Common Stock on the closing date and becoming exercisable in two equal installments on the first and second anniversaries of the Effective Time and (iii) will provide Mr. Eller during the consulting period with an office and an administrative assistant in Pulte's Dallas office. Upon a termination of the consulting period for any reason, except by Pulte for cause or by Mr. Eller without good reason, Mr. Eller would be

entitled to the consulting fees, performance bonuses and equity awards in respect of board fees not yet paid and his equity awards would vest in full, with his stock options remaining exercisable for their full term. In addition, during the period that Mr. Eller renders services under the Consulting Agreement, Mr. Eller will be subject to a standard non-competition and non-solicitation covenant provided by senior executive officers of Pulte.
The foregoing summary of the Consulting Agreement is qualified in its entirety by the terms and conditions of the Consulting Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this report and is incorporated herein by reference.
Amendment to Section 382 Rights Agreement
On April 7, 2009, Pulte entered into a first amendment (the "Rights Amendment") to the Section 382 Rights Agreement between Pulte and Computershare Trust Company, N.A., as rights agent, dated as of March 5, 2009 (the "Rights Plan"). Pursuant to the Rights Amendment, neither Centex nor any of its affiliates, associates or stockholders, nor the general partners, limited partners or members or such stockholders, will be deemed an "acquiring person" for purposes of the Rights Plan as a result of the Merger Agreement, the Pulte Voting Agreements or any of the transactions contemplated thereby. Additionally, none of these events will cause the rights issued under the Rights Plan to be distributed or become exercisable or result in any rights becoming void or an adjustment to the number or types of securities issuable upon exercise of the rights.
The foregoing summary of the Rights Amendment is qualified in its entirety by the terms and conditions of the Rights Amendment, which is filed as Exhibit 4.1 to this report and is incorporated herein by reference.

No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in the Merger, but in lieu thereof each holder of Shares otherwise entitled to a fractional share of Parent Common Stock will be entitled to receive, from the Exchange Agent in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.1(d), a cash payment in lieu of such fractional share of Parent Common Stock equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A) such fractional share interest to which such holder (after taking into account all fractional share interests then held by such holder, and rounding such fractional share interest to four decimal places) would otherwise be entitled by (B) the per share value calculated as the average of the closing sale prices of one share of Parent Common Stock for the five most recent days that the Parent Common Stock has traded ending on the last full trading day immediately prior to the Effective Time.

Exchange Fund
          (b) . As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and in any event not later than the third business day following the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of Shares, which at the Effective Time were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and that risk of loss and title to the Shares shall pass, only upon delivery of the Shares to the Exchange Agent and which shall be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the Company) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Shares in exchange for certificates representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock (or appropriate alternative arrangements shall be made by Parent if uncertificated shares of Parent Common Stock will be issued), cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.1(d) and any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.2(c). Upon surrender of Shares for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock (after taking into account all Shares surrendered by such holder) to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.1 (which shall be in uncertificated book entry form unless a physical certificate is requested), payment by cash or check in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock which such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.1(d) and any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.2(c), and the Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be registered in the name of a person other than the person in whose name the applicable surrendered Share is registered, it shall be a condition to the registration thereof that the surrendered Share be in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such delivery of the Merger Consideration pay any transfer or other similar Taxes required as a result of such registration in the name of a person other than the registered holder of such Share or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2(b), each Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration (and any amounts to be paid pursuant to Section 2.1(d) or Section 2.2(c)) upon such surrender. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on any amount payable pursuant to Section 2.1(d) or Section 2.2(c). If any certificate representing any Share(s) shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance of any certificate or evidence of shares in book-entry form representing Parent Common Stock, require the owner of such lost, stolen or

destroyed certificate representing any Share(s) to provide a customary affidavit and to deliver a bond in a reasonable amount as Parent may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the Exchange Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such certificate representing such Share(s).
          (c) . No dividends or other distributions with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Share with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock represented thereby, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to Section 2.1(d), until in either case, such Share has been surrendered in accordance with this Article II. Following surrender of any such Share, there shall be paid to the recordholder thereof, without interest, (i) promptly after such surrender, the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock issuable in exchange therefor pursuant to this Article II, together with any cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(d) and the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time and a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock. The Exchange Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable under this Agreement to any holder of Shares or holder of Restricted Shares or Restricted Stock Units, such amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under the Code or any provision of U.S. state or local Tax Law with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent that amounts are so withheld or deducted and paid over to the applicable Governmental Entity, such withheld or deducted amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the person in respect of which such deduction and withholding were made.
Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares
          (d) . All shares of Parent Common Stock issued upon the surrender for exchange of Shares in accordance with the terms of this Article II and any cash paid pursuant to Section 2.1(d) or Section 2.2(c) shall be deemed to have been issued (or paid) in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares previously represented by such Shares. After the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the Shares which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.
No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock; Closing of Transfer Books
          (e) . Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains undistributed to the former holders of Shares for one year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation upon demand, and any holders of Shares who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.1(d) and any dividends or distributions pursuant to Section 2.2(c), subject to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any certificate representing any Share shall not
