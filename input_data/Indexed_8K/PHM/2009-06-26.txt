Item 1.01 Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement
On June 23, 2009, Pulte Homes, Inc. (the "Company") entered into a five-year, unsecured letter of credit facility (the "") with Deutsche Bank AG, New York Branch, which permits the issuance of up to $200.0 million of letters of credit ("") by the Company. This new credit facility supplements the Company's existing letter of credit capacity included in the Company's unsecured revolving credit facility. The LOCs will be used for general corporate purposes of the Company and its subsidiaries. LOCs may be issued to support the obligations of any wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Pricing under the LOC agreement is based on a 100 basis point (1.0%) spread above the applicable credit default swap rate (referencing senior unsecured debt obligations of the Company) over the applicable pricing period.
LOC Agreement
LOCs
The covenants in the LOC Agreement are substantially similar to the covenants in the Company's senior note indenture. The covenants include restrictions on creation of secured debt, sale and leaseback transactions, and the consolidation, merger, and sale of assets.
In addition, the LOC Agreement has customary events of default, including (subject to certain materiality thresholds and grace periods) payment default, failure to comply with covenants, material inaccuracy of representation or warranty, bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings, change of control and cross-default to other debt and credit agreements.
If the Company elects to terminate any portion of the availability under the LOC Agreement prior to the scheduled maturity date, then the Company will be obligated to pay an unwind fee.

Deutsche Bank, AG, New York Branch

The Banks party to the Facility
  Agreement defined below
Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have acted as counsel to Pulte Homes, Inc., a Michigan corporation (the ""), in connection with the Facility Agreement (the "") dated as of June 23, 2009, among the Company, the Banks and Deutsche Bank AG, New York Branch, as the Issuing Bank and as Administrative Agent. This opinion letter is furnished to you at the request of the Company pursuant to Section 3.01(a)(iv) of the Facility Agreement. Except as otherwise indicated, capitalized terms used in the opinion letter are defined as set forth in the Facility Agreement.
Company
Facility Agreement
In so acting, we have examined the Facility Agreement and the Pricing Agreement (together, the ""), and we have considered such matters of law and fact and relied upon such certificates and other information furnished to us as we have deemed appropriate as a basis for our opinions set forth below. We have also relied, as to matters involving facts, upon representations made by the Company in the Facility Documents, certificates of officers of the Company and certificates of government officials.
Facility Documents
The Law (as defined in paragraph (h) below) covered by the opinions expressed in this opinion letter is limited to the Federal Law of the United States and the Law of the State of Michigan. With your permission, we have assumed that insofar as the laws of any jurisdiction, other than the laws described above, may be applicable to the matters addressed in this opinion, such laws are identical to the laws of the State of Michigan. No opinion is rendered as to whether a court will give effect to the parties' choice of New York law (or the law of any other specific jurisdiction) as the governing law of the Facility Documents.
Based upon the foregoing, we are of the opinion that:
1.         The Company has been duly incorporated and is validly existing in good standing under the laws of the State of Michigan.
2.         The Company has all requisite corporate power to execute and deliver, and to perform its obligations under, each Facility Document.
 
June 23, 2009

3.         The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of each Facility Document have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company.
4.         Each Facility Document has been duly executed and delivered by the Company.
5.         Each Facility Document constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company and is enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium or other laws relating to or affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and is subject to general principles of equity, regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding at law or in equity.
6.         No authorization, approval or consent of, and no filing or registration with, any governmental or regulatory authority or agency of the United States of America or the State of Michigan is required on the part of the Company for the execution, delivery or performance by the Company of the Facility Documents.
7.         The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Facility Documents do not (a) violate any provision of the Restated Articles of Incorporation or By-Laws of the Company, (b) violate any Law which, to our Actual Knowledge (as defined below), is applicable to the Company, (c) to our Actual Knowledge, based solely on a certificate of officers of the Company, violate any order, writ, injunction or decree of any court or governmental authority or agency or any arbitration award applicable to the Company, or (d) breach or constitute a default under any agreement listed as an Exhibit to the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2008, or any subsequently filed Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or Current Report on Form 8-K, of the Company.
8.         We hereby confirm to you that, to our Actual Knowledge, based solely on a certificate of officers of the Company, there are no actions or proceedings against the Company, pending or overtly threatened in writing, before any court, governmental agency or arbitrator which (i) seek to affect the enforceability of any Facility Document, or (ii) except as set forth in the Facility Documents or in the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2008, or any subsequently filed Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or Current Report on Form 8-K, if adversely determined, would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
9.         Based solely on a certificate of officers of the Company, and without any independent investigation or verification, the Company is not an "investment company" (as such term is defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended).
The foregoing opinions are subject to the following (in addition to the qualifications and other limitations set forth above):
(a)         The enforceability of the Facility Documents, and the rights and remedies set forth in the Facility Documents and the compliance with law of the execution, delivery and

performance of the Facility Documents are subject to established and evolving principles of equity, commercial reasonableness and conscionability, and to the limitations imposed by applicable law on (i) the enforceability of purported waivers of rights and defenses, (ii) the granting of rights, remedies, covenants or security in excess of those available under applicable law, and (iii) the exercise and availability of remedies and defenses generally, including the availability or non availability of the remedy of specific performance.
(b)         We express no opinion with respect to the legality, validity, binding nature, enforceability or compliance with laws or regulations of any terms in the Facility Documents with respect to the rate of interest, late charges, increases in interest rates upon delinquency in payment or the occurrence of an Event of Default under the Facility Documents or when the Company is in default, prepayment premiums or matters governed by usury laws in general or with respect to the effect of any laws relating to usury or permissible rates of interest in the event, and to the extent, that the interest rates specified under the Facility Documents calculated pursuant to Michigan usury laws (and which include in such calculations all amounts that are deemed to be interest under Michigan law, regardless of how they are denominated in the Facility Documents) exceed (i) a simple annual interest rate of 25% (the Michigan criminal usury limit) on the amounts actually advanced and from time to time outstanding, or (ii) a simple annual interest rate of 10% on delinquent installments of interest. In addition, we express no opinion with respect to the legality, validity, binding nature or enforceability or compliance with laws or regulations of any terms in the Facility Documents with respect to compounding of interest or interest on interest except to the extent that payment of interest on due but unpaid installments of interest would be permitted by MCLA  438.101.
(c)         No opinion is given with respect to any late charges, penalties, forfeitures, liquidated or other pre-measured damages or limitations thereon or any prepayment premiums.
(d)         We express no opinion as to the compliance with law or the enforceability of cumulative remedies of the Administrative Agent or the Banks to the extent they would compensate the Administrative Agent or the Banks in excess of the obligations of the Company.
(e)         We express no opinion as to the enforceability of the indemnification provisions of the Facility Documents, or any provisions exculpating the Administrative Agent or any Bank or any of their respective representatives from any liability, in each case insofar as such provisions might require indemnification or exculpation with respect to any violations of securities laws or relating to any litigation by any party determined adversely to any party other than the Company. We express no opinion as to the enforceability of any provision exculpating the Administrative Agent or any Bank or any of their respective representatives as to any loss, cost or expense arising out of any violation by any party other than the Company of any of that party's duties, the Facility Documents, general principles of equity or public policy.
(f)         We express no opinion as to whether courts of any jurisdiction would enforce a waiver of objection to jurisdiction or venue or an objection based on or any other provisions relating to the operations of courts, court rules, service of process, witnesses at a trial, discovery, rules of evidence or the conduct of litigation in such court.

(g)         Notwithstanding anything contained in the Facility Documents, the Administrative Agent and the Banks may be limited to recovering only reasonable expenses with respect to enforcement or collection of the obligations under the Facility Documents.
(h)         For purposes of this opinion letter, "Law" means the statutes, and the judicial and administrative decisions, and the rules and regulations of the governmental agencies of the applicable jurisdiction, but excluding the statutes and ordinances, the administrative decisions, and the rules and regulations of counties, towns, municipalities and special political subdivisions (whether created or enabled through legislative action at the federal, state or regional level), and judicial decisions to the extent that they deal with any of the foregoing.
(i)         We have only considered the applicability of Laws that a lawyer in the State of Michigan exercising customary professional diligence would reasonably recognize as being directly applicable to the Company, the transactions described in the Facility Documents, or both. We disclaim any opinion with respect to specialized laws that are not customarily covered in opinion letters of this kind, such as tax, securities (except with respect to the opinion given in paragraph 9 above), insolvency, antitrust, pension, employee benefit, environmental, intellectual property, bank regulatory, insurance, labor, and health and safety laws.
(j)         The term "" means the actual conscious awareness of Norman H. Beitner and Thomas E. Przybylski, who constitute the only attorneys in this firm who were involved in the transactions contemplated by the Facility Documents, without any independent inquiry or search of public records, court dockets or files within this firm.
