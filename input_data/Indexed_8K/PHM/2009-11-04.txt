 Pulte Homes (NYSE: PHM) announced today financial results for its third quarter ended September 30, 2009. For the quarter, the Company reported a net loss of $361.4 million, or $1.15 per share, inclusive of approximately $86.7 million of charges and transaction costs associated with its merger with Centex Corporation and $163.8 million in inventory impairments and other land-related charges. The Company also recorded a $47.4 million loss related to the debt retired in the quarter. For the comparable period in 2008, the Company reported a net loss of $280.4 million, or $1.11 per share, including impairments and land-related charges of $266.6 million.
Bloomfield Hills, Mich., November 4, 2009
Consolidated revenue for the quarter was $1.1 billion, compared with prior year revenue of $1.6 billion.
On August 18, 2009, Pulte Homes completed its previously announced merger with Centex Corporation. The Company's 2009 third quarter and nine month financials are inclusive of Centex's operations for the period from August 19, 2009 through September 30, 2009. Prior year results have not been adjusted for the merger.
 
"We are continuing to make progress in the performance of our business as Pulte's third quarter gross margin before interest, merger costs, impairments and land-related charges expanded to 13.1%, an increase of 370 basis points from the second quarter 2009," said Richard J. Dugas, Jr., Chairman, President and CEO of Pulte Homes. "Looking past the quarter, our merger with Centex offers powerful near-term opportunities as reflected in our increased synergy and savings target of $440 million on an annualized basis. In addition, our post-merger analysis indicates the potential to realize annualized purchasing synergies on the combined business in the range of $150 million to $200 million.
"Longer term, Centex's strong brand and 27,000 finished lots, many in communities serving the first-time homebuyer, enable Pulte to expand its presence within this important customer segment with minimal future investment. We are rapidly integrating the two companies and are pleased with the opportunities we see to serve more customers, drive greater construction efficiencies, and accelerate our return to profitability.
"Beyond the impact of the merger, Pulte's Q3 results reflect a homebuilding industry that continues its transition toward more stable market conditions as lower prices and historically low mortgage rates are helping to support homebuyer demand," said Mr. Dugas. "Challenges remain, however, as economic weakness, foreclosures, rising unemployment and recent uncertainty over the expiration of the federal tax credit continue to influence buyer behavior."
Third Quarter Results
Revenue from homebuilding settlements in the third quarter ended September 30, 2009, totaled $1.1 billion, compared with $1.5 billion in last year's third quarter. Lower revenue for the quarter reflects a 23% decrease in closings to 4,166 homes, combined with a 10% decrease in average selling price to $253,000. Revenue and closings for the period benefitted from the inclusion of Centex's operations for the final six weeks of the quarter.
Homebuilding cost of sales for the third quarter totaled $1.1 billion, inclusive of $10.5 million of merger-related charges and $132.6 million of impairments and land-related charges. For the prior year quarter, homebuilding cost of sales was $1.6 billion, inclusive of $249.9 million in impairments and land-related charges.
Reported homebuilding selling, general & administrative (SG&A) expense for the period was $209.1 million, inclusive of $51 million of one-time, merger-related expenses. Excluding merger-related costs, SG&A for the quarter was 15.0% of settlement revenue. SG&A expense for the third quarter 2008 was $192.0 million, or 12.7% of settlement revenue.
 
Inclusive of all merger costs and impairment and land-related charges of $240.5 million, the Company's reported third quarter homebuilding pre-tax loss was $291.6 million. For the comparable prior year period, the Company reported a $302.0 million pre-tax loss inclusive of $266.6 million of impairments and land-related charges.
Third quarter 2009 net new home orders, inclusive of Centex operations for the period of August 19, 2009 through September 30, 2009 increased 35% to 4,048 homes compared with prior year orders of 3,008 homes. The Company's reported quarter-end backlog as of September 30, 2009 was 8,383 homes, valued at $2.2 billion. Reported backlog reflects the inclusion of 4,585 homes which were in Centex's backlog at merger close and which were recorded directly to Pulte's backlog without impacting sign-ups for the period. At quarter end, Centex's backlog totaled 4,316 homes. Backlog for the third quarter 2008 was 5,885 homes, valued at $1.7 billion.
The Company's financial services operations reported a pre-tax loss of $8.6 million for the quarter, compared with pre-tax income of $10.1 million for the prior year. Financial services results for the quarter are inclusive of Centex's mortgage and title operations for the period from August 19, 2009 through September 30, 2009. The change in pre-tax income for the period was due to a 24% decline in mortgage loans originated during the quarter compared with the prior year, increased loan-loss reserves and merger-related costs. The mortgage capture rate for the quarter was 86%, compared with 93% for the same period last year.
Nine Month Results
For the nine months ended September 30, 2009, Pulte Homes' net loss was $1.1 billion, or $3.88 per share, compared with a net loss of $1.1 billion, or $4.48 per share, for the prior year period. Consolidated revenue for the period was $2.4 billion, compared with $4.6 billion for the first nine months of last year. Reported 2009 nine-month financial results reflect the Company's merger with Centex Corporation that closed on August 18, 2009. Reported results are inclusive of Centex for the period from August 19, 2009 through September 30, 2009. Prior year results have not been adjusted for the merger.
Revenue from homebuilding settlements for the period was $2.3 billion, compared with revenue of $4.5 billion in the prior year. Revenue for the period benefitted from the inclusion of approximately six weeks of Centex results, partially offset by a 10% decrease in average selling price to $258,000, combined with a 43% decrease in the number of closings to 8,813 homes.
The Company's reported homebuilding pre-tax loss for the period narrowed to $987 million, an improvement from a pre-tax loss of $1.2 billion for the prior year period. Homebuilding SG&A expense for the period, inclusive of $56.6 million in merger-related
 
costs, totaled $442.6 million compared with $571.6 million in the prior year. For the first nine months, the Company recorded $693.3 million of impairments and land-related charges. For the prior year period, impairments and land-related charges totaled $1.2 billion.
For the first nine months of 2009, Pulte's financial services operations, inclusive of approximately six weeks of Centex's mortgage and title operations, generated a pre-tax loss of $18.7 million, compared with pre-tax income of $35.9 million in the prior year. The pre-tax loss reported in 2009 was due to a 43% decline in mortgage loans originated during the period compared with the prior year period, increased loan-loss reserves and merger-related costs.
Credit Facility Update
As of September 30, 2009, Pulte Homes was not in compliance with the tangible net worth covenant under its credit facility. The Company subsequently requested and received a limited waiver from its banks until December 15, 2009, permitting the Company to issue letters of credit under the credit facility during the term of the waiver. The Company expects to negotiate a permanent amendment by December 15, 2009, but there can be no assurance that any agreement regarding the amendment can be reached. If the Company does not reach an agreement with its banks prior to expiration of the waiver, the Company may seek an extension of the waiver or alternatively terminate the credit facility. In the event the Company terminates the credit facility, it believes it has sufficient liquidity given its current and expected cash position.
Merger Update
Following completion of its merger with Centex on August 18, 2009, Pulte immediately began integrating the corporate and field operations of the two companies with the goal of achieving the merger's strategic benefits related to profitability, cost savings, operating efficiencies and branding. The Company estimates that synergies realized through the fourth quarter 2009 are expected to generate annualized cost savings of $260 million. Further, the Company expects to reach its initial synergy target of $350 million annually early in 2010 and reach $440 million of savings on an annualized basis by year end 2010. Incremental to these savings, the Company's post-merger analysis indicates the potential to realize purchasing synergies on the combined business in the range of $150 million to $200 million.
As previously announced, on September 9, 2009, the Company successfully completed its tender for $1.5 billion of outstanding Pulte Homes and Centex senior notes. The Company retired a total of $1.7 billion of outstanding debt during the quarter, and retired $1.9 billion of debt for the first nine months of the year.
"In addition to improving our net-debt-to-total-capital ratio to 45%, Pulte's $1.9 billion in debt repayments will reduce the Company's annual interest payments by approximately $130 million, which is $30 million more than estimated when we announced the Centex merger," said Roger A. Cregg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. "At quarter end, we had $1.6 billion of cash on the balance sheet, which we expect will grow to $2.0 billion by year end."
