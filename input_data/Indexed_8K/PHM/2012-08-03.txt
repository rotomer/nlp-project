Mr. Dugas does not retain or exercise any discretion over the exercise of his options or trading under the plan, although he may later amend or terminate the plan.
The plan expires on December 12, 2012. The transactions under this plan will be disclosed publicly through Form 144 and Form 4 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The plan was adopted during an authorized trading period at a time when Mr. Dugas was not in possession of material, non-public information and in compliance with the Company's policies on trading shares.
The Company undertakes no obligation to report on Form 8-K any Rule 10b5-1 plans that may be adopted by any of its officers and directors or to report on Form 8-K any modifications or termination of any publicly announced trading plans, except to the extent required by law.
