1 Applicability and Defined Terms
.
1.1.
    
Applicability
. From time to time the parties hereto may enter into transactions in which the Seller agrees to transfer to
the Agent on behalf of the Buyers, Eligible Loans on a servicing released basis against the transfer of funds by the Buyers, with a simultaneous agreement by the Buyers to transfer to the Seller such Eligible Loans at a date certain or on demand in the event of termination pursuant to
Section 18.2
hereof, or if no demand is sooner made, on the Termination Date, against the transfer of funds by the Seller. Each such transaction shall be referred to herein as a Transaction and shall be governed by this Agreement, as hereinafter defined.
Comerica Bank has also agreed to provide a separate revolving swing line repurchase facility to initially and temporarily purchase Eligible Loans pending their purchase by all of the Buyers pursuant to this Agreement.
The parties hereby specifically declare that it is their intention that this Master Repurchase Agreement (as amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the Agreement, which term includes the preamble above) and the purchases of Eligible Loans made pursuant to it (under both its regular and swing line provisions) are to be treated as repurchase transactions under the Title 11 of the United States Code, as amended (the 
Bankruptcy Code
), including all rights that accrue to the Buyers by virtue of sections 559, 561 and 562 of the Bankruptcy Code. This Agreement also contains lien provisions with respect to the Purchased Loans so that if, contrary to the intent of the parties, any court of competent jurisdiction characterizes any Transaction as a financing, rather than a purchase, under applicable law, including the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, the Agent is deemed to have a first priority perfected security interest in and to the Purchased Loans to secure the payment and performance of all of the Sellers Obligations under this Agreement and the other Repurchase Documents.
The Buyers agreement to establish and continue the revolving repurchase facilities, and Comerica Banks agreement to establish and continue such revolving swing line repurchase facility, are each made upon and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. If there is any conflict or inconsistency between any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement and any of the other Repurchase Documents, this Agreement shall govern and control. If there is any conflict between any provision of this Agreement and any later supplement, amendment, restatement or replacement of it, then the latter shall govern and control.

.
2.1.
    
The Buyers Commitments to Purchase
. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including without limitation the terms and conditions set forth in
Section 4
and
Section 14
) and provided no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing that has not been waived by the Buyers or the Required Buyers, as applicable (or, if one has occurred and not been so cured or declared waived, if all of the Buyers, in their sole discretion and with or without waiving such Default or Event of Default, have elected in writing that Transactions under this Agreement shall continue nonetheless), the Buyers agree to make revolving purchases of Eligible Loans on a servicing released basis through but not including the Termination Date, so long as the Aggregate Outstanding Purchase Price does not exceed the Maximum Aggregate Commitment and so long as each Buyers Committed Sum is not exceeded. The Buyers respective Committed Sums and the Maximum Aggregate Commitment are set forth on
Schedule BC
in effect at the relevant time, as it may have been amended or restated pursuant to this Agreement. Upon the joinder of additional Buyer(s), if any, the parties agree to approve in writing revised and updated versions of
Schedule BC
. The fractions to be applied to determine the respective Funding Shares of the Buyers for any day are their respective Committed Sums divided by the Maximum Aggregate Commitment for that day. Each Buyer shall be obligated to fund only that Buyers own Funding Share of any Transaction requested, and no Buyer shall be obligated to the Seller or any other Buyer to fund a greater share of any Transaction. No Buyer shall be excused from funding its applicable Funding Share of any Transaction merely because any other Buyer has failed or refused to fund its relevant Funding Share of that or any other Transaction. If any Buyer fails to fund its Funding Share of any Transaction (a Nonfunding Buyer), the Agent (in its sole and absolute discretion) may choose to fund the amount that such Nonfunding Buyer failed or refused to fund, or the Agent as a Buyer and the other Buyers who are willing to do so may (in each of their sole and absolute discretion) do so in the proportion that the Committed Sum of each bears to the total Committed Sums of all Buyers that have funded (or are funding) their own Funding Shares of that Transaction and that are willing to fund part of the Funding Share of such Nonfunding Buyer. Should the Agent and/or any other Buyer(s) fund any or all of the Nonfunding Buyers Funding Share of any Transaction, then the Nonfunding Buyer shall have the obligation to deliver such amount to the Agent (for its own account and/or for distribution to the Buyer(s) who funded it, as the case may be) in immediately available funds on the next Business Day. Regardless of whether the other Buyers fund the Funding Share of the Nonfunding Buyer, the respective ownership interests of the Buyers in the Transaction shall be adjusted as provided in
Section 3.10
. The obligations of the Buyers hereunder are several and not joint.
2.2.
    
Expiration or Termination of the Commitments
. Unless extended in writing or terminated earlier in accordance with this Agreement, the Buyers Commitments (including Comerica Banks Swing Line Commitment) shall automatically expire at the close of business on the Termination Date, without any requirement for notice or any other action by the Agent, any of the Buyers or any other Person.
2.3.

29
Detroit\1205907\17\

(with respect to the initial purchase hereunder) and
Section 14.2
have been satisfied;
(iii)
    
so long as (A) the Swing Line Limit is not exceeded and (B) such Swing Line Transaction will not cause the sum of Comerica Banks Funding Share of the Swing Line Transactions plus Comerica Banks Funding Share of all Open Transactions to exceed Comerica Banks Commitment;
(iv)
    
so long as, after giving effect to the proposed Swing Line Transaction, the Aggregate Outstanding Purchase Price would not exceed the Maximum Aggregate Commitment;

Lafayette Blvd. Detroit, MI 48226, which shall be paid by Agent to the Swing Line Buyer for application against the Swing Line Transaction, whereupon the Swing Line Transaction shall be deemed a Regular Transaction.
(e)
    
If, on any Swing Line Refunding Due Date, an Event of Default under
Section 18.1(b)
shall have occurred and be continuing, each Buyer shall, no later than 4:00 p.m. (Detroit, Michigan time) on such Swing Line Refunding Due Date, purchase a participation in the Swing Line Transaction by immediately transferring to the Agent, for the benefit of the Swing Line Buyer, in immediately available funds, an amount equal to its Funding Share of the Purchase Price of such Swing Line Transaction, and upon its receipt thereof, the Agent shall deliver to such Buyer a certificate evidencing such participation.
(f)
    
Unless a Buyer shall have notified the Swing Line Buyer, prior to any Swing Line Transaction, that any applicable condition precedent set forth in
Sections 14.1 or 14.2
had not then been satisfied, such Buyers obligation to convert the Swing Line Transaction to a Regular Transaction pursuant to clause (d) of this
Section 2.5
or to purchase a participation in respect of such Swing Line Transaction pursuant to clause (e) of this
Section 2.5

Section 2.5
, the Agent shall be entitled to receive, retain and apply against such obligation the Repurchase Prices (including Price Differential) otherwise payable to such Buyer hereunder
31
Detroit\1205907\17\
until the Agent receives such payment from such Buyer or such obligation is otherwise fully satisfied. In addition to the foregoing, if for any reason any Buyer fails to make payment to the Agent of any amount due under this
Section 2.5
, such Buyer shall be deemed, at the option of the Agent, to have unconditionally and irrevocably purchased from the Swing Line Buyer, without recourse or warranty, an undivided interest and participation in the applicable Swing Line Transaction in the amount of such Buyers Funding Share of that Transaction, and such interest and participation may be recovered from such Buyer together with interest thereon at the Federal Funds Rate for each day during the period commencing on the date of demand and ending on the date such amount is received. On the Termination Date, the Seller shall repurchase all Purchased Loans then subject to a Swing Line Transaction.

The Agent shall disburse to the Swing Line Buyer an amount equal to the sum of the Funding Shares funded by all of the other Buyers in respect of the refunding of any Swing Line Transaction;
provided
that if a Buyer other than the Swing Line Buyer advises the Agent by telephone and confirms the advice by fax that such Buyer has placed all of its Funding Share on the federal funds wire to the Agent, the Agent shall continue to keep the Swing Line Transaction outstanding to the extent of that Buyers Funding Share so wired until such Buyers Funding Share is received by Agent, and the Agent shall then repay the Swing Line Buyer that still-outstanding portion of the Swing Line Transaction from such funds wired to and received by the Agent, and the Price Differential accrued at the Pricing Rate(s) applicable to the Transaction on that Funding Share for the period from (and including) the relevant Swing Line Refunding Due Date to (but excluding) the date such Buyers Funding Share is received by the Agent shall belong to the Swing Line Buyer.

Pursuant to the Parent Repurchase Agreement, the Seller has sold certain Mortgage Loans and related rights to Parent prior to the Effective Date (collectively, the 
Existing Mortgage Loan Portfolio
) with Seller having the right, and obligation, to repurchase the Existing Mortgage Loan Portfolio. The Basic Papers for such Mortgage Loans to be repurchased are held by Bank of New York Mellon Trust Co., N.A., as custodian for Parent (in such capacity, 
Parent Custodian
). Prior to the Effective Date, the Seller has furnished to the Agent (i) a Request/Confirmation for the initial Transaction to purchase all or a portion of the Existing Mortgage Loan Portfolio (such Mortgage Loans to be purchased under such Request/Confirmation being referred to herein as 
Initial Loans to be Purchased
), and (ii) a letter signed by the Parent (the 
Parent Repurchase Letter
) which shall (A) state the repurchase price required to be paid to Parent for Seller to repurchase the Initial Loans to be Purchased from the Parent on the Effective Date (the 
Initial Loans Repurchase Price
), (B) provide that upon receipt of the Initial Loans Repurchase Price, Parent automatically releases any security interest it may have in the Initial Loans to be
35
Detroit\1205907\17\
Purchased or the Collateral with respect thereto, and Parent shall have no further ownership, security interest or other interest therein, (C) irrevocably authorize and direct the Parent Custodian, upon payment by Agent to Parent of the Initial Loans Repurchase Price, to deliver to Custodian all Basic Papers and other documents in Parent Custodians possession evidencing or relating to any of the Initial Loans to be Purchased, and deliver to Agent any escrows, principal and interest payments and other funds in Parent Custodians possession constituting Collateral relating to any of the Initial Loans to be Purchased, and (D) provide that, upon payment by Agent to Parent of the Initial Loans Repurchase Price, Parent shall pay over to Agent any escrows, principal and interest payments and other funds in Parents possession constituting Collateral relating to any of the Initial Loans to be Purchased.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, on the Effective Date the Buyers shall purchase all Initial Loans to be Purchased (such Transaction being referred to herein as the Initial Transaction). Seller represents and warrants to the Agent and the Buyers that all Initial Loans to be Purchased will, upon purchase by Buyers, be Eligible Loans. To the extent the Initial Loans Repurchase Price is greater than the Purchase Price for the Initial Loans to be Purchased under this Agreement, prior to the Effective Date Seller shall transfer to Agent (in the case of cash) or the Custodian (in the case of Additional Purchased Loans), either (at the Sellers option) cash, Additional Purchased Loans, or a combination of cash and Additional Purchased Loans, so that the cash and the aggregate Purchase Value of the Initial Loans to be Purchased and Additional Purchased Loans will thereupon at least equal the Purchase Price for the Initial Loans to be Purchased. On the Effective Date, the proceeds of the Initial Transaction together with the amount of any cash required to be paid by Seller to Agent as aforesaid, shall be paid to Parent by wire transfer in accordance with the wire instructions provided in the Parent Repurchase Letter, to enable the Seller to repurchase from Parent the Initial Loans to be Purchased.

. Seller shall furnish to Agent by 3:00 p.m. Eastern time on each Business Day, a Repurchase Settlement Account Disbursement Request which details the amounts and sources of all funds in the Repurchase Settlement Account, and requests disbursement of such funds. With respect to any Repurchase Settlement Account Disbursement Request furnished by Seller to Agent, if, and only if, (i) no Default has occurred unless it has been either cured by the Seller or waived in writing by the Agent (acting with the requisite consent of the Buyers as provided in this Agreement), (ii) no Event of Default has occurred unless it has been either cured by the Seller or waived in writing by the Agent (acting with the requisite consent of the Buyers as provided in this Agreement), (iii) no Margin Deficit exists that would not be eliminated by disbursements in accordance with such Repurchase Settlement Account Disbursement Request, and (iv) no Default or Event of Default or Margin Deficit will result from the making of the disbursements requested in such Repurchase Settlement Account Disbursement Request, then Agent shall disburse the funds in the Repurchase Settlement Account in accordance with the Repurchase Settlement Account Disbursement Request. After the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, Seller shall have no further right to request disbursements of funds in the Repurchase Settlement Account, and Agent may at any time and from time to time apply funds in the Repurchase Settlement Account to pay Sellers Obligations whether or not then
36
Detroit\1205907\17\
due.
3.8.
    
Delivery of Additional Mortgage Loans
. The Seller may from time to time deliver to the Custodian for and on behalf of Agent Mortgage Loans that are also Eligible Loans without entering into a new Transaction by providing to the Custodian the documents required under
Section 3.1(a)
with respect to such Mortgage Loans. The Seller and the Buyers agree that such Mortgage Loans delivered pursuant to this
Section 3.8
shall be treated as Purchased Loans subject to the existing Transactions hereunder from the date of such delivery.
3.9.
    
Application of Purchase Price Decreases
. Upon receipt by the Agent of amounts paid or prepaid as Purchase Price Decreases (except upon the exercise of remedies provided in
Section 18
) the Agent shall apply amounts so received to outstanding Purchase Price.
3.10.
    
Defaulting Buyers
. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any Buyer becomes a Defaulting Buyer, then the following provisions shall apply for so long as such Buyer is a Defaulting Buyer:
(a)
    
applicable fees shall cease to accrue on the unfunded portion of the Commitment of such Defaulting Buyer pursuant to
Section 9.1
;
(b)
    
the Commitment of and the outstanding Purchase Prices paid by such Defaulting Buyer shall not be included in determining whether all Buyers or the Required Buyers have taken or may take any action hereunder (including any consent to any amendment or waiver pursuant to
Section 22
), provided that any waiver, amendment or modification requiring the consent of all Buyers or each affected Buyer which affects such Defaulting Buyer differently than other affected Buyers shall require the consent of such Defaulting Buyer;
(c)
    
if any Swing Line Transactions shall exist at the time a Buyer becomes a Defaulting Buyer then the Seller shall within one Business Day following notice by the Agent repurchase the Purchased Loans subject to such Swing Line Transactions;
(d)
    
the respective ownership interests of both (i) the Defaulting Buyer and (ii) the Buyer (or Buyers) that funded the Defaulting Buyers Funding Share(s) of any Transaction shall be proportionately decreased and increased, respectively, to the same extent as if their respective Committed Sums were changed in direct proportion to the unreimbursed balance outstanding from time to time thereafter of the amount so funded;
(e)
    
if no other Buyer funds any of the Defaulting Buyers Funding Share, then the Pro Rata ownership interests of the Buyers in the Purchased Loans shall be changed, so that each Buyers Pro Rata ownership interest in the Purchased Loans is equal to the ratio of (i) the sum of the portions of the Purchase Prices paid by that Buyer in all Open Transactions on that day to (ii) the total of the Purchase Prices paid by all Buyers in all Open Transactions on that day, but the Defaulting Buyers share of all subsequent distributions of any Repurchase Price and Margin Deficit payments shall be paid to the other Buyers, pro rata among them in the ratio that the Pro Rata ownership interest in the Purchased Loans owned by each bears to the aggregate Pro Rata ownership interests in the Purchased Loans
37
Detroit\1205907\17\
of all such other Buyers, and the Buyers respective Pro Rata ownership interests in the Purchased Loans shall be readjusted after each such payment, until their Pro Rata ownership interests are restored to what they were before any Defaulting Buyer failed to fund. Notwithstanding any such changes in the Buyers Pro Rata ownership interests in any Purchased Loan due to any Buyers failure to fund its Funding Share(s) of any Transaction, such failure to fund shall not diminish any Buyers Funding Share(s) for subsequent Transactions; and
(f)
    
any amount payable to such Defaulting Buyer hereunder (whether on account of Repurchase Price, Price Differential, Margin Deficits, Purchase Price Decrease, fees or otherwise and including any amount that would otherwise be payable to such Defaulting Buyer pursuant to
Section 20.2
but excluding
Section 6.4
) shall, in lieu of being distributed to such Defaulting Buyer, be retained by the Agent in a segregated account and, subject to any applicable requirements of law, be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the Agent (i) first, to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Buyer to the Agent hereunder, (ii) second, pro rata, to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Buyer to the Swing Line Buyer hereunder, (iii) third, to the funding of any Transaction or the funding of any participating interest in any Swing Line Transaction in respect of which such Defaulting Buyer has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by the Agent, (iv) fourth, if so determined by the Agent and the Seller, held in such account as cash collateral for future funding obligations of the Defaulting Buyer under this Agreement, (v) fifth, pro rata, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Seller or the Buyers as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Seller or any Buyer against such Defaulting Buyer as a result of such Defaulting Buyers breach of its obligations under this Agreement, and (vi) sixth, to such Defaulting Buyer or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction;
provided
, that if such payment is (x) a Purchase Price Decrease and (y) made at a time when the conditions set forth in
Section 14.2
are satisfied, such payment shall be applied solely to reduce the Purchase Prices owed to all Buyers that are not Defaulting Buyers Pro Rata prior to being applied to any Purchase Prices owed to any Defaulting Buyer.
In the event that the Agent, the Seller and the Swing Line Buyer each agrees that a Defaulting Buyer has adequately remedied all matters that caused such Buyer to be a Defaulting Buyer (Redeemed Buyer), then the Swing Line Exposure of the other Buyers shall be readjusted to reflect the inclusion of such Redeemed Buyers Commitment and on such date such Redeemed Buyer shall purchase from the other Buyers at par a portion of the Open Transactions as the Agent shall determine may be necessary in order for such Redeemed Buyer to participate in such Open Transactions in accordance with its Pro Rata share. For purposes of this
Section 3.11
, Swing Line Exposure means, with respect to any Buyer at any time, such Buyers Pro Rata share of the aggregate Purchase Prices of all Swing Line Transactions outstanding at such time.
Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be deemed to constitute a waiver by the Seller of any of its rights or remedies (whether in equity or law) against any Buyer which fails to fund any Transaction hereunder at the time or in the amount required to be funded under the terms of this Agreement.

5.4.
    
Adjustments to Buyers Price Differential based on Qualifying Balances
A particular Buyer and the Seller may, from time to time, agree by separate agreement to adjustments to such Buyers Price Differential based on Qualifying Balances (Price Differential Adjustment Agreement), provided, however, that no such adjustments shall result in a Buyer receiving more than it would have been entitled to receive with respect to any Transaction under the terms of this Agreement. Prior to or concurrently with the execution of any Price Differential Adjustment Agreement, any such Buyer shall inform the Agent of the terms of any such adjustments (such
40
Detroit\1205907\17\
terms to be administratively acceptable to Agent). Such Buyer shall notify Agent of any adjustments to the Price Differential made pursuant to a Price Differential Adjustment Agreement in accordance with this Section 5.4. The adjustments identified in such notice shall become effective on a date determined by Agent (but in any event shall not become effective prior to the date such notice is received).
6 Margin Maintenance.
6.1.
    
Margin Deficit
.     
(a)
    
If at any time the aggregate Purchase Value of all Purchased Loans subject to all Transactions hereunder is less than the aggregate Repurchase Price (excluding Price Differential), minus, without duplication, cash transfers previously made from the Seller to the Agent in response to previous Margin Calls, if any, for all such Transactions (a 
Margin Deficit
), then by notice to the Seller (a 
Margin Call
), the Agent shall require the Seller to transfer (for the account of the Buyers) to the Agent (in the case of cash) or the Custodian (in the case of Additional Purchased Loans, as defined below), as appropriate, either (at the Sellers option) cash, additional Eligible Loans reasonably acceptable to the Agent (
Additional Purchased Loans
), or a combination of cash and Additional Purchased Loans, so that the cash and the aggregate Purchase Value of the Purchased Loans, including any such Additional Purchased Loans, will thereupon at least equal the then aggregate Repurchase Price (excluding Price Differential).
(b)
    
On any Business Day on which the Purchase Value of the Purchased Loans subject to Transactions exceeds the then outstanding aggregate Repurchase Price (excluding Price Differential) of all Transactions (a 
Margin Excess
), so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing or will result therefrom, the Agent shall, upon receipt of a written request from the Seller, remit cash or authorize Custodian to release Purchased Loans, as requested by the Seller, in either case in an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the amount requested by the Seller and (ii) such Margin Excess, subject always to the other limitations of this Agreement. If cash is to be remitted the Agent shall treat the receipt of the written request of the Seller under this
Section 6.1(b)
as if it were a request for a Transaction. To the extent the Agent remits cash to the Seller, such cash shall be (A) additional Purchase Price with respect to the Transactions, and (B) subject in all respects to the provisions and limitations of this Agreement. Each Buyer shall fund its Pro Rata share of such additional Purchase Price as if the remission of such Margin Excess were the initiation of a Transaction hereunder.
6.2.

6.4.
    
Increased Cost
. If any Change in Law:
(a)
    
shall subject such Buyer (or its LIBOR Lending Office) to any tax, duty or other charge with respect to this Agreement or any Transaction or change the basis of taxation of payments to the Buyer in respect thereof (except for changes in the rate of tax on the overall net income of Buyer or its LIBOR Lending Office imposed by the jurisdiction in which Buyer's principal executive office or LIBOR Lending Office is located);
(b)
    
shall impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve (including, without limitation, any imposed by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System), special deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by Buyer (or its LIBOR Lending Office), or shall impose on Buyer (or its LIBOR Lending Office) or the foreign exchange and interbank markets any other condition affecting this Agreement or the making or maintaining of Transactions hereunder; or
(c)
    
shall impose on the Buyer any other condition:
and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Buyer, by an amount which the Buyer deems to be material, of entering, continuing or maintaining any Transaction or to reduce any amount due or owing hereunder in respect thereof, then in any such case, the Seller shall promptly pay the Agent (for distribution to such Buyer) such additional amount or amounts as calculated by the Buyer in good faith as will compensate the Buyer for such increased cost or reduced amount. A certificate of a Buyer, prepared in good faith and in reasonable detail by such Buyer and submitted to the Seller and the Agent, setting forth the basis for determining such additional amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Buyer shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.
6.5    Capital Adequacy.
If any Change in Law affects or would affect the amount of capital or liquidity required or expected to be maintained by such Buyer (or any corporation controlling such Buyer), and such Buyer determines that the amount of such capital is increased by or based upon the existence of any its obligations hereunder or the maintaining of any Transactions, and such increase has the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Buyer's (or such controlling corporation's) capital as a consequence of such obligations or the maintaining of such Transactions to a level below that which such Buyer (or such controlling corporation) could have achieved but for such circumstances (taking into consideration its policies with respect to capital adequacy), then the Seller shall pay to such Buyer, within fifteen (15) days of the Seller's receipt of written notice from such Buyer demanding such compensation, additional amounts as are sufficient to compensate such Buyer (or such controlling corporation) for any increase in the amount of capital and reduced rate of return which Buyer reasonably determines to be allocable to the existence of any obligations of the Buyer hereunder or to maintaining any Transactions hereunder. A certificate of a Buyer as to the amount
42
Detroit\1205907\17\
of such compensation, prepared in good faith and in reasonable detail by the Buyer and submitted to the Seller, shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes absent manifest error.
6.6.
    
Market Valuations for Purchase Values
. In the discretion of the Agent or Required Buyers if it or they reasonably determine that market conditions warrant (except that the Agent shall have no obligation to make such determination more frequently than once per day), the Agent may (a) notify Custodian that Agent desires to re-calculate the Purchase Values of all or a portion of the Purchased Loans using the Market Values of such Purchased Loans, which notice shall include the Market Values determined by Agent for such Purchased Loans, and (b) obtain from Custodian an updated Purchased Loan Collateral Activity Summary Report taking into account such Market Values.
6.7.
    
Provisions Relating to Daily Adjusting LIBOR Rate
.
(a)
    
If the Agent or the Required Buyers (after consultation with the Agent) shall determine in good faith that, (a) it is or they are unable to determine or ascertain the Daily Adjusting LIBOR Rate, or (b) by reason of circumstances affecting the foreign exchange and interbank markets generally, deposits in eurodollars in the applicable amounts or for the relative maturities are not being offered to Agent or such Buyers, or (c) the Daily Adjusting LIBOR Rate will not accurately or fairly cover or reflect the cost of making, maintaining or funding any Transaction based upon the Daily Adjusting LIBOR Rate, then Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof to the Seller. Thereafter, until Agent notifies the Seller that such conditions or circumstances no longer exist, the Prime Referenced Rate shall be the applicable Pricing Rate for all Transactions during such period of time, and each Transaction which bears interest at or by reference to the Daily Adjusting LIBOR Rate shall automatically be converted into a Transaction with a Pricing Rate determined by reference to the Prime Referenced Rate.
(b)
    
If any Change in Law shall make it unlawful or impossible for any of the Buyers (or any of their respective LIBOR Lending Offices) to honor its obligations hereunder to make or maintain any Transaction which bears interest at or by reference to the Daily Adjusting LIBOR Rate, such Buyer shall give notice thereof to the Seller and the Agent. Thereafter, until such Buyer notifies the Seller that such conditions or circumstances no longer exist, the Prime Referenced Rate shall be the applicable Pricing Rate for all Transactions hereunder during such period of time, and if any of the Buyers may not lawfully continue to maintain any existing Transaction with a Pricing Rate determined at or by reference to the Daily Adjusting LIBOR Rate, the applicable Transaction shall immediately be converted to a Transaction with a Pricing Rate determined by reference to the Prime Referenced Rate. For purposes of this Section, a change in law, rule, regulation, interpretation or administration shall include, without limitation, any change made or which becomes effective on the basis of a law, rule, regulation, interpretation or administration presently in force, the effective date of which change is delayed by the terms of such law, rule, regulation, interpretation or administration.

. Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement, all payments required by this Agreement or the other Repurchase Documents to be made to the Agent shall be paid to the Agent by no later than 1:00 p.m. (Detroit, Michigan time) on the day when due (funds received after 1:00 p.m. (Detroit, Michigan time) shall be conclusively deemed to have been paid by the Seller on the next following Business Day unless the Agent shall agree otherwise) and without set-off, counterclaim or deduction, in lawful money of the United States of America in immediately available funds as provided in

If Payment Not Made When Due
. If and to the extent any payment is not made when due under this Agreement or any of the other Repurchase Documents, the Seller authorizes the Agent and each Buyer (for the Pro Rata account and benefit of all of the Buyers) then or at any time thereafter to charge any amounts so due and unpaid against any or all of the Sellers accounts with the Agent or any of the Buyers;
provided
that such right to charge the Sellers accounts shall not apply to any escrow, trust or other deposit accounts designated as being held by the Seller on behalf of third party owners of the escrowed funds other than Affiliates of the Seller. The Agent and each Buyer agrees to use reasonable efforts to promptly advise the Seller of any charge made pursuant to this
Section 12.3
, but the failure to do so will not affect the validity or collectability of such charge. Neither the Agent nor any Buyer shall have any obligation to charge any Seller account, merely the right to do so.
12.4.
    
Payments Valid and Effective

Segregation may be accomplished by
53
Detroit\1205907\17\
appropriate identification of ownership on the books and records of the holder of such documents, including MERS, a documents custodian, a financial or securities intermediary, or a clearing corporation.

Section 2.6

Accordingly, the Agent may elect the time and manner of liquidating any Purchased Loan and nothing contained herein shall obligate the Agent to liquidate any Purchased Loan on the occurrence of an Event of Default or to liquidate all Purchased Loans in the same manner or on the same Business Day and no such exercise of any right or remedy shall constitute a waiver of any other right or remedy of the Agent or the Buyers.
19 Servicing of the Purchased Loans

Servicing Released Basis
. Consistent with the Buyers purchase of the Purchased Loans on a servicing-released basis, the Seller shall have no ownership right whatsoever as to any of the Purchased Loans or the servicing rights related thereto, unless and until such Purchased Loans are repurchased by the Seller.

Section 19.7
. The Seller and the Buyers hereby acknowledge and agree that the provisions contained in this
Section 19
are intended to be for the benefit of the Buyers and are an essential part of this Agreement, and that the nature and purpose of the purchase and sale obligations and the servicing obligations hereunder are interrelated.

The Agent may terminate the servicing of any Purchased Loan with the then existing Servicer in accordance with
Section 19.7
. The Seller shall not be entitled to any servicing fee or other compensation in connection with its performance of the servicing responsibilities with respect to the Purchased Loans except to the extent that the Seller is Servicer. Nothing in this
Section 19.2
shall be deemed to impair the rights of any Subservicer to fees and other compensation to which it is entitled under the applicable Servicing Agreement.
19.3.
    
Escrow Payments
. The Seller shall cause Servicer and any Subservicers to hold or cause to be held all escrow payments collected by the Seller with respect to any Purchased

19.5.
    
Servicing Records

Servicing Records
). The Servicing Records are and shall be held in trust by the Seller, Servicer and each Subservicer for the benefit of the Agent as the owner thereof on behalf of the Buyers. Upon notice from the Agent after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, the Seller will cause Servicer and each Subservicer to (a) designate the Buyers as the owner of each Purchased Loan in its collateral tracking system, (b) segregate such Servicing Records from any and all servicing agreements, files, documents, records, data bases, computer tapes, copies of computer tapes, proof of insurance coverage, insurance policies, appraisals, other closing documentation, payment history records, and any other records relating to or evidencing the servicing of assets that are not Purchased Loans, (c) safeguard such Servicing Records and (d) deliver them promptly to the Agent or its designee (including the Custodian) at the Agents request.
19.6.
    
Subservicer Instruction Letter

19.7.
    
Termination of Servicing
. At any time during the existence of a Default or an Event of Default in the Agents sole discretion, the Agent may, and at the direction of the Required Buyers, shall (a) terminate the Sellers rights as Servicer, and any Subservicers rights, if any, and obligations with respect to servicing of the Purchased Loans without payment of any penalty or termination fee (i) immediately with respect to the Seller and (ii) with respect to any Servicer (other than the Seller) or Subservicer, as promptly as possible subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable Servicing Agreement and Subservicer Instruction Letter; provided that any such termination shall be deemed to have occurred automatically upon the occurrence of an Event of Default set forth in
Section 18.1(b)

Upon any such termination, the Seller
82
Detroit\1205907\17\
shall, and shall cause each Subservicer to, (A) perform the servicing responsibilities with respect to the Purchased Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement until the transfer of servicing responsibilities is effectuated and (B) cooperate, at the Sellers expense, in transferring such servicing responsibilities with respect to the Purchased Loans to a successor Servicer appointed by the Agent in its sole discretion. Upon termination of the Seller as Servicer and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Seller shall, in the manner and at such times as the successor servicer or the Agent shall request, (1) promptly transfer all data in the Servicing Records relating to the Purchased Loans to the successor servicer in such electronic format as the successor servicer may reasonably request, (2) promptly transfer to the successor servicer, the Agent or its designee, all other files, records correspondence and documents relating to the Purchased Loans and (3) use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate and coordinate with the successor servicer and the Agent to comply with any applicable so-called goodbye letter requirements or other applicable requirements of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act or other applicable legal or regulatory requirement associated with the transfer of the servicing of the Purchased Loans.

19.8.
    
Notice from Seller
. If the Seller should discover that, for any reason whatsoever, any entity responsible to the Seller by contract for managing or servicing any Purchased Loan has failed to perform in any material respects the Sellers obligations under the Repurchase Documents or any of the material obligations of such entities with respect to the Purchased Loans, the Seller shall promptly notify the Agent.
19.9.
    
Seller Remains Liable
. Notwithstanding any Servicing Agreement or the provisions of this Agreement relating to agreements or arrangements between the Seller and a Subservicer or reference to actions taken through a Subservicer or otherwise, and unless the Agent has terminated the Sellers rights pursuant to Section 19.7, the Seller shall remain obligated and primarily liable to the Buyers for servicing and administering of the Purchased Loans in accordance with the provisions hereof without diminution of such obligation or liability by virtue of such Servicing Agreements or arrangements or by virtue of indemnification from a Subservicer and to the same extent and under the same terms and conditions as if the Seller alone were servicing and administering the Purchased Loans. All actions of each Subservicer performed pursuant to the related Servicing Agreement shall be performed as an agent of the Seller with the same force and effect as if performed directly by the Seller and the Buyers shall have no obligations, duties or liabilities with respect to any Subservicer including no obligation, duty or liability of the Buyers to pay any Subservicers fees and expenses, provided, however, that each Subservicer may retain any amounts collected by it that it is entitled to retain pursuant to the applicable Servicing Agreement or Subservicer Instruction Letter.

Such Successor Agent shall thereupon become the Agent hereunder, as applicable, and Agent shall deliver or cause to be delivered to any successor agent such documents of transfer and assignment as such Successor Agent may reasonably request. If a Successor Agent is not so appointed or does not accept such appointment before the resigning Agents resignation becomes effective, the resigning Agent may appoint a temporary successor to act until such appointment by the Required Buyers and, if applicable, the Seller, is made and accepted, or if no such temporary successor is appointed as provided above by the resigning Agent, the Required Buyers shall thereafter perform all of the duties of the resigning Agent hereunder until such appointment by the Required Buyers and, if applicable, the Seller, is made and accepted. Such Successor Agent shall succeed to all of the rights and obligations of the resigning Agent as if originally named. The resigning Agent shall duly assign, transfer and deliver to such Successor Agent all moneys at the time held by the resigning Agent hereunder after deducting therefrom its expenses for which it is entitled to be reimbursed hereunder. Upon such succession of any such Successor Agent, the resigning Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations, in its capacity as Agent hereunder, except for its gross negligence or willful misconduct arising prior to its resignation hereunder, and the provisions of this Article 12 shall continue in effect for the benefit of the resigning Agent in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as Agent.

Section 22.17
, (and any other attempted assignment or transfer by any Buyer shall be deemed to be null and void). Each assignment by a Buyer of all or any portion of its rights and obligations hereunder and under the other Repurchase Documents, shall be subject to the following terms and conditions: (i) each such assignment shall be in a minimum amount of the lesser of (x) Five Million Dollars
93
Detroit\1205907\17\
($5,000,000) or such lesser amount as the Agent shall agree and (y) the entire remaining amount of assigning Buyers Committed Sum; provided however that, after giving effect to such assignment, in no event shall the entire remaining amount (if any) of assigning Buyers Committed Sum be less than $5,000,000; (ii) each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Buyers rights and obligations under this Agreement, and (iii) the parties to any assignment shall execute and deliver to Agent an Assignment and Assumption substantially (as determined by Agent) in the form attached hereto as
Exhibit E
(with appropriate insertions acceptable to Agent), together with a processing and recordation fee in the amount, if any, required as set forth in the Assignment and Assumption. Until the Assignment and Assumption becomes effective in accordance with its terms, and Agent has confirmed that the assignment satisfies the requirements of this
Section 22.17
, the Seller and the Agent shall be entitled to continue to deal solely and directly with the assigning Buyer in connection with the interest so assigned. From and after the effective date of each Assignment and Assumption that satisfies the requirements of this
Section 22.17
, the assignee thereunder shall be deemed to be a party to this Agreement, such assignee shall have the rights and obligations of a Buyer under this Agreement and the other Repurchase Documents (including without limitation the right to receive fees payable hereunder in respect of the period following such assignment) and the assigning Buyer shall relinquish its rights and be released from its obligations under this Agreement and the other Repurchase Documents. Upon request, the Seller shall execute and deliver to the Agent, documents reasonably necessary to such assignment process;
(b)
    
Participations.
The Seller and the Agent acknowledge that each of the Buyers may at any time and from time to time, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, sell participations in all or any part of such Buyers Commitment and Pro Rata ownership share of the Purchased Loans to any Person (other than a natural person or to the Seller or any of the Sellers Affiliates or Subsidiaries); provided that any participation permitted hereunder shall comply with all applicable laws and shall be subject to a participation agreement that incorporates the following restrictions:
(i)
    
such Buyer shall remain the holder of its Notes hereunder (if such Notes are issued), notwithstanding any such participation;
(ii)
    
a participant shall not reassign or transfer, or grant any sub-participations in its participation interest hereunder or any part thereof; and
(iii)
    
such Buyer shall retain the sole right and responsibility to enforce the obligations of the Seller relating to this Agreement and the other Repurchase Documents, including, without limitation, the right to proceed against any Guarantors, or cause the Agent to do so (subject to the terms and conditions hereof), and the right to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement without the consent of the participant (unless such participant is a Buyer Affiliate), except to the extent such amendment, modification or waiver requires the consent of all Buyers under
Section 22.6
.
In those cases (if any) where a Buyer grants rights to any of its participants to approve amendments, modifications
94
Detroit\1205907\17\
or waivers of any Repurchase Documents pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, such Buyer must include a voting mechanism as to all such approval rights in the relevant participation agreement(s) whereby a readily-determinable fraction of such Buyers portion of the Purchased Loans (whether held by such Buyer or participated) shall control the vote for all of such Buyers portion of the Purchased Loans; provided that if no such voting mechanism is provided for or is fully and immediately effective, then the vote of such Buyer itself shall be the vote for all of such Buyers portion of the Purchased Loans; and provided further that a participant may exercise approval rights over such matters only on an indirect basis, acting through such Buyer, and the Seller, Agent and the other Buyers may continue to deal directly with such Buyer in connection with such Buyers rights and duties hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, in the case of any participation granted by any Buyer hereunder, the participant shall not have any rights under this Agreement or any of the other Repurchase Documents against the Agent, any other Buyer or the Seller; provided, however that the participant may have rights against such Buyer in respect of such participation as may be set forth in the applicable participation agreement and all amounts payable by the Seller hereunder shall be determined as if such Buyer had not sold such participation. Each such participant shall be entitled to the benefits of
Sections 6.4, 6.5, and 7.1
of this Agreement to the same extent as if it were a Buyer and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to clause (a) of this
Section 22.17
, provided that no participant shall be entitled to receive any greater amount pursuant to such the provisions of
Sections 6.4, 6.5 and 7.1
than the issuing Buyer would have been entitled to receive in respect of the amount of the participation transferred by such issuing Buyer to such participant had no such transfer occurred and each such participant shall also be entitled to the same rights of set-off as though it were a Buyer, provided that such participant agrees to be subject to Section
22.10
hereof as though it were a Buyer.
(c)
    
Other Permitted Transfers.
Any Buyer may at any time pledge, collaterally assign or grant a security interest in any or all of its interests under this Agreement and in the Purchased Loans to any Federal Reserve Bank or to any other Person to secure obligations of such Buyer, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Buyer from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledge or assignee for such Buyer as a party hereto.
(d)
    
Register.
The Agent shall maintain at its principal office a copy of each Assignment Agreement delivered to it and a register (the Register) for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Buyers and the Committed Sum of, and amount owing to, each Buyer. The entries in the Register shall be conclusive evidence, absent manifest error, and the Seller, the Agent, and the Buyers may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register as the owner of the Advances recorded therein for all purposes of this Agreement. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Seller or any Buyer (but only with respect to any entry relating to such Buyers Committed Sum) upon reasonable notice to the Agent and a copy of such information shall be provided to any such party on their prior
95

written request. The Agent shall give prompt written notice to the Seller of the making of any entry in the Register or any change in such entry.
(e)
    
Disclosure of Seller Information.

Section 24.6
hereof or shall otherwise agree to be bound by the terms thereof.
(f)

(g)

Section 7.5
.
(h)
    
The Seller shall not be required to incur any cost or expense incident to any sale to a Person of any interest in the Repurchase Documents and the Purchased Loans pursuant to this
Section 22.17

Upon receiving such a notice, the Agent shall promptly notify each Buyer of such Default or Event of Default and provide each Buyer with a copy of such notice and shall endeavor to provide such notice to the Buyers within three (3) Business Days (but without any liability whatsoever in the event of its failure to do so).

The Sellers Customer Information in the possession of the Agent or the Buyers, other than information independently obtained by the Agent or the Buyers and not derived in any manner from or using information obtained under or in connection with this Agreement, is and shall remain confidential and proprietary information of the Seller. Except in accordance with this
Section 24.6

30 Relationship of the Parties
.
This Agreement provides for the sale by the Seller and the purchase by the Buyers (acting through their agent and representative, the Agent) of Eligible Loans and the obligation of the Seller to repurchase them upon termination of each Transaction. The relationship between the Seller and the Buyers (and the Agent) is limited to that of seller and repurchaser on the one hand and buyers and resellers (and the Agent as the Buyers agent and representative) on the other. The provisions in this Agreement and the other Repurchase Documents for compliance with financial covenants and delivery of financial statements are intended solely for the benefit of the Buyers and the Agent, to protect the interests of the Buyers as buyers, including the Buyers and the Agents interest in assuring repurchase of Purchased Loans at the termination of each Transaction, and nothing contained in this Agreement or any of the other Repurchase Documents shall be construed as permitting or obligating any Buyer or the Agent to act as a financial or business advisor or consultant to the Seller, as permitting or obligating any Buyer or the Agent to control the Seller or to conduct the Sellers operations, as creating any fiduciary obligation on the part of the Buyers or the Agent to the Seller, or as creating any joint venture, agency or other relationship between the parties other than as explicitly and specifically stated in this Agreement. The Seller acknowledges that it has had the opportunity to obtain the advice of experienced counsel of its own choosing in connection with the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and the other Repurchase Documents and to obtain the advice of such counsel with respect to all matters contained in the Repurchase Documents including the provision for waiver of trial by jury. The Seller further acknowledges that it is experienced with respect to financial and credit matters and has made its own independent decisions to apply to the Buyers and the Agent to enter into this Agreement, and to execute and deliver this Agreement and the other Repurchase Documents.
31 No Waivers, Etc
.
No express or implied waiver of any Event of Default by any party shall constitute a waiver of any other Event of Default and no exercise of any remedy hereunder by any party shall constitute a waiver of its right to exercise any other remedy hereunder. No modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement and no consent by any party to a departure herefrom shall be effective unless and until such shall be in writing and duly executed by the Seller and the parties required to do so pursuant to
Section 23
. Without limitation on any of the foregoing, the failure to give a notice pursuant to
Section 23
will not constitute a waiver of any right to do so at a later date. The rights and remedies of the Buyers hereunder shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights and remedies that the Buyers would otherwise have. No failure or delay on the part of the Buyers in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege.
104
Detroit\1205907\17\
32 Use of Employee Plan Assets
.
32.1.
    
Prohibited Transactions
. If assets of an employee benefit plan subject to any provision of ERISA are intended to be used by any party hereto (the 
Plan Party
) in a Transaction, the Plan Party shall so notify the other parties prior to the Transaction. The Plan Party shall represent in writing to the other parties that the Transaction does not constitute a prohibited transaction under ERISA or is otherwise exempt therefrom, and the other parties may proceed in reliance thereon but shall not be required so to proceed.
32.2.
    
Audited Financial Statements Required
. Subject to the last sentence of
Section 32.1
, any such Transaction shall proceed only if the Seller furnishes or has furnished to the Agent its most recent available audited statement of its financial condition and its most recent subsequent unaudited statement of its financial condition.
32.3.
    
Representations
. By entering into a Transaction pursuant to this
Section 32
, the Seller shall be deemed (a) to represent to the Buyers and the Agent that since the date of the Sellers latest such financial statements, there has been no material adverse change in the Sellers financial condition that the Seller has not disclosed to the Agent, and (b) to agree to provide the Agent with future audited and unaudited statements of its financial condition as they are issued, so long as it is a Seller in any Open Transaction involving a Plan Party.
33 Intent
.
33.1.
    
Transactions are Repurchase Agreements and Securities Contracts
. The parties intend and acknowledge that each Transaction is a repurchase agreement and a master netting agreement as such terms are defined in Section 101 of the Bankruptcy Code (except insofar as the type of Mortgage Loans subject to such Transaction or the term of such Transaction would render such definition inapplicable), and a securities contract as that term is defined in Section 741 of the Bankruptcy Code (except insofar as the type of assets subject to such Transaction would render such definition inapplicable). This Agreement also constitutes a netting contract as defined in and subject to Title IV of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (
FDICIA
) and each payment entitlement and payment obligation under any Transaction hereunder shall constitute a covered contractual payment entitlement or covered contractual payment obligation, respectively, as defined in and subject to FDICIA (except insofar as any or all of the parties is not a financial institution as that term is defined in FDICIA). The Seller hereby agrees that it shall not challenge the characterization of this Agreement as a repurchase agreement as that term is defined in Section 101 of the Bankruptcy Code, or as a securities contract as that term is defined in Section 741 of the Bankruptcy Code in any dispute or proceeding.
33.2.
    
Contractual Rights, Etc.
Any partys right to liquidate Mortgage Loans delivered to it in connection with Transactions hereunder or to exercise any other remedies pursuant to
Section 18
is a contractual right to liquidate, terminate or accelerate such Transaction as described in Sections 555, 559 and 561 of the Bankruptcy Code.
33.3.
    
FDIA
. If a party hereto is an insured depository institution, as such term is defined in the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as amended (
FDIA
), then each Transaction
105
Detroit\1205907\17\
hereunder is a qualified financial contract, as that term is defined in FDIA and any rules, orders or policy statements thereunder (except insofar as the type of assets subject to such Transaction would render such definition inapplicable).
33.4.
    
Master Netting Agreement
. It is understood and agreed that this Agreement constitutes a master netting agreement as that term is defined in Section 101 of the Bankruptcy Code, and that a partys right to cause the termination, liquidation, or acceleration of, or to offset net termination values, payment amounts or other transfer obligations arising under or in connection with, this Agreement or any Transaction is a contractual right to cause the termination, liquidation, or acceleration of, or to offset net termination values, payment amounts or other transfer obligations arising under or in connection with, this Agreement or any Transaction as described in Section 561 of the Bankruptcy Code.
34 Disclosure Relating to Certain Federal Protections
.
The parties acknowledge that they have been advised that:
34.1.
    
Parties not Protected by SIPA or Insured by FDIC or NCUSIF
. In the case of Transactions in which one of the parties is a broker or dealer registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (
SEC
) under Section 15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (
1934 Act
), the Securities Investor Protection Corporation has taken the position that the provisions of SIPA do not protect the other party with respect to any Transaction hereunder.
34.2.
    
SIPA Does Not Protect Government Securities Broker or Dealer Counterparty
. In the case of Transactions in which one of the parties is a government securities broker or a government securities dealer registered with the SEC under Section 15C of the 1934 Act, SIPA will not provide protection to the other party with respect to any Transaction hereunder.
34.3.
    
Transaction Funds Are Not Insured Deposits
. In the case of Transactions in which one of the parties is a financial institution, funds held by such financial institution pursuant to a Transaction hereunder are not a deposit and therefore are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (through either the Bank Insurance Fund or the Savings Association Insurance Fund) or the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund, as applicable.
35 USA Patriot Act Notification
.
Pursuant to Section 326 of the USA Patriot Act, the Agent and the Buyers hereby notify the Seller that if they or any of their Subsidiaries open an account, including any loan, deposit account, treasury management account, or other extension of credit with Agent or any Buyer, the Agent or the applicable Buyer will request the applicable Persons name, tax identification number, business address and other information necessary to identify such Person (and may request such Persons organizational documents or other identifying documents) to the extent necessary for the Agent and the applicable Buyer to comply with the USA Patriot Act.
106
Detroit\1205907\17\
36 Waiver of Fees, Costs and Expenses
.
Agent, Custodian, Approved MBS Custodian and each Buyer shall have the right, in their sole discretion, at any time and from time to time, to waive or reduce (but not increase) any fees (including the Facility Fee, the Agents Fee, and Custodian Fees) owing to it by the Seller, and/or any costs and expenses (including without limitation attorney's fees and third party audit fees) incurred by Agent, Custodian, Approved MBS Custodian or such Buyer for which the Seller is obligated to reimburse Agent, Custodian, Approved MBS Custodian or such Buyer. Custodian and each Buyer shall promptly inform the Agent of any waiver of all or any portion of the Facility Fee, Custodian Fees, account-related charges or fees, or any other fees, costs or expenses (including without limitation attorney's fees and third party audit fees) owing by Seller to such Buyer or Custodian under this Agreement. Such Buyer shall notify Seller and Agent of any waiver or reduction in the amount of the Facility Fee or other costs and expenses payable by the Seller to such Buyer. The waivers and adjustments identified in such notice shall become effective on a date determined by Agent (but in any event shall not become effective prior to the date such notice is received). The Seller hereby acknowledges and agrees that nothing in this Section 36 shall obligate any Buyer to grant any such waiver or reduction.
37 Amended and Restated
.
This Agreement amends, restates, replaces and supersedes in its entirety the Master Repurchase Agreement between Seller, Comerica Bank, as agent, lead arranger and a buyer, and certain other buyers dated October 25, 2010, as amended by Amendment No. 1 dated October 20, 2011, (as amended, the Prior Agreement); provided, however, nothing contained herein shall impair the liens, security interests and other rights established or continued by the Prior Agreement, which liens, security interests and other rights shall continue in full force and effect. All Purchased Loans (as defined in the Prior Agreement) (the Existing Purchased Loans), shall be Purchased Loans under this Agreement as if originally funded under this Agreement so long as such Existing Purchased Loans meet all of the requirements for eligibility and inclusion under this Agreement, provided, however, (a) the determination of the Purchase Date under paragraph 9 of Schedule DQ under this Agreement shall be calculated based on the original Purchase Date as determined under the Prior Agreement, and (b) such Existing Purchased Loans shall be deemed to comply with the requirement of paragraph 8 of Schedule EL under this Agreement if the date of each underlying Mortgage Note for such Existing Purchased Loans was not earlier than 30 days prior to the date such Existing Purchased Loan was purchased under the Prior Agreement. On the Effective Date, each Buyer shall (i) have Committed Sums equal to the applicable amounts set forth in Schedule BC hereto and (ii) have funded its Funding Share of all Transactions (and participation in Swing Line Transactions) outstanding on the Effective Date. To facilitate the foregoing, each Buyer which as a result of the adjustments of Committed Sums and Funding Shares evidenced by Schedule BC hereto is to have a greater principal amount of the Transactions outstanding than such Buyer had outstanding under the Prior Agreement immediately prior to the Effective Date, shall deliver to the Agent immediately available funds to cover such Transactions (and the Agent shall, to the extent of the funds so received, disburse funds to each Buyer which, as a result of the adjustment of the Funding Shares, is to have a lesser principal amount of Transactions outstanding than such Buyer had under the Prior Agreement). The Buyers agree that any Price Differential, Facility Fees and
107
Detroit\1205907\17\
other fees accrued under the Prior Agreement shall constitute the property of the Buyers which were parties to the Prior Agreement and shall be distributed (to the extent received from the Seller) to such Buyers on the basis of the Funding Shares in effect under the Prior Agreement. Furthermore, it is acknowledged and agreed that all fees paid under the Prior Agreement shall not be recalculated, redistributed or reallocated by Agent among the Buyers.
