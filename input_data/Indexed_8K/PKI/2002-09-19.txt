This Current Report on Form 8-K is filed by PerkinElmer, Inc., a Massachusetts corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the matters described herein. ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS. Effective September 19, 2002, the Company entered into amendments to its two unsecured credit facilities. As noted in the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2002, the Company was in compliance with these covenants as they were in effect as of June 30, 2002, but was not certain if it would be able to comply with the Interest Coverage covenant as of the end of the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2002. With these amendments, the Company believes that it will now be in compliance with the covenants. The amendments included the following changes: - - the calculation of EBITDA under the agreements' covenants will exclude gains and losses on non-ordinary course assets sales and certain restructuring charges; - - the amount available for borrowing under the 5-year facility remains unchanged at $100 million. The amount available for borrowing under the 364-day credit facility is reduced from $270 million to $200 million, and the Company retains the ability to convert this facility into a term loan subject to certain debt to EBITDA ratios; - - the interest rate under both facilities increases based on a pricing grid. Currently, the rates will increase by approximately 35 basis points; - - upon certain asset sales (including a potential sale of the Company's Fluid Sciences business) and certain capital market transactions such as raising or retiring debt, the amount available for borrowing under the 364-day facility will be reduced; and - - both facilities will include a covenant to maintain a consolidated indebtedness to EBITDA ratio. Both facilities remain unsecured. The amendments to the facilities contain provisions restricting the creation of liens and regarding negative pledges and other matters. Copies of the amendments are attached to this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2. One of the Company's operating leases contained covenants similar to those in the Company's credit facility agreements. On September 18, 2002, the Company entered into an amendment to that operating lease to amend the covenants. As part of this amendment, the Company agreed to: - - increase the monthly amount payable under the lease, - - shorten the maturity date of the lease from December 2006 to the earlier to occur of the sale of the Company's Fluid Sciences business or February 28, 2003, and - - comply with additional covenants similar to the new covenants contained in the credit facility amendments. The Company believes it will be able to satisfy the revised covenants in the operating lease for the quarter ending September 30, 2002. ITEM 7.

If the rating system of Moody's or S&P shall change, or if either such rating agency shall cease to be in the business of rating corporate debt obligations, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to amend the references to specific ratings in this definition to reflect such changed rating system or the non-availability of ratings from such rating agency, and pending the effectiveness of any such amendment the Applicable Percentage shall be determined by reference to the rating most recently in effect prior to such change or cessation.

Each such change in the Applicable Percentage shall apply during the period commencing on the effective date of such change and ending on the date immediately preceding the effective date of the next such change. If the rating system of Moody's or S&P shall change, or if either such rating agency shall cease to be in the business of rating corporate debt obligations, the

SECTION 5.13. FURTHER ASSURANCES. Notwithstanding any other provision contained herein, in the event the Company or any Subsidiary shall be party to, enter into or amend any agreement or instrument evidencing or related to any Indebtedness (including, without limitation, the Master Lease) and such agreement or instrument (as so amended, if applicable) shall contain any affirmative or negative covenant, event of default or similar provision that is more restrictive than the analogous provision in this Agreement or for which there is no analogous provision in this Agreement (including, without limitation, the granting of any Lien permitted under Section 5.08 to secure "Obligations" under and as defined in the Master Lease (other than any Liens granted with respect thereto existing on the Amendment Date)), then this Agreement shall be deemed to have
9 been amended to incorporate such affirmative or negative covenant, event of default or similar provision for so long as such affirmative or negative covenant, event of default or similar provision shall continue to be applicable pursuant to such other agreement or instrument. The Company (a) represents that it has provided the Administrative Agent with complete and accurate copies of each such agreement or instrument existing on the Amendment Date and containing any such covenant, event of default or similar provision, and (b) covenants and agrees that it will (i) provide the Administrative Agent with complete and accurate copies of each such agreement or instrument, and of each amendment, modification and waiver, entered into after the Amendment Date, promptly after the execution thereof, and (ii) execute any and all further documents and agreements, including amendments hereto, and take all such further actions necessary or reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent to give effect to this Section 5.13.
