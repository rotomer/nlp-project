These amendments will be effective as to all 6.80% notes, including those that are not purchased in the offer, if and when the offer is consummated. PerkinElmer solicited the consents in connection with PerkinElmer's previously announced plans to refinance its existing debt.

The offer is scheduled to expire at 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on Monday, December 23, 2002, unless extended. Holders who have not yet tendered their 6.80% notes may do so until the expiration of the offer. If the offer is completed, those holders will be entitled to receive the tender offer consideration of $985 per $1,000 principal amount of 6.80% notes tendered, but not the consent payment of $15 per $1,000 principal amount.

PerkinElmer's obligation to complete the tender offer and consent solicitation is subject to a number of conditions, including PerkinElmer's receipt of funding under its previously announced refinancing plan.
