EXHIBIT 99.1 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 26 DECEMBER 2002 PERKINELMER COMPLETES REFINANCING TRANSACTIONS - COMPLETES SALE OF SENIOR SUBORDINATED NOTES - ENTERS NEW SECURED CREDIT FACILITIES - REPAYS EXISTING BANK DEBT AND $110.3 MILLION OF 6.80% NOTES - ZERO COUPON DEBENTURE TENDER OFFER TO EXPIRE DECEMBER 27, 2002 Boston - PerkinElmer, Inc. (NYSE: PKI) announced that it has substantially completed its previously announced refinancing plan to repay existing debt in order to extend existing shorter-term debt maturities. Today the company repaid its existing bank debt and synthetic lease by completing the sale of $300 million aggregate principal amount of ten-year senior subordinated notes and entering into new senior secured credit facilities for a $315 million six-year term loan and a $100 million revolving credit facility. PerkinElmer also accepted for payment $110,319,000 aggregate principal amount of its outstanding 6.80% Notes due October 15, 2005 pursuant to its cash tender offer and consent solicitation. The final step of the refinancing plan, PerkinElmer's pending cash tender offer to purchase its Zero Coupon Convertible Debentures due August 7, 2020, is scheduled to expire at 12:00 midnight, New York City time, on Friday, December 27, 2002. Senior Subordinated Notes and Secured Credit Facilities PerkinElmer sold $300 million aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes in an institutional private placement. The notes have been guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis by certain of PerkinElmer's domestic subsidiaries. PerkinElmer borrowed the full amount available under the term loan at the closing of the new senior secured credit facilities. PerkinElmer did not draw upon the $100 million revolving credit facility, which remains available for the company's working capital needs. The revolving credit facility has a five-year term. A portion of the proceeds from the term loan is being used to purchase the tendered 6.80% notes and a portion of the proceeds, together with proceeds from the sale of the company's senior subordinated notes, will be used to purchase the zero coupon convertible debentures that are tendered. 6.80% Notes The tendered 6.80% notes represented approximately 96% of the total outstanding 6.80% notes. PerkinElmer will pay an aggregate of $111,768,350.37 for the tendered 6.80% notes. Each holder who tendered 6.80% notes and the related consents at or before 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on December 6, 2002, the consent expiration date, will receive $1,013.41 for each $1,000 principal amount of tendered 6.80% notes, including a $15 consent payment. Each holder who tendered notes and the related consents after the consent expiration date will receive $998.41 for each $1,000 principal amount of tendered 6.80% notes.
The 6.80% notes tender offer commenced on November 22, 2002 and expired at 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on Thursday, December 26, 2002. It is anticipated that State Street Bank and Trust Company, as Depositary for the tender offer and consent solicitation, will pay noteholders on or about December 26, 2002. On December 6, 2002, the expiration date for the 6.80% notes consent solicitation, PerkinElmer announced that it had received the requisite consents to amend the indenture under which the 6.80% notes were issued. PerkinElmer and State Street Bank and Trust Company, as Trustee, executed a supplemental indenture, which became effective as of December 26, 2002, eliminating substantially all of the restrictive covenants from the indenture, as more fully described in PerkinElmer's Offer to Purchase and Consent Solicitation Statement dated November 22, 2002. Important additional information has been filed with the SEC PerkinElmer has filed with the SEC a Schedule TO in connection with the tender offer for the zero coupon convertible debentures.
