Second quarter 2003 earnings are at the upper end of the Company's previous estimate for the quarter of $.05 to $.08 per share on a GAAP basis. Revenue from continuing operations in the second quarter of 2003 was $377.1 million, down 2% from the same period of 2002.

The Company generated operating cash flow of $36.8 million in the second quarter of 2003, an improvement of $25.2 million over the same period in 2002. For the first six months of 2003, operating cash flow was $60.9 million.

At the end of the second quarter of 2003, the Company's debt, net of cash and equivalents, was reduced by $29.5 million. "We were pleased with our progress in driving cash flow and profitability growth. The integration of our Life and Analytical Sciences unit is ahead of schedule and will result in a stronger business, better positioned to serve our global customers. Also, we continue to make progress on new product introductions and building our service business," said Gregory L. Summe, Chairman and CEO of the Company.

This is pursuant to the Company's plans, announced in the fourth quarter of 2002, to integrate the two businesses, and reflects the current structure of the Company. LIFE AND ANALYTICAL SCIENCES reported revenue of $246.0 million for the second quarter of 2003, down 3% compared to revenue of $252.9 million for the second quarter of 2002. During the second quarter of 2003, the Company reported revenue growth in reagents, consumables and service which was more than offset by lower instruments sales compared to the second quarter of 2002. By market segment, the Company experienced growth in revenue during the second quarter of 2003 in its genetic screening and environmental and chemical businesses, while sales into the biopharma markets were down year over year. The segment's GAAP operating profit for the second quarter of 2003 was $20.7 million versus $12.9 million in the same period of 2002. As a percentage of sales, operating profit for the second quarter of 2003 and 2002 was 8.4% and 5.1%, respectively. The results for each of the second quarters of 2003 and 2002 include intangibles amortization of $6.5 million. OPTOELECTRONICS reported revenue of $89.4 million for the second quarter of 2003, an increase of 8% from revenue of $82.8 million for the second quarter of 2002. Growth across most major product lines drove the increase in revenues during the quarter, due to new product introductions and continued end market growth. The segment's GAAP operating profit was $11.1 million for the second quarter of 2003 versus an operating profit of $4.8 million for the comparable period in 2002. As a percentage of sales, operating profit for the second quarter of 2003 and 2002 was 12.4% and 5.8%, respectively. FLUID SCIENCES reported revenue of $41.7 million for the second quarter of 2003, representing a decline of 12% compared to revenue of $47.4 million for the second quarter of 2002. The decline in revenue was largely attributable to continued softness in
the aerospace and semiconductor end markets. The segment's GAAP operating profit for the second quarter of 2003 was $3.1 million versus $3.9 million in the second quarter of 2002. -more- "We are seeing good market acceptance for our new products, and are beginning to see positive trends in certain end markets," added Summe.
