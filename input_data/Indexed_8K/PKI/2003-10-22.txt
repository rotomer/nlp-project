Exhibit 99.1 [LOGO]PERKINELMER(R) PERKINELMER, INC. precisely. 45 William Street Wellesley, MA 02481-4078 USA Phone: 781-431-4306 Fax: 781-431-4255 www.perkinelmer.com FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE - --------------------- October 22, 2003 PERKINELMER ANNOUNCES Q3 2003 RESULTS o NET INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS INCREASES BY 45% o OPERATING MARGINS EXPAND BY 460 BASIS POINTS o CONVERTIBLE REDEMPTION DRIVES $177M GROSS DEBT REDUCTION BOSTON -- PerkinElmer, Inc. (NYSE: PKI) today announced third quarter 2003 GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations of $.11 on revenue of $367.1 million, compared to GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations of $.08 and revenue of $366.0 million in the third quarter of 2002. Earnings per share excluding intangibles amortization were $.15 for the third quarter of 2003, which exceed by $.01 the Thomson First CallTM consensus earnings per share estimate of $.14, which also excludes intangibles amortization. Amortization of intangibles for the quarter was $7.0 million, or $.04 per share. Revenue from continuing operations for the third quarter of 2003 was $367.1 million, slightly above 2002, with revenue growth in Optoelectronics and Life and Analytical Sciences of 4% and 1%, respectively, offset by a 10% decline in Fluid Sciences' revenue during the quarter. GAAP operating margins during the third quarter of 2003 doubled to 9.2% from 4.6% for the same period of 2002. Third quarter 2003 operating margins, excluding intangibles amortization, were 11.2% compared to 6.5% for the third quarter of 2002. This margin expansion compared to the 2002 quarter was driven by benefits we derived from the integration of Life and Analytical Sciences, and other productivity initiatives across the Company. "We were pleased with the benefits of our cost productivity initiatives, which are reflected in our lower SG&A and higher gross margins," said Gregory L. Summe, Chairman and CEO of the Company. "We believe that our improved cost structure as well as investments in new products positions the Company well." The Company generated operating cash flow of $28.7 million in the third quarter of 2003 and $89.6 million for the first nine months of 2003. This compares with operating cash flow of $70.9 million and $55.5 million for the third quarter and first nine months of 2002, respectively. Third quarter 2003 operating cash flow includes a $10 million benefit due to increased sales of receivables under our accounts receivable securitization program. The Company paid down $20 million of its long-term debt during the third quarter, and has reduced long-term debt by $50 million year to date. As previously announced, during the third quarter of 2003, the Company retired its remaining zero coupon convertible debentures, which contributed to a $177 million gross debt reduction since the second quarter of 2003. "We remained focused on driving strong cash flow and improving our working capital turns as this both strengthens our balance sheet and forces greater rigor and quality in our processes," added Summe.
Net income for the third quarter of 2002 comprised $.08 earnings per share from continuing operations and a loss of ($.02) per share from discontinued operations. Third quarter 2002 results included $.03 per share resulting from the effects of two discrete events, a gain from the retirement of debt partially offset by certain divestiture-related costs. Financial overview by reporting segment: LIFE AND ANALYTICAL SCIENCES reported revenue of $235.1 million for the third quarter of 2003, up 1% from $232.9 million for the third quarter of 2002. Revenue growth in reagents, consumables and service was partially offset by declines in instruments sales compared to the third quarter of 2002. By market segment, the Company experienced growth in revenue during the third quarter in the environmental and chemical markets, due to strong market acceptance of our recently introduced new products into these end markets. Sales into the biopharma markets were down compared to the third quarter of 2002, however, we believe the end market demand appears to be improving, particularly for the Company's high-end instruments. Genetic screening revenue during the third quarter of 2003 was down compared to the same period of 2002, due to the timing of certain customer order patterns compared to the same period of 2002. We believe that genetic screening revenues continue to track to double-digit growth for the full year 2003. The segment's GAAP operating profit for the third quarter of 2003 was $21.3 million versus $9.6 million in the same period of 2002. As a percentage of sales, operating profit for the third quarter of 2003 and 2002 was 9.1% and 4.1%, respectively. This 500 basis point increase in operating margin reflects the benefits from the Life and Analytical Sciences integration, cost productivity actions across the business and a shift in product mix to higher margin products. The results for the third quarters of 2003 and 2002 include intangibles amortization of $6.5 million and $6.6 million, respectively. Operating margins excluding intangibles amortization, were 11.8% and 6.9%, for the third quarters of 2003 and 2002, respectively. OPTOELECTRONICS reported revenue of $88.1 million for the third quarter of 2003, an increase of 4% from revenue of $84.3 million for the third quarter of 2002. Growth in revenue from imaging and specialty lighting was offset by lower sensors revenue during the third quarter of 2003 compared to the same period of 2002. Both biotech and medical imaging revenues grew double-digits during the quarter. The segment's GAAP operating profit was $10.9 million for the third quarter of 2003, versus an operating profit of $6.2 million for the comparable period in 2002. As a percentage of sales, operating profit for the third quarters of 2003 and 2002 was 12.3% and 7.3%, respectively. Operating margins excluding intangibles amortization, were 12.7% and 7.7%, for the third quarters of 2003 and 2002, respectively. FLUID SCIENCES reported revenue of $43.9 million for the third quarter of 2003, representing a decline of 10% compared to revenue of $48.8 million for the third quarter of 2002, largely attributable to continued softness in the aerospace and semiconductor end markets. Despite lower revenue quarter over quarter, the segment's GAAP operating profit for the third quarter of 2003 increased to $5.6 million versus $5.4 million in the third quarter of 2002. As a percentage of sales, operating profit for the third quarter of 2003 and 2002 was 12.8% and 11.2%, respectively. Operating margins excluding intangibles amortization, were 13.3% and 11.6%, for the third quarter of 2003 and 2002, respectively. "We are entering the fourth quarter with good momentum on improving our cost position, driving cash flow, fueling our new product pipeline, and expanding the service business to improve our customers' productivity," added Summe. "We believe we are on track to achieve the upper end of our original guidance for full year 2003 earnings per share of between $.37 to $.43 on a GAAP basis, and between $.52 to $.58 per share excluding $.15 per share of intangibles amortization," concluded Summe.

USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES In addition to financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), this press release also contains non-GAAP financial measures of earnings per share and operating margin, in each case excluding amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. We exclude the amortization of acquisition-related intangibles in calculating these non-GAAP measures because such amortization is outside of our normal operations. We believe that the inclusion of these non-GAAP financial measures in this press release helps investors to gain a meaningful understanding of our core operating results and future prospects, consistent with how management measures and forecasts the company's performance, especially when comparing such results to previous periods or forecasts. PerkinElmer's management uses these non-GAAP measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, as the basis for measuring the company's core operating performance and comparing such performance to that of prior periods and to the performance of our competitors. Such measures are also used by management in their financial and operating decision-making. The non-GAAP financial measures included in this press release are not meant to be considered superior to or a substitute for results of operations prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, the non-GAAP financial measures included in this press release may be different from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similar measures used by other companies. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures used in this press release to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are set forth in the accompanying exhibits to this press release.
