(NYSE: PKI), a global leader in health sciences and other advanced technology markets, today announced GAAP earnings per share of $.21 from continuing operations on revenue of $432.6 million for the fourth quarter ended December 28, 2003. The Company reported earnings per share from continuing operations excluding intangibles amortization of $.24, which exceeds by $.02 the Thomson First Call(TM) consensus earnings per share estimate of $.22 for the fourth quarter of 2003, which also excludes intangibles amortization. Amortization of intangibles for the fourth quarter of 2003 was $7.1 million, or $.03 per share. Revenue from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2003 was $432.6 million, an increase of 6.0% from the fourth quarter of 2002, driven by revenue growth in all segments. Foreign exchange rate fluctuations increased revenue by 6.0% in the fourth quarter of 2003. GAAP operating margin during the fourth quarter of 2003 increased significantly in all segments, resulting in an overall operating margin of 12.5% compared to 1.2% for the fourth quarter of 2002. Fourth quarter 2003 operating margin excluding intangibles amortization was 14.1% compared to 3.0% for the fourth quarter of 2002. The fourth quarter of 2002 operating profit included a restructuring charge of $26.5 million, approximately 6.5% of sales for the period, related to the integration of Life and Analytical Sciences. Improved gross margin and lower selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) drove the operating margin expansion in the fourth quarter of 2003 compared to the same period of 2002. SG&A expenses were down, reflecting the benefits from the Life and Analytical Sciences integration, and productivity initiatives across all businesses. The Company generated operating cash flow of $77.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2003 and $167.5 million for the full year 2003, an increase of $28.9 million and $59.8 million, respectively, compared to the fourth quarter and full year 2002. The Company paid down $20 million of its long-term debt during the fourth quarter of 2003, and reduced long-term debt by $70 million during 2003. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow of $167.5 million less capital expenditures of $16.6 million, was $150.9 million for the full year 2003. Free cash flow for 2003 was more than double the free cash flow for 2002 on higher income and improved working capital efficiency. The 2003 operating cash flow of $167.5 million included a $16.0 million benefit due to increased sales of receivables under our accounts receivable securitization program.
"We were pleased to deliver fourth quarter financial results that are significantly improved from a year ago," said Gregory L. Summe, chairman and CEO of the Company. "Our priorities for 2003 were to improve our cost structure, launch a broad array of new products, and deliver strong cash flow. We feel terrific about our progress in all of these areas, especially the strong cash flow performance. Our 2003 operating cash flow was more than three times our GAAP net income," added Summe. The fourth quarter 2002 GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations were $.01 on revenue of $409.6 million. The fourth quarter 2002 results included a restructuring charge of $26.5 million mentioned above, related to the integration of Life and Analytical Sciences. Total net income for the fourth quarter of 2003 was $27.9 million, or $.22 per share, and was comprised of $.21 earnings per share from continuing operations and $.01 earnings per share from disposition of discontinued operations. The fourth quarter of 2002 resulted in a net loss of ($2.6) million, or ($.02) per share, comprised of $.01 earnings per share from continuing operations, a loss of ($.01) per share from discontinued operations, and a loss of ($.02) per share on disposition of discontinued operations. Financial overview by reporting segment: LIFE AND ANALYTICAL SCIENCES reported revenue of $290.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2003, up 6% from $273.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2002. Growth during the quarter was driven by Genetic Screening and Environmental and Chemical end markets. In addition, our OneSource (TM) service offering continued to gain momentum and experienced strong market penetration and customer acceptance. By product category, instruments revenue was up slightly, with stronger growth in reagents, consumables and service. The segment's GAAP operating profit for the fourth quarter of 2003 was $41.1 million versus a loss of ($2.8) million for the same period of 2002. As a percentage of sales, operating profit for the fourth quarter was 14.2% compared to negative (1.0%) for the fourth quarter of 2002. Included in the segment's operating profit for the fourth quarter of 2002 was a restructuring charge of $26.5 million, related to the integration of Life and Analytical Sciences. This significant increase was achieved through cost reductions driven by the integration of Life and Analytical Sciences. The operating profit for the fourth quarter of 2003 and 2002 included intangibles amortization of $6.6 million and $5.9 million, respectively.
OPTOELECTRONICS reported revenue of $91.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2003, an increase of 4% from revenue of $87.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2002. Growth in digital imaging revenue during the quarter was partially offset by revenue declines in sensors and lighting compared to the fourth quarter of 2002. The segment's GAAP operating profit was $11.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2003 versus an operating profit of $7.7 million for the comparable period of 2002. As a percentage of sales, operating profit for the fourth quarters of both 2003 and 2002 was 12.7% and 8.8%, respectively. The operating profit for the fourth quarter of 2003 and 2002 included intangibles amortization of $.3 million. Higher revenue and lower SG&A expenses year over year were the primary drivers of the increase in operating profit during the fourth quarter of 2003 compared to the same period of 2002. FLUID SCIENCES reported revenue of $51.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2003, up 5% from the same period of 2002. Revenue growth in aerospace was offset by lower revenue in power generation, with sales to semiconductor end markets roughly flat compared to the fourth quarter of 2002, as orders during the fourth quarter suggest that demand in semiconductor end markets appears to be improving. The segment's GAAP operating profit for the fourth quarter of 2003 was $6.8 million, versus $4.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2002. As a percentage of sales, operating profit for the fourth quarter of 2003 and 2002 was 13.3% and 9.8%, respectively. The operating profit for the fourth quarter of 2003 and 2002 included intangibles amortization of $.2 million and $.9 million, respectively. 2004 GUIDANCE The Company projects 2004 GAAP EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $.62 to $.67, including the negative impact of intangibles amortization of $.15 per share. This would represent an increase of 44% to 56% from the Company's 2003 GAAP EPS. The Company's 2004 EPS excluding intangibles amortization is forecasted to be in the range of $.77 to $.82 per share, which exceeds Thomson First Call (TM) consensus earnings estimate of $.76 per share, which also excludes intangibles amortization. For the first quarter of 2004, the Company projects EPS from continuing operations of between $.06 and $.10 per share on a GAAP basis, including the negative impact of intangibles amortization of $.04 per share. In Q1 2003, the Company's GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations were $.03 per share, including the negative impact of intangibles amortization of $.04 per share. "Our revenue growth outlook for 2004 continues to be tempered. We expect the economy to continue in a slow expansion, with slightly higher growth in the cyclical recoveries of industrial and semiconductor," continued Summe. "However, we enter 2004 with a better cost position, a stronger balance sheet and improved operating processes. We believe this positions us to deliver significant earnings per share growth in 2004, while at the same time funding more growth initiatives. Our priorities for this year will be focused on improving our customers' experience, as well as driving productivity, cash flow and new product innovations."

USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES In addition to financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), this press release also contains non-GAAP financial measures of earnings per share and operating margin, in each case excluding amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. We exclude the amortization of acquisition-related intangibles in calculating these non-GAAP measures because such amortization is outside of our normal operations. We believe that the inclusion of these non-GAAP financial measures in this press release helps investors to gain a meaningful understanding of our core operating results and future prospects, consistent with how management measures and forecasts the company's performance, especially when comparing such results to previous periods or forecasts. PerkinElmer's management uses these non-GAAP measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, as the basis for measuring the company's core operating performance and comparing such performance to that of prior periods and to the performance of our competitors. Such measures are also used by management in their financial and operating decision-making. This press release also contains a non-GAAP measure of free cash flow. We define free cash flow as our net cash provided by operating activities minus our capital expenditures. We use free cash flow, and ratios based on this measure, to conduct and evaluate our business and, specifically, to determine incentive compensation, to allocate resources to debt repayment and for cash investing and financing activities. Therefore, we believe that these measures may be similarly useful and informative to investors. The non-GAAP financial measures included in this press release are not meant to be considered superior to or a substitute for results of operations prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, the non-GAAP financial measures included in this press release may be different from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similar measures used by other companies. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures used in this press release to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are set forth in the text of, and the accompanying exhibits to this press release.
