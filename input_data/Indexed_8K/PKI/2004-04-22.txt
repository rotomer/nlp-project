(NYSE: PKI), a global leader in health sciences and other advanced technology markets, today announced GAAP earnings per share of $.10 from continuing operations on revenue of $393.5 million for the first quarter ended March 28, 2004. The first quarter 2004 results include intangibles amortization of $7.1 million, or approximately $.04 per share. The Company reported earnings per share from continuing operations excluding intangibles amortization of $.14, which exceeded by $.01 the Thomson First Call(TM) consensus earnings per share estimate for the first quarter of 2004, and was at the high end of the Company's forecasted range for the quarter. Total GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2004 was $13.3 million, compared to $2.4 million for the first quarter of 2003. Revenue in the first quarter of 2004 was $393.5 million, an increase of 10% from the first quarter of 2003, driven by revenue growth in all segments. The comparative increase in revenue by segment was comprised of growth of 7% in Life and Analytical Sciences, 4% in Optoelectronics, and 34% in Fluid Sciences. Foreign exchange rate fluctuations increased total reported revenue by approximately 5% in the first quarter of 2004. GAAP operating margin during the first quarter of 2004 increased to 7.0%, up 160 basis points from 5.4% for the first quarter of 2003. First quarter 2004 operating margin excluding intangibles amortization was 8.8% compared to 7.4% for the first quarter of 2003, driven by higher revenue, cost productivity and quality improvements. The first quarter 2004 operating profit included a $1.2 million pre-tax charge related to the impairment of a non-strategic product line in Optoelectronics, that the Company will close later in 2004. The Company generated operating cash flow of $26.6 million in the first quarter of 2004. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow of $26.6 million less capital expenditures of $3.3 million, was $23.3 million for the first quarter of 2004. During the first quarter of 2004, the Company reduced long-term debt by $45.0 million. Total debt at the end of the first quarter of 2004 was $504.3 million, down by approximately $256.0 million compared to the first quarter of 2003. Total debt net of cash and cash equivalents of $165.5 million was $338.9 million at the end of the first quarter of 2004, representing a decrease of $137.2 million from the end of the first quarter of 2003.
"We were pleased to deliver revenue growth across all three businesses, significant operating margin expansion and excellent cash flow in our first quarter of 2004," said Gregory L. Summe, Chairman and CEO of the Company. "With our improved cost structure and strengthened balance sheet, we are increasing our focus on driving revenue growth," added Summe. Financial overview by reporting segment: LIFE AND ANALYTICAL SCIENCES reported revenue of $249.2 million for the first quarter of 2004, up 7% from $232.2 million in the first quarter of 2003. This was generated by revenue growth in all businesses: BioPharma, Genetic Screening, Environmental and Chemical, and the Company's OneSource (TM) service business. By product category, instruments revenue was up 8%, reagents and consumables revenue increased 5%, and service revenue increased 10% during the first quarter of 2004 compared to the first quarter of 2003.

As a percentage of sales, operating profit for the first quarter of 2004 increased to 6.4% compared to 5.0% for the first quarter of 2003. The operating profit for the first quarters of 2004 and 2003 included intangibles amortization of $6.6 million and $6.5 million, respectively. OPTOELECTRONICS reported revenue of $86.7 million for the first quarter of 2004, an increase of 4% from revenue of $83.3 million in the first quarter of 2003. Revenue growth in our medical and biotech imaging business, and growth in specialty lighting revenue was partially offset by softness in certain sensors end markets during the quarter compared to the first quarter of 2003. The segment's GAAP operating profit was $9.4 million for the first quarter of 2004 versus an operating profit of $8.7 million for the comparable period of 2003.

The operating profit for each of the first quarters of 2004 and 2003 included intangibles amortization of $.3 million. FLUID SCIENCES reported revenue of $57.5 million for the first quarter of 2004, up 34% from revenue of $42.9 million in the first quarter of 2003. Strong growth in semiconductor and aerospace revenue drove the increase during the quarter compared to the same period of 2003. The segment's GAAP operating profit for the first quarter of 2004 was $8.3 million, versus $2.4 million in the first quarter of 2003. As a percentage of sales, operating profit for the first quarter of 2004 and 2003 was 14.5% and 5.5%, respectively. The operating profit for the first quarter of 2004 and 2003 included intangibles amortization of $.2 million and $.4 million, respectively. "During the quarter we saw continued gradual strengthening in our end markets," continued Summe. "We remain focused on our customer excellence initiatives and acceleration of new product introductions to drive revenue growth, while delivering our financial commitments," added Summe.
For the second quarter of 2004, the Company projects EPS from continuing operations between $.14 and $.17 on a GAAP basis, including the negative impact of intangibles amortization of $.04 per share.

USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES In addition to financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), this press release also contains non-GAAP financial measures of earnings per share and operating margin, in each case excluding amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. We exclude the amortization of acquisition-related intangibles in calculating these non-GAAP measures because such amortization is outside of our normal operations. We believe that the inclusion of these non-GAAP financial measures in this press release helps investors to gain a meaningful understanding of our core operating results and future prospects, consistent with how management measures and forecasts the company's performance, especially when comparing such results to previous periods or forecasts. PerkinElmer's management uses these non-GAAP measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, as the basis for measuring the company's core operating performance and comparing such performance to that of prior periods and to the performance of our competitors. Such measures are also used by management in their financial and operating decision-making. This press release also contains a non-GAAP measure of free cash flow. We define free cash flow as our net cash provided by operating activities minus our capital expenditures. We use free cash flow, and ratios based on this measure, to conduct and evaluate our business and, specifically, to determine incentive compensation, to allocate resources to debt repayment and for cash investing and financing activities. Therefore, we believe that these measures may be similarly useful and informative to investors. The non-GAAP financial measures included in this press release are not meant to be considered superior to or a substitute for results of operations prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, the non-GAAP financial measures included in this press release may be different from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similar measures used by other companies. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures used in this press release to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are set forth in the text of, and the accompanying exhibits, to this press release.
