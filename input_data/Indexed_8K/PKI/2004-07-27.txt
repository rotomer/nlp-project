Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In addition to financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), this press release also contains non-GAAP financial measures of earnings per share, operating profit and operating margin, in each case excluding amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, and organic revenue growth, representing the rate of revenue growth excluding the effects of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. We exclude the amortization of acquisition related intangibles and the effects of foreign exchange rates in calculating these non-GAAP measures because such amortization is outside of our normal operations and such foreign exchange effects are out of our control. We believe that the inclusion of these non-GAAP financial measures in this press release also helps investors to gain a meaningful understanding of our core operating results and future prospects, consistent with how management measures and forecasts the company's performance, especially when comparing such results to previous periods or forecasts. PerkinElmer's management uses these non-GAAP measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, as the basis for measuring the company's core operating performance and comparing such performance to that of prior periods and to the performance of our competitors. These measures are also used by management in their financial and operating decision-making.
 
This press release also contains a non-GAAP financial measure of free cash flow. We define free cash flow as our net cash provided by operating activities minus our capital expenditures. We use free cash flow, and ratios based on this measure, to conduct and evaluate our business and, specifically, to determine incentive compensation, to allocate resources to debt repayment and for cash investing and financing activities. Therefore, we believe that this measure may be similarly useful and informative to investors.
 
The non-GAAP financial measures included in this press release are not meant to be considered superior to or a substitute for results of operations prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, the non-GAAP financial measures included in this press release may be different from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similar measures used by other companies. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures used in this press release to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are set forth in the text of, and the accompanying exhibits to, this press release.
