PerkinElmer, Inc. (NYSE: PKI), a global leader in health sciences and other advanced technology markets, today announced GAAP earnings per share of $.19 from continuing operations on revenue of $403.4 million for the third quarter ended September 26, 2004. The third quarter 2004 results include intangibles amortization of $7.1 million, or approximately $.04 per share. The Company reported earnings per share from continuing operations excluding intangibles amortization of $.23, which exceeded the Thomson First Call consensus earnings per share estimate of $.21 for the third quarter of 2004 and also exceeded the Company's forecasted range for the quarter. GAAP net income from continuing operations for the third quarter of 2004 was $24.6 million compared to $14.8 million for the third quarter of 2003, an increase of 67%.

Third quarter 2004 revenue of $403.4 million increased 10% over the third quarter of 2003. Revenue growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange was 8% over the third quarter of the prior year.
 
"We were pleased to deliver another strong quarter with double-digit revenue growth. From an end market perspective, our reported revenue in health sciences grew 6% during the quarter, and electronics and aerospace grew 18%," said Gregory L. Summe, Chairman and CEO of the Company. "The revenue growth in health sciences this quarter was driven by strength in medical imaging and genetic screening, and in electronics and aerospace across nearly all applications," added Summe.
 
GAAP operating profit during the third quarter of 2004 increased 23% over the third quarter of 2003 to $42.9 million, and the operating margin increased to 10.6%, up 110 basis points from 9.5% for the third quarter of 2003. Third quarter 2004 operating profit excluding intangibles amortization was $50.0 million, and operating margin excluding intangibles amortization was 12.4%. The increase in operating income was primarily due to the higher sales volume and lower selling, general and administrative expenses, partially offset by higher research and development investments and costs associated with certain site consolidations.
 
The Company generated operating cash flow of $46.6 million in the third quarter of 2004, an increase of 62% over operating cash flow of $28.7 million for the third quarter of 2003. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow of $46.6 million less capital expenditures of $4.2 million, was $42.4 million for the third quarter of 2004. Cash and cash equivalents increased $23.3 million to $220.0 million, sequentially from the end of the second quarter of 2004. The Company has generated $129.7 million of operating cash flow for the first nine months of 2004, and free cash flow of $117.2 million for that period.
 
Financial overview by reporting segment:
 
reported revenue of $243.7 million for the third quarter of 2004, up 4% from $235.1 million in the third quarter of 2003 driven primarily by revenue growth in the Company's genetic screening, service and environmental businesses that was partially offset by lower revenue in its biopharma business.

Operating profit excluding intangibles amortization for the third quarter of 2004 was $25.5 million, or 10.5% as a percentage of revenue.
 
reported revenue of $98.6 million for the third quarter of 2004, an increase of 13% from revenue of $87.2 million for the third quarter of 2003, with the increase in revenue driven by continued strength in the Company's medical imaging, sensors and certain consumer electronics businesses.

"Our momentum through the first nine months of this year gives us the confidence to once again raise our full year 2004 EPS guidance," continued Summe. "Longer term, we are excited by our breadth of revenue and operational productivity initiatives to drive profitable growth," continued Summe.
 
The Company projects full year 2004 EPS from continuing operations of between $.86 and $.89 excluding the negative $.15 per share impact of intangibles amortization. This is up from the Company's previous full year 2004 EPS guidance of $.81 to $.86, excluding intangibles amortization.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
In addition to financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), this press release also contains non-GAAP financial measures of earnings per share, operating profit and operating margin, in each case excluding amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. This press release also contains a non-GAAP financial measure of organic revenue growth, representing the rate of revenue growth excluding the effects of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. We exclude the amortization of acquisition related intangibles and the effects of foreign exchange rates in calculating these non-GAAP measures because such amortization is outside of our normal operations and such foreign exchange effects are out of our control. We believe that the inclusion of these non-GAAP financial measures in this press release also helps investors to gain a meaningful understanding of our core operating results and future prospects, consistent with how management measures and forecasts the company's performance, especially when comparing such results to previous periods or forecasts. PerkinElmer's management uses these non-GAAP measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, as the basis for measuring the company's core operating performance and comparing such performance to that of prior periods and to the performance of our competitors. These measures are also used by management in their financial and operating decision-making.
 
This press release also contains a non-GAAP financial measure of free cash flow. We define free cash flow as our net cash provided by operating activities minus our capital expenditures. We use free cash flow, and ratios based on this measure, to conduct and evaluate our business and, specifically, to determine incentive compensation, to allocate resources to debt repayment and for cash investing and financing activities. Therefore, we believe that this measure may be similarly useful and informative to investors.
 
The non-GAAP financial measures included in this press release are not meant to be considered superior to or a substitute for results of operations prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, the non-GAAP financial measures included in this press release may be different from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similar measures used by other companies. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures used in this press release to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are set forth in the text of, and the accompanying exhibits to, this press release.
