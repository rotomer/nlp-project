Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
On January 3, 2005, PerkinElmer, Inc. granted to its executive officers their annual stock option awards under PerkinElmer's 2001 Incentive Plan. The following table summarizes the awards granted to the specified executive officers of PerkinElmer:
 
 
The stock options grant the executive the right to purchase up to the number of shares of PerkinElmer's common stock specified in the table above at a per share purchase price equal to $22.22. The per share purchase price is equal to the fair market value of PerkinElmer's common stock, calculated as the average of the high and low trading price of such stock on January 3, 2004 on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock options vest in three equal annual installments beginning on January 3, 2006 and, to the extent vested, may be exercised over a term of seven years. Upon a change in control of PerkinElmer or the death or disability of the executive, all unvested options become 100% vested.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
