First quarter 2005 revenue of $416.3 million increased 6% over the first quarter of 2004. The impact of foreign exchange and acquisitions increased first quarter 2005 revenue by 2% over the first quarter of 2004. First quarter 2005 revenue in Health Sciences, representing 71% of total revenues for the quarter, increased 9% over the same period of 2004 driven primarily by strong growth in genetic screening, medical imaging, environmental and service. Industrial Sciences revenue in the first quarter of 2005 was flat compared to the first quarter of 2004 as growth in consumer electronics, aerospace and safety and security was offset by declines in semiconductor revenues. Excluding semiconductor revenues, the first quarter of 2005 Industrial Sciences revenue increased 3% compared to the same period last year.
 
"We were pleased to deliver a strong quarter of revenue and earnings growth," said Gregory L. Summe, Chairman and CEO of the Company.

We believe this balance will enable us to continue improving profitability while increasing our revenue growth rate" added Summe.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
In addition to financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), this press release also contains non-GAAP financial measures of earnings per share, operating profit and operating margin, in each case excluding amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. This press release also contains a non-GAAP financial measure of operating profit excluding intangibles amortization and an in-process research and development charge. We exclude the amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and, where applicable, the in-process research and development charge, in calculating these non-GAAP measures because such amortization and in-process research and development charge are outside of our normal operations. We believe that the inclusion of these non-GAAP financial measures in this press release also helps investors to gain a meaningful understanding of our core operating results and future prospects, consistent with how management measures and forecasts the Company's performance, especially when comparing such results to previous periods or forecasts. PerkinElmer's management uses these non-GAAP measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, as the basis for measuring the Company's core operating performance and comparing such performance to that of prior periods and to the performance of our competitors. These measures are also used by management in their financial and operating decision-making.
 
The non-GAAP financial measures included in this press release are not meant to be considered superior to or a substitute for results of operations prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, the non-GAAP financial measures included in this press release may be different from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similar measures used by other companies. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures used in this press release to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are set forth in the text of, and the accompanying exhibits to, this press release.
