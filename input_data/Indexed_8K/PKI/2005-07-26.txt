 PerkinElmer, Inc. (NYSE: PKI), a global leader in Health Sciences and Industrial Sciences, today announced GAAP earnings per share of $.26 from continuing operations on revenue of $425.5 million for the second quarter ended July 3, 2005.

Second quarter 2005 GAAP earnings per share of $.26 from continuing operations included a previously disclosed tax benefit and restructuring charges which provided a net benefit to earnings of $.06 per share. The second quarter 2005 results also included intangibles amortization expense of $7.4 million, or approximately $.04 per share. Excluding the net $.02 per share increase to earnings resulting from the tax and restructuring items as well as the intangibles amortization, the Company announced earnings per share from continuing operations of $.24. This adjusted earnings per share met the Thomson First Call
TM
consensus estimate of $.24 for the second quarter of 2005, and was also at the high end of the Company's forecasted range of $.23 to $.24 for the quarter.
 
Second quarter 2005 revenue of $425.5 million increased 3% over the second quarter of 2004. Revenue growth of 5% in Life and Analytical Sciences and 5% in Optoelectronics was partially offset by a decline of Fluid Sciences revenue of 6% during the second quarter of 2005 compared to the same period last year. The effects of foreign exchange and acquisitions increased total second quarter 2005 revenue by 2% over the second quarter of 2004.
 
Second quarter 2005 revenue from Health Sciences end markets, representing 72% of total revenues for the quarter, increased 8% over the same period of 2004, driven primarily by continued strong revenue growth in the Company's genetic screening, medical imaging, environmental and service businesses. Second quarter 2005 revenue from Industrial Sciences end markets decreased 7% compared to the second quarter of 2004, as revenue growth in aerospace and certain consumer electronics applications was offset primarily by declines in revenues from semiconductor and photoflash lighting businesses.
 
The Company's total revenue for the six months ended July 3, 2005 was $841.4 million, up 5% compared with the first six months of 2004. Health Sciences revenue for the first six months of 2005 increased 8% compared to the same period of 2004. Industrial Sciences revenue decreased 4% during the first six months of 2005 compared to the first six months of 2004. For the first six months ended July 3, 2005 compared to the same period of 2004, revenue from Life and Analytical Sciences increased 6%, Optoelectronics revenue increased 8% and Fluid Sciences revenue decreased 6%.
The Company generated operating cash flow of $86.8 million in the second quarter of 2005, up 53% compared to operating cash flow of $56.6 million for the second quarter of 2004. Free cash flow for the second quarter of 2005, defined as operating cash flow of $86.8 million less capital expenditures of $7.0 million, was $79.8 million for the second quarter of 2005, representing an increase of 55% over the same period of 2004. Free cash flow for the second quarter of 2004 was $51.5 million, and was comprised of operating cash flow of $56.6 million less capital expenditures of $5.1 million. During the second quarter of 2005, the Company reduced debt by $104 million, including paying off the remaining balance of its term loan. Cash and cash equivalents were $158.7 million at the end of the second quarter of 2005.
 
"We were pleased to deliver a strong quarter of earnings growth and excellent cash flow," said Gregory L. Summe, Chairman and CEO of the Company. "We continue to see good momentum in most of our growth platforms with product lines representing about 40% of our revenue posting double-digit growth. During the quarter, we reinvested some of our financial gains to further accelerate the Company's shift of resources into geographic regions and product lines that drive our growth strategy," added Summe.
 
GAAP operating profit during the second quarter of 2005 was $27.7 million. Attached to this press release is a reconciliation of second quarter 2005 GAAP operating profit by segment to earnings excluding intangibles amortization and restructuring charges. Excluding intangibles amortization and restructuring charges, operating profit for the second quarter of 2005 was $50.0 million or approximately 11.8% of revenues up from 11.6% in the second quarter of 2004. This increase in second quarter 2005 operating margin, excluding intangibles amortization and restructuring charges detailed in the attached reconciliation, was due to an increase of 120 basis points in Life and Analytical Sciences operating margin and an increase of 60 basis points in Optoelectronics operating margin, that were partially offset by a 390 basis point decline in Fluid Sciences operating margin.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
In addition to financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), this press release also contains non-GAAP financial measures of earnings per share, operating profit and operating margin, in each case excluding amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and restructuring charges. This press release also contains a non-GAAP financial measure of earnings per share excluding intangibles amortization, restructuring charges and a tax benefit. We exclude the amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, restructuring charges, and, where applicable, the tax benefit in calculating these non-GAAP measures because such items are outside of our normal operations. We believe that the inclusion of these non-GAAP financial measures in this press release also helps investors to gain a meaningful understanding of our core operating results and future prospects, consistent with how management measures and forecasts the Company's performance, especially when comparing such results to previous periods or forecasts. PerkinElmer's management uses these non-GAAP measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, as the basis for measuring the Company's core operating performance and comparing such performance to that of prior periods and to the performance of our competitors. These measures are also used by management in their financial and operating decision-making.
 
This press release also contains a non-GAAP financial measure of free cash flow. We define free cash flow as our net cash provided by operating activities minus our capital expenditures. We use free cash flow, and ratios based on this measure, to conduct and evaluate our business and, specifically, to determine incentive compensation, to allocate resources to debt repayment and for cash investing and financing activities. Therefore, we believe that this measure may be similarly useful and informative to investors.
 
The non-GAAP financial measures included in this press release are not meant to be considered superior to or a substitute for results of operations prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, the non-GAAP financial measures included in this press release may be different from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similar measures used by other companies. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures used in this press release to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are set forth in the text of, and the accompanying exhibits to, this press release.
