If a Neutral is not selected within that time period, either Dispute Resolution Party may request the Center for Public Resources, or if the Authorized Representative has previously objected to the use of the Center for Public Resources, the American Arbitration Association, to supply within ten (10) days a list of at least three (3) potential Neutrals with qualifications as specified in the request, or as agreed to jointly by the Parties. Within 7 days of receipt of the list, the Dispute Resolution Parties shall rank the proposed candidates independently, exchange rankings (ranked numerically with 1 being the most desired) and select as the Neutral the individual who receives the highest combined ranking who is available to serve.

and the identification of witnesses. Should a dispute arise over the extent of document production, appropriate witnesses or the scheduling of any activity, including the hearing location and date, the Neutral is authorized to make a final determination after hearing each Dispute Resolution Party's position. At the pre-hearing conference, or at a later scheduled conference as agreed to by both Dispute Resolution Parties, the location and date for the hearing will be set which will not, unless both Dispute Resolution Parties agree, be more than one 120 days from the date of the initial pre-hearing conference.
 
(e) . One week before the scheduled hearing, each Dispute Resolution Party shall deliver to the Neutral and to the other Dispute Resolution Party a written summary of its views on the matter in dispute. The summary may be no longer than twenty double-spaced pages unless the Dispute Resolution Parties agree otherwise.
Summary of Views
 
(f) . At the hearing each Dispute Resolution Party shall be represented by the Authorized Individuals and also may be represented by counsel. Each Dispute Resolution Party will have an agreed-upon time, not to exceed four hours, in order to present its case. The Authorized Individuals must be present for the presentations but may not participate in them. The Neutral may ask questions during the presentations and the Authorized Individuals may ask questions after the conclusion of the other Dispute Resolution Party's presentation. At the conclusion of the presentations, the Authorized Individuals, without counsel, will meet with the Neutral to discuss the dispute in order to attempt to reach a resolution. If no settlement is reached, the Neutral will orally summarize the dispute, the strengths and weaknesses of both Dispute Resolution Parties' positions and give his or her opinion as to how much the Dispute Resolution Party seeking recovery or other relief would

receive if the matter were resolved through litigation. No stenographic, visual or audio record made will be made of the hearing.
 
(g) . The Dispute Resolution Parties shall participate in the ADR to its conclusion as designated by the Neutral and not terminate negotiations concerning resolution of the matters in dispute until at least 2 weeks after the hearing. Neither Dispute Resolution Party may begin a lawsuit or seek other remedies prior to the conclusion of the two-week post-hearing negotiation period. But, despite anything to the contrary in this Article or elsewhere in this Agreement, either Dispute Resolution Party may commence litigation on any date after which the commencement of litigation would be barred by an applicable statute of limitations or in order to request equitable relief. In that event, the Dispute Resolution Parties shall (except as prohibited by court order) continue to participate in the ADR to its conclusion.
Participation
 
(h) . The Dispute Resolution Parties shall share equally the fees of, and reasonable costs incurred by, the Neutral. The Neutral may not be a witness, consultant, expert or counsel for any Dispute Resolution Party with respect to the matters in dispute and any related matters.
Costs of Dispute Resolution
 
(i) . The ADR is a compromise negotiation for purposes of the Federal Rules of Evidence and state rules of evidence. The entire procedure is confidential. All conduct, statements, promises, offers, views and opinions, whether oral or written, made in the course of the ADR by any of the Dispute Resolution Parties, their agents, employees, representatives or other invitees to the ADR and by the Neutral, who is the Dispute Resolution Parties' joint agent for purposes of these compromise negotiations, are confidential and will, in addition and where appropriate, be deemed to be work product and privileged. The conduct, statements, promises, offers, views and opinions are not discoverable or admissible for any
Confidentiality
 
purposes, except impeachment, in any litigation or other proceeding involving the Dispute Resolution Parties and may not be disclosed to anyone not an agent, employee, expert, witness, or representative for any of the Dispute Resolution Parties. Evidence otherwise discoverable or admissible is not excluded from discovery or admission as a result of its use in the ADR and the Dispute Resolution Parties may request any discovery to which they would otherwise be entitled without regard to the documents, depositions or other discovery that occurred as part of the ADR.
 
(j) .
Exclusive Means for Dispute Resolution
 
(i) A Party's failure or refusal to participate in the dispute resolution mechanisms of this Article is a material breach of this Agreement. If any Party seeks and secures judicial intervention requiring enforcement of this Section 11.14, it will be entitled to recover from the other Party in the judicial proceeding all costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, that it was required to incur.
 
(k) Except for the dispute resolution procedure set forth in Section 1.4, the procedures specified in this Section 11.14 are the sole and exclusive procedures for the resolution of disputes between the Parties arising out of or relating to this Agreement.
 
(l) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, each Party shall have the right to pursue provisional relief from any court, such as attachment, specific performance, preliminary injunction, replevin, etc., to avoid irreparable harm, even though ADR has not been commenced or completed. For purposes of any action described in this Section 11.14(l), each Party (i) submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of any federal court sitting in the Southern District of New York, or any state court in the Bureau of Manhattan, State of New York, (ii) agrees that any action described in this Section 11.14(l) may be heard and determined
 
only in such court, (iii) agrees not to bring any such action in any other court, and (iv) waives any defense of inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any action described in this Section 11.14(l) and waives any bond, surety or other security that might be required of the other Party with respect thereto.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
October 6, 2005
 
 
 
 
PerkinElmer, Inc. (NYSE: PKI) announced today its intention to divest the Fluid Sciences business segment to increase the strategic focus on its higher-growth Health Sciences and Photonic markets. As part of the divestiture process, the Company has signed a definitive agreement to sell its aerospace business to Eaton Corporation for approximately $333 million, subject to regulatory approval and customary closing conditions. The Company also reported that it is in discussions to sell its semiconductor and fluid testing businesses. All of the planned divestitures are expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2005 with aggregate proceeds of approximately $400 million from the sale of the Fluid Sciences business segment.
BOSTON 
 
"The divestiture of our Fluid Sciences business segment will allow us to better focus our leadership and financial resources on our most promising growth opportunities," said Gregory L. Summe, Chairman and CEO of PerkinElmer. "The proceeds will help us build our growth platforms, with particular emphasis on genetic screening, medical imaging, molecular medicine and service. While expected to be modestly dilutive, about 5%-7% in 2006, the divestitures should reduce our exposure to more cyclical markets and position PerkinElmer to deliver higher revenue and EPS growth."
 
Summe continued, "While Fluid Sciences is an excellent business, it does not fit with our long-term strategy. We remain committed to supporting the business through the divestiture process and anticipate no interruptions in customer service."
 
Merrill Lynch acted as exclusive financial advisor to the Company in the sale of its aerospace business.
 
The Company will hold a conference call on October 6, 2005 at 5:30PM Eastern Time (ET) to discuss the recent developments. To listen to the call live, please tune into the webcast via .

- PerkinElmer - Chairman, CEO
 
Thank you, Dan. Good morning, everyone. I appreciate you taking the time to join us this afternoon and talk about an exciting strategic transition in our business portfolio. With me today is Rob Friel, our Chief Financial Officer.
 
Earlier today, we announced our intention to divest our Fluid Sciences business segment, and specifically that we had signed a contract to sell our aerospace business to the Eaton Corporation for $333 million. Now, you will recall that since 1998, we have been on a journey to shift our business portfolio into higher-growth market with a strategic focus on Health Sciences. At the beginning of 1998, Health Sciences was less than 10% of our revenue. And after this transaction, it will be over 80% of a larger revenue base.
 
We expect to realize good value for these businesses, with proceeds of approximately $400 million. Rob will discuss our intentions with respect to the expected use of the proceeds. But clearly, this gives us a very strong balance sheet to continue building our growth platforms, particularly in genetic screening, molecular medicine, medical imaging and service. As importantly, this allows us to concentrate our leadership and financial resources on our high growth opportunities.
 
We intend to be a major contributor to the development of the predictive diagnostics and personalized medicine markets. Rob is now going to provide a financial review of this proposed transaction. And then we will open the call for questions. Rob?
 
Rob Friel
- PerkinElmer - CFO
 
Thanks, Greg. As Greg just discussed some of the strategic rationale behind today's announcement, I thought I would review the details of the transactions, potential use of the proceeds, the financial implications, and finally, show a brief summary of PKI pro forma without Fluid Sciences.
 
So you'll see on page 4, first of all, the contract we signed today with Eaton Corporation to sell our aerospace business is for 333 million, which is made up of 326 million of cash and 7 million of assumed obligations under capital leases. In 2005, the aerospace business is projected to generate about 155 to 160 million of revenue, with EBITDA in the 34 to 35 million range. Therefore, we are selling the business just under 10 times EBITDA. Since we have a relatively low both book and tax basis, we estimate about 900 million of cash taxes from the sale, so that net cash proceeds would be roughly 240 million. And we expect to report a significant booking on the transaction of over $1 per share.
 
Turning to page 5, in addition to the sale of the aerospace business, we're in discussions with prospective buyers to sell the semicon piece of Fluid Sciences, as well as the fluid testing business. Revenue for these businesses is projected to be about 75 million this year, with EBITDA of about $10 million.
 
Based on these discussions, we believe the range of value is between 60 to 75 million, which, assuming the midpoint of that range, would yield after-tax proceeds of about 55 million, and a book gain of roughly $0.20 to $0.25 per share.
 
We believe all these transactions will close in the fourth quarter. And for the third quarter financial results, which we will issue later this month, the Fluid Sciences business will be accounted for as a discontinued business.
 
Page 6 shows the potential uses of the proceeds, which include the repayment of our outstanding indebtedness, which at this point is only the 270 million remaining balance on the subordinated note we issued in 2002. In addition, we'll look to expand our capabilities with product line and technology extensions. This could take the form of both licensing as well as outright acquisitions. And while we're looking at opportunities to expand all our businesses, the four I have listed in the middle of page 6 are the highest priority.
 
We may also purchase some of our shares. And we currently have the authorization to do about 10 million shares. As we get more definitive information on the closing date of these transactions, we will communicate the impact, if any, on our 2005 financial results.
 
On page 7, I have quantified the potential 2006 impact on earnings per share, assuming the proceeds are used to pay off debt. Since we are still in the process of determining our 2006 operating plan, I have assumed Fluid Sciences would generate between 40 to 43 million of operating income next year. And the interest savings from retiring the debt would be about 24 million. Again, since we have not issued 2006 guidance, I have used the current estimate in First Call, which is $1.28 per share, representing a 16 to 20% increase over 2005 based on our current guidance for this year. As you can see at the bottom of the page, this would result in roughly 5 to 7% dilution. This, of course, assumes we do not repurchase any of our shares.

Turning to page 8, you can see an indication of PKI pro forma without Fluid Sciences. On the right, you see that Health Sciences would now make up 82% of our roughly 1.5 billion revenue, with the remaining 270 million, or 18%, of our revenue in sensors and specialty lighting, which are sold into photonic application.
 
On the right side of the page, I show several 2005 estimated financial measures, again pro forma without Fluid Sciences and the impact of the sale. As you can see, virtually all of the financial metrics improve except for cash flow, which is still very strong at over $160 million, or roughly $1.22 per share. At the bottom of the page, I show an estimate of our capital structure, which, as you can see, gives us excellent financial strength to continue to build out our capabilities.
 
So in summary, we feel like we're receiving good value for these businesses. But more importantly, this action reduces our exposure to several cyclical markets, and narrows our focus in what we believe are the most exciting end markets. Now, I would like to open the call to any of your questions.
 
QUESTION AND ANSWER

(OPERATOR INSTRUCTIONS) John Harmon, Needham & Company.
 
John Harmon
- Needham & Company - Analyst
 
Congratulations. Sorry; I missed a bit of your opening remarks, so please bear with me if I ask you something you mentioned.
 
Just two questions  first of all, in your press release you talked about your Optoelectronics segment as Photonics. Are you just renaming it, or does that mean a change in focus?
 
Greg Summe
- PerkinElmer - Chairman, CEO
 
No. What you have is  if you look at our organization definition, how we are organized it today, we have Life and Analytical Sciences and we have Optical Electronics. When we look at it from an end market definition, where do we sell the products into, we have Health Sciences, which is all of LAS plus the medical imaging these out of Optical Electronics, and then the Photonics, which are the remaining two components in Optical Electronics, which is specialty lighting and sensors.
 
So it's meant to be an end-market cut as opposed to our internal organization cut  more of an outside-in perspective on our business.
 
John Harmon
- Needham & Company - Analyst
 
I see, I understand. And the second question is  how difficult is it to separate off those two other pieces of the Fluid Sciences business? Are they in different facilities?
 
Greg Summe
- PerkinElmer - Chairman, CEO
 
Yes. The three components  the three pieces of Fluid Sciences are all very separated businesses, and so they are in different sites. And so they are very contained, separate businesses. So not difficult.
 
John Harmon
- Needham & Company - Analyst
 
And finally, your press release implied you're close to finding a buyer for those two businesses?

Rob, are there any restrictions on the notes for you guys to repurchase stock?
 
Rob Friel
- PerkinElmer - CFO
 
There is  as they all (ph) stand today, there are some restricted payments, covenants that we would have to stay within. And so, while we could purchase some shares today, we would be limited to probably something in the 60 to $70 million range.
 
Darryl Pardi
- Merrill Lynch-Analyst
 
Per year (multiple speakers) or as total?
 
Rob Friel
- PerkinElmer - CFO
 
No; that would be  as of right now, if the notes stay outstanding, that would be the total amount that we would be restricted to.
 
Darryl Pardi
- Merrill Lynch - Analyst
 
Okay. And do you have a sense for what type of premium you would need to tender to get the debt back? I know, if I recall correctly, you paid 13.75% premium to get the 30 million back (multiple speakers) 
 
Rob Friel
- PerkinElmer - CFO
 
Well, of course, interest rates have moved since then. But I think it depends on  you know, the way this works is it depends on what you pay over treasury. So whether you pay T plus 50 or T plus 75 or et cetera  but it's probably going to be something in the 112 to 113 range.
 
Darryl Pardi
- Merrill Lynch - Analyst
 
Okay. Well, will there (ph) any changes to the corporate structure subsequent to the divestiture?
 
Greg Summe
- PerkinElmer - Chairman, CEO
 
Not driven by this, no. We continue to  as you know, we have a very lean corporate structure. And we continue to look at the amount of integration we have with the businesses, but not prompted by this.
 
Darryl Pardi
- Merrill Lynch - Analyst
 
Okay. And would you guys lever the company to execute the share buyback? I assume (ph) you use a big slug of the cash to pay off the debt?
F T
INAL
RANSCRIPT
 
Greg Summe
- PerkinElmer - Chairman, CEO
 
I think we look at it  sort of fungible use of the cash. Clearly, I don't think our optimum capital structure is zero debt. So I think, at some point, whether it's through acquisitions or whatever, you could probably expect that we will lever up. I think, having said that, though, I think we want to keep a fairly conservative capital structure. So I think as a sort of internal guideline, I don't think we want to go anywhere above two times EBITDA. So if you think about an EBITDA this year without Fluid in the $250 million range  and of course, that will grow next year  that gives you some sense of what leverage capability we have in addition to the internal cash we generate  and, of course, the cash we will end the year with on the balance sheet.
 
Darryl Pardi
- Merrill Lynch - Analyst
 
Sorry; just a last question, if you could prioritize the three options for cash of debt reduction, share buyback, and acquisitions, what would that be?
 
Greg Summe
- PerkinElmer - Chairman, CEO
 
I think they're probably in the priority they are on the page.

Quintin Lai
- Robert W. Baird - Analyst
 
This is Quintin Lai for Aaron. Congratulations, and thanks for taking my call. With respect to the timeline for  on, let's say, the licensing and acquisition, anything in the hopper that you can speak of now?
 
Greg Summe
- PerkinElmer - Chairman, CEO
 
No. It's always  no; I think the short answer is we don't really comment on stuff that is under discussion in the pipeline; it's very difficult to predict these, which way they go. And so we typically like to talk about things after the fact as opposed to speculate while they are going on.
 
Quintin Lai
- Robert W. Baird - Analyst
 
Now, some of these areas are areas that are regulated by things like the FDA. Could you talk a little bit about your internal capabilities now with respect to taking products through a regulated environment and with respect to your internal R&D structure now? Do you anticipate bulking that up as you move into these new areas?
 
Greg Summe
- PerkinElmer - Chairman, CEO
 
Yes. We have been increasing our R&D spending this year. And we expect to be on a track over the next couple of years to continue to increase R&D expenditures on these growth opportunities.
 
As far as the FDA capability we have, we do have very significant GMP capability. All of our neonatal testing business is regulated by the FDA. And a lot of that comes out  or all of that comes out of our Turku, Finland site. So that is a very capable GMP site for the FDA. So we have the capability to do that. We are not on the therapeutic side; we're just on the diagnostic side.

Congratulations on a well-priced and well-timed acquisition  or divestiture, rather. A couple questions. You did the Health Sciences/Photonics breakdown. I assume that that's for illustrative purposes, and you're not going to change the way you're reporting?
 
Rob Friel
- PerkinElmer - CFO
 
Not at this time, although I do say  we typically give out some of the revenue of the segments underneath Opto and Health Sciences so you can build that up. I think we kind of give it both ways.
 
Steven Salamon
- Infinium Capital - Analyst
 
Fair enough, although I guess you report EBIT under the LAS and (multiple speakers)
 
Greg Summe
- PerkinElmer - Chairman, CEO
 
Yes; yes, we do.
 
Steven Salamon
- Infinium Capital - Analyst
 
And then the net proceeds that you quote  is that also net of any fees, or is there another little adjustment to the net proceeds that we need to make?
 
Rob Friel
- PerkinElmer - CFO
 
That's net of fees as well.
 
Steven Salamon
- Infinium Capital - Analyst
 
And if you could remind us, maybe relative to the specific acquisitions sort of target areas that you've mentioned, if you have any acquisition criteria that you're looking for? Is there a size criteria? Presumably, a number of the acquisitions in this area would be on the smaller side as opposed to being big chunks.
 
Greg Summe
- PerkinElmer - Chairman, CEO
 
When we look and acquisition opportunities, we have three screens. First and foremost, we have a strategic due diligence to say what's the hit (ph)? And I would say our priorities here are really expanding the capabilities on our growth platforms. So they are principally around product line extensions and technology bolt-ons. We do look at some consolidation plays, although I think that is a lower priority for us than sort of building the range of capabilities to help accelerate, which we think helps accelerate our organic growth on our growth platforms.
 
And then financial  we look at the incremental return on investment. And then lastly, we look at the operational or the integration requirements  just how difficult, both from a culture, physical location, motivation and incentives of the people involved. So we kind of run it through those three screens. I would say it's principally around  what can we buy that helps us accelerate our internal growth as opposed to doing larger consolidation plays in the industry?

Did I hear you correctly  you're going to report Q3 with fluid as discontinued operations?
 
Rob Friel
- PerkinElmer - CFO
 
Yes.
 
Darryl Pardi
- Merrill Lynch - Analyst
 
But you are not giving us your anticipated impact on that in the quarter? I mean 
 
Rob Friel
- PerkinElmer - CFO
 
Well, I don't think there's going to be any impact on the quarter, because this thing is not going to close till Q4. So the only impact will be, obviously, some portion of the income will be down in discontinued versus up in continued.
 
Darryl Pardi
- Merrill Lynch - Analyst
 
And the second question is for Greg. You just mentioned earlier that you expect to continue to grow R&D investments in the current growth initiatives. Do you expect R&D to grow faster than sales in the next few years?
 
Greg Summe
- PerkinElmer - Chairman, CEO
 
Yes. I don't have a specific ratio for you, Darryl. You have to  we have some very attractive growth platforms. We would like to continue to step up the internal investment on it. On the other hand, we keep a close eye on how the markets are doing. And if we think we've got better growth, the market has got a little bit more of an uplift, we spend more. And if not, we moderate it a little bit to keep us on  I think a balance between longer-term growth and short-term delivery of cash and earnings return to the investors.
 
So I think the short answer to that is yes. But I don't have a specific target to give you each year out.

Gentlemen, you have no further questions. I turn it back to you, Mr. Summe, for closing remarks.
 
Greg Summe

Great. Well, thanks, everyone, for your questions. In summary, I think we're quite excited about shifting our portfolio to accelerate the growth in Health Sciences and Photonics end-markets. We believe after these divestitures, PerkinElmer will have a higher growth and higher value-added mix of businesses that will serve us well going on in the future. So thanks for your time today and your support of PerkinElmer.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This presentation contains non-GAAP financial measures of earnings per share operating profit and operating margin in each case exclude amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and restructuring changes. This presentation also includes a non-GAAP financial measure of earnings per share excluding intangibles amortization, restructuring charges and a tax benefit. We exclude the amortization of acquisition related intangibles, restructuring charges, and where applicable, the tax benefit in calculating these non-GAAP measures because such items are outside of our normal operations. This presentation also contains non-GAAP financial measures of free cash flow and EBITDA. We define free cash flow as our net cash provided by operating activities minus our capital expenditures. We define EBITDA as earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization expense. We believe that the inclusion of these non-GAAP financial measures in this presentation also helps investors to gain a meaningful understanding of our core operating results and future prospects, consistent with how management measures and forecasts the Company's performance, especially when comparing such results to previous periods or forecasts.
