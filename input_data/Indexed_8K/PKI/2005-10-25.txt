EXHIBIT INDEX Exhibit No. Description - ----------- ----------- 99.1 Press release entitled "PerkinElmer Announces Q3 2005 Results", issued by PerkinElmer, Inc. on October 25, 2005.

Exhibit 99.1 PerkinElmer Announces Q3 2005 Results BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 25, 2005--PerkinElmer, Inc. (NYSE: PKI) -- EPS from Continuing Operations up 43%, Exceeds Forecast -- Health Sciences Revenue Growth of 8% -- Operating Margin up 180 Basis Points -- Increases 2005 Full Year EPS Guidance PerkinElmer, Inc. (NYSE: PKI), a global leader in Health Sciences, today announced GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations of $.20 on revenue of $361.9 million for the third quarter ended October 2, 2005. This third quarter EPS represents an increase of 43% over GAAP earnings per share of $.14 in the third quarter of 2004. Third quarter 2005 income from discontinued operations, representing the results of the Company's Fluid Sciences business segment, was $.04 per share. Total EPS from continuing and discontinued operations for the third quarter of 2005, excluding intangibles amortization expense of $7.4 million or approximately $.04 per share, was $.28 per share. The adjusted earnings per share of $.28 exceeded the Thomson First Call(TM) consensus estimate of $.27 for the third quarter of 2005, and also exceeded the Company's forecasted range of $.26 to $.27 for the quarter. Third quarter 2005 revenue of $361.9 million increased 6% over the third quarter of 2004. Revenue growth was 6% in Life and Analytical Sciences and 5% in Optoelectronics. Third quarter 2005 revenue from Health Sciences end markets, representing 81% of total revenues for the quarter, increased 8% over the same period of 2004, driven primarily by continued strong revenue growth in the Company's genetic screening, medical imaging, environmental and service businesses. Third quarter 2005 revenue from Photonics end markets declined just under 1% compared to the same period of 2004 as declines in lithography revenues offset growth in specialty lighting and sensors. GAAP operating profit for the third quarter of 2005 was $40.7 million, up 26% over the third quarter of 2004. Operating profit excluding intangibles amortization of $7.2 million was $47.9 million for the third quarter of 2005, or 13.2% as a percentage of revenue for the quarter. This represents an increase of 170 basis points compared to the same period of last year, as gross margins increased 160 basis points due to higher volume and productivity gains. "We were pleased to deliver strong revenue and earnings growth during the quarter, with excellent performance in our key growth platforms of genetic screening, medical imaging and service," said Gregory L. Summe, Chairman and CEO of the Company. "Strategically, with the recent announcement of our plan to divest our Fluid Sciences business segment, we continue to reposition the portfolio and narrow our focus around higher growth end markets. Our investments going forward will be centered around opportunities in Health Sciences and Photonics end markets that drive long-term growth," added Summe. The Company generated operating cash flow of $23.2 million in the third quarter of 2005. Free cash flow for the third quarter of 2005, defined as operating cash flow of $23.2 million less capital expenditures of $6.6 million, was $16.6 million for the third quarter of 2005. For the nine months ended October 2, 2005, free cash flow was $107.3 million, comprised of operating cash flow of $123.5 million less capital expenditures of $16.2 million for the period. The Company is forecasting full year 2005 free cash flow from continuing and discontinued operations of at least $180 million. Financial overview by reporting segment: Life and Analytical Sciences reported revenue of $259.1 million for the third quarter of 2005, up 6% from revenue of $243.7 million in the third quarter of 2004, driven primarily by revenue growth in the Company's genetic screening, service and environmental businesses. Revenue growth during the third quarter of 2005 excluding the effects of foreign exchange was 6%. The segment's GAAP operating profit for the third quarter of 2005 was $26.7 million. The segment's operating profit for the third quarter of 2005, excluding intangibles amortization, was $33.2 million, or 12.8% of revenues, representing an increase of 230 basis points over the same period of 2004. Optoelectronics reported revenue of $102.8 million for the third quarter of 2005, an increase of 5% from revenue of $97.9 million for the third quarter of 2004, with growth in medical imaging and specialty lighting partially offset by revenue declines in lithography. Revenue growth during the third quarter of 2005 excluding the effects of foreign exchange and acquisitions was 2%. The segment's GAAP operating profit for the third quarter of 2005 was $20.3 million. The segment's operating profit for the third quarter of 2005, excluding intangibles amortization, was $20.9 million, or 20.4% of revenues, representing an increase of 200 basis points over the same period of 2004. Discontinued Operations In October 2005, the Company announced its intention to divest its Fluid Sciences business segment to increase the strategic focus on its higher-growth Health Sciences and Photonics end markets. Therefore, the results of operations for the segment have been reported as discontinued operations in this press release and in the attachments to this release. Fluid Sciences reported revenue of $58.3 million for the third quarter of 2005, down 5% compared to the same period of 2004. Revenue growth in aerospace was offset by a decline in semiconductor revenues. The segment's GAAP operating profit for the third quarter of 2005 was $9.1 million. The segment's operating profit for the third quarter of 2005, excluding intangibles amortization, was $9.4 million, or 16.1% of revenues. Financial Guidance The Company projects fourth quarter 2005 total GAAP earnings from continuing and discontinued operations of between $.36 and $.38 per share. Excluding the impact of intangibles amortization of $.03 per share, the Company projects earnings per share of between $.39 and $.41 for the fourth quarter of 2005. The Company increased its forecast for full year total 2005 GAAP earnings from continuing and discontinued operations to a range between $.98 and $1.00 per share. Excluding the impact of intangibles amortization and the second quarter 2005 tax benefit and restructuring charges, the Company increased its forecast for full year 2005 earnings per share to a range between $1.10 and $1.12. The fourth quarter and full year 2005 projections do not take into account any impact or gain from the planned divestitures of the Fluid Sciences business segment or the use of proceeds expected from the sales. The Company will provide an update on the effects of the divestitures on financial results once these transactions have closed. The Company will discuss its third quarter results in a conference call on October 25, 2005 at 5:30 p.m. Eastern Time (ET). To listen to the call live, please tune into the webcast via www.perkinelmer.com. A playback of this conference call will be available beginning 8:30 p.m. ET, Tuesday, October 25, 2005.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), this press release also contains non-GAAP financial measures of earnings per share, operating profit and operating margin, in each case excluding amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and restructuring charges. This press release also contains a non-GAAP financial measure of earnings per share excluding intangibles amortization, restructuring charges and a tax benefit. We exclude the amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, and, where applicable, the tax benefit and restructuring charges in calculating these non-GAAP measures because such items are outside of our normal operations. We believe that the inclusion of these non-GAAP financial measures in this press release also helps investors to gain a meaningful understanding of our core operating results and future prospects, consistent with how management measures and forecasts the Company's performance, especially when comparing such results to previous periods or forecasts. PerkinElmer's management uses these non-GAAP measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, as the basis for measuring the Company's core operating performance and comparing such performance to that of prior periods and to the performance of our competitors. These measures are also used by management in their financial and operating decision-making. This press release also contains a non-GAAP financial measure of free cash flow. We define free cash flow as our net cash provided by operating activities minus our capital expenditures. We use free cash flow, and ratios based on this measure, to conduct and evaluate our business and, specifically, to determine incentive compensation, to allocate resources to debt repayment and for cash investing and financing activities. Therefore, we believe that this measure may be similarly useful and informative to investors. The non-GAAP financial measures included in this press release are not meant to be considered superior to or a substitute for results of operations prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, the non-GAAP financial measures included in this press release may be different from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similar measures used by other companies. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures used in this press release to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are set forth in the text of, and the accompanying exhibits to, this press release. Factors Affecting Future Performance This press release contains "forward-looking" statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including, but not limited to, statements relating to estimates and projections of future earnings per share and revenue growth and other financial results, developments relating to our customers and end-markets, the planned divestiture of our Fluid Sciences business segment, and plans concerning business development opportunities. Words such as "believes," "anticipates," "plans," "expects," "projects," "forecasts," "will" and similar expressions, and references to guidance, are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Such statements are based on management's current assumptions and expectations and no assurances can be given that our assumptions or expectations will prove to be correct.
