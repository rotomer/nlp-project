On October 31, 2005, PerkinElmer, Inc. ("PerkinElmer") entered into an unsecured revolving credit facility (the "Credit Agreement") with PerkinElmer and certain subsidiaries of PerkinElmer as Borrowers, PerkinElmer as Guarantor, Bank of America, N.A. acting as Administrative Agent, Swing Line Lender and L/C Issuer, Bank of America, N.A., Canada Branch, acting as Canada Paying Agent, Bank of America, N.A., Singapore Branch, as Singapore Paying Agent, and Bank of America, N.A., Tokyo Branch, as Yen Paying Agent and with other lenders party thereto. Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and HSBC Bank USA, National Association acted as Co-Syndication Agents, ABN AMRO Bank N.V. and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. acted as Co-Documentation Agents, and Banc of America Securities LLC and Citigroup Global Markets Inc. acted as Joint Lead Arrangers and Joint Book Managers. The Credit Agreement provides for a $350 million unsecured revolving credit facility maturing on the fifth anniversary of the closing date.
 
This Credit Agreement replaces the senior secured credit agreement (the "Prior Credit Agreement") dated as of December 26, 2002, as amended, among PerkinElmer, Inc., as Borrower, Merrill Lynch & Co., Merrill, Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith Incorporated, as Arranger, Merrill Lynch Capital Corporation, as Syndication Agent, Societe Generale, as Documentation Agent, and Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent and additional lenders (as defined in the Prior Credit Agreement) from time to time as parties thereto. The Prior Credit Agreement was comprised of a six-year term loan in the amount of $315 million and a $100 million five-year revolving credit facility secured primarily by a substantial portion of the PerkinElmer's and its subsidiaries' domestic assets. There was no outstanding principal balance under the remaining revolving credit facility at October 31, 2005. Letters of credit in the aggregate amount of approximately $15 million, originally issued under the Prior Credit Agreement, will be treated as issued under the Credit Agreement.
 
Borrowings made pursuant to the Credit Agreement will bear interest, payable quarterly or, if earlier, at the end of any interest period, at either (a) the base rate, described in the Agreement as the higher of the annual rate of the lead bank's prime rate or the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, or, with respect to loans in Canadian dollars, the Canadian prime rate or (b) the Eurocurrency rate (a publicly published rate) (plus, for certain lenders, a fee to compensate the lender for certain additional applicable fees), plus a percentage spread based on PerkinElmer's credit rating. Under certain conditions, PerkinElmer may request an increase not to exceed $100,000,000 in the aggregate maximum commitment under the agreement. Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, PerkinElmer agrees to pay a facility fee, payable quarterly, at rates that vary depending on PerkinElmer's credit rating and the outstanding amount of commitments under the facility, and, when applicable, a letters of credit fronting fee and letter of credit fee (as defined in the Credit Agreement).
 
The Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants for credit facilities of this type, including, among others, limitations on PerkinElmer and its subsidiaries with respect to liens, investments, incurrence of indebtedness, disposition of assets, mergers and acquisitions, subordinated debt, and transactions with affiliates. The Credit Agreement also contains customary financial covenants and events of default (with customary grace periods, as applicable). PerkinElmer may use the proceeds of borrowings under the Credit Agreement for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes, including acquisitions made under certain conditions and to refinance PerkinElmer's existing indebtedness, including indebtedness arising under the Prior Credit Agreement and the outstanding senior subordinated notes.
 
PerkinElmer has from time to time had banking relationships with the parties to the Credit Agreement.
The foregoing description of the Credit Agreement and related matters is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Credit Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.
 
On October 31, 2005, PerkinElmer entered into the Tenth Amendment (the "Amendment") to the Receivables Sale Agreement, dated as of December 21, 2001 among PerkinElmer Receivables Company, PerkinElmer, ABN AMRO Bank N.V., the committed purchasers named therein and Windmill Funding Corporation. The Amendment includes amendments to certain defined terms to reflect PerkinElmer's entry into the Credit Agreement and termination of the Prior Credit Agreement.

In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Committed Borrowing available to the Applicable Agent, then the applicable Lender and the applicable Borrower severally agree to pay to the Applicable Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount in Same Day Funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to such Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Applicable Agent, at (A) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the Overnight Rate and (B) in the case of a payment to be made by such Borrower, the interest rate applicable to Base Rate Loans.

Status of Lenders
 
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that a Borrower is resident for tax purposes in the United States, any Foreign Lender shall deliver to Company and the Administrative Agent
 
(in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the request of the Company or the Administrative Agent, but only if such Foreign Lender is legally entitled to do so), whichever of the following is applicable:

(iv) any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in United States Federal withholding tax duly completed together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Company to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made.

Each Lender shall promptly (i) notify the Administrative Agent of any change in circumstances which would modify or render invalid any such claimed exemption or reduction, and (ii) take such steps as shall not be materially disadvantageous to it, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, and as may be reasonably necessary (including the re-designation of its Lending Office) to avoid any requirement of applicable Laws of any such jurisdiction that any Borrower make any deduction or withholding for taxes from amounts payable to such Lender. Additionally, each of the Borrowers shall promptly deliver to the Administrative Agent or any Lender, as the Administrative Agent or such Lender shall reasonably request, on or prior to the Closing Date, and in a timely fashion thereafter, such documents and forms required by any relevant taxing authorities under the Laws of any jurisdiction, duly executed and completed by such Borrower, as are required to be furnished by such Lender or the Administrative Agent under such Laws in connection with any payment by the Administrative Agent or any Lender of Taxes or Other Taxes, or otherwise in connection with the Loan Documents, with respect to such jurisdiction.

organized under the laws of Singapore, any withholding tax that is imposed by Singapore (or any political subdivision thereof) on payments by the Borrower from an office within such jurisdiction, (iii) in the case of a Borrower organized under the laws of Japan, any withholding tax that is imposed by Japan (or any political subdivision thereof) on payments by the Borrower from an office within such jurisdiction, (iv) in the case of a Borrower organized under the laws of Canada, any withholding tax that is imposed by Canada (or any political subdivision thereof) on payments by the Borrower from an office within such jurisdiction, (v) in the case of a Borrower organized under the laws of Finland, any withholding tax that is imposed by Finland (or any political subdivision thereof) on payments by the Borrower from an office within such jurisdiction.

This subsection shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the L/C Issuer to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to any Borrower or any other Person.
Treatment of Certain Refunds
provided
