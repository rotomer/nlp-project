Item 7.01.    Regulation FD Disclosure.
 
In September 2005, the Company approved a plan to sell its Fluid Sciences business. Accordingly, the results of operations have been segregated from continuing operations and reported in a separate line on the Company's Consolidated Income Statements. The following schedules were prepared in order to provide the Company's investors and the analyst community with detail on the operations of the Fluid Sciences business. These schedules reconcile the Consolidated Income Statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principals ("GAAP") and included in our periodic filings to non-GAAP Pro Forma Income Statements which present consolidated operations to include Fluid Sciences as continuing operations. The reconciliations were provided for each of the three quarters for the nine months ended September 26, 2004 and for the nine months ended October 2, 2005.
 
The Company's management believes that presentation of this information for Fluid Sciences provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations because it helps investors gain a meaningful understanding of our core operating results and future prospects, consistent with how management measures and forecasts the Company's performance, especially when comparing such results to previous periods or forecasts. The Company's management uses this information to assist in their financial and operational decision-making.
 
 
The information in this Form 8-K shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Exchange Act, except as expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
