EXHIBIT INDEX Exhibit No. Description - ----------- ----------- 99.1 Press release entitled "PerkinElmer Announces Q4 2005 Results", issued by PerkinElmer, Inc. on January 26, 2006.

Exhibit 99.1 ( BW)(MA-PERKINELMER)(PKI) PerkinElmer Announces Q4 2005 Results Business Editors BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 26, 2006--PerkinElmer, Inc. (NYSE: PKI) -- Q4 GAAP EPS of $1.45 -- Operating Cash Flow of $83 million, up 17% -- Completed Sale of Aerospace and Fluid Testing Businesses -- Tender for 8.875% Bonds Completed PerkinElmer, Inc. (NYSE: PKI), a global leader in the Health Sciences and Photonics markets, today announced GAAP earnings per share of $1.45 on revenue of $387.7 million for the fourth quarter ended January 1, 2006, compared to GAAP earnings per share of $.29 per share on revenue of $411.6 million for the fourth quarter 2004. The fourth quarter 2005 GAAP EPS includes net divestiture gains of $1.47 per share and net charges of $.35 per share, including debt refinancing, tax, restructuring and income from discontinued operations. Excluding the items above and intangibles amortization expense of $.03 per share, the Company announced adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations of $.36, which represents an increase of 29% over the fourth quarter 2004. The adjusted earnings per share exceeds the Thomson First Call(TM) estimate of $.35 for the fourth quarter of 2005, and was also in line with the Company's forecasted range for the quarter. For the full year 2005, the Company announced GAAP earnings per share of $2.05. The Company reported adjusted 2005 earnings per share from continuing operations of $.95 compared to $.73 in 2004, an increase of 30%. Full year 2005 revenue of $1.47 billion increased 3% over 2004 driven primarily by sales growth in medical imaging and genetic screening. Due to the timing of the fiscal calendar, the fourth quarter of 2004 included an additional week. Adjusting for the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions and an average week's sales in the prior fiscal period, annual revenue increased 4% over 2004. Fourth quarter 2005 revenue of $387.7 million decreased 6% over the fourth quarter of 2004. Revenue in the fourth quarter 2005, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions and the extra week, increased 4% over the fourth quarter of the prior year. GAAP operating profit during the fourth quarter was $49.8 million. Excluding intangibles amortization and restructuring charges, operating profit for the fourth quarter of 2005 was $64.4 million, or approximately 16.6% of revenue, up from 14.9% in the fourth quarter of 2004. This increase in fourth quarter 2005 adjusted operating margin was due primarily to an increase in operating margins of 190 basis points in Life and Analytical Sciences and a 40 basis point increase in Optoelectronics. The company generated operating cash flow of $83.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2005, up 17% compared to operating cash flow of $71.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2004. Free cash flow for the fourth quarter of 2005, defined as operating cash flow of $83.4 million less capital expenditures of $8.8 million, was $74.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2005. Free cash flow for fiscal 2005 was $181.9 million, or approximately $1.39 per share, and was comprised of operating cash flow of $206.9 million less capital expenditures of $25.0 million. "2005 was an excellent year for PerkinElmer. We made great progress on focusing our portfolio on the Health Sciences and Photonics markets, building a very strong financial capability and strengthening our growth platforms. In addition, we delivered significant increases in operating margin and EPS," said Gregory L. Summe, Chairman and CEO of the Company. "We enter 2006 with a very strong balance sheet and operating momentum. Our focus this year will be to accelerate growth through continued operational improvement and increasing our investment in innovation." Financial overview by reporting segment: Life and Analytical Sciences reported revenue of $286.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2005, down 8% from revenue of $311.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2004, driven primarily by the longer fiscal period in 2004 versus this year. Revenue during the fourth quarter of 2005 excluding the effects of foreign exchange and the impact of the average extra week is estimated to be up 2%. The segment's GAAP operating profit for the fourth quarter of 2005 was $46.2 million. The segment's operating profit for the fourth quarter of 2005, excluding intangibles amortization and restructuring, was $54.3 million, or 19.0% of revenues, representing an increase of 190 basis points over the same period of 2004. Optoelectronics reported revenue of $101.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2005, an increase of 2% from revenue of $99.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2004, with growth in medical imaging and specialty lighting partially offset by revenue declines in the mil/aero business. Revenue growth during the fourth quarter of 2005 excluding the effects of foreign exchange, acquisitions and the impact of the average extra week was approximately 8%. The segment's GAAP operating profit for the fourth quarter of 2005 was $11.2 million. The segment's operating profit for the fourth quarter of 2005, excluding intangibles amortization and restructuring, was $17.8 million, or 17.6% of revenues, representing an increase of 40 basis points over the same period of 2004. Discontinued Operations In October 2005, the Company announced its intention to divest its Fluid Sciences business segment to increase the strategic focus on its higher-growth Health Sciences and Photonics end markets. Therefore, the results of operations for the segment have been reported as discontinued operations in this press release and in the attachments to this release. In the fourth quarter 2005, the Company sold the Aerospace and Fluid Testing divisions of Fluid Sciences, and the Lithography product line within Optoelectronics, for total cash proceeds of approximately $360 million resulting in an after-tax gain of $191 million or $1.47 per share. The Semiconductor unit continues to be reported as discontinued operations. Financial Guidance The Company projects organic revenue to increase by 5-7% for the full year 2006 and earnings per share, excluding intangibles amortization, to be in the range of $1.20-1.25, which would be growth in excess of 25%. Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2006, earnings per share, excluding intangibles amortization, is projected to be $.21-$.23, which would be growth in excess of 30%. The 2006 projections do not take into account stock option expense or any impact from the planned divestiture of the Semiconductor unit of Fluid Sciences. The Company will discuss its fourth quarter results in a conference call on January 26, 2006 at 5:30 p.m. Eastern Time (ET). To listen to the call live, please tune into the webcast via www.perkinelmer.com. A playback of this conference call will be available beginning 8:30 p.m. ET, Thursday, January 26, 2006. The playback phone number is (617) 801-6888 and the code number is 15811839. Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), this press release also contains non-GAAP financial measures of revenue, earnings per share, operating profit and operating margin, in each case excluding, where appropriate, restructuring charges, gains from the sale of businesses, intangibles amortization, the impact of foreign exchange and, where periods being compared were of a different length, extra sales during the longer period. When we refer in this press release to "earnings per share from continuing operations," we are excluding gains from the sale of businesses and restructuring charges from GAAP earnings per share. When we refer in this press release to "adjusted operating margin," we are excluding intangibles amortization and restructuring charges from GAAP operating margin. In each other case when we exclude these additional items, we identify that we are doing so when we use those items in this press release. We exclude restructuring charges, gains from the sale of businesses, intangibles amortization, the impact of foreign exchange and estimated extra sales during longer periods in calculating these non-GAAP measures because such items are outside of our normal operations. We believe that the inclusion of these non-GAAP financial measures in this press release helps investors to gain a meaningful understanding of our core operating results and future prospects, consistent with how management measures and forecasts our performance, especially when comparing such results to previous periods or forecasts. Our management uses these non-GAAP measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, as the basis for measuring our core operating performance and comparing such performance to that of prior periods and to the performance of our competitors. These measures are also used by management in their financial and operating decision-making. This press release also contains a non-GAAP financial measure of free cash flow. We define free cash flow as our net cash provided by operating activities minus our capital expenditures. We use free cash flow, and ratios based on this measure, to conduct and evaluate our business and, specifically, to determine incentive compensation, to allocate resources to debt repayment and for cash investing and financing activities. Therefore, we believe that this measure may be similarly useful and informative to investors. The non-GAAP financial measures included in this press release are not meant to be considered superior to or a substitute for results of operations prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, the non-GAAP financial measures included in this press release may be different from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similar measures used by other companies. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures used in this press release to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are set forth in the text of, and the accompanying exhibits to, this press release. Factors Affecting Future Performance This press release contains "forward-looking" statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including, but not limited to, statements relating to estimates and projections of future earnings per share and revenue growth and other financial results, developments relating to our customers and end-markets, and plans concerning business development opportunities. Words such as "believes," "intends," "anticipates," "plans," "expects," "projects," "forecasts," "will" and similar expressions, and references to guidance, are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Such statements are based on management's current assumptions and expectations and no assurances can be given that our assumptions or expectations will prove to be correct. A number of important risk factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described, implied or projected in any forward-looking statements. These factors include, without limitation: (1) our ability to identify a purchaser of the Company's semiconductor business, negotiate and consummate the sale of such business, including obtaining regulatory approvals; (2) economic and geopolitical forces that may limit any continued or expected economic or end market strengthening or recoveries; (3) risks related to our failure to introduce new products in a timely manner; (4) our ability to comply with financial covenants contained in our credit agreements and our debt instruments; (5) a delay in resolution of the Company's tax audits and an adverse determination with respect to the Company's tax audits by the Internal Revenue Service or other taxing authorities; (6) cyclical downturns continuing to affect several of the industries into which we sell our products; (7) our ability to adjust our operations to address unexpected changes; (8) our ability to execute acquisitions and license technologies and successfully integrate acquired businesses and licensed technologies into our existing business; (9) the loss of any of our licenses that may require us to stop selling products or lose competitive advantage; (10) competition; (11) regulatory compliance; (12) regulatory changes; (13) our failure to obtain and enforce intellectual property protection; (14) our defense of third party claims of patent infringement and our ability to realize the full value of our intangible assets; (15) other factors which we describe under the caption "Forward-Looking Information and Factors Affecting Future Performance" in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and in our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q and in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We disclaim any intention or obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of developments occurring after the date of this press release.
