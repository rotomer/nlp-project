EXHIBIT INDEX Exhibit No. Description - ----------- ----------- 99.1 Press release entitled "PerkinElmer Announces Q3 2006 Results", issued by PerkinElmer, Inc. on October 26, 2006.

Exhibit 99.1 PerkinElmer Announces Q3 2006 Results -- Revenue Growth of 7%; Health Sciences up 9% -- EPS from Continuing Operations of $.23; Cash EPS of $.30, up 25% -- Cash Flow from Continuing Operations up 42% BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 26, 2006--PerkinElmer, Inc. (NYSE: PKI), a global leader in Health Sciences and Photonics markets, today reported GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations of $.23 on revenue of $386.9 million for the third quarter ended October 1, 2006. The third quarter 2006 results include intangibles amortization of $9.1 million, or approximately $.05 per share, and stock option expense of $3.1 million, or $.02 per share. The Company announced earnings per share from continuing operations excluding intangibles amortization and stock option expense, or Cash EPS, of $.30, which represents an increase of 25% over the third quarter of 2005 and exceeded the Company's forecasted range of $.27 to $.29. Third quarter 2006 revenue of $386.9 million increased 7% over the third quarter of 2005. Revenue growth was 9% in Life and Analytical Sciences and 2% in Optoelectronics compared to the same period last year. From an end market perspective, third quarter 2006 revenue from Health Sciences, which represented 83% of total revenues for the quarter, increased 9% over the same period of 2005. This increase was driven primarily by strong growth in genetic screening, medical imaging and service. Foreign exchange and acquisitions contributed 3% to third quarter 2006 revenue. "We were pleased to deliver a strong quarter of revenue and earnings growth driven by excellent performance in our key growth platforms," said Gregory L. Summe, Chairman and CEO of the Company. "We believe our ongoing investments in these platforms, both through acquisitions and internal spending, will continue to drive long-term growth. This quarter, for example, we introduced our new Clarus(R) gas chromatography line, which offers the world's fastest injection-to-injection time. We also completed the acquisition of NTD Laboratories, a market leader in first trimester prenatal risk assessment." GAAP operating profit during the third quarter of 2006 was $36.5 million. Third quarter 2006 operating profit excluding intangibles amortization of $9.1 million and stock option expense of $3.1 million was $48.7 million, or 12.6% as a percentage of revenue for the quarter. The Company generated cash flow from continuing operations of $26.0 million in the third quarter of 2006, up 42% over the same period last year. Financial Overview by Reporting Segment Life and Analytical Sciences reported revenue of $283.5 million for the third quarter of 2006, up 9% from revenue of $259.1 million in the third quarter of 2005, driven primarily by growth in the Company's genetic screening and service businesses, as well as sales traction from a range of new products. The segment's GAAP operating profit for the third quarter of 2006 was $25.3 million. Operating profit excluding intangibles amortization and stock option expense for the third quarter of 2006 was $34.7 million, or 12.2% as a percentage of revenue. Optoelectronics reported revenue of $103.4 million for the third quarter of 2006, up 2% from revenue of $100.9 million in the third quarter of 2005, driven primarily by revenue growth in imaging partially offset by a decline in specialty lighting revenue. The segment's GAAP operating profit was $20.1 million for the third quarter of 2006. The segment's operating profit excluding intangibles amortization and stock option expense for the third quarter of 2006 was $21.2 million, or 20.5% as a percentage of revenue. Financial Guidance For the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company projects GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations of between $.32 and $.34. The Company projects Cash EPS of between $.38 and $.40 for the fourth quarter of 2006. The Company will discuss its third quarter results in a conference call on October 26, 2006, at 5:30 p.m. Eastern Time (ET).

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), this earnings announcement also contains non-GAAP financial measures of revenue, revenue growth, operating profit, operating margin and earnings per share, in each case excluding, where appropriate, the impact of foreign exchange, the effects of acquisitions, intangibles amortization, stock option expense and tax benefits. -- When we refer in this earnings announcement to "revenue growth," other than on a GAAP basis, we are excluding the effects of foreign exchange and acquisitions on GAAP revenue. -- When we refer in this earnings announcement to "operating profit," other than on a GAAP basis, we are excluding the amortization of intangibles, stock option expense and restructuring charges or reversals from GAAP operating margin. -- When we refer in this earnings announcement to "operating margin," other than on a GAAP basis, we are excluding the amortization of intangibles, stock option expense and restructuring charges or reversals from GAAP operating margin. -- When we refer to "Cash EPS" or "earnings per share from continuing operations," other than on a GAAP basis, we are excluding the amortization of intangibles and stock option expense from GAAP earnings per share from continued operations. We exclude the impact of foreign exchange, the effects of acquisitions, intangibles amortization and stock option expense in calculating these non-GAAP measures because such items are outside of our ongoing core business operations. We believe that the inclusion of these non-GAAP financial measures in this earnings announcement helps investors to gain a meaningful understanding of our core operating results and future prospects, and can also help investors who wish to make comparisons between us and other companies on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis, particularly with respect to stock option expenses. Our management uses both GAAP financial measures and non-GAAP financial measures to measure and forecast our core operating performance and to compare that performance to prior periods and to the performance of our competitors. Both GAAP and non-GAAP measures are also used by management in their financial and operating decision making. The non-GAAP financial measures included in this earnings announcement are not meant to be considered superior to, or a substitute for, results of operations prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, the non-GAAP financial measures included in this earnings announcement may be different from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similar measures used by other companies. Although certain non-GAAP financial measures used in this release exclude the accounting treatment of stock option expense, these non-GAAP measures should not be relied upon independently, as they ignore the contribution to our operating results that is generated by the incentive and compensation effects of the underlying stock option programs. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures used in this earnings announcement to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are set forth in the text of, and the accompanying exhibits to, this earnings announcement. Factors Affecting Future Performance This earnings announcement contains "forward-looking" statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including, but not limited to, statements relating to estimates and projections of future earnings per share and revenue growth and other financial results, developments relating to our customers and end-markets, and plans concerning business development opportunities. Words such as "believes," "intends," "anticipates," "plans," "expects," "projects," "forecasts," "will" and similar expressions, and references to guidance, are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Such statements are based on management's current assumptions and expectations and no assurances can be given that our assumptions or expectations will prove to be correct. A number of important risk factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described, implied or projected in any forward-looking statements. These factors include, without limitation: (1) our failure to introduce new products in a timely manner; (2) our ability to execute acquisitions and license technologies, or to successfully integrate acquired businesses and licensed technologies into our existing business or to make them profitable; (3) our failure to protect adequately our intellectual property; (4) the loss of any of our licenses or licensed rights; (5) our ability to compete effectively; (6) fluctuation in our quarterly operating results and our ability to adjust our operations to address unexpected changes; (7) our ability to produce an adequate quantity of products to meet our customers' demands; (8) our failure to maintain compliance with applicable government regulations; (9) regulatory changes; (10) economic, political and other risks associated with foreign operations; (11) our ability to retain key personnel; (12) restrictions in our credit agreement; (13) our ability to realize the full value of our intangible assets; and (14) other factors which we describe under the caption "Risk Factors" in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and in our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q and in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
