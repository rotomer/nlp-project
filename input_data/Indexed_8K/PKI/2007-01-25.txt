EXHIBIT INDEX Exhibit No. Description - ----------- ----------- 99.1 Press release entitled "PerkinElmer Announces Q4 2006 Results", issued by PerkinElmer, Inc. on January 25, 2007.

Exhibit 99.1 PerkinElmer Announces Q4 2006 Results -- Revenue Growth of 10%; Health Sciences up 12% -- Cash Flow from Operations of $85M -- Announced Euroscreen and Evotec acquisitions BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 25, 2007--PerkinElmer, Inc. (NYSE: PKI), a global leader in Health Sciences and Photonics markets, today reported GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations of $.33 on revenue of $427.0 million for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2006. On a non-GAAP basis, which includes the adjustments noted in the income statement reconciliation, the Company announced earnings per share for the fourth quarter 2006 of $.39, which met the First Call consensus estimate and was in line with the Company's forecasted range of $.38 to $.40. Fourth quarter 2006 revenue of $427.0 million increased 10% over the fourth quarter of 2005. Revenue growth was 12% in Life and Analytical Sciences and 5% in Optoelectronics compared to the same period last year. From an end market perspective, fourth quarter 2006 revenue from Health Sciences, which represented 85% of total revenues for the quarter, increased 12% over the same period of 2005. This increase was driven primarily by strong growth in the genetic screening, medical imaging, environmental and service businesses, as well as a positive impact from acquisitions and new product introductions. Foreign exchange and acquisitions contributed 3% and 2%, respectively, to fourth quarter 2006 revenue. Full year 2006 revenue of $1.55 billion increased 5% over 2005 driven primarily by sales growth in medical imaging, genetic screening and service. "Our strong Q4 results reflect the increased growth momentum we are generating through R&D and capital investments in our key growth platforms. We also announced eight acquisitions during the year that will help fuel our long-term growth," said Gregory L. Summe, Chairman and CEO of the Company. "We expect to carry this momentum into 2007, bringing an increased number of new products to market while continuing to deliver strong financial results." GAAP operating profit during the fourth quarter of 2006 was $52.2 million. On a non-GAAP basis, which includes the adjustments noted in the attached reconciliation, fourth quarter 2006 operating profit was $64.0 million, or 15.0% as a percentage of revenue for the quarter. The Company generated cash flow from operations of $84.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2006. For the full year 2006, cash flow from operations was $127.3 million. This number includes tax payments of $60.3 million related to the gain on the divestiture of Fluid Sciences. Cash flow from operations, net of divestiture taxes, was $187.6 million. Financial Overview by Reporting Segment: Life and Analytical Sciences reported revenue of $320.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2006, up 12% from revenue of $286.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2005, driven primarily by growth in the Company's genetic screening, environmental and service businesses, as well as a positive impact from acquisitions and new product introductions. The segment's GAAP operating profit for the fourth quarter of 2006 was $40.9 million. On a non-GAAP basis, which includes the adjustments noted in the attached reconciliation, operating profit for the fourth quarter of 2006 was $51.3 million, or 16.0% as a percentage of revenue. Optoelectronics reported revenue of $106.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2006, up 5% from revenue of $101.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2005, driven primarily by revenue growth in imaging. The segment's GAAP operating profit was $19.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2006. On a non-GAAP basis, which includes the adjustments noted in the attached reconciliation, operating profit for the fourth quarter of 2006 was $20.4 million or 19.2% as a percentage of Optoelectronics revenue. Financial Guidance The Company projects revenue to increase in the high single to low double digits for the full year 2007 and non-GAAP earnings per share to grow in the low double digits to mid-teens. Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2007, earnings per share, excluding intangibles amortization and stock option expense, is projected to be $.23-$.25. The Company will discuss its fourth quarter results in a conference call on January 25, 2007 at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time (ET). To listen to the call live, please tune into the webcast at the "Investor Corner" section of our website, www.perkinelmer.com. A playback of this conference call will be available beginning 7:00 p.m. ET, Thursday, January 25, 2007. The playback phone number is (617) 801-6888 and the code number is 67623101. Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), this earnings announcement also contains non-GAAP financial measures of revenue, revenue growth, operating profit, operating margin and earnings per share, in each case excluding, where appropriate, the impact of foreign exchange, the effects of acquisitions, intangibles amortization, stock option expense, impairment charges, restructuring reversals and tax benefits. -- When we refer in this earnings announcement to "operating profit," other than on a GAAP basis, we are excluding the amortization of intangibles, stock option expense, impairment charges and restructuring charges or reversals from GAAP operating margin. -- When we refer in this earnings announcement to "operating margin," other than on a GAAP basis, we are excluding the amortization of intangibles, stock option expense, impairment charges and restructuring charges or reversals from GAAP operating margin. -- When we refer to "non-GAAP earnings per share" or "specify that earnings per share is "on a non-GAAP basis," we are excluding the amortization of intangibles, stock option expense, impairment charges, tax expenses or benefits, debt extinguishment charges and restructuring charges or reversals from GAAP earnings per share from continued operations. -- When we refer to "cash flow from operations, net of divestiture taxes," we are excluding tax benefits relating to divestitures from GAAP cash flow from operations. We exclude the impact of foreign exchange, the effects of acquisitions, intangibles amortization, stock option expense, impairment charges and restructuring charges or reversals in calculating these non-GAAP measures because such items are outside of our ongoing core business operations. We believe that the inclusion of these non-GAAP financial measures in this earnings announcement helps investors to gain a meaningful understanding of our core operating results and future prospects, and can also help investors who wish to make comparisons between us and other companies on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis, particularly with respect to stock option expenses. Our management uses both GAAP financial measures and non-GAAP financial measures to measure and forecast our core operating performance and to compare that performance to prior periods and to the performance of our competitors. Both GAAP and non-GAAP measures are also used by management in their financial and operating decision-making. The non-GAAP financial measures included in this earnings announcement are not meant to be considered superior to or a substitute for results of operations prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, the non-GAAP financial measures included in this earnings announcement may be different from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similar measures used by other companies. Although certain non-GAAP financial measures used in this release exclude the accounting treatment of stock option expense, these non-GAAP measures should not be relied upon independently, as they ignore the contribution to our operating results that is generated by the incentive and compensation effects of the underlying stock option programs. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures used in this earnings announcement to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are set forth in the text of, and the accompanying exhibits to, this earnings announcement.
