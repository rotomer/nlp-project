EXHIBIT INDEX Exhibit No. Description - ----------- ----------- 99.1 Press release entitled "PerkinElmer Announces Q1 2007 Results", issued by PerkinElmer, Inc. on April 26, 2007.

EXHIBIT 99.1 PerkinElmer Announces Q1 2007 Results -- Revenue Growth of 13%; Health Sciences Revenue up 16% -- Growth led by Genetic Screening, Medical Imaging and Service -- Completed Euroscreen and Improvision Acquisitions BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 26, 2007--PerkinElmer, Inc. (NYSE: PKI), a global leader in Health Sciences and Photonics markets, today reported GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations of $.12 on revenue of $402.9 million for the first quarter ended April 1, 2007. On a non-GAAP basis, which includes the adjustments noted in the attached reconciliation, the Company announced adjusted earnings per share for the first quarter 2007 of $.24, which met the First Call consensus estimate and was in line with the Company's forecasted range of $.23 to $.25. First quarter 2007 revenue of $402.9 million increased over 13% versus the first quarter of 2006. Revenue growth was 14% in Life and Analytical Sciences and 11% in Optoelectronics compared to the same period last year. From an end market perspective, first quarter 2007 revenue from Health Sciences, which represented 84% of total revenues for the quarter, increased 16% over the same period of 2006. This increase was driven primarily by strong growth in genetic screening, medical imaging, and service as a result of new products, key customer wins and market expansion. Foreign exchange and acquisitions contributed 7% to first quarter 2007 revenue. "We were pleased to deliver another quarter of double-digit revenue growth as we continue to strengthen our growth platforms through increased R&D, marketing, acquisitions and capital investments," said Gregory L. Summe, Chairman and CEO of the Company. "We expect our momentum to continue through the year, as our new products and services continue to make a greater contribution to our overall revenue." GAAP operating profit during the first quarter of 2007 was $23.1 million. On a non-GAAP basis, which includes the adjustments noted in the attached reconciliation, first quarter 2007 adjusted operating profit was $43.1 million, or 10.7% as a percentage of GAAP revenue for the quarter. The Company generated cash flow from operations of $17.3 million in the first quarter of 2007, while increasing capital expenditures by 23%. In addition, the Company repurchased 2.5 million shares for a cost of approximately $60 million in the first quarter of 2007. This leaves 7.5 million shares remaining on the Company's stock repurchase authorization. Financial Overview by Reporting Segment Life and Analytical Sciences reported revenue of $299.5 million for the first quarter of 2007, up 14% from revenue of $261.9 million in the first quarter of 2006, driven primarily by growth in the Company's genetic screening, service and environmental businesses, as well as a positive impact from acquisitions and new product introductions. The segment's GAAP operating profit for the first quarter of 2007 was $14.9 million. On a non-GAAP basis, which includes the adjustments noted in the attached reconciliation, adjusted operating profit for the first quarter of 2007 was $32.7 million, or 10.9% as a percentage of GAAP revenue. Optoelectronics reported revenue of $103.4 million for the first quarter of 2007, up 11% from revenue of $93.5 million in the first quarter of 2006, driven primarily by revenue growth in medical imaging. The segment's GAAP operating profit was $16.3 million for the first quarter of 2007. On a non-GAAP basis, which includes the adjustments noted in the attached reconciliation, adjusted operating profit for the first quarter of 2007 was $17.3 million, or 16.8% as a percentage of GAAP revenue. Financial Guidance For the second quarter of 2007, the Company projects revenue to increase by low double digits, GAAP earnings per share of between $.21 and $.23, and on a non-GAAP basis, adjusted earnings per share of between $.28 and $.30.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), this earnings announcement also contains non-GAAP financial measures of adjusted earnings per share and adjusted operating profit. In each case, see below for the items that have been excluded in the determination of non-GAAP financial measures. -- When we refer to "adjusted earnings per share," we have excluded the amortization of intangibles, stock option expense, revaluation of acquired inventory, in-process research and development charges and restructuring charges from GAAP earnings per share from continued operations. -- When we refer to "adjusted operating profit," we have excluded the amortization of intangibles, stock option expense, revaluation of acquired inventory, in-process research and development charges and restructuring charges from GAAP operating margin. We use both GAAP and non-GAAP measures in our financial and operating decision-making. We believe certain items should be excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures because they are either outside of our ongoing core operations or vary significantly from period to period, which adversely affects the comparability of our results with our competitors and our own prior periods, and, in certain cases, are difficult to forecast accurately for future periods. We believe that our GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with meaningful information about and insight into our ongoing core operating results and future prospects. This is consistent with how we internally understand, manage, evaluate and forecast our performance and compare that performance to prior periods, forecasts and our competitors' performance. We also use such GAAP and non-GAAP measures to assess and compensate our employees. Examples of items that are excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures include the following: -- We exclude costs and tax effects associated with restructurings, such as the first quarter restructuring plan. We do not engage in restructuring activities in the ordinary course of business, and each restructuring plan has been discrete in terms of its business impact and scope. We believe that the costs related to restructuring activities vary significantly, which adversely affects comparability of our operating results, makes it difficult to forecast in future periods and is not indicative of our ongoing core operations. -- We exclude certain acquisition-related costs, including charges for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and in-process research and development acquired. We exclude these costs because they vary significantly, which adversely affect comparability of our operating results, makes it difficult to forecast in future periods and is not indicative of our ongoing core operations. -- We exclude the cost and tax effects associated with the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets because a significant portion of the purchase price for acquisitions may be allocated to intangible assets that have varying useful lives. In addition, exclusion of the amortization expense allows for more comparative operating results that are consistent over time for both our newly acquired and long-held businesses and with those of competitors who have made acquisitions as well as those who have not. -- We exclude the cost and tax effects associated with the effect of stock option expense. Exclusion of stock option expense allows for better comparisons with prior periods and operating results of competitor companies. Stock-based compensation plans and assumptions used to calculate the fair-value of the expense vary dramatically between companies. The non-GAAP financial measures included in this earnings announcement are not meant to be considered superior to, or a substitute for, results of operations prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, the non-GAAP financial measures included in this earnings announcement may be different from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similar measures used by other companies. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures used in this earnings announcement and in our related investor conference call to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are set forth in the accompanying exhibits to this earnings announcement.
