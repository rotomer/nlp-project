EXHIBIT INDEX Exhibit No. Description - ----------- ----------- 99.1 Press release entitled "PerkinElmer Announces Financial Results For The Third Quarter Of 2007", issued by PerkinElmer, Inc. on October 25, 2007.

Exhibit 99.1 PerkinElmer Announces Financial Results for the Third Quarter of 2007 -- Revenue growth of 13% -- EPS from continuing operations of $0.26; Adjusted EPS of $0.33 -- Operating profit margin increases 110 basis points; Adjusted operating profit margin up 70 basis points WALTHAM, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 25, 2007--PerkinElmer, Inc. (NYSE: PKI), a global leader in Health Sciences and Photonics markets, today reported financial results for the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2007. For the third quarter 2007, the Company reported GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.26. On a non-GAAP basis, which includes the adjustments noted in the attached reconciliation, the Company announced adjusted earnings per share for the third quarter 2007 of $0.33, which was at the upper end of the Company's forecasted range of $0.31 to $0.33. Revenue for the third quarter 2007 was $435.7 million, an increase of 13% versus the third quarter 2006. Revenue growth was 13% in Life and Analytical Sciences and 13% in Optoelectronics, compared to the same period last year. From an end market perspective, third quarter 2007 revenue from Health Sciences, which represented 84% of total revenues for the quarter, increased 13% over the same period of 2006. This increase was driven primarily by strong growth in genetic screening, medical imaging, and service. Changes in foreign exchange rates and acquisitions contributed approximately 4% and 3%, respectively, to overall third quarter 2007 revenue growth. "We are very pleased with our revenue growth and margin expansion for the quarter. Our investments in new products, services and geographic expansion continue to yield attractive results. Additionally, we announced our pending acquisition of ViaCell, which we believe should further strengthen our genetic screening business by expanding our capabilities in neonatal health," said Gregory L. Summe, Chairman and CEO of PerkinElmer, Inc. "We expect our positive operational and financial momentum to continue through the balance of 2007." GAAP operating profit was $45.8 million for the third quarter of 2007, compared to $36.5 million for the same period a year ago. On a non-GAAP basis, which includes the adjustments noted in the attached reconciliation, adjusted operating profit in the third quarter 2007 was $58.0 million, or 13.3% as a percentage of GAAP revenue, compared to $48.7 million, or 12.6% as a percentage of GAAP revenue, in the third quarter 2006. The Company generated cash flow from operations of $23.4 million in the third quarter 2007. Capital expenditures were $10.5 million in the third quarter 2007, an increase of 10% over the same period of 2006. In addition, the Company repurchased 1.1 million shares of its common stock for a cost of approximately $28.9 million in the third quarter 2007. This leaves approximately 2.9 million shares remaining of the Company's stock repurchase program. At September 30, 2007, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $160.9 million and net debt (defined as long term debt plus short term debt, less cash and cash equivalents) of $86.1 million. Financial Overview by Reporting Segment Life and Analytical Sciences reported revenue of $319.3 million for the third quarter 2007, up 13% from revenue of $283.5 million in the third quarter of 2006, driven primarily by growth in the Company's genetic screening, service and environmental businesses, as well as a positive impact from acquisitions, new product introductions, and changes in foreign exchange rates. The segment's GAAP operating profit for the third quarter 2007 was $29.3 million. On a non-GAAP basis, which includes the adjustments noted in the attached reconciliation, the segment's adjusted operating profit for the third quarter 2007 was $40.7 million, or 12.7% as a percentage of GAAP revenue. Optoelectronics reported revenue of $116.3 million for the third quarter 2007, up 13% from revenue of $103.4 million in the third quarter 2006, driven primarily by revenue growth in medical imaging and specialty lighting, as well as a positive impact from new product introductions and changes in foreign exchange rates. The segment's GAAP operating profit for the third quarter 2007 was $24.6 million. On a non-GAAP basis, which includes the adjustments noted in the attached reconciliation, the segment's adjusted operating profit for the third quarter 2007 was $24.2 million, or 20.8% as a percentage of GAAP revenue. Financial Guidance For the fourth quarter 2007, the Company projects revenue to increase in the mid teens with acquisitions and changes in foreign exchange rates contributing approximately 7%. The Company expects to earn GAAP earnings per share of between $0.36 and $0.38, and on a non-GAAP basis, which is expected to include the adjustments noted in the attached reconciliation, adjusted earnings per share in the range of $0.43 and $0.45. In addition, assuming a mid-November closing of the pending ViaCell acquisition, the transaction is expected to contribute in the fourth quarter an incremental 200 basis points to the Company's revenue growth and $0.01 dilution, resulting in non-GAAP adjusted combined earnings per share of between $0.42 and $0.44. The non-GAAP adjusted combined earnings per share is expected to include the adjustments noted in the attached reconciliation.

0.0% ------------------------------------ Adjusted Operating Profit $ 24.2 20.8% $ 21.2 20.5% ==================================== Adjusted Gross Margin and Adjusted Gross Margin Percentage We use the term "adjusted gross margin" to refer to GAAP gross margin, excluding amortization of intangible assets, inventory fair value adjustments related to business acquisitions, and stock option expense. We use the related term "adjusted gross margin percentage" to refer to adjusted gross margin as a percentage of GAAP revenue. We believe that these non-GAAP measures, when taken together with our GAAP financial measures, allow us and our investors to better measure the performance of our investments in technology, to evaluate the long-term profitability trends and to assess our ability to invest in the business. We exclude amortization of intangible assets from these measures because intangibles amortization charges do not represent what our management and what we believe our investors consider to be costs of producing our products and could distort the additional value generated over the cost of producing those products. Inventory fair value adjustments related to business acquisitions charges also do not represent what our management and what we believe our investors consider to be costs used in producing our products. In addition, we exclude stock option expense from these measures because stock-based compensation plans and the critical assumptions used to calculate the expense vary dramatically between us and our peers, which we believe makes comparisons of long-term operating performance trends difficult for management and investors, and could result in overstating or understating to our investors the costs used in producing our products. Adjusted Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) Expense and Adjusted SG&A Percentage We use the term "adjusted SG&A expense" to refer to GAAP SG&A expense, excluding amortization of intangible assets and stock option expense. We use the related term "adjusted SG&A percentage" to refer to adjusted SG&A expense as a percentage of GAAP revenue. We believe that these non-GAAP measures, when taken together with our GAAP financial measures, allow us and our investors to better measure the cost of the internal operating structure, our ability to leverage that structure and the level of investment required to grow our business. We exclude amortization of intangible assets from these measures because intangibles amortization charges do not represent what our management and what we believe our investors consider to be costs that support our internal operating structure and could distort the efficiencies of that structure. We also exclude stock option expense from these measures because stock-based compensation plans and the critical assumptions used to calculate the expense vary dramatically between us and our peers, which we believe makes comparisons of long-term operating performance trends difficult for management and investors, and could result in overstating or understating to our investors the costs to support our internal operating structure. Adjusted Research and Development (R&D) Expense and Adjusted R&D Percentage We use the term "adjusted R&D expense" to refer to GAAP R&D expense, excluding amortization of intangible assets and stock option expense. We use the related term "adjusted R&D percentage" to refer to adjusted R&D expense as a percentage of GAAP revenue. We believe that these non-GAAP measures, when taken together with our GAAP financial measures, allow us and our investors to better understand and evaluate our internal technology investments. We exclude amortization of intangible assets from these measures because intangibles amortization charges do not represent what our management and what we believe our investors consider to be internal investments in R&D activities and could distort our R&D investment level. In addition, we exclude stock option expense from these measures because stock-based compensation plans and the critical assumptions used to calculate the expense vary dramatically between us and our peers, which we believe makes comparisons of long-term operating performance trends difficult for management and investors, and could result in overstating or understating to our investors the amount of our internal investments in R&D activities. Adjusted Operating Profit and Adjusted Operating Profit Margin We use the term "adjusted operating profit" to refer to GAAP operating profit, excluding amortization of intangible assets, inventory fair value adjustments related to business acquisitions, restructuring and lease reversals and stock option expense. Adjusted operating profit is calculated by subtracting adjusted R&D expense and adjusted SG&A expense from adjusted gross margin. We use the related term "adjusted operating profit margin" to refer to adjusted operating profit as a percentage of GAAP revenue. We believe that these non-GAAP measures, when taken together with our GAAP financial measures, allow us and our investors to analyze the costs of the different components of producing and selling our products, to better measure the performance of our internal investments in technology and to evaluate the long-term profitability trends of our core operations. Adjusted operating profit also provides for easier comparisons of our performance and profitability with prior and future periods and relative comparisons to our peers. We believe our investors do not consider the items that we exclude from adjusted operating profit to be costs of producing our products, investments in technology and production, and costs to support our internal operating structure, and so we present this non-GAAP measure to avoid overstating or understating to our investors the performance of our operations. In addition, we exclude restructuring and lease reversals because they tends to occur due to an acquisition, divestiture, repositioning of the business or other unusual event that could distort the performance measures of our internal investments and costs to support our internal operating structure. Adjusted Earnings per Share We use the term "adjusted earnings per share" to refer to GAAP earnings per share, excluding discontinued operations, amortization of intangible assets, inventory fair value adjustments related to business acquisitions, restructuring and lease reversals and stock option expense. Adjusted earnings per share is calculated by subtracting adjusted R&D expense, adjusted SG&A expense, other income / expense and provision for taxes from adjusted gross margin. We believe that this non-GAAP measure, when taken together with our GAAP financial measures, allows us and our investors to analyze the costs of producing and selling our products and the performance of our internal investments in technology and our internal operating structure, to evaluate the long-term profitability trends of our core operations and to calculate the underlying value of the core business on a dilutive share basis, which is a key measure of the value of the company used by our management and we believe used by investors as well. Adjusted earnings per share also facilitates the overall analysis of the value of the company and the core measure of the success of our operating business model as compared to prior and future periods and relative comparisons to our peers. We exclude discontinued operations, amortization of intangible assets, inventory fair value adjustments related to business acquisitions, restructuring and lease reversals and stock option expense as these items do not represent what our management and what we believe our investors consider to be costs of producing our products, investments in technology and production, and costs to support our internal operating structure, which could result in overstating or understating to our investors the performance of our operations. Adjusted Combined Earnings per Share We use the term "adjusted combined earnings per share" to refer to projected adjusted earnings per share after giving effect to our pending acquisition of ViaCell, assuming a mid-November closing. Adjusted combined earnings per share excludes discontinued operations charges, amortization of intangible assets, inventory fair value adjustments, in-process research and development charges, deferred revenue adjustments and other significant adjustments related to business acquisitions, as well as restructuring and lease reversals and stock option expense, all of which would be included in our GAAP earnings per share. We are not currently certain that these items or other items that are required by GAAP to be included in a determination of earnings per share will be excluded from adjusted combined earnings per share because we have not yet completed our acquisition of ViaCell and integration of ViaCell into our financial statements. We believe that this non-GAAP measure will allow us and our investors to better evaluate the expected profitability of the combined operations of PerkinElmer and ViaCell, in a manner consistent with how our management and we believe our investors evaluate the core business. We exclude discontinued operations charges, amortization of intangible assets, inventory fair value adjustments, in-process research and development charges, deferred revenue adjustments, and other significant adjustments related to business acquisitions, restructuring and lease reversals and stock option expense as these items do not represent what our management and what we believe our investors will consider to be costs of producing our products, investments in technology and production, and costs to support our internal operating structure, which could result in overstating or understating to our investors the expected profitability of the combined operations. ---------- The non-GAAP financial measures described above are not meant to be considered superior to, or a substitute for, our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. There are material limitations associated with non-GAAP financial measures because they exclude charges that have an effect on our reported results and, therefore, should not be relied upon as the sole financial measures to evaluate our financial results. Management compensates and believes that investors should compensate for these limitations by viewing the non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures. In addition, the non-GAAP financial measures included in this earnings announcement may be different from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similar measures used by other companies. Each of the non-GAAP financial measures listed above are also used by our management to evaluate our operating performance, communicate our financial results to our Board of Directors, benchmark our results against our historical performance and the performance of our peers, evaluate investment opportunities including acquisitions and discontinued operations, and determine the bonus payments for senior management and employees.
