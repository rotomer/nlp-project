There are currently no subsidiary guarantors. The Company may use the proceeds from the sale of Senior Notes to finance mergers, acquisitions, capital expenditures, stock repurchases, dividends, debt refinancing and for other general corporate purposes.
The foregoing description of the Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.

Section 5.14 Use of Proceeds; Margin Regulations

No part of the proceeds from the sale of the Series 2008-A Notes hereunder will be used, directly or indirectly, for the purpose of buying or carrying or trading in any securities under such circumstances as to involve any Purchaser in a violation of Regulation U of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (12 CFR 221) or the Company in violation of Regulation X of said Board (12 CFR 224) or to involve any broker or dealer in a violation of Regulation T of said Board (12 CFR 220).

As used in this Section, the terms "margin stock" and "purpose of buying or carrying" shall have the meanings assigned to them in said Regulation U.
Section 5.15 Existing Debt; Future Liens.
(a) Except as described therein, Schedule 5.15 sets forth a complete and correct list of all outstanding Debt of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries as of May 30, 2008 (including a description of the obligors and obligees, principal amount outstanding and collateral therefor, if any, and Guaranty thereof, if any), and there has been no Material change in the amounts, interest rates, sinking funds, installment payments or maturities of the Debt of the Company or its Restricted Subsidiaries. Neither the Company nor any Restricted Subsidiary is in default and no waiver of default is currently in effect, in the payment of any principal or interest on any Debt of the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, and no event or condition exists with respect to any Debt of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary that would permit (or that with notice or the lapse of time, or both, would permit) one or more Persons to cause such Debt to become due and payable before its stated maturity or before its regularly scheduled dates of payment.
