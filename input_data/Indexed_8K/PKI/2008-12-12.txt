2008 Deferred Compensation Plan.
On December 8, 2008, the Compensation and Benefits Committee (the "Committee") of PerkinElmer, Inc. (the "Company") approved the 2008 Deferred Compensation Plan (the "2008 Plan"), an amendment and restatement of the Company's 1999 Restatement of its 1998 Deferred Compensation Plan (the "Prior Plan"), primarily to bring the terms of the plan into compliance with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code and regulations promulgated thereunder (collectively, "Section 409A"). The amendments include updates to certain definitions and to the time and form of certain benefits payable thereunder, such as in the event of a change in control of the Company. The 2008 Plan also documents the elimination of restricted stock as a deferral option, the incorporation of the Company's existing 401(k) Excess Plan into the 2008 Plan and other administrative changes. Participants of the Prior Plan who made deferrals or material modifications to their account options after January 1, 2005 are subject to the provisions of the 2008 Plan. Under the general terms of the 2008 Plan, non-employee directors and a group of management and highly compensated employees are eligible for participation. The foregoing description of the 2008 Plan does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the 2008 Plan filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Report and incorporated herein by reference.
2008 Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan.
On December 8, 2008, the Committee approved the 2008 Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (the "2008 SERP"), an amendment and restatement of the Company's previous supplemental executive retirement plan (the "Prior SERP"), primarily to bring the terms of the plan into compliance with Section 409A. The revised terms include updated definitions and specifications for the time and form of certain benefits payable thereunder, such as in the event of a change in control of the Company, as well as other administrative changes. Under the general terms of the 2008 SERP, designated senior executives are eligible for participation, and participants in the Prior SERP whose benefits were not fully vested as of December 31, 2004 are now subject to the provisions of the 2008 SERP. The foregoing description of the 2008 SERP does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the 2008 SERP filed as Exhibit 10.2 to this Report and incorporated herein by reference.
Form of Award Agreements under the 2005 Incentive Plan
The Committee also approved new form agreements for awards granted under the Company's 2005 Incentive Plan primarily to bring them into compliance with Section 409A. These forms include the form for time-based restricted stock awards, performance-based restricted stock awards, and both time and performance based restricted stock unit awards, attached hereto as Exhibit 10.3, 10.4, 10.5 and 10.6, respectively.

Such notice shall be deemed given as of the date of delivery or, if delivery is made by mail, as of the date shown on the postmark on the receipt for registration or certification.
Any notice or filing required or permitted to be given to a Participant under this Plan shall be sufficient if in writing and hand-delivered, or sent by mail, to the last known address of the Participant.
 
 
 
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has signed this Plan document this 9th day of December, 2008.
 
 

Exhibit 10.2
 
 
 
PerkinElmer, Inc. maintains the PerkinElmer, Inc. 2008 Supplemental Benefits Retirement Plan (the "Plan") to increase the overall effectiveness of the Company's executive compensation program; to attract, retain and motivate qualified senior executives; to provide retirement benefits more closely related to Total Compensation; and to soften the financial impact of early retirement for Participants. The Plan is intended to be "a plan which is unfunded and is maintained by an employer primarily for the purpose of providing deferred compensation for a select group of management or highly compensated employees" within the meaning of Sections 201(2), 301(a)(3) and 401(a)(1) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"), and shall be interpreted and administered in a manner consistent therewith.
This Plan is effective January 1, 2008, except that provisions implementing the requirements of section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as Amended (the "Code") are effective January 1, 2005. Benefits accrued and vested under the PerkinElmer, Inc. Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (the "Old SERP") as of December 31, 2004 and not materially modified thereafter (the "Grandfathered Benefits") will be administered under the terms of the Old SERP. This Plan replaces the Old SERP, which remains in existence solely to hold Grandfathered Benefits. Those benefits formerly governed by the terms and conditions of the Old SERP which are not Grandfathered Benefits and benefits accrued on or after January 1, 2005 are administered under and governed by this Plan. This Plan is intended to provide for deferred compensation that is subject to and compliant with the requirements of section 409A of the Code and the guidance issue pursuant thereto. The Plan shall be administered and interpreted to the extent possible in a manner consistent with that intent.
 
Whenever used herein, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise, the following words and phrases shall have the meanings herein specified, and the following definitions shall be equally applicable to both the singular and plural forms of any of the terms herein defined. The masculine pronoun whenever used herein shall include the feminine and neuter genders and the singular number as used herein shall include the plural, and the plural the singular, unless the context clearly indicates a different meaning.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If a Participant terminates his Employment and is rehired, the following rules shall apply in determining his Years of Service:
 
 
In no event shall a Participant be deemed to have more than one Year of Service with respect to any Year.
 
The Plan shall be administered by the Committee. The Committee shall have the authority to interpret the provisions of the Plan and decide all questions and settle all disputes which may arise in connection with the Plan, all in the sole exercise of its discretion. The Committee may establish operative and administrative rules and procedures in connection therewith, and may provide the delegation of day-to-day administration to the Company's Administrative Committee or Chief Administrative Officer, provided that such procedures are consistent with the requirements of Section 503 of ERISA. All interpretations, decisions and determinations made by the Committee or its delegate shall be final, conclusive and binding on all persons concerned. No member of the Committee who is a Participant may vote or otherwise participate in any decision or act with respect to a matter relating to himself or his beneficiaries. The Committee and the individual members thereof and its delegates shall be indemnified by the Company against any and all liabilities arising by reason of any act or failure to act made in good faith pursuant to the provisions of the Plan, including expenses reasonably incurred in the defense of any claim relating thereto.
 
 
The remaining Participants shall be those Executive Officers or other Employees who are both selected by the Committee and are "management" or "highly compensated" employees within the meaning of Sections 201(2), 301(a)(3) and 401(a)(1) of ERISA.

The benefit payable under the Plan, however, shall in no event be less than (c) above. No actuarial adjustment shall be made as the result of either retirement before or after age 65.
 
If a Participant dies while in the employ of the Company prior to attaining age 55, but after the completion of five (5) Years of Service, the Participant's benefit will be calculated on the date of the Participant's death; and the Participant's Eligible Spouse, if any, shall be entitled to receive an annual Plan Benefit in the form of a Surviving Spouse Option commencing on the day the Participant would have attained age 55, if still living.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
To the extent permitted by applicable law and notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, a Participant who acts in a manner prejudicial to the interests of the Company shall forfeit his rights to benefits under the Plan. A Participant shall be deemed to have acted in a manner prejudicial to the interests of the Company if, at any time within one (1) year after Termination of Employment, the Participant engages in any activity in competition with any business activity of the Company, or inimical, contrary or harmful to the interests of the Company, including, but not limited to:
 
 
 
 
 
 
If this Article 8, or any portion thereof, is held to be illegal, invalid, or unenforceable under present or future law, and not subject to reformation, then such provision shall be fully severable, and the remaining provisions of the Plan shall remain in full force and effect and shall not be affected by the severed provision or by its severance.
 
The Company intends the Plan to be permanent but reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan upon action of the Committee. Any amendment approved by the Committee must be in writing and be executed by an officer of the Company authorized to take such action. No amendment or termination shall directly or indirectly deprive any current or former Participant or beneficiary of all or any portion of any benefit payment which has commenced prior to the effective date of such amendment or termination or which could be payable if the Participant terminated employment for any reason, including death, immediately prior to the effective date such amendment or termination. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, in the event of Plan termination, vested benefits shall be distributed to Participants in lump sum payments as soon as permitted under Treas. Reg.  1.409A-3(j)(4)(ix).
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The costs of any such arbitration shall be borne equally by the Company and the claimant. Each party shall be responsible for its own legal expenses. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on all parties and judgment on the arbitrator's award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused the Plan to be executed by its duly authorized representative this 9th day of December, 2008.

5. This Agreement is subject to the provisions of the Plan, a copy of which is furnished to the Participant with this Agreement.
Provisions of the Plan
6.
Adjustments for Stock Splits, Stock Dividends, Etc.
(a) If from time to time during the term of this Agreement, there is any stock split-up, reverse stock split, stock dividend, stock distribution, recapitalization, combination of shares, reclassification of shares, spin-off or other similar change in capitalization event or other reclassification of the Common Stock of the Company, or any distribution to holders of Common Stock other than a normal cash dividend, then any and all new, substituted or additional securities to which the Participant is entitled by reason of his ownership of the Shares shall be immediately considered unvested to the extent that the Shares in respect of which such new, substituted or additional securities are received were unvested at the time of receipt of such new, substituted or additional securities, and shall be subject to the restrictions on transfer and other provisions of this Agreement to the same extent as such unvested Shares.
(b) If the Shares are converted into or exchanged for, or stockholders of the Company receive by reason of any distribution in total or partial liquidation, securities of another corporation, or other property (including cash), pursuant to any merger of the Company or acquisition of its assets, other than one that constitutes a Change in Control for the purposes of Section 2 of this Agreement, then the rights of the Company under this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of the Company's successor and this Agreement shall apply to the securities or other property received upon such conversion, exchange or distribution in the same manner and to the same extent as to the Shares.
7. .
Withholding Taxes; Section 83(b) Election
(a) The Participant acknowledges and agrees that the Company has the right to deduct from payments of any kind otherwise due to the Participant any federal, state or local taxes of any kind required by law to be withheld with respect to the vesting of the Shares.
(b) [The Participant will satisfy the tax withholding obligation due on each date on which Shares vest hereunder through the automatic forfeiture to the Company of Shares scheduled to vest on such date. Accordingly the Participant hereby instructs the Company to take whatever action is necessary or advisable such that, with no further action by the Participant, on date on which Shares vest hereunder, Shares are automatically forfeited to the Company on such date with a value equal to the Company's minimum statutory withholding obligations, based on the minimum statutory withholding rates for federal and state tax purposes, including payroll taxes, that result from the vesting of Shares on such date hereunder, with the value of one Share for such purpose being equal to the closing price of the Company's common stock on the trading day preceding the vesting date.]
(c) [As of the date hereof, the Participant is not aware of any material nonpublic information about the Company or its common stock. The Participant has entered into the commitments described in Section 7(b) in good faith and not as part of a plan or scheme to evade the prohibitions of Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. It is the intention of the Participant that Section 7(b) comply with the requirements of Rule 10b5-1(c)(1) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Section 7(b) shall be interpreted to comply with the requirements of such rule.]
 
(d) The Participant has reviewed with the Participant's own tax advisors the federal, state, local and foreign tax consequences of this investment and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Participant is relying solely on such advisors and not on any statements or representations of the Company or any of its agents. The Participant understands that the Participant (and not the Company) shall be responsible for the Participant's own tax liability that may arise as a result of this investment or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Participant understands that it may be beneficial in many circumstances to elect to be taxed at the time the Shares are granted rather than when and as the Shares vest by filing an election under Section 83(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 with the I.R.S. within 30 days from the date of grant.
THE PARTICIPANT ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT IS SOLELY THE PARTICIPANT'S RESPONSIBILITY AND NOT THE COMPANY'S TO FILE TIMELY THE ELECTION UNDER SECTION 83(b), EVEN IF THE PARTICIPANT REQUESTS THE COMPANY OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES TO MAKE THIS FILING ON THE PARTICIPANT'S BEHALF.
8. .
Miscellaneous
(a) . The Participant acknowledges and agrees that the vesting of the Shares pursuant to Section 2 hereof is earned only by continuing service as an employee at the will of the Company (not through the act of being hired or purchasing shares hereunder) and satisfying the other terms and conditions set forth in Section 2. The Participant further acknowledges and agrees that the transactions contemplated hereunder and the vesting schedule set forth herein do not constitute an express or implied promise of continued engagement as an employee or consultant for the vesting period, for any period, or at all.
No Rights to Employment
(b) . The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement, and each other provision of this Agreement shall be severable and enforceable to the extent permitted by law.
Severability

Waiver

Payment
(a) As soon as administratively practicable following the vesting date(s) of the Units pursuant to Section 2 above, but in no event later than the 15

day of the third month of the year following the calendar year in which the Units vest, the Company shall distribute to the Participant (or to the Participant's estate in the event of death) the Shares of Common Stock represented by Units that vested on such vesting date[, subject to reduction pursuant to Section 3(b)].
(b) [On each date on which Units vest hereunder, the Participant will satisfy the tax withholding obligation due on each date on which Units vest hereunder through the retention by the Company of Shares subject to units scheduled to vest on such date. Accordingly, the Participant hereby instructs the Company to take whatever action is necessary or advisable such that, with no further action by the Participant, on date on which Units vest hereunder, the Company deducts from the Shares of Common Stock that would otherwise be distributed to the participant pursuant to Section 3(a) with respect to such vesting of Units a number of Shares with a value equal to the Company's minimum statutory withholding obligations, based on the minimum statutory withholding rates for federal and state tax purposes, including payroll taxes, that result from the vesting of Units on such date hereunder, with the value of one Share for such purpose being equal to the closing price of the Company's common stock on the trading day preceding the vesting date.]
(c) [As of the date hereof, the Participant is not aware of any material nonpublic information about the Company or its common stock. The Participant has entered into the commitments described in Section 3(b) in good faith and not as part of a plan or scheme to evade the prohibitions of Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. It is the intention of the Participant that Section 3(b) comply with the requirements of Rule 10b5-1(c)(1) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Section 3(b) shall be interpreted to comply with the requirements of such rule.]
