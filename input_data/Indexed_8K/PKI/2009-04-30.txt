Exhibit 99.1
PerkinElmer Announces Financial Results for the First Quarter of 2009
Revenue of $432 million, representing flat organic revenue growth
Gross margin expands by 170 basis points
EPS from continuing operations of $0.13; Adjusted EPS of $0.26 exceeds guidance
WALTHAM, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 30, 2009--PerkinElmer, Inc. (NYSE: PKI), a global leader focused on improving the health and safety of people and the environment, today reported financial results for the first quarter ended April 5, 2009. The Company reported GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.13, down from the same period a year ago due primarily to a restructuring charge and a higher tax rate. On a non-GAAP basis, which includes the adjustments noted in the attached reconciliation, the Company announced adjusted earnings per share of $0.26, which exceeds the Companys prior guidance of $0.21-$0.23.
Organic revenue growth, which includes the adjustments noted in the attached reconciliation, was flat as compared to the first quarter of 2008. Revenue from continuing operations in the Human Health and Environmental Health segments decreased by 2% and 9% respectively as compared to the same period a year ago. Organic revenue in the Human Health segment was up by 3% and organic revenue in the Environmental Health segment was down by 3% as compared to the same period a year ago.
We are pleased to have started 2009 with better than expected results in both revenue and adjusted earnings per share, said Robert Friel, chairman and chief executive officer of PerkinElmer. Our increased focus on human and environmental health applications and our broad array of service offerings is enabling us to do relatively well despite the challenging economic environment.
GAAP operating profit from continuing operations for the first quarter of 2009 was $25.7 million, compared to $33.4 million for the same period a year ago. On a non-GAAP basis, which includes the adjustments noted in the attached reconciliation, adjusted operating profit for the first quarter of 2009 was $48.4 million as compared to $48.4 million in the first quarter of 2008, representing a 70 basis point expansion in adjusted operating profit margins.
GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations for the first quarter of 2009 was $0.13 as compared to $0.18 for the same period in 2008. On a non-GAAP basis, which includes the adjustments noted in the attached reconciliation, adjusted earnings per share for the first quarter of 2009 was $0.26, which was flat as compared to $0.26 in the first quarter of 2008.
For the first quarter of 2009, operating cash flow from continuing operations was $18.8 million as compared to $24.9 million from the same period one year ago. In the first quarter of 2009, the Company reduced the amount drawn under an accounts receivable securitization facility by $10.0 million, resulting in an unfavorable impact to operating cash flow. On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes the reduction in the amount outstanding under this facility, the adjusted operating cash flow was $28.8 million in the first quarter of 2009 representing a 16% increase from the same period a year ago.
Financial Overview by Reporting Segment
reported revenue of $177.3 million for the first quarter of 2009. The segments GAAP operating profit for the first quarter of 2009 was $12.7 million, compared to $11.8 million for the same period a year ago.

Environmental Health
Financial Guidance
While several of our end markets appear to be stabilizing, we believe there continues to be risk in the global economy. Therefore, despite our strong first quarter financial performance, we feel it prudent, at this time, to keep our full year revenue and adjusted earnings guidance unchanged, said Friel.
In January of 2009, the Company forecasted for the full year 2009 organic revenue growth relative to 2008 to be flat to down mid-single digits. The Company forecasted 2009 earnings per share relative to 2008 to be down mid-single digits to mid-teens on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, which includes the impact of stock option expense in both periods.

Organic Revenue and Organic Revenue Growth
We use the term organic revenue to refer to GAAP revenue, excluding the effect of foreign currency translation and acquisitions. We use the related term organic revenue growth to refer to the measure of comparing current period organic revenue with the corresponding period of the prior year. We believe that these non-GAAP measures, when taken together with our GAAP financial measures, allow us and our investors to better measure the performance of our investments in technology, to evaluate the long-term performance trends and to assess our ability to invest in the business. Organic revenue growth also provides for easier comparisons of our performance with prior and future periods and relative comparisons to our peers. We exclude the effect of foreign currency translation from these measures because foreign currency translation is subject to volatility and can obscure underlying trends. We exclude the effect of acquisitions because acquisition activity can vary dramatically between reporting periods and between us and our peers, which we believe makes comparisons of long-term performance trends difficult for management and investors, and could result in overstating or understating to our investors the performance of our operations.
Adjusted Gross Margin and Adjusted Gross Margin Percentage
We use the term adjusted gross margin to refer to GAAP gross margin, excluding amortization of intangible assets and inventory fair value adjustments related to business acquisitions, and including estimated revenue from contracts acquired in the acquisition of ViaCell, Inc., or ViaCell, that will not be fully recognized due to business combination accounting rules. We use the related term adjusted gross margin percentage to refer to adjusted gross margin as a percentage of GAAP revenue. We believe that these non-GAAP measures, when taken together with our GAAP financial measures, allow us and our investors to better measure the performance of our investments in technology, to evaluate the long-term profitability trends and to assess our ability to invest in the business. We exclude amortization of intangible assets from these measures because intangibles amortization charges do not represent what our management and what we believe our investors consider to be costs of producing our products and could distort the additional value generated over the cost of producing those products. Inventory fair value adjustments related to business acquisitions also do not represent what our management and what we believe our investors consider to be costs used in producing our products. We include estimated revenue from contracts acquired in the ViaCell acquisition that will not be fully recognized because our GAAP revenue for the periods subsequent to our acquisition do not reflect the full amount of storage revenue on these contracts that would have otherwise been recorded by ViaCell. The non-GAAP adjustment is intended to reflect the full amount of such revenue. Our management and we believe our investors will use this adjustment as a measure of the ongoing performance of the ViaCell business because customers have historically renewed these contracts, although there can be no assurance that customers will do so in the future.
Adjusted Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) Expense and Adjusted SG&A Percentage
We use the term adjusted SG&A expense to refer to GAAP SG&A expense, excluding amortization of intangible assets, and contingent consideration and other costs related to business acquisitions. We use the related term adjusted SG&A percentage to refer to adjusted SG&A expense as a percentage of GAAP revenue. We believe that these non-GAAP measures, when taken together with our GAAP financial measures, allow us and our investors to better measure the cost of the internal operating structure, our ability to leverage that structure and the level of investment required to grow our business. We exclude amortization of intangible assets and contingent consideration and other costs related to business acquisitions from these measures because intangibles amortization charges and contingent consideration and other costs related to business acquisitions do not represent what our management and what we believe our investors consider to be costs that support our internal operating structure and could distort the efficiencies of that structure.
Adjusted Research and Development (R&D) Expense and Adjusted R&D Percentage
We use the term adjusted R&D expense to refer to GAAP R&D expense, excluding amortization of intangible assets. We use the related term adjusted R&D percentage to refer to adjusted R&D expense as a percentage of GAAP revenue. We believe that these non-GAAP measures, when taken together with our GAAP financial measures, allow us and our investors to better understand and evaluate our internal technology investments. We exclude amortization of intangible assets from these measures because intangibles amortization charges do not represent what our management and what we believe our investors consider to be internal investments in R&D activities and could distort our R&D investment level.
Adjusted Operating Profit and Adjusted Operating Profit Margin
We use the term adjusted operating profit to refer to GAAP operating profit, excluding amortization of intangible assets, inventory fair value adjustments related to business acquisitions, contingent consideration and other costs related to business acquisitions, and restructuring charges, and including estimated revenue from contracts acquired in the ViaCell acquisition that will not be fully recognized due to business combination accounting rules. Adjusted operating profit is calculated by subtracting adjusted R&D expense, adjusted SG&A expense, and restructuring charges from adjusted gross margin. We use the related term adjusted operating profit margin to refer to adjusted operating profit as a percentage of GAAP revenue. We believe that these non-GAAP measures, when taken together with our GAAP financial measures, allow us and our investors to analyze the costs of the different components of producing and selling our products, to better measure the performance of our internal investments in technology and to evaluate the long-term profitability trends of our core operations. Adjusted operating profit also provides for easier comparisons of our performance and profitability with prior and future periods and relative comparisons to our peers. We believe our investors do not consider the items that we exclude from adjusted operating profit to be costs of producing our products, investments in technology and production, and costs to support our internal operating structure, and so we present this non-GAAP measure to avoid overstating or understating to our investors the performance of our operations. We exclude restructuring charges because they tend to occur due to an acquisition, divestiture, repositioning of the business or other unusual event that could distort the performance measures of our internal investments and costs to support our internal operating structure. We include estimated revenue from contracts acquired in the ViaCell acquisition that will not be fully recognized because our GAAP revenue for the periods subsequent to our acquisition do not reflect the full amount of storage revenue on these contracts that would have otherwise been recorded by ViaCell. The non-GAAP adjustment is intended to reflect the full amount of such revenue. Our management and we believe our investors will use this adjustment as a measure of the ongoing performance of the ViaCell business because customers have historically renewed these contracts, although there can be no assurance that customers will do so in the future.
Adjusted Earnings per Share
We use the term adjusted earnings per share, or adjusted EPS, to refer to GAAP earnings per share, excluding discontinued operations, amortization of intangible assets, inventory fair value adjustments related to business acquisitions, contingent consideration and other costs related to business acquisitions, and restructuring charges, and including estimated revenue from contracts acquired in the ViaCell acquisition that will not be fully recognized due to business combination accounting rules. Adjusted earnings per share is calculated by subtracting adjusted R&D expense, adjusted SG&A expense, restructuring charges, other income/expense and provision for taxes from adjusted gross margin. We believe that this non-GAAP measure, when taken together with our GAAP financial measures, allows us and our investors to analyze the costs of producing and selling our products and the performance of our internal investments in technology and our internal operating structure, to evaluate the long-term profitability trends of our core operations and to calculate the underlying value of the core business on a dilutive share basis, which is a key measure of the value of the Company used by our management and we believe used by investors as well. Adjusted earnings per share also facilitates the overall analysis of the value of the Company and the core measure of the success of our operating business model as compared to prior and future periods and relative comparisons to our peers. We exclude discontinued operations, amortization of intangible assets, inventory fair value adjustments related to business acquisitions, contingent consideration and other costs related to business acquisitions, and restructuring charges as these items do not represent what our management and what we believe our investors consider to be costs of producing our products, investments in technology and production, and costs to support our internal operating structure, which could result in overstating or understating to our investors the performance of our operations. We include estimated revenue from contracts acquired in the ViaCell acquisition that will not be fully recognized because our GAAP revenue for the periods subsequent to our acquisition do not reflect the full amount of storage revenue on these contracts that would have otherwise been recorded by ViaCell. The non-GAAP adjustment is intended to reflect the full amount of such revenue. Our management and we believe our investors will use this adjustment as a measure of the ongoing performance of the ViaCell business because customers have historically renewed these contracts, although there can be no assurance that customers will do so in the future.
Adjusted Operating Cash Flow
We use the term adjusted operating cash flow to refer to GAAP operating cash flow from continuing operations, excluding the effect of changes in our accounts receivable securitization facility. We believe that this non-GAAP measure, when taken together with our GAAP financial measure, allows us and our investors to better evaluate the long-term performance trends and to assess our ability to invest in the business. Adjusted operating cash flow also provides for easier comparisons of our performance with prior and future periods and relative comparisons to our peers. We exclude the effect of changes in our accounts receivable securitization facility from this measure because changes in our accounts receivable securitization facility can vary dramatically by quarter and between us and our peers and can obscure underlying trends, which we believe makes comparisons of long-term performance trends difficult for management and investors, and could result in overstating or understating to our investors the performance of our operations.
* * * *
The non-GAAP financial measures described above are not meant to be considered superior to, or a substitute for, our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. There are material limitations associated with non-GAAP financial measures because they exclude charges that have an effect on our reported results and, therefore, should not be relied upon as the sole financial measures to evaluate our financial results. Management compensates and believes that investors should compensate for these limitations by viewing the non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures. In addition, the non-GAAP financial measures included in this earnings announcement may be different from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similar measures used by other companies.
Each of the non-GAAP financial measures listed above are also used by our management to evaluate our operating performance, communicate our financial results to our Board of Directors, benchmark our results against our historical performance and the performance of our peers, evaluate investment opportunities including acquisitions and discontinued operations, and determine the bonus payments for senior management and employees.
