Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.
In light of media reports that contain speculation that PerkinElmer has decided to put itself up for sale, PerkinElmer is clarifying that such speculation is inaccurate. A sale of the Company is not being discussed, and such a transaction is not in PerkinElmer's current strategic plans.
The Company remains committed to growing its business while leveraging the strong foundation that it has already built to achieve future growth.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
