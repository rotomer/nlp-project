On December 16, 2011, PerkinElmer, Inc. ("PerkinElmer") entered into a second amended and restated unsecured revolving credit facility (the "Credit Agreement") with PerkinElmer, Wallac Oy, and PerkinElmer Health Sciences, Inc. as Borrowers, Bank of America, N.A. acting as Administrative Agent, Swing Line Lender and L/C Issuer, and other lenders party thereto. Barclays Capital acted as Syndication Agent, and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and Barclays Capital acted as Joint Lead Arrangers and Joint Book Managers. The Credit Agreement provides for a $700 million committed unsecured revolving credit facility through December 16, 2016.
This Credit Agreement amends and restates in its entirety the amended and restated unsecured revolving credit agreement (the "Prior Credit Agreement") dated as of August 13, 2007, as amended, among PerkinElmer and Wallac Oy as Borrowers, Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent, Swing Line Lender and L/C Issuer, and the other lenders from time to time party thereto. The Prior Credit Agreement provided for a $500 million unsecured revolving credit facility through the fifth anniversary of the closing date.
Borrowings made pursuant to the Credit Agreement will bear interest, payable quarterly or, if earlier, at the end of any interest period, at either (a) the base rate, as described in the Credit Agreement, or (b) the Eurocurrency rate (a publicly published rate), in each case plus a percentage spread based on PerkinElmer's credit rating.
The Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants for credit facilities of this type, including, among others, limitations on PerkinElmer and its subsidiaries with respect to liens, investments, incurrence of indebtedness, disposition of assets, mergers and acquisitions, dividends and distributions, and transactions with affiliates. The Credit Agreement contains a debt-to-capitalization ratio covenant applicable so long as PerkinElmer's debt is rated investment grade (as defined in the Credit Agreement). This covenant is replaced by leverage ratio and interest coverage ratio covenants under certain circumstances. The Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default (with customary grace periods, as applicable). PerkinElmer may use the proceeds of borrowings under the Credit Agreement for working capital, capital expenditures, permitted repurchases of equity and dividends and distributions, permitted acquisitions and other general corporate purposes.
PerkinElmer has from time to time had banking relationships with the parties to the Prior Credit Agreement and the Credit Agreement.
The foregoing description of the Credit Agreement and related matters is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Credit Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.
 
On December 16, 2011, the Prior Credit Agreement was amended and restated in its entirety by a committed unsecured revolving credit facility. The information reported under Item 1.01 "Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement" above is incorporated herein by reference.
 
 
See Exhibit Index attached hereto.

Status of Lenders
 
copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Company or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that a Borrower is resident for tax purposes in the United States (A) any Lender that is a "United States person" within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code shall deliver to the Company or the Administrative Agent executed originals of Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 or such other documentation or information prescribed by applicable Laws or reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements; and (B) any Foreign Lender shall deliver to Company and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the request of the Company or the Administrative Agent, but only if such Foreign Lender is legally entitled to do so), whichever of the following is applicable:

If a payment made to a Foreign Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Foreign Lender were to fail
 
to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Foreign Lender shall provide, promptly upon the reasonable demand of the Company or the Administrative Agent, any information, form or document, accurately completed and in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the requesting party, that may be required or reasonably requested in order to allow the requesting party to comply with its obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Foreign Lender has complied with such Lender's obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment.

Without limiting the obligations of the Lenders set forth above regarding delivery of certain forms and documents to establish each Lender's status for U.S. withholding tax purposes, each Lender agrees promptly to deliver to the Administrative Agent or the Company, as the Administrative Agent or the Company shall reasonably request, on or prior to the Closing Date, and in a timely fashion thereafter, such other documents and forms required by any relevant taxing authorities or under the Laws of any other jurisdiction, duly executed and completed by such Lender, as are required under such Laws to confirm such Lender's entitlement to any available exemption from, or reduction of, applicable withholding taxes in respect of all payments to be made to such Lender by the Borrowers pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise to establish such Lender's status for withholding tax purposes in such other jurisdiction. Each Lender shall promptly (i) notify the Company and the Administrative Agent of any change in circumstances which would modify or render invalid any such claimed exemption or reduction, and (ii) take such steps as shall not be materially disadvantageous to it, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, and as may be reasonably necessary (including the re-designation of its Lending Office) to avoid any requirement of applicable Laws of any such jurisdiction that any Borrower or the Administrative Agent make any deduction or withholding for taxes from amounts payable to such Lender. Additionally, each of the Borrowers shall promptly deliver to the Administrative Agent or any Lender, as the Administrative Agent or such Lender shall reasonably request, on or prior to the Closing Date, and in a timely fashion thereafter, such documents and forms required by any relevant taxing authorities under the Laws of any jurisdiction, duly executed and completed by such Borrower, as are required to be furnished by such Lender or the Administrative Agent under such Laws in connection with any payment by the Administrative Agent or any Lender of Taxes or Other Taxes, or otherwise in connection with the Loan Documents, with respect to such jurisdiction.
In addition, each Lender, as of the date it becomes a Lender hereunder will designate lending offices for the Loans to be made by it such that, on such date, it will not be liable for (i) in the case of a loan made to a Borrower organized under the laws of the United States of America, any state thereof or the District of Columbia, any withholding tax that is imposed by the United States of America on payments by the Borrower from an office within such jurisdiction and (ii) in the case of a Borrower organized under the laws of Finland, any withholding tax that is imposed by Finland (or any political subdivision thereof) on payments by the Borrower from an office within such jurisdiction.
(f) . If the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the L/C Issuer determines, in its sole discretion, that it has received a refund of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by any Borrower or with respect to which any
Treatment of Certain Refunds

Thereafter, the obligation of the Lenders to make or
Inability to Determine Rates
 
maintain Eurocurrency Rate Loans in the affected currency or currencies shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent (upon the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, the Company may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Loans in the affected currency or currencies or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Committed Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein.

(iv) impose on any Lender or the L/C Issuer or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense affecting this Agreement or Eurocurrency Rate Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein;
and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining any Eurocurrency Rate Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan), or to increase the cost to such Lender or the L/C Issuer of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit (or of maintaining its obligation to participate in or to issue any Letter of Credit), or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or the L/C Issuer hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon request of such Lender or the L/C Issuer, the Company will pay (or cause the applicable Designated Borrower to pay) to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.

Certificates for Reimbursement
(d) . Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or the L/C Issuer to demand compensation pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's or the L/C Issuer's right to demand such compensation, that no Borrower shall be required to compensate a Lender or the L/C Issuer pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than six months prior to the date that such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, notifies the Company of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender's or the L/C Issuer's intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the six-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof).

Enzo Biochem, Inc. and Enzo Life Sciences, Inc. (collectively, "Enzo") filed a complaint dated October 23, 2002 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, Civil Action No. 02-8448, against Amersham plc, Amersham BioSciences, PerkinElmer, Inc., PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Inc., Sigma-Aldrich Corporation, Sigma Chemical Company, Inc., Molecular Probes, Inc., and Orchid BioSciences, Inc. (the "New York Case"). The complaint alleges that we have breached our distributorship and settlement agreements with Enzo, infringed Enzo's patents, engaged in unfair competition and fraud, and committed torts against Enzo by, among other things, engaging in commercial development and exploitation of Enzo's patented products and technology, separately and together with the other defendants. Enzo seeks injunctive and monetary relief. In 2003, the court severed the lawsuit and ordered Enzo to serve individual complaints against the five defendants. We subsequently filed an answer and a counterclaim alleging that Enzo's patents are invalid. In July 2006, the court issued a decision regarding the construction of the claims in Enzo's patents that effectively limited the coverage of certain of those claims and, we believe, excludes certain of our products from the coverage of Enzo's patents. Summary judgment motions were filed by the defendants in January 2007, and a hearing with oral argument on those motions took place in July 2007. In January 2009, the case was assigned to a new district court judge and in March 2009, the new judge denied the pending summary judgment motions without prejudice and ordered a stay of the case until the federal appellate court decides Enzo's appeal of the judgment of the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut in Enzo Biochem vs. Applera Corp. and Tropix, Inc. (the "Connecticut Case"), which involves a number of the same patents and which could materially affect the scope of Enzo's case against us. On March 26, 2010, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed-in-part and reversed-in-part the judgment in the Connecticut Case. The New York Case against us and other defendants remains stayed except that the district court has permitted us and the other defendants to jointly file a motion for summary judgment on certain patent and other issues common to all of the defendants.
