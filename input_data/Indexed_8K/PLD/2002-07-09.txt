ITEM 5 OTHER EVENTS.
On July 8, 2002, AMB Property Corporation announced second quarter 2002 results as follows:
Earnings per share were $0.31 for the quarter, reflecting a 6.1% decrease over the same period in 2001. The Company's industrial portfolio continued to outperform the national industrial market in that AMB's industrial assets, located predominantly in infill submarkets of major hub and gateway distribution markets, were 94.4% leased as of June 30, 2002, unchanged from the prior quarter end. The Company also began expensing stock options on its income statement rather than the typical disclosure in the footnotes to financial statements.
Performance & Operating Highlights
AMB reported earnings per share (EPS) for the second quarter of $0.31, which included $0.03 per share of gains on dispositions of real estate. Second quarter 2002 EPS reflects a 6.1% decrease from second quarter 2001 EPS of $0.33, which included $0.02 per share of net gains from real estate dispositions and non-cash charges for impairment reserves for the Company's private equity investments which were fully written off in 2001. EPS for the first half of 2002 was $0.65, including $0.03 per share of gains on dispositions of real estate, reflecting a 20.7% decrease over EPS for the first half of 2001 of $0.82, which included $0.16 per share of net gains.
Industrial occupancy remained unchanged from the end of the first quarter at 94.4%, down 10 bps from year-end 2001 and down 140 bps from second quarter 2001. The Company grew same store cash basis net operating income by 1.0%, slightly below expectations, while same store GAAP basis net operating income was down 0.5%. The primary drivers of the decrease in 2002 earnings from 2001 earnings were: lower net gains, slightly lower same store GAAP net operating income and net disposition activity over the last six quarters as a result of the Company's focus on long term results. Tenant retention for the quarter was 75.1%, while rents on renewals and rollovers declined by 0.4% as the Company continued to focus on occupancy.
Investment Activity
Acquisitions during the quarter totaled five transactions with an aggregate value of $121.9 million and 2.0 million square feet. The Company expanded its on-tarmac presence with the purchase of the leasehold interest in a 285,000 square foot air cargo distribution center at Washington Dulles International Airport for a total acquisition price of $41.9 million. The facility, with over 500,000 square feet of aircraft ramp, is leased to FedEx, United Airlines, Air France and Lufthansa.
AMB and Mexico-based Strategic Alliance Partner  G. Accion jointly closed their first investment during the second quarter to develop a distribution center for the Mexico operations of a major, international consumer products company. AMB's first

international project, scheduled for completion in December 2002, is located in the San Martin Obispo Industrial Park within the Cuautitlan submarket of Mexico City.
AMB completed and stabilized three industrial development projects during the quarter, totaling 343,000 square feet for a total estimated investment of $15.8 million. The industrial development and renovation pipeline currently stands at $163.6 million and consists of 3.5 million square feet, of which $102.3 million, or 63%, has been funded and 69% is preleased.
During the quarter, the Company sold one industrial building totaling 484,000 square feet for a price of $12.1 million. In addition, the Company sold $76.9 million of industrial assets, totaling 1.9 million square feet, to the AMB-SGP joint venture, the Company's co-investment partnership with an affiliate of GIC Real Estate, the real estate investment subsidiary of the Government of Singapore.
Accounting for Stock Options
During the quarter, AMB began expensing the fair value of options granted under the Company's stock option plan. The Company will record the expense over the option vesting period, using the fair value at the date of grant. The accounting treatment has been adopted on a prospective basis and is applied to all options granted on January 1, 2002 or later.
Governance
Daniel H. Case III, Chairman of JP Morgan H&Q and an AMB Director, passed away on Wednesday, June 26, 2002 after a 15-month battle with brain cancer. AMB recognizes with gratitude Mr. Case's contributions as a member of AMB's Board of Directors since the Company's IPO in 1997. The Board will seek to fill his position with an independent director of equal knowledge, insight and enthusiasm but does not expect to find this person easily or quickly.
Supplemental Reporting Measure
AMB reported second quarter 2002 Funds from Operations (FFO) of $0.60 per share, representing a 39.5% increase over second quarter 2001 FFO of $0.43 per share, which included non-cash charges for impairment reserves of $0.18 per share. FFO per share for the first half of 2002 was $1.21, up 21.0% from the first half of 2001 of $1.00, which included non-cash charges of $0.23 per share.
