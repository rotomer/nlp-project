ITEM 5 OTHER EVENTS.
On April 7, 2003, AMB Property Corporation announced first quarter 2003 results as follows:
AMB Property Corporation today reported first quarter 2003 earnings per share (EPS) of $0.69, 109% above EPS of $0.33 for the same period in 2002 and above the company's guidance of $0.60 to $0.65 per share for the quarter. EPS during the quarter was positively impacted by gains from dispositions and net lease termination fees of $0.45 and $0.08 per share, respectively. Occupancy in the company's industrial operating portfolio was 92.5% at the quarter's end, down 210 basis points from 2002 year-end results. Same store cash net operating income increased 3.8% in the quarter.
Investment Activity
During the quarter, AMB acquired with its partner, Codina Group, 438 acres of land for development in Miami's Airport West submarket for $29.7 million. The master planned park, called Beacon Lakes, represents the last large developable land parcel within Airport West. The site is fully entitled for 6.8 million square feet of properties for lease or sale. During the quarter, AMB and Codina began development of the first two buildings at Beacon Lakes; together, the buildings will comprise approximately 389,000 square feet. The two new distribution facilities are expected to stabilize in the first half of 2005 at an estimated investment of $20.3 million.
Other investment activity in the quarter included the acquisition of two industrial buildings for a total of $10.9 million, comprising 238,300 square feet. In addition, the company stabilized two buildings in Southern California with a total investment of $12.6 million aggregating 160,900 square feet. New development starts, totaling $36.4 million, include the two Beacon Lakes buildings as well as two additional projects scheduled for completion in the fall of 2004. AMB's committed industrial development and renovation pipeline through 2005 currently stands at $132.8 million and consists of 2.2 million square feet, of which 48% has been funded and 22% has been preleased.
Dispositions in the quarter totaled $220.9 million, representing both direct sales and contributions of assets, resulting in net gains of $37.1 million. The company sold $127.0 million in assets, totaling 1.6 million square feet which include both opportunistic sales and sales of assets that no longer fit our investment strategy. Contributions in the quarter consisted of a portfolio of 24 buildings, valued at $94.0 million, to a joint venture with an affiliate of Citigroup Alternative Investments. AMB will maintain a 15% ownership interest in the joint venture, called Industrial Fund I. Unlike AMB's other co-investment joint ventures, this fund is unconsolidated and is structured for a five-year term with opportunistic dispositions intended before or at the end of the term.
Advancing the company's international expansion, AMB has entered into a letter of intent to form a joint venture with Tokyo-based industrial property specialists, BlackPine. The joint venture, AMB BlackPine, will focus on development, acquisition and operation of distribution facilities serving logistics and airfreight customers in greater Tokyo. Tokyo

is one of the world's largest industrial real estate markets; its airport, Narita International, consistently ranks as one of the busiest in the world for international air cargo volume.
AMB's private capital activity in the quarter consisted of an approximate $43 million equity commitment from Mn Services, one of the largest pension fund managers in the Netherlands. AMB's planned co-investment contributions and expected debt financings will result in a partnership with an estimated $200 million in purchasing power for investments in distribution facilities within targeted U.S. hub and gateway markets. AMB will contribute 38% of the equity and will receive compensation consistent with its existing private capital partnerships.
Common Stock Repurchases and Dividend Activity
During the quarter, AMB repurchased a total of 787,800 shares of its common stock for a total investment of $20.6 million, at a weighted average price of $26.10 per share. Currently, $110.0 million of capacity remains under the company's repurchase plan. Since AMB's IPO in 1997, the company has repurchased a total of 6.2 million shares at a weighted average price of $24.03 per share.
AMB increased its regular cash dividend for the quarter ending March 31, 2003 to $0.415 per common share. The new rate reflects an annualized dividend of $1.66 per share and reflects an increase of 1.2% over the 2002 annual dividend of $1.64 per common share. The company expects its dividend once again in 2003 to be comprised of income from operations and gains on sales of property and does not expect a return of capital component to the dividend.

Exhibit 99.1
     SAN FRANCISCO, April 7 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/  AMB Property Corporation (NYSE: AMB), a leading owner and operator of industrial real estate, today reported first quarter 2003 earnings per share (EPS) of $0.69, 109% above EPS of $0.33 for the same period in 2002 and above the company's guidance of $0.60 to $0.65 per share for the quarter. EPS during the quarter was positively impacted by gains from dispositions and net lease termination fees of $0.45 and $0.08 per share, respectively. Occupancy in the company's industrial operating portfolio was 92.5% at the quarter's end, down 210 basis points from 2002 year-end results. Same store cash net operating income increased 3.8% in the quarter.
     Chairman and CEO Hamid R. Moghadam noted, "Our first quarter occupancy decline was consistent with our expectations and prior guidance. At current levels, AMB's portfolio occupancy exceeds preliminary data for national industrial occupancy by more than 350 basis points. Our view of the first quarter operating environment reflects static conditions, with fundamentals neither improving nor weakening significantly. However, we believe the overall economic outlook has deteriorated in the last month, as the benefits of monetary and fiscal policy and lean inventories are currently more than offset by geopolitical uncertainty and weak levels of capital spending and manufacturing output."
     
Investment Activity
     During the quarter, AMB acquired with its partner, Codina Group, 438 acres of land for development in Miami's Airport West submarket for $29.7 million. The master planned park, called Beacon Lakes, represents the last large developable land parcel within Airport West. The site is fully entitled for 6.8 million square feet of properties for lease or sale. During the quarter, AMB and Codina began development of the first two buildings at Beacon Lakes; together, the buildings will comprise approximately 389,000 square feet. The two new distribution facilities are expected to stabilize in the first half of 2005 at an estimated investment of $20.3 million.
     Other investment activity in the quarter included the acquisition of two industrial buildings for a total of $10.9 million, comprising 238,300 square feet. In addition, the company stabilized two buildings in Southern California with a total investment of $12.6 million aggregating 160,900 square feet. New development starts, totaling $36.4 million, include the two Beacon Lakes buildings as well as two additional projects scheduled for completion in the fall of 2004. AMB's committed industrial development and renovation pipeline through 2005 currently stands at $132.8 million and consists of 2.2 million square feet, of which 48% has been funded and 22% has been preleased.
 
     W. Blake Baird, AMB's president, said, "Buyer interest for industrial assets remains strong and, in our view, has strengthened since year end. We are using this environment to advance our capital allocation plan through strategic asset sales and, in fact, we significantly exceeded our expectations for net sales volume and profitability in the quarter. While sales in the quarter resulted in both significant gains and reinvestment capacity, they also create near-term earnings dilution. We believe this sacrifice will be rewarded with superior long-term total return through anticipated redeployment into targeted U.S. and international markets and possible share repurchases."
     Dispositions in the quarter totaled $220.9 million, representing both direct sales and contributions of assets, resulting in net gains of $37.1 million. The company sold $127.0 million in assets, totaling 1.6 million square feet which include both opportunistic sales and sales of assets that no longer fit our investment strategy. Contributions in the quarter consisted of a portfolio of 24 buildings, valued at $94.0 million, to a joint venture with an affiliate of Citigroup Alternative Investments. AMB will maintain a 15% ownership interest in the joint venture, called Industrial Fund I. Unlike AMB's other co-investment joint ventures, this fund is unconsolidated and is structured for a five-year term with opportunistic dispositions intended before or at the end of the term.
     "In addition to strategic sales in our domestic markets," said Baird, "dispositions in the quarter included the successful completion of our first international investment lifecycle. With our partner, G. Accion, we completed development in Mexico City of a 787,000-square foot distribution center for a multinational consumer products company, allowing them to consolidate a large supply-chain network into a single location. Following the on-time, on-budget delivery in December 2002, our customer exercised a purchase option, resulting in a net profit to AMB of approximately $5.0 million. On the one-year anniversary of the announcement of our international expansion, this gain demonstrates the successful portability of our alliance-based business model."
     Advancing the company's international expansion, AMB has entered into a letter of intent to form a joint venture with Tokyo-based industrial property specialists, BlackPine. The joint venture, AMB BlackPine, will focus on development, acquisition and operation of distribution facilities serving logistics and airfreight customers in greater Tokyo. Tokyo is one of the world's largest industrial real estate markets; its airport, Narita International, consistently ranks as one of the busiest in the world for international air cargo volume.
     AMB's chief investment officer, Guy F. Jaquier, commented, "Our new partners have a proven track record in the acquisition and development of industrial property in our Tokyo target market. Together we will provide AMB's global customers with critical distribution facilities as Japan continues to optimize the efficiency of its supply chain."
     AMB's private capital activity in the quarter consisted of an approximate $43 million equity commitment from Mn Services, one of the largest pension fund managers in the Netherlands. AMB's planned co-investment contributions and expected debt financings
 
will result in a partnership with an estimated $200 million in purchasing power for investments in distribution facilities within targeted U.S. hub and gateway markets. AMB will contribute 38% of the equity and will receive compensation consistent with its existing private capital partnerships.
     John T. Roberts Jr., president, AMB Capital Partners, commented, "Our longstanding strategic commitment to private capital, in the form of separate accounts and commingled funds, allows us to deploy capital for our partners in alignment with our equity and strategic interests, expand our operating platform and improve our return on invested capital. We are pleased to welcome Mn Services, a well-respected European fund advisor, as a new investment partner."
     
Common Stock Repurchases and Dividend Activity
     During the quarter, AMB repurchased a total of 787,800 shares of its common stock for a total investment of $20.6 million, at a weighted average price of $26.10 per share. Currently, $110.0 million of capacity remains under the company's repurchase plan. Since AMB's IPO in 1997, the company has repurchased a total of 6.2 million shares at a weighted average price of $24.03 per share.
     AMB increased its regular cash dividend for the quarter ending March 31, 2003 to $0.415 per common share. The new rate reflects an annualized dividend of $1.66 per share and reflects an increase of 1.2% over the 2002 annual dividend of $1.64 per common share. The company expects its dividend once again in 2003 to be comprised of income from operations and gains on sales of property and does not expect a return of capital component to the dividend.
     
Supplemental Reporting Measure
     AMB reports funds from operations per fully diluted share and unit (FFO) in accordance with the standards established by NAREIT as a supplemental earnings measure. AMB reported first quarter 2003 FFO of $0.59, representing a 3.3% decrease from first quarter 2002 FFO of $0.61. First quarter 2002 FFO has been adjusted downward by $0.01 to reflect the adoption of SFAS No. 123, accounting for stock options, and SFAS No. 145, accounting for extraordinary items, in the second and fourth quarters of 2002, respectively; these accounting measures required retroactive adoption to the beginning of 2002. First quarter 2003 FFO was above the company's guidance of $0.50 to $0.51 per share and was positively impacted by $0.08 per share of net lease termination fees and does not include gains from dispositions of real estate held for investment. A reconciliation from net income to funds from operations is published in our quarterly supplemental analyst package and is available on AMB's website at www.amb.com.
