Item 5. Other Events.
     On June 18, 2003, we executed an underwriting agreement in connection with the public offering of 2,000,000 shares of our 6 1/2% Series L Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, at a price of $25.00 per share, under our shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-68283), and pursuant to the terms set forth in a prospectus dated December 17, 1998, as supplemented by a prospectus supplement dated June 18, 2003. We expect the transaction to close on June 23, 2003. In the underwriting agreement, we also granted the underwriters an over-allotment option to purchase up to an additional 300,000 shares of the series L preferred stock.
     Dividends on the series L preferred stock will be payable quarterly in arrears on the 15th day of January, April, July and October of each year, commencing on July 15, 2003 (or, if any such date is not a business day, on the next succeeding business day). Except in limited circumstances to preserve our status as a real estate investment trust, we may not redeem the series L preferred stock until June 23, 2008. On or after that date, we may redeem the series L preferred stock in whole or in part, for cash at a redemption price of $25.00 per share, plus all accumulated and unpaid dividends on such series L preferred stock. The series L preferred stock will have no stated maturity, will not be subject to any sinking find or mandatory redemption and will not convertible into any other securities. Application has been made to list the Series L Preferred on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "AMB  PrL". For additional information concerning these securities, please refer to the exhibits attached to this report.
     We expect to receive net proceeds from this offering of approximately $47,975,000 (exclusive of the over-allotment option) after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated transaction expenses payable by us. We will contribute the net proceeds to AMB Property, L.P., our operating partnership, and, in exchange, the operating partnership will issue to us 6 1/2% Series L Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units. We intend for the operating partnership to use the proceeds, in addition to some or all of the proceeds we previously contributed to the operating partnership from other equity issuances subsequent to the issuance of our series A preferred stock, to redeem its 8 1/2% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units, held by us. In turn, we intend to use those funds to pay all or a portion of the redemption price of our 81/2% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, at $25.00 per share; and we will pay accumulated and unpaid dividends on such shares to the redemption date. Any additional or remaining proceeds will be used by the operating partnership for general corporate purposes.
     On June 18, 2003, we issued a press release regarding the pricing of the series L preferred, which is attached to this report as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated by reference into this report.

Forward Looking Statements
     Some of the information included in this report contains forward-looking statements, such as statements pertaining to earnings and results of operations and future plans, including anticipated closings and transactions. Forward-looking statements involve numerous risks and uncertainties and you should not rely on them as predictions of future events. The events or circumstances reflected in forward-looking statements might not occur. You can identify forward-looking statements by the use of forward-looking terminology such as "believes," "expects," "may," "will," "should," "seeks," "approximately," "intends," "plans," "pro forma," "estimates" or "anticipates" or the negative of these words and phrases or similar words or phrases. You can also identify forward-looking statements by discussions of strategy, plans or intentions. Forward-looking statements are necessarily dependent on assumptions, data or methods that may be incorrect or imprecise and we may not be able to realize them. We caution you not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which reflect our analysis only and speak only as of the date of this report or the dates indicated in the statements. The following factors, among others, could cause actual results and future events to differ materially from those set forth or contemplated in the forward-looking statements: defaults on or non-renewal of leases by tenants, increased interest rates and operating costs, our failure to obtain necessary outside financing, difficulties in identifying properties to acquire and in effecting acquisitions, our failure to successfully integrate acquired properties and operations, our failure to divest of properties we have contracted to sell or to timely reinvest proceeds from any divestitures, risks and uncertainties affecting property development and construction (including construction delays, cost overruns, our inability to obtain necessary permits and public opposition to these activities), our failure to qualify and maintain our status as a real estate investment trust,

environmental uncertainties, risks related to natural disasters, financial market fluctuations, changes in real estate and zoning laws, risks related to doing business internationally and increases in real property tax rates. Our success also depends upon economic trends generally, including interest rates, income tax laws, governmental regulation, legislation, population changes and certain other matters discussed under the heading "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsBusiness Risks" and elsewhere in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly report on Form 10-Q and in the prospectus supplement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 18, 2003 pursuant to Rule 424(b).

Pro forma financial information included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus has been prepared in accordance with the applicable requirements of Rules 11-01 and 11-02 of Regulation S-X under the Securities Act, and the necessary pro forma adjustments have been properly applied to the historical amounts in the compilation of such information, and, in management's opinion, the assumptions used in the preparation thereof are reasonable 10
and the adjustments used therein are appropriate to give effect to the transactions and circumstances referred to therein. (x) The Company is currently in compliance with all presently applicable provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act, except for such noncompliance which would not, singly or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.

(z) Neither the REIT, the Operating Partnership nor any Subsidiary, nor any of their directors, officers or controlling persons, has taken or will take, directly or indirectly, any action designed to cause or result under the Exchange Act, or otherwise in, or which has constituted or which reasonably might be expected to constitute, the unlawful stabilization or manipulation of the price of any security of the REIT to facilitate the sale or resale of the Shares. (aa) (i) the (a) Revolving Credit Agreement dated as of May 24, 2000 among the Operating Partnership and the banks listed therein (the "ORIGINAL REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT") and (b) the Guaranty of Payment made as of May 24, 2000 between the REIT and JPMorgan Chase Bank (formerly Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of New York), as administrative agent for the banks listed on the signature page of the Revolving Credit Agreement have been superceded in their entirety by (c) the Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement, dated as of December 11, 2002, by and among the Operating Partnership, the banks listed therein, JPMorgan Chase Bank, as administrative agent, J.P.

Documentation Agent (the "ALLIANCE FUND II CREDIT AGREEMENT") has been fully paid and the Alliance Fund II Credit Agreement has been terminated and is of no further force and effect. 2. AGREEMENT TO SELL AND PURCHASE. The REIT hereby agrees to issue and sell to the several Underwriters, and each Underwriter, upon the basis of the representations and warranties herein contained and upon the terms and subject to the conditions herein set forth, agrees, severally and not jointly, to purchase from the REIT, the respective number of Firm Shares set forth in Schedule I hereto opposite its name. The purchase price per share of the Shares to be paid by the several Underwriters to the REIT shall be $24.2125 a share (the "PURCHASE PRICE"). In addition, REIT hereby agrees to issue and sell to the several Underwriters, and the Underwriters, upon the basis of the representations and warranties herein contained and upon the terms and subject to the conditions herein set forth, shall have a one-time right to purchase, severally and not jointly, from the REIT any or all of the Additional Shares at the Purchase Price. If you, on behalf of the Underwriters, elect to exercise such option, you shall so notify the REIT in writing not later than 30 days after the date of this Agreement, which notice shall specify the number of Additional Shares to be purchased by the Underwriters and the date on which such shares are to be purchased. Such date may be the same as the Closing Date (as defined below) but not earlier than the Closing Date nor later than ten business days after the date of such notice. Additional Shares may be purchased as provided in Section 4 hereof solely for the purpose of covering over-allotments made in connection with the offering of the Firm Shares. If any Additional Shares are to be purchased, each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to purchase the number of Additional Shares (subject to such adjustments to eliminate fractional shares as you may determine) that bears the same proportion to the total number of Additional Shares to be purchased as the number of Firm Shares set forth in Schedule I hereto opposite the name of such Underwriter bears to the total number of Firm Shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing, because the record date for the first dividend on the Shares is July 3, 2003, the Underwriters have agreed that to the extent they elect to exercise the option to purchase the Additional Shares, they will do so such that the delivery date for the Additional Shares exercised occurs on or before July 2, 2003. The REIT hereby agrees that, without the prior written consent of the Representative on behalf of the Underwriters, it will not, during the period commencing on the date hereof and ending 30 days after the date of the Prospectus, (i) offer, pledge, sell, contract to sell, sell any option or contract to purchase, purchase any option or contract to sell, grant any option, right or warrant to purchase, lend or otherwise transfer or dispose of, directly or indirectly, any shares of 6 1/2% Series L Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (the "SERIES L PREFERRED STOCK"), or any securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for Series L Preferred Stock or (ii) enter into any swap or other arrangement that transfers to another, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of ownership of shares of Series L Preferred Stock, whether any such transaction described in clause (i) or (ii) above is to be settled by delivery of Series L Preferred Stock, in cash or otherwise. The restrictions described in the foregoing sentence shall not apply to the Shares to be sold hereunder or the Common Stock or prevent the REIT from redeeming or repurchasing any of its securities, including without limitation, its Series A Preferred Stock. 12
3. TERMS OF PUBLIC OFFERING. The REIT is advised by you that the Underwriters propose to make a public offering of their respective portions of the Shares as soon after this Agreement has become effective as in your judgment is advisable. The REIT is further advised by you that the Shares are to be offered to the public initially at $25.00 a share (the "PUBLIC OFFERING PRICE") plus accrued dividends, if any, to the Closing Date, and to certain dealers selected by you at a price that represents a concession not in excess of $0.50 a share under the Public Offering Price, and that any Underwriter may allow, and such dealers may reallow, a concession, not in excess of $0.45 a share, to any Underwriter or to certain other dealers. 4. PAYMENT AND DELIVERY. Payment of the aggregate Purchase Price for the Firm Shares shall be made to the REIT in federal or other funds immediately available in New York City against delivery of such Firm Shares for the respective accounts of the several Underwriters at 10:00 A.M., New York City time, on the third full business day following the date of this Agreement, or at such other time on the same or such other date as shall be agreed to in writing by the REIT and the Representative. The time and date of such payment are hereinafter referred to as the "CLOSING DATE." Payment for the Additional Shares shall be made to the REIT in federal or other funds immediately available in New York City against delivery of such Additional Shares for the respective accounts of the several Underwriters at 10:00 A.M., New York City time, on the date specified in the notice described in Section 2 or at such other time on the same or such other date as shall be agreed to in writing by the REIT and the Representative. The time and date of such payment are hereinafter referred to as the "OPTION CLOSING DATE." Certificates for Firm Shares and Additional Shares shall be in definitive form and registered in such names and in such denominations as you shall request in writing not later than one (1) full business day prior to the Closing Date or the Option Closing Date, as the case may be. The certificates evidencing the Firm Shares and Additional Shares shall be delivered to you on the Closing Date or the Option Closing Date, as the case may be, for the respective accounts of the several Underwriters, with any transfer taxes payable in connection with the transfer of the Shares to the Underwriters duly paid, against payment of the Purchase Price therefor. 5. CONDITIONS TO THE UNDERWRITERS' OBLIGATIONS. The several obligations of the Underwriters hereunder are subject to the accuracy of the representations and warranties on the part of the Company herein, to the accuracy of the statements of the Company's officers made in each certificate furnished pursuant to the provisions hereof and to the performance and observance by the Company of all covenants and agreements herein contained on its part to be performed and observed and to the following conditions: (a) Subsequent to the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date: (i) there shall not have occurred any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in the condition, financial or otherwise, or in the earnings, business or operations of the REIT, the Operating Partnership and their subsidiaries, taken as a whole, from that set forth in the Prospectus (exclusive of any amendments or supplements thereto subsequent to the date of this Agreement) that, in your judgment, is material and adverse and that makes it, in 13
your judgment, impracticable to market the Shares on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus; and (ii) there shall not have occurred any downgrading, nor shall any notice have been given of any intended or potential downgrading or of any review for a possible change that does not indicate the direction of the possible change, in the rating accorded the REIT, the Operating Partnership, any of their subsidiaries, any of their respective securities or in the rating outlook for any of them by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization," as such term is defined for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Securities Act. (b) The Underwriters shall have received on the Closing Date a certificate, dated the Closing Date and signed by an executive officer of the REIT on behalf of the REIT and in the REIT's capacity as general partner of the Operating Partnership, to the effect set forth in subsection (a) and subsection (c) of this Section 5, and to the effect that: (i) the representations and warranties of the REIT and the Operating Partnership contained in this Agreement are true and correct on the Closing Date, as if made on the Closing Date, (ii) all of the covenants and agreements contained herein to be performed on the part of the Company and all conditions contained herein to be fulfilled or complied with by the Company at or prior to the Closing Date, shall have been duly performed, fulfilled or complied with, and (iii) the executive officer executing such certificate has examined the Registration Statement and the Prospectus (including the documents filed under the Exchange Act and deemed to be incorporated by reference into the Prospectus) and (A) believes that as of the date of such certificate, such documents are true and correct in all material respects and do not omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not true or misleading and (B) does not know of any event that has occurred as a result of which it is necessary to amend or supplement the Prospectus in order to make the statements therein not untrue or misleading and there has been no document required to be filed under the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder that upon such filing would be deemed to be incorporated by reference into the Prospectus that has not been so filed. The officer signing and delivering such certificate may rely upon the best of his or her knowledge as to proceedings threatened. (c) The Prospectus shall have been filed as required by this Agreement and no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement shall have been issued and no proceedings for that purposes shall be pending or threatened by the Commission. (d) The Underwriters shall have received on the Closing Date an opinion of Latham & Watkins, special counsel for the REIT, dated the Closing Date, in form and 14
substance reasonably satisfactory to the Underwriters, as to the matters set forth in Exhibit B attached hereto. (e) The Underwriters shall have received on the Closing Date an opinion of Tamra D. Browne, General Counsel to the REIT, dated the Closing Date, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Underwriters, as to the matters set forth in Exhibit C attached hereto.

At the Closing Date, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP shall have furnished to the Underwriters a letter, dated the date of its delivery, which shall confirm, on the basis of a review in accordance with the procedures set forth in the letter from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, that nothing has come to their attention during the period from the date of the letter referred to in the prior sentence to a date (specified in the letter) not more than three days prior to the Closing Date which would require any change in their letter dated the date hereof if it were required to be dated and delivered at the Closing Date. (i) The Shares shall be qualified for sale in such states as the Underwriters may reasonably request, and each such qualification shall be in effect and not subject to any stop order or other proceeding on the Closing Date. (j) On the Closing Date, the Company shall have furnished to the Underwriters such appropriate further information, certificates and documents as they may reasonably request. The several obligations of the Underwriters to purchase Additional Shares hereunder are subject to the delivery to you on the Option Closing Date of such documents as you may reasonably request with respect to the good standing of the REIT and the Operating Partnership, the due authorization and issuance of the Additional Shares and other matters related to the issuance of the Additional Shares, including, without limitation, (i) a certificate dated and as of the Option Closing Date to same effect as the certificate described in paragraph (b) above, (ii) opinions of Latham & Watkins, Tamra D.

COVENANTS OF THE REIT AND THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP. In further consideration of the agreements of the Underwriters herein contained, the REIT and the Operating Partnership covenant with each Underwriter as follows: (a) The REIT will advise the Representative promptly of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or of the institution of any proceedings for that purpose, and will use their best efforts to prevent the issuance of any such stop order and to obtain as soon as possible the lifting thereof, if issued. The REIT and the Operating Partnership will advise the Representative promptly of any request by the Commission for any amendment of or supplement to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or for additional information, and will not at any time file any amendment to the Registration Statement or supplement to the Prospectus which shall not previously have been submitted to the Representatives a reasonable time prior to the proposed filing or use thereof or to which the Representatives shall reasonably object or which is not in compliance with the Securities Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. The REIT and the Operating Partnership will cause the Prospectus Supplement to be filed and will advise you promptly when the Prospectus has been filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the Securities Act. (b) To furnish to you, upon request and without charge, a signed copy of the Registration Statement (including exhibits thereto) and for delivery to each other Underwriter a conformed copy of the Registration Statement (without exhibits thereto) and to furnish to you in New York City, without charge, prior to 10:00 A.M. New York City time on the business day next succeeding the date of this Agreement and during the period mentioned in Section 6(c) below, as many copies of the Prospectus and any supplements and amendments thereto or to the Registration Statement as you may reasonably request. (c) If, during such period after the first date of the public offering of the Shares, in the opinion of counsel for the Underwriters, the Prospectus is required by law to be delivered in connection with sales by an Underwriter or dealer, any event shall occur or condition exist as a result of which it is necessary to amend or supplement the Prospectus in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading when the Prospectus is delivered to a purchaser, or if, in the opinion of counsel for the Underwriters, it is necessary to amend or supplement the Prospectus to comply with applicable law, forthwith to prepare, file with the Commission and furnish, at its own expense, to the Underwriters and to the dealers (whose names and addresses you will furnish to the REIT and the Operating Partnership) to which Shares may have been sold by you on behalf of the Underwriters and to any other dealers upon request, either amendments or supplements to the Prospectus so that the statements in the Prospectus as so amended or supplemented will not, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, be misleading when the Prospectus is 16
delivered to a purchaser, or so that the Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, will comply with law. (d) To endeavor to qualify the Shares for offer and sale under the securities or Blue Sky laws and real estate syndication laws of such jurisdictions as you shall reasonably request. (e) To make generally available to the REIT's security holders and to you as soon as practicable (but no event later than the last day of the fifteenth full calendar month following the end of the REIT's current fiscal quarter), an earnings statement covering the twelve-month period beginning after the date upon which the Prospectus Supplement is filed pursuant to Rule 424 of the Act that satisfies the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder. (f) Whether or not the transactions contemplated in this Agreement are consummated or this Agreement is terminated, to pay or cause to be paid all expenses incident to the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, including: (i) the fees, disbursements and expenses of counsel for the Company and the Company's accountants in connection with the registration and delivery of the Shares under the Securities Act and all other fees or expenses in connection with the preparation and filing of the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Prospectus and amendments and supplements to any of the foregoing, including all printing costs associated therewith, and the mailing and delivering of copies thereof to the Underwriters and dealers, in the quantities hereinabove specified, (ii) all costs and expenses related to the transfer and delivery of the Shares to the Underwriters, including any transfer or other taxes payable thereon, (iii) the cost of printing or producing any Blue Sky or Legal Investment memorandum in connection with the offer and sale of the Shares under state securities laws and all expenses in connection with the qualification of the Shares for offer and sale under state securities laws as provided in Section 6(d) hereof, including filing fees and the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel for the Underwriters in connection with such qualification and in connection with the Blue Sky or Legal Investment memorandum, (iv) all filing fees and the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel to the Underwriters incurred in connection with the review and qualification of the offering of the Shares by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., if any, (v) any fees charged by the rating agencies for the rating of the Shares, (vi) all fees and expenses in connection with the preparation and filing of the registration statement on Form 8-A relating to the Shares, (vii) all costs and expenses incident to listing the Shares on the New York Stock Exchange, (viii) the cost of printing certificates representing the Shares, (ix) the fees and expenses of any transfer agent, registrar or depositary in connection with the issuance of the Shares, (x) the costs and expenses of the Company relating to investor presentations on any "road show" undertaken in connection with the marketing of the offering of the Shares, including, without limitation, expenses associated with the production of road show slides and graphics, fees and expenses of any consultants engaged in connection with the road show presentations with the prior approval of the REIT, travel and lodging expenses of the representatives and officers of the REIT and any such consultants, and, with the prior approval of the REIT, the cost of 17
any aircraft chartered in connection with the road show and (xi) all other costs and expenses incident to the performance of the obligations of the REIT and the Operating Partnership hereunder for which provision is not otherwise made in this Section. It is understood, however, that except as provided in this Section, Section 7 entitled "Indemnity and Contribution" and the last paragraph of Section 9 below, the Underwriters will pay all of their costs and expenses, including fees and disbursements of their counsel, stock transfer taxes payable on resale of any of the Shares by them and any advertising expenses connected with any offers they may make. (g) The Company will use the net proceeds received by it from the sale of the Shares sold by it in the manner specified in the Prospectus under the caption "Use of Proceeds." (h) The Company shall have applied to list the Shares, and the Shares shall have been approved for listing, subject to notice of issuance, on the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") on or prior to the Closing Date, and the REIT and the Operating Partnership shall use its best efforts to maintain the listing of such Shares on the NYSE. (i) Except for the authorization of actions permitted to be taken by the underwriters as contemplated herein or in the Prospectus, neither the REIT nor the Operating Partnership will, within 30 days of the date of the Prospectus, (i) take, directly or indirectly, any action designed to cause or to result in, or that might reasonably be expected to constitute, the stabilization or manipulation of the price of any security of the REIT to facilitate the sale or resale of the Shares, (ii) sell, bid for or purchase the Shares or pay any person any compensation for soliciting purchases of the Shares or (iii) pay or agree to pay to any person any compensation for soliciting another to purchase any other securities of the REIT, which payment or agreement is designed to cause or to result in the stabilization or manipulation of the price of the Shares. (j) The Company will use its best efforts to enable Moody's Investor Service, Inc. and Standard and Poor's Rating Services to provide their respective credit ratings of the REIT, the Operating Partnership or the Shares, as the case may be. (k) Prior to the Closing Date the REIT will file the Articles Supplementary with the Maryland State Department of Assessments and Taxation establishing and fixing the rights and preferences of the Shares. The REIT shall first provide the form of Articles Supplementary to counsel to the Underwriters and shall not file any form of Articles Supplementary to which counsel to the Underwriters has objected in good faith. 7. INDEMNITY AND CONTRIBUTION. (a) The REIT and the Operating Partnership, jointly and severally, agree to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses (including, without limitation, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with defending or investigating any such action or claim) arising out of or caused by (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration 18
Statement or any amendment thereof, any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (as amended or supplemented if the REIT and the Operating Partnership shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto) or in any documents filed under the Exchange Act and deemed to be incorporated by reference into the Prospectus, or in any application or other document executed by or on behalf of the Company or based on written information furnished by or on behalf of the Company filed in any jurisdiction in order to qualify the Shares under the securities or blue sky laws thereof or filed with the Commission, (ii) any omission or alleged omission to state in such document a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or (iii) any act or failure to act or any alleged act or failure to act by any Underwriter in connection with, or relating in any manner to, the Shares or the offering contemplated hereby, and which is included as part of or referred to in any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense arising out of or based upon matters covered by clause (i) or (ii) above (provided, however, that the REIT and the Operating Partnership shall not be liable under this clause (iii) to the extent it is finally judicially determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense resulted directly from any such acts or failures to act undertaken or omitted to be taken by such Underwriter through its gross negligence or willful misconduct), except insofar as such losses, claims, damage, liabilities or expenses are caused by any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission based upon information relating to any Underwriter furnished to the REIT and the Operating Partnership in writing by such Underwriter through you expressly for use therein and set forth in Exhibit A hereof; provided, however, that the foregoing indemnity agreement with respect to any preliminary prospectus shall not inure to the benefit of any Underwriter from whom the person asserting any such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses purchased Shares, or any person controlling such Underwriter, if a copy of the Prospectus (as then amended or supplemented if the REIT and the Operating Partnership shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto) was not sent or given by or on behalf of such Underwriter to such person, if required by law so to have been delivered, at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale of the Shares to such person, and if the Prospectus (as so amended or supplemented) would have cured the defect giving rise to such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, unless such failure is the result of noncompliance by the REIT and the Operating Partnership with Section 6(b) hereof. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability that the REIT or the Operating Partnership might otherwise have. (b) Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the REIT, the Operating Partnership and the REIT's directors, its officers who sign the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the REIT or the Operating Partnership within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the foregoing indemnities from the REIT and the Operating Partnership to such Underwriter, but only with reference to information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the REIT in writing by such Underwriter through you expressly for use in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto, and as set forth in Exhibit A hereto. (c) In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to Section 7(a) or 7(b), such person (the "INDEMNIFIED PARTY") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "INDEMNIFYING PARTY") in writing and the 19
indemnifying party, upon request of the indemnified party, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in respect of the legal expenses of any indemnified party in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified parties and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Such firm shall be designated in writing by Wachovia Securities, LLC, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 7(a), and by the REIT or the Operating Partnership, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 7(b). The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party in writing to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by the second and third sentences of this paragraph, the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 60 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request and (ii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of each indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding. (d) To the extent the indemnification provided for in Section 7(a) or 7(b) is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the REIT and the Operating Partnership on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Shares or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the REIT and the Operating Partnership on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the REIT and the Operating Partnership on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the offering of the Shares 20
shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds from the offering of the Shares (before deducting expenses) received by the REIT and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate Public Offering Price of the Shares. The relative fault of the REIT and the Operating Partnership on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the REIT or the Operating Partnership or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to the respective number of Shares they have purchased hereunder, and not joint. (e) The REIT, the Operating Partnership and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in Section 7(d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Shares underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The remedies provided for in this Section 7 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity. (f) The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in this Section 7 and the representations, warranties and other statements of the REIT and the Operating Partnership contained in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any person controlling any Underwriter or by or on behalf of the REIT, the Operating Partnership or the REIT's officers or directors or any person controlling the REIT or the Operating Partnership and (iii) acceptance of and payment for any of the Shares. 8.

EFFECTIVENESS; DEFAULTING UNDERWRITERS. This Agreement shall become effective upon the execution and delivery hereof by the parties hereto. If, on the Closing Date or the Option Closing Date, as the case may be, any one or more of the Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Shares that it has or they have agreed to purchase hereunder on such date, and the aggregate number of Shares which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase is not more than one-tenth of the aggregate number of the Shares to be purchased on such date, the other Underwriters shall be obligated severally in the proportions that the number of Firm Shares set forth opposite their respective names in Schedule I bears to the aggregate number of Firm Shares set forth opposite the names of all such non-defaulting Underwriters, or in such other proportions as you may specify, to purchase the Shares which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase on such date; provided that in no event shall the number of Shares that any Underwriter has agreed to purchase pursuant to this Agreement be increased pursuant to this Section 9 by an amount in excess of one-ninth of such number of Shares without the written consent of such Underwriter.

Any action taken under this paragraph shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement. If this Agreement shall be terminated by the Underwriters, or any of them, because of any failure or refusal on the part of the REIT or the Operating Partnership to comply with the terms 22
or to fulfill any of the conditions of this Agreement, or if for any reason the REIT or the Operating Partnership shall be unable to perform their obligations under this Agreement, the REIT and the Operating Partnership will, jointly and severally, reimburse the Underwriters or such Underwriters as have so terminated this Agreement with respect to themselves, severally, for all out-of-pocket expenses (including the fees and disbursements of their counsel) reasonably incurred by such Underwriters in connection with this Agreement or the offering contemplated hereunder. 10.
