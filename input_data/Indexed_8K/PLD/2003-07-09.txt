OTHER EVENTS.
On July 8, 2003, AMB Property Corporation announced second quarter 2003 results as follows:
AMB Property Corporation today reported second quarter 2003 earnings per share (EPS) of $0.19, compared with EPS of $0.31 for the same period in 2002. EPS in the quarter was below the company's guidance of $0.28 to $0.33 per share; the variance was largely a result of the company's decision to postpone the sale of, and the corresponding gain from, one of the company's remaining retail assets. The sale is expected to be completed before year end.
In the first half of 2003, EPS was $0.89, including $0.50 per share of gains on disposition of real estate, up from $0.65 per share in first half 2002 which included $0.03 of gains. The company's industrial operating portfolio was 91.5% leased at the end of the second quarter, down 100 basis points from March 31, 2003 and down 290 basis points from June 30, 2002. Preliminary data indicate national industrial occupancy at the end of the second quarter was 88.5%. Cash-based same store net operating income decreased 2.4% in the quarter and increased 0.7% year to date.
Investment Activity
During second quarter 2003, AMB acquired 16 buildings totaling 2.1 million square feet for a total investment of $120.1 million. The company sold two buildings totaling 229,700 square feet for a disposition price of $15.1 million during the same period.
AMB began four development projects during the quarter with an estimated total investment of $42.1 million. AMB's committed industrial development and renovation pipeline through 2005 currently stands at $157.3 million and consists of an expected 2.8 million square feet, of which 60% has been funded and 20% has been preleased.
In addition to the developments begun in the second quarter, AMB has agreed to purchase a 32-acre (13 hectare) development parcel adjacent to Tokyo's Narita International Airport  one of the world's busiest airports for international air cargo. The land purchase, which is subject to customary closing conditions and completion of infrastructure by the seller, is expected to be completed in May 2004.
Financing Activity and Staffing Update
During the quarter, AMB issued and sold 2,000,000 shares of its 6.5% Series L Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock at a price of $25.00 per share.

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
AMB PROPERTY CORPORATION ANNOUNCES SECOND QUARTER 2003 RESULTS
Core operations continue to outperform industry benchmarks; capital deployment activities accelerate in both international and domestic markets
San Francisco, July 8, 2003  AMB Property Corporation (NYSE: AMB), a leading owner and operator of industrial real estate, today reported second quarter 2003 earnings per share (EPS) of $0.19, compared with EPS of $0.31 for the same period in 2002. EPS in the quarter was below the company's guidance of $0.28 to $0.33 per share; the variance was largely a result of the company's decision to postpone the sale of, and the corresponding gain from, one of the company's remaining retail assets. The sale is expected to be completed before year end.
In the first half of 2003, EPS was $0.89, including $0.50 per share of gains on disposition of real estate, up from $0.65 per share in first half 2002 which included $0.03 of gains.
The company's industrial operating portfolio was 91.5% leased at the end of the second quarter, down 100 basis points from March 31, 2003 and down 290 basis points from June 30, 2002. Preliminary data indicate national industrial occupancy at the end of the second quarter was 88.5%. Cash-based same store net operating income decreased 2.4% in the quarter and increased 0.7% year to date.
Hamid R. Moghadam, chairman and CEO, said, "AMB's second quarter occupancy decline was consistent with the stalled economic environment. Importantly, based on preliminary national industrial data, our portfolio continues to outperform the industrial market by approximately 300 basis points. With the reduction in geopolitical tensions, domestic fiscal and monetary stimulus, and historically lean levels of inventory, we believe the stage is set for increased absorption of industrial space. However, persistently weak levels of capital spending and manufacturing output, combined with delayed decision making by users, could drive occupancies still lower before recovery begins. Long term, our outlook is positive and reflected in our increased acquisition and development activity in the second quarter."
Investment Activity
During second quarter 2003, AMB acquired 16 buildings totaling 2.1 million square feet for a total investment of $120.1 million. The company sold two buildings totaling 229,700 square feet for a disposition price of $15.1 million during the same period.
AMB began four development projects during the quarter with an estimated total investment of $42.1 million. AMB's committed industrial development and renovation pipeline through 2005 currently stands at $157.3 million and consists of an expected 2.8 million square feet, of which 60% has been funded and 20% has been preleased.
W. Blake Baird, AMB's president, noted, "During the last four quarters, AMB's share of dispositions has totaled more than $380 million in real estate, including assets in markets that no longer fit our investment strategy and properties at valuations we considered to be at premium levels. In addition, we have contributed nearly $75 million to co-investment joint ventures. Although these sales and
1
 
contributions have diluted our near-term results, we believe they position the company for superior long-term growth and higher return on invested capital with a portfolio increasingly aligned with our investment focus and private capital model. Further, proceeds from these sales, along with our balance sheet and private capital sources, create significant capacity for future deployment. While we will continue to sell assets on an opportunistic basis, we've substantially achieved our near-term strategic disposition goals. Therefore, in the coming quarters, we expect AMB's net investment activity to begin to reflect the acquisition and development opportunities we are seeing in our targeted global distribution markets."
In addition to the developments begun in the second quarter, AMB has agreed to purchase a 32-acre (13 hectare) development parcel adjacent to Tokyo's Narita International Airport  one of the world's busiest airports for international air cargo. The land purchase, which is subject to customary closing conditions and completion of infrastructure by the seller, is expected to be completed in May 2004. AMB and its development partner AMB BlackPine currently plan to develop approximately 1.5 million square feet (139,400 square meters) in seven distribution facilities on the site. The company's total investment in AMB Narita Air Cargo Center is expected to be approximately $150 million with delivery in four phases between 2005 and 2007.
Financing Activity and Staffing Update
During the quarter, AMB issued and sold 2,000,000 shares of its 6.5% Series L Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock at a price of $25.00 per share. In addition, the company announced the redemption of all 3,995,800 shares of its outstanding 8.5% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock; the shares will be redeemed on July 28, 2003.
In a recent promotion, Alison M. Hill was appointed senior vice president of AMB and senior vice president and chief operating officer of AMB's wholly owned subsidiary, AMB Capital Partners, LLC.
Supplemental Reporting Measure
AMB reports funds from operations per fully diluted share and unit (FFOPS) in accordance with the standards established by NAREIT as a supplemental earnings measure. Second quarter 2003 FFOPS was $0.52, compared with $0.60 for the same period in 2002. Current period FFO was above the company's guidance of $0.47 to $0.48 per share primarily as a result of net lease termination fees of $0.03 per share above the company's expectations. FFOPS for the first half of 2003 was $1.13, below 2002 FFOPS for the same period of $1.21.
In light of the SEC's recent rulemaking regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures and its related discussions of FFO, the company determined that it should no longer exclude the amortization of investments in leasehold interests from FFO. This change has added $0.01 and $0.02 per share, respectively, to FFO for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2003. Excluding this change and the net lease termination fees referred to above, second quarter 2003 FFOPS would have been in line with the company's guidance. A reconciliation from net income to funds from operations is provided in the attached tables and published in AMB's quarterly supplemental analyst package and is available on the company's website at www.amb.com.

(1)  FFO for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2002, was adjusted for the retroactive adoption of SFAS No. 145 for the treatment of extraordinary items, resulting in a reduction of $0.1 million and $0.3 million, respectively, from previously reported FFO.
(2)  In the quarter ended June 30, 2003, and effective January 1, 2003, the Company discontinued its practice of deducting amortization of investments in leasehold interests from FFO as such an adjustment is not provided for in NAREIT's FFO definition.
