We have audited the accompanying Statement of Revenues and Certain Expenses (the "Statement") of Trans-Pacific Industrial Park (the "Portfolio") for the year ended December 31, 2002. This Statement is the responsibility of the Portfolio's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on this Statement based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Statement is free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the Statement. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the Statement. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
The accompanying Statement was prepared for the purpose of complying with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission as described in Note 1 and is not intended to be a complete presentation of the Portfolio's revenues and expenses.
In our opinion, the Statement referred to above presents fairly, in all material respects, the revenues and certain expenses described in Note 1 of the Portfolio for the year ended December 31, 2002 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Revenue Recognition
Rental revenues from operating leases are recorded on a straight-line basis over the term of the leases. Tenant reimbursements represent recoveries from tenants for utilities and certain property maintenance expenses. Tenant reimbursements are recognized as revenues in the period the applicable costs are accrued.
Property Operating Expenses
Property operating expenses represent the direct expenses of operating the Portfolio and include maintenance, utilities, property management fees, repairs, and insurance cost that are expected to continue in the ongoing operation of the Portfolio. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions of the reported amounts of revenues and certain expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements.
Interim Statements
The statement for the five-month period ended May 31, 2003 is unaudited, however, in the opinion of management of AMB Property Corporation and AMB Property, L.P., all significant adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the statement for the interim period have been included. The results of operations for the interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year for the operation of the Portfolio.
