ITEM 2.02 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.
On October 12, 2004, we issued a press release entitled "AMB Property Corporation Announces Restatement of Depreciation Expense for Prior Periods and Third Quarter 2004 Results," which sets forth disclosure regarding our restatement of depreciation expense for prior periods and our results of operations for the third quarter of 2004. A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1. This section and the attached exhibit are provided under Item 2.02 of Form 8-K and are furnished to, but not filed with, the Securities and Exchange Commission.
ITEM 4.02(a) NON-RELIANCE ON PREVIOUSLY ISSUED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OR A RELATED AUDIT REPORT OR COMPLETED INTERIM REVIEW.
On October 12, 2004, we announced a restatement of depreciation expense for our prior period results relating to 39 buildings in our portfolio, 38 of which are located on-tarmac. As part of our on-going review of our accounting policies and internal control over financial reporting, we determined that we should have depreciated certain of our investments in buildings that reside on land subject to ground leases over the remaining terms of the ground leases, not over 40 years as applied to buildings that reside on land held in fee by us. We did not segregate these assets into a separate expected useful life category for depreciation purposes. Our management determined that the internal control deficiency that gave rise to this restatement represents a material weakness, as defined by the PCAOB's Auditing Standard No. 2. In connection with correcting the error, we believe we have taken appropriate action to modify our system of internal control and properly remediate this internal control deficiency. Going forward, these assets will be depreciated over the lesser of 40 years or the contractual term of the underlying ground lease.
To reflect additional depreciation expense, our management will restate our previously issued financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 filed on Form 10-K and for the quarters ended March 31, 2004 and June 30, 2004 filed on Form 10-Q. Management and the audit committee of our board of directors consulted with our independent auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, and determined that this was the proper approach. On October 12, 2004, management and the audit committee of our board of directors concluded that our financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 filed on Form 10-K and for the quarters ended March 31, 2004 and June 30, 2004 filed on Form 10-Q should no longer be relied upon because of this error in the financial statements as addressed in Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 20.
The restatement affects our depreciation expense, net income and earnings per share for the prior periods. The net impact of the restatement of depreciation expense on earnings per share results will reduce earnings per share by $0.02 from $1.43 to $1.41 for 2001; by $0.04 from $1.37 to $1.33 for 2002; by $0.06 from $1.47 to $1.41 for 2003. The net impact on each of the three months ended March 31, and June 30, 2004 will reduce earnings per share by $0.02 from $0.19 to $0.17 and by $0.02 from $0.22 to $0.20, respectively. The restatement reduces net income available to stockholders from $122 million to $120 million for 2001, from $116 million to $113 million for 2002, from $122 million to $117 million for 2003, from $16 million to $15 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2004 and from $18 million to $17 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2004. This restatement of depreciation expense does not impact our previously reported funds
 
from operations, or FFO, per fully diluted share and unit as, in accordance with NAREIT's FFO definition, we add back real estate-related depreciation to calculate FFO.
OPERATING RESULTS
We reported third quarter 2004 earnings per share of $0.35, exceeding our guidance for the quarter of $0.30 to $0.33 per share. The higher-than-expected results were driven by early receipt of gains from property dispositions and net lease termination fees, offset by delayed development profits. Earnings per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2004 were $0.73 per share compared with $1.11 in the same period of 2003.
Earnings per share results for the first nine months of 2004 included $0.14 of gains on disposition of real estate and an adjustment of $0.03 of additional depreciation on investments in leasehold investments related to the first six months of 2004. For the first nine months of 2003, earnings per share included $0.57 of gains on dispositions of real estate and an additional restatement of depreciation expense of $0.04 related to certain leasehold investments.
Our industrial operating portfolio was 94.6% leased as of September 30, 2004, up 100 basis points from June 30, 2004, and up 260 basis points from September 30, 2003. Preliminary data indicate U.S. industrial vacancy at the end of the third quarter was 11.2%, representing a 20 basis point improvement from the prior quarter  the second consecutive quarter of improving occupancy nationally.
Cash-basis same store net operating income increased 4.8% in third quarter 2004, driven primarily by lease termination fees. Without the effect of lease termination fees, same store net operating income increased 0.6% in the quarter, driven by occupancy gains offset by rental rate decreases on leases renewed or rolled over during the past 12 months. For the year to date, same store net operating income declined 1.1%; without the impact of lease termination fees, year-to-date same store net operating income decreased 1.0%.
INVESTMENT ACTIVITY
During the third quarter, we acquired 590,800 square feet of distribution facilities in two buildings for a total expected investment of $51.6 million. Both assets are fully leased and are situated in infill locations of our target market of northern New Jersey. The transactions bring our year-to-date acquisition activity to 4.6 million square feet in 48 buildings with a total expected investment of $490.8 million.
Development starts in the quarter totaled approximately 2.7 million square feet in seven projects in three countries with an expected total investment of $345.7 million. The two largest projects total approximately 1.8 million square feet of multi-story, ramp-accessed industrial facilities in the high-demand logistics markets of Tokyo and Osaka, Japan. In Osaka, our 973,000 square-foot Amagasaki Distribution Center broke ground in August and is approximately 50% preleased.
 
During the quarter, we stabilized 370,600 square feet of new developments for a total expected investment of $15.4 million. The stabilized developments include the Singapore Airport Logistics Center Building 1 adjacent to Singapore's Changi International Airport and Northfield Building 600, adjacent to Dallas Fort Worth International Airport.
The quarter included sales of seven buildings for a total disposition price of approximately $62.8 million. In addition, we generated $1.5 million of net development profits in the quarter from our development-for-sale program.
FINANCING ACTIVITIES
During the quarter, AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, our wholly-owned subsidiary, obtained a seven-year, $101 million secured loan facility which combines both fixed and floating rates terms and significant prepayment flexibility. We expect to close on the first equity raise for AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III during the fourth quarter, reducing our 100% ownership of the fund to the 20% to 50% level. AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III is expected to be the REIT industry's first open-end, commingled private capital fund with an initial asset base of more than $400 million.
Supplemental Earnings Measure
We report funds from operations per fully diluted share and unit, or FFOPS, in accordance with the standards established by NAREIT. Third quarter 2004 FFOPS increased more than 27% to $0.61 from $0.48 at September 30, 2003, at the top end of our guidance of $0.59  $0.61 per share. The high end of our guidance was achieved through receipt of an earlier-than-anticipated level of net lease termination fees. The year-over-year results are attributable to increased levels of capital deployment and improved core operations. FFOPS for the nine months ended September 30, 2004 was $1.68, nine percent ahead of FFOPS for the same period in 2003 of $1.54.
Included in the footnotes to our attached financial statements is a discussion of why management believes FFO is a useful supplemental measure of operating performance, ways in which investors might use FFO when assessing our financial performance, and FFO's limitations as a measurement tool.
A reconciliation from net income to funds from operations is provided in the following tables.
 
 
 
(1)We believe that net income, as defined by GAAP, is the most appropriate earnings measure. However, we consider funds from operations, or FFO, as defined by NAREIT, to be a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance. FFO is defined as net income, calculated in accordance with GAAP, less gains (or losses) from dispositions of real estate held for investment purposes and real estate-related depreciation, and adjustments to derive our pro rata share of FFO of consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures. Further, we do not adjust FFO to eliminate the effects of non-recurring charges. We believe that FFO, as defined by NAREIT, is a meaningful supplemental measure of our operating performance because historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time, as reflected through depreciation and amortization expenses. However, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market and other conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient. Thus, NAREIT created FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance for real estate investment trusts that excludes historical cost depreciation and amortization, among other items, from net income, as defined by GAAP. We believe that the use of FFO, combined with the required GAAP presentations, has been beneficial in improving the understanding of operating results of real estate investment trusts among the investing public and making comparisons of operating results among such companies more meaningful. We consider FFO to be a useful measure for reviewing comparative operating and financial performance because, by excluding gains or losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets and real estate depreciation and amortization, FFO can help the investing public compare the operating performance of a company's real estate between periods or as compared to other companies. While FFO is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance of real estate investment trusts, it does not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to those measures in evaluating our liquidity or operating performance. FFO also does not consider the costs associated with capital expenditures related to our real estate assets nor is FFO necessarily indicative of cash available to fund our future cash requirements. Further, our computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other real estate investment trusts that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently than we do.
(2)Effective January 1, 2003, we discontinued our practice of deducting amortization of investments in leasehold interest from FFO as such an adjustment is not provided for in NAREIT's FFO definition. As a result, FFO for the periods presented has been adjusted to reflect the changes.

EXHIBIT 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
AMB PROPERTY CORPORATION ANNOUNCES RESTATEMENT OF DEPRECIATION EXPENSE FOR PRIOR PERIODS AND THIRD QUARTER 2004 RESULTS
Prior Period Results Restated for Additional Depreciation Expenses of Leasehold Investments; Operating Results Reflect Strengthening National Industrial Market With Higher Occupancies and Improving Same Store Results
SAN FRANCISCO, October 12, 2004  AMB Property Corporation (NYSE:AMB), a leading global developer and owner of industrial real estate, announced a restatement of depreciation expense for prior period results relating to 39 buildings in its portfolio, 38 of which are located on-tarmac. As part of the company's on-going review of its accounting policies and internal control over financial reporting, the company determined that it should have depreciated certain of its investments in buildings that reside on land subject to ground leases over the remaining terms of the ground leases, not over 40 years as applied to buildings that reside on land held in fee by the company. AMB did not segregate these assets into a separate expected useful life category for depreciation purposes. Management determined that the internal control deficiency that gave rise to this restatement represents a material weakness, as defined by the PCAOB's Auditing Standard No. 2. In connection with correcting the error, AMB believes it has taken appropriate action to modify its system of internal control and properly remediate this internal control deficiency. Going forward, these assets will be depreciated over the lesser of 40 years or the contractual term of the underlying ground lease.
To reflect additional depreciation expense, management will restate AMB's previously issued financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 filed on Form 10-K and for the quarters ended March 31, 2004 and June 30, 2004 filed on Form 10-Q. Management and the Audit Committee consulted with the company's independent auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, and determined that this was the proper approach.
The restatement affects the company's depreciation expense, net income and earnings per share for the prior periods. The net impact of the restatement of depreciation expense on earnings per share results will reduce EPS by $0.02 from $1.43 to $1.41 for 2001; by $0.04 from $1.37 to $1.33 for 2002; by $0.06 from $1.47 to $1.41 for 2003. The net impact on each of the three months ended March 31, and June 30, 2004 will reduce EPS by $0.02 from $0.19 to $0.17 and by $0.02 from $0.22 to $0.20, respectively. The restatement reduces net income available to stockholders from $122 million to $120 million for 2001, from $116 million to $113 million for 2002, from $122 million to $117 million for 2003, from $16 million to $15 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2004 and from $18 million to $17 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2004. This restatement of depreciation expense does not impact the company's previously reported funds from operations (FFO) per fully diluted share and unit as, in accordance with NAREIT's FFO definition, the company adds back real estate-related depreciation to calculate FFO.

Operating Results
AMB reported third quarter 2004 earnings per share (EPS) of $0.35, exceeding the company's guidance for the quarter of $0.30 to $0.33 per share. The higher-than-expected results were driven by early receipt of gains from property dispositions and net lease termination fees, offset by delayed development profits.
Earnings per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2004 were $0.73 per share compared with $1.11 in the same period of 2003. EPS results for the first nine months of 2004 included $0.14 of gains on disposition of real estate and an adjustment of $0.03 of additional depreciation on investments in leasehold investments related to the first six months of 2004. For the first nine months of 2003, EPS included $0.57 of gains on dispositions of real estate and an additional restatement of depreciation expense of $0.04 related to certain leasehold investments.
The company's industrial operating portfolio was 94.6% leased as of September 30, 2004, up 100 basis points from June 30, 2004, and up 260 basis points from September 30, 2003. Preliminary data indicate U.S. industrial vacancy at the end of the third quarter was 11.2%, representing a 20 basis point improvement from the prior quarter  the second consecutive quarter of improving occupancy nationally.
Cash-basis same store net operating income (NOI) increased 4.8% in third quarter 2004, driven primarily by lease termination fees. Without the effect of lease termination fees, same store NOI increased 0.6% in the quarter, driven by occupancy gains offset by rental rate decreases on leases renewed or rolled over during the past 12 months. For the year to date, same store NOI declined 1.1%; without the impact of lease termination fees, year-to-date same store NOI decreased 1.0%.
Hamid R. Moghadam, chairman and CEO, said, "The strengthening of the industrial markets which began earlier this year continues to take hold. On a national basis, absorption of industrial property is estimated to have exceeded 50 million square feet, the highest level since the fourth quarter of 2000. We believe the prospects for well-located, functional industrial real estate are good. The ISM manufacturing index remains well above the level indicating expansion and the recent upward revision in GDP reflects gains in business spending and the much-anticipated restocking of inventories. These conditions supported the strong growth in occupancy in AMB's portfolio during the third quarter. We are now seeing levels of customer activity in several markets which suggests future rental rate growth."
Investment Activity
During the third quarter, AMB acquired 590,800 square feet of distribution facilities in two buildings for a total expected investment of $51.6 million. Both assets are fully leased and are situated in infill locations of the company's target market of northern New Jersey. The transactions bring the company's year-to-date acquisition activity to 4.6 million square feet in 48 buildings with a total expected investment of $490.8 million.
Development starts in the quarter totaled approximately 2.7 million square feet in seven projects in three countries with an expected total investment of $345.7 million. The two largest projects total approximately 1.8 million square feet of multi-story, ramp-accessed industrial facilities in the high-demand logistics markets of Tokyo and Osaka, Japan. In Osaka, AMB's 973,000 square-foot Amagasaki Distribution Center broke ground in August and is approximately 50% preleased.

During the quarter, the company stabilized 370,600 square feet of new developments for a total expected investment of $15.4 million. The stabilized developments include the Singapore Airport Logistics Center Building 1 adjacent to Singapore's Changi International Airport and Northfield Building 600, adjacent to Dallas Fort Worth International Airport.
AMB's president, W. Blake Baird, commented, "We continue to see outstanding development opportunities in our global target markets, particularly in airport and seaport locations of Japan. Our current development pipeline totals 8.6 million square feet with an estimated total investment of $689.3 million  more than 60% of which is located in non-U.S. markets. We expect this pipeline to provide excellent global expansion opportunities for our customers and a growing source of value for our investors."
The quarter included sales of seven buildings for a total disposition price of approximately $62.8 million. In addition, the company generated $1.5 million of net development profits in the quarter from its development-for-sale program.
Financing Activities
During the quarter, AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III (Fund III), a wholly-owned subsidiary, obtained a seven-year, $101 million secured loan facility which combines both fixed and floating rates terms and significant prepayment flexibility. AMB expects to close on the first equity raise for Fund III during the fourth quarter, reducing the company's 100% ownership of the fund to the 20% to 50% level. Fund III is expected to be the REIT industry's first open-end, commingled private capital fund with an initial asset base of more than $400 million.
Supplemental Earnings Measure
AMB reports funds from operations per fully diluted share and unit (FFOPS) in accordance with the standards established by NAREIT. Third quarter 2004 FFOPS increased more than 27% to $0.61 from $0.48 at September 30, 2003, at the top end of the company's guidance of $0.59  $0.61 per share. The high end of the company's guidance was achieved through receipt of an earlier-than-anticipated level of net lease termination fees. The strong year-over-year results are attributable to increased levels of capital deployment and improved core operations. FFOPS for the nine months ended September 30, 2004 was $1.68, nine percent ahead of FFOPS for the same period in 2003 of $1.54.
