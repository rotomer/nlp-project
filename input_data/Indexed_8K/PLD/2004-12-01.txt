     On November 24, 2004, AMB Tokai TMK, a Japanese subsidiary of AMB Property, L.P., entered into a secured multi-advance project financing, providing for loans in a maximum principal amount outstanding at any time of up to 20,000,000,000, which, using the exchange rate in effect on November 24, 2004, would equal approximately US$195,000,000. The financing agreement is among AMB Tokai TMK, us, AMB Property, L.P., Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation ("SMBC"), as administrative agent and sole lead arranger and bookmanager, and a syndicate of banks. We and AMB Property, L.P. jointly and severally guarantee AMB Tokai TMK's obligations under the financing agreement, pursuant to a guaranty of payment executed in connection with the project financing.
     The financing is secured by a mortgage on certain real property located in Tokai, Tokyo, Japan. The financing will also be secured by an additional mortgage on a building to be constructed on the Tokai property, which we refer to as the Ohta distribution center. AMB Tokai TMK intends to use the proceeds from the financing to (i) pay down amounts it borrowed under a separate revolving credit facility guaranteed by us and AMB Property, L.P., (ii) to pay for construction costs in connection with the development of the Ohta distribution center and (iii) to pay financing-related costs.
     The financing matures on October 31, 2006 and may be extended for one year at AMB Tokai TMK's option, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions and the payment of an extension fee equal to 0.25% of the outstanding commitments under the loan at that time. The rate on the borrowings will generally be TIBOR plus a margin, which is based on the credit rating of AMB Property, L.P.'s long-term debt and is currently 60 basis points per annum, except that AMB Tokai TMK has purchased from SMBC an interest rate swap, which has fixed the interest rate payable on a principal amount equal to 13,000,000,000 at 1.32% per annum plus the applicable margin. In addition, there is an annual commitment fee based on unused commitments, payable quarterly, which is based on the credit rating of AMB Property, L.P.'s long-term debt, and is currently 20 basis points of the amount of unused commitments. AMB Tokai TMK may repay all or a portion of the loan so long as the minimum amount being repaid is at least 100,000,000 and certain other conditions are satisfied. Amounts repaid may not be re-borrowed. The financing agreement contains customary and other affirmative covenants, including financial reporting requirements and maintenance of specified financial ratios, and negative covenants, including limitations on the incurrence of liens and limitations on mergers or consolidations. In addition, the financing agreement includes customary events (including without limitation a non-payment under the loan, a breach of warranties and representations in a material respect, non-compliance with covenants and the incurrence of additional significant liabilities by AMB Tokai TMK, AMB Property, L.P., us, or certain of AMB Property, L.P.'s or our subsidiaries and affiliaties, as applicable), as well as certain other additional events (including without a limitation change in the majority of our board of directors during any 12-month period or the acquisition by a person or group of 30% or more of our common stock), each of which, if not cured within the time period specified in the financing agreement, would constitute an event of default. Upon the occurrence and continuance of such events of default, the lenders may elect to accelerate the outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest under the financing agreement. Further, outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest thereon automatically accelerate upon the occurrence of certain other events of default, including without limitation and as described more fully in the financing agreement, the commencement of any voluntary or involuntary proceeding seeking liquidation, reorganization or other relief of the debts of AMB Tokai TMK, AMB Property, L.P. or us under any bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law, or AMB Tokai TMK, AMB Property, L.P. or we seek at any time to repudiate its or our respective obligations under the financing agreement or a related document.
     In addition, SMBC, AMB Tokai TMK and AMB Property, L.P. signed a commitment letter on November 24, 2004, pursuant to which SMBC committed to purchase bonds that may be issued by AMB Tokai TMK in an amount between 10,000,000,000 and 15,000,000,000 (such amount to be determined by AMB Tokai TMK). The bonds would be secured by the Ohta property and distribution center and would generally accrue interest at a rate of TIBOR plus 1.10% per annum; because the swap purchased by AMB Tokai TMK from SMBC is coterminous with the maturity date of the proposed bonds, AMB Tokai TMK will have fixed the interest rate payable on, in general, a principal amount equal to 13,000,000,000 at 2.42% per annum. The bonds, if issued, would mature on October 31, 2012, and during the last four years of the term of the bonds, AMB Tokai TMK would be required to make quarterly principal payments in such amounts as are necessary to pay annual principal amortization of 1.6% of the original principal amount of the bonds during such period.
     SMBC's commitment is subject to the satisfaction of multiple conditions precedent, including that the bonds be issued by May 24, 2007 and that amounts outstanding under the financing agreement be repaid in full, as well as other conditions precedent standard and customary for financings. The proceeds of the bonds would be used to pay, in part, amounts outstanding under the financing agreement. The bonds would be

recourse obligations of AMB Tokai TMK but would be nonrecourse to any other entity; provided, however, that (i) AMB Property, L.P. would be required to indemnify SMBC for losses suffered from certain nonrecourse carveout obligations that are standard and customary for nonrecourse financings and (ii) if AMB Tokai TMK fails to meet certain leasing criteria at the time of issuance of the bonds, AMB Property, L.P. could guarantee that rent proceeds from the Ohta distribution center will generate cash flow in an amount necessary to satisfy a debt service coverage ratio test until such leasing criteria are met. If the leasing criteria are not met within approximately one year after the date of issuance of the bonds, payment of the bonds may be accelerated. The documents that would govern the issuance of the bonds contain customary nonrecourse financing covenants and other affirmative and negative covenants, including limitations on the incurrence of liens and transfers of equity interests.
     A copy of the financing agreement and the guaranty are attached hereto as Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2, respectively, and are incorporated into this current report by reference.

ARTICLE IV REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES SECTION 4.1. Representations and Warranties by the Guarantors. In order to induce the Administrative Agent and each of the other Banks which is or may become a party to this Agreement to make the Loans, each of AMB LP and AMB Corporation, as applicable, make the following representations and warranties as of the Closing Date. Such representations and warranties shall survive the effectiveness of this Agreement, the execution and delivery of the other Loan Documents and the making of the Loans. (a) Existence and Power. 39
(i) AMB LP is a limited partnership, duly formed and validly existing as a limited partnership under the laws of the State of Delaware and has all powers and all material governmental licenses, authorizations, consents and approvals required to own its property and assets and carry on its business as now conducted or as it presently proposes to conduct and has been duly qualified and is in good standing in every jurisdiction in which the failure to be so qualified and/or in good standing is likely to have a Material Adverse Effect. (ii) AMB Corporation is a corporation, duly formed, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Maryland and has all powers and all material governmental licenses, authorizations, consents and approvals required to own its property and assets and carry on its business as now conducted or as it presently proposes to conduct and has been duly qualified and is in good standing in every jurisdiction in which the failure to be so qualified and/or in good standing is likely to have a Material Adverse Effect. (b) Power and Authority. (i) Each Guarantor has duly executed and delivered each Loan Document to which it is a party in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, and each such Loan Document constitutes, or will constitute, the legal, valid and binding obligation of such Guarantor, enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as enforceability may be limited by applicable insolvency, bankruptcy or other laws affecting creditors rights generally, or general principles of equity, whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law. (ii) Each Guarantor has the power and authority to execute, deliver and carry out the terms and provisions of each of the Loan Documents to which it is a party and has taken all necessary action to authorize the execution, delivery and performance of such Loan Documents. (c) No Violation. Neither the execution, delivery or performance by any Guarantor of the Loan Documents to which it is a party, nor compliance by such Guarantor with the terms and provisions thereof nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated by such Loan Documents, (i) will materially contravene any applicable provision of any law, statute, rule, regulation, order, writ, injunction or decree of any court or governmental instrumentality, (ii) will materially conflict with or result in any breach of, any of the terms, covenants, conditions or provisions of, or constitute a default under, or result in the creation or imposition of (or the obligation to create or impose) any Lien upon any of the property or assets of such Guarantor or any of its Consolidated Subsidiaries pursuant to the terms of any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, or other agreement or other instrument to which such Guarantor (or of any partnership of which such Guarantor is a partner) or any of its Consolidated Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of its property or assets is bound or to which it is subject (except for such breaches and defaults under loan agreements which the lenders thereunder have agreed to forbear pursuant to valid forbearance agreements), or (iii) will cause a material default by such Guarantor under any organizational document of any Person in which such Guarantor has 40
an interest, the consequences of which conflict, breach or default would have a Material Adverse Effect, or result in or require the creation or imposition of any Lien whatsoever upon any Property (except as contemplated herein). (d) Financial Information. (i) The consolidated balance sheet of AMB LP and its Consolidated Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2003, and the related consolidated statements of operations and cash flows of AMB Corporation for the fiscal year then ended, reported on by PricewaterhouseCoopers fairly present, in conformity with GAAP, the consolidated financial position of each of the Guarantors and their Consolidated Subsidiaries as of such date and the consolidated results of operations and cash flows for such fiscal quarter. (ii) Since September 30, 2004, (i) except as may have been disclosed in writing to the Banks, nothing has occurred having a Material Adverse Effect, and (ii) except as set forth on Schedule 4.1(d), no Credit Party has incurred any material indebtedness or guaranty on or before the Closing Date. (e) Litigation. Except as previously disclosed by the Guarantors in writing to the Banks, there is no action, suit or proceeding pending against or, to the knowledge of the Guarantors, threatened against or affecting, (i) any Credit Party or any of their respective Consolidated Subsidiaries, (ii) the Loan Documents or any of the transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents or (iii) any of their assets, before any court or arbitrator or any governmental body, agency or official in which there is a reasonable possibility of an adverse decision which could, individually, or in the aggregate have a Material Adverse Effect or which in any manner draws into question the validity of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents. As of the Closing Date, no such action, suit or proceeding exists. (f) Compliance with ERISA. (i) Except as set forth on Schedule 4.1(f) attached hereto, no Credit Party is a member of or has entered into, maintained, contributed to, or been required to contribute to, or may incur any liability with respect to any Plan or Multiemployer Plan or any other Benefit Arrangement. In the event that at any time after the Closing Date, any Credit Party shall become a member of any other material Plan or Multiemployer Plan, such Credit Party promptly shall notify the Administrative Agent thereof and from and after such notice, Schedule 4.1(f) shall be deemed modified thereby. (ii) Except for a "prohibited transaction" arising solely because of a Bank's breach of the covenant set forth in Section 9.17 hereof, the transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents will not constitute a nonexempt prohibited transaction (as such term is defined in Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA) that could subject the Administrative Agent or any of the Banks to any tax or penalty on prohibited transactions imposed under Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502(i) of ERISA and such transactions will not otherwise result in the Administrative 41
Agent or any of the Banks being deemed in violation of Sections 404 or 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or in the Administrative Agent or any of the Banks being a fiduciary or party in interest under ERISA or a "disqualified person" as defined in Section 4975(e)(2) of the Code with respect to an "employee benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA or a "plan" within the meaning of Section 4975(e)(1) of the Code. No assets of any Credit Party constitute "assets" (within the meaning of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, including, but not limited to, 29 C.F.R. Section 2510.3-101 or any successor regulation thereto) of an "employee benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA or a "plan" within the meaning of Section 4975(e)(1) of the Code. In addition to the prohibitions set forth in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and not in limitation thereof, AMB LP covenants and agrees that AMB LP shall not, and shall not permit any Credit Party to, use any "assets" (within the meaning of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, including but not limited to 29 C.F.R. Section 2510.3-101) of an "employee benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA or a "plan" within the meaning of Section 4975(e)(1) of the Code to repay or secure the Loans or the Obligations. (g) Environmental. AMB LP conducts reviews of the effect of Environmental Laws on the business, operations and properties of AMB LP and its Consolidated Subsidiaries when necessary in the course of which it identifies and evaluates associated liabilities and costs (including, without limitation, any capital or operating expenditures required for clean-up or closure of properties presently owned, any capital or operating expenditures required to achieve or maintain compliance with environmental protection standards imposed by law or as a condition of any license, permit or contract, any related constraints on operating activities, and any actual or potential liabilities to third parties, including, without limitation, employees, and any related costs and expenses). On the basis of this review, AMB LP has reasonably concluded that such associated liabilities and costs, including, without limitation, the costs of compliance with Environmental Laws, are unlikely to have a Material Adverse Effect. (h) Taxes. Each Credit Party and their respective Consolidated Subsidiaries have filed all United States Federal and Japanese national and local income tax returns and all other material tax returns which are required to be filed by them and have paid all taxes due pursuant to such returns or pursuant to any assessment received by any Credit Parties or any of their respective Consolidated Subsidiaries, except such taxes, if any, as are reserved against in accordance with GAAP, such taxes as are being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings or such taxes, the failure to make payment of which when due and payable will not have, in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. The charges, accruals and reserves on the books of the Credit Parties and their respective Consolidated Subsidiaries in respect of taxes or other governmental charges are, in the opinion of AMB LP, adequate. (i) Full Disclosure. All information heretofore furnished by the Credit Parties to the Administrative Agent or any Bank for purposes of or in connection with this Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby or thereby is true and accurate in all material respects on the date as of which such information is stated or certified. The 42
Guarantors have disclosed to the Administrative Agent, in writing any and all facts which have or may have (to the extent the Guarantors can now reasonably foresee) a Material Adverse Effect. (j) Solvency. On the Closing Date and after giving effect to the transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents occurring on the Closing Date and after each Loan, each Credit Party will be Solvent. (k) Use of Proceeds. All proceeds of the Loans will be used by Borrower only in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.17. Neither the making of any Loan nor the use of the proceeds thereof will violate or be inconsistent with the provisions of regulations T, U, or X of the Federal Reserve Board. (l) Governmental Approvals. No order, consent, approval, license, authorization, or validation of, or filing, recording or registration with, or exemption by, any governmental or public body or authority, or any subdivision thereof, is required to authorize, or is required in connection with the execution, delivery and performance of any Loan Document or the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated thereby other than those that have already been duly made or obtained and remain in full force and effect or those which, if not made or obtained, would not have a Material Adverse Effect; (m) Investment Company Act; Public Utility Holding Company Act. No Credit Party and no Consolidated Subsidiary (other than AMB Capital Partners, LLC) is (x) an "investment company" or a company "controlled" by an "investment company", within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, (y) a "holding company" or a "subsidiary company" of a "holding company" or an "affiliate" of either a "holding company" or a "subsidiary company" within the meaning of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended, or (z) subject to any other federal or state law or regulation which purports to restrict or regulate its ability to borrow money. (n) Principal Offices. As of the Closing Date, the principal office, chief executive office and principal place of business of each of the Guarantors is Pier 1, Bay 1, San Francisco, California 94111. (o) REIT Status. AMB Corporation is qualified and AMB Corporation intends to continue to qualify as a real estate investment trust under the Code. (p) Patents, Trademarks, etc. The Credit Parties have obtained and hold in full force and effect all patents, trademarks, servicemarks, trade names, copyrights and other such rights, free from burdensome restrictions, which are necessary for the operation of its business as presently conducted, the impairment of which is likely to have a Material Adverse Effect. (q) Judgments. As of the Closing Date, there are no final, non-appealable judgments or decrees in an aggregate amount of Ten Million Dollars (US$10,000,000) (or its equivalent in alternate currency) or more entered by a court or 43
courts of competent jurisdiction against any of the Credit Parties or, to the extent such judgment would be recourse to any Credit Party or any of their respective Consolidated Subsidiaries (other than judgments as to which, and only to the extent, a reputable insurance company has acknowledged coverage of such claim in writing or which have been paid or stayed). (r) No Default. No Event of Default or, to the best of AMB LP's knowledge, Default exists under or with respect to any Loan Document and no Credit Party is in default in any material respect beyond any applicable grace period under or with respect to any other material agreement, instrument or undertaking to which it is a party or by which it or any of its property is bound in any respect, the existence of which default is likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect. (s) Licenses, etc. Each Credit Party has obtained and does hold in full force and effect, all franchises, licenses, permits, certificates, authorizations, qualifications, accreditation, easements, rights of way and other consents and approvals which are necessary for the operation of its businesses as presently conducted, the absence of which is likely to have a Material Adverse Effect. (t) Compliance With Law. To AMB LP's knowledge, each Credit Party and each of their respective Real Property Assets are in compliance with all laws, rules, regulations, orders, judgments, writs and decrees, including, without limitation, all building and zoning ordinances and codes, the failure to comply with which is likely to have a Material Adverse Effect. (u) No Burdensome Restrictions. Except as may have been disclosed by the AMP LP in writing to the Banks, no Credit Party is a party to any agreement or instrument or subject to any other obligation or any charter or corporate or partnership restriction, as the case may be, which, individually or in the aggregate, is likely to have a Material Adverse Effect. (v) Brokers' Fees. No Credit Party has dealt with any broker or finder with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise in connection with this Agreement, and no Credit Party has done any act, had any negotiations or conversation, or made any agreements or promises which will in any way create or give rise to any obligation or liability for the payment by any such party of any brokerage fee, charge, commission or other compensation to any party with respect to the transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents, other than the fees payable to the Administrative Agent and the Banks, and certain other Persons as previously disclosed in writing to the Administrative Agent.

regarding such action. As used herein the term "Second Tier Funding Loan" means any loans made to an International FinCo by AMB LP, any Financing Partnerships of AMB LP and/or any other Person with an equity interest in such International FinCo (or affiliates of such other Person) so long as (x) AMB LP's direct or indirect share of the combined loans of AMB LP, any Financing Partnership and/or such other Persons (or affiliates thereof) to the International FinCo is the same or greater than Guarantors' Share of the applicable Non-US Property Owner, and (y) all such loans are pari passu and any remedies that may be exercised in connection with enforcement of such loans may only be exercised concurrently or not at all.

In such event, unless Borrower notifies the Administrative Agent on or before the second (2nd) Tokyo Business Day before, but excluding, the date of any TIBOR Borrowing for which a Notice of Borrowing has previously been given that it elects not to borrow on such date, such Borrowing shall instead be made as a Base Rate Borrowing. SECTION 8.2. Illegality.

With respect to TIBOR Loans, before giving any notice to the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 8.2, such Bank shall designate a different Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for giving such notice and will not, in the judgment of such Bank, be 67
otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank. If such Bank shall determine that it may not lawfully continue to maintain and fund any of its outstanding TIBOR Loans to maturity and shall so specify in such notice, such TIBOR Loan shall be converted as of such date to a Base Rate Loan (without payment of any amounts that Borrower would otherwise be obligated to pay pursuant to Section 2.15 hereof with respect to Loans converted pursuant to this Section 8.2) in an equal principal amount from such Bank (on which interest and principal shall be payable contemporaneously with the related TIBOR Loans of the other Banks), and such Bank shall make such a Base Rate Loan. If at any time, it shall be unlawful for any Bank to make, maintain or fund its TIBOR Loans, Borrower shall have the right, upon five (5) Tokyo Business Day's notice to the Administrative Agent, to either (x) cause a bank, reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent, to offer to purchase the Commitments of such Bank for an amount equal to such Bank's outstanding Loans, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon, and to become a Bank hereunder, or obtain the agreement of one or more existing Banks to offer to purchase the Commitments of such Bank for such amount, which offer such Bank is hereby required to accept, or (y) to repay in full all Loans then outstanding of such Bank, together with interest due thereon and any and all fees due hereunder, upon which event, such Bank's Commitments shall be deemed to be canceled. SECTION 8.3. Increased Cost and Reduced Return. (a) If, on or after the date hereof, the adoption of any applicable law, rule or regulation, or any change in any applicable law, rule or regulation, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any Bank (or its Lending Office) with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) made at the Closing Date of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency shall impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve (including, without limitation, any such requirement imposed by the Japanese Central Bank), special deposit, insurance assessment or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Bank (or its Lending Office) or shall impose on any Bank (or its Lending Office) or on the interbank market any other condition materially more burdensome in nature, extent or consequence than those in existence as of the Loan Effective Date affecting such Bank's TIBOR Loans, or its obligation to make TIBOR Loans, and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Bank (or its Lending Office) of making or maintaining any TIBOR Loan, or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Bank (or its Lending Office) under this Agreement with respect to such TIBOR Loans, by an amount deemed by such Bank to be material, then, within 15 days after demand by such Bank (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), Borrower shall pay to such Bank such additional amount or amounts attributable to the TIBOR Loans made to Borrower (based upon a reasonable allocation thereof by such Bank to the TIBOR Loans made by such Bank hereunder) as will compensate such Bank for such increased cost or reduction to the extent such Bank generally imposes such additional amounts on other borrowers of such Bank in similar circumstances. 68
(b) If any Bank shall have reasonably determined that, after the date hereof, the adoption of any applicable law, rule or regulation regarding capital adequacy, or any change in any such law, rule or regulation, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or any request or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) made after the Closing Date of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on capital of such Bank (or its Parent) as a consequence of such Bank's obligations hereunder to a level below that which such Bank (or its Parent) could have achieved but for such adoption, change, request or directive (taking into consideration its policies with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount reasonably deemed by such Bank to be material, then from time to time, within 15 days after demand by such Bank (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), Borrower shall pay to such Bank such additional amount or amounts attributable to the TIBOR Loans made to Borrower as will compensate such Bank (or its Parent) for such reduction to the extent such Bank generally imposes such additional amounts on other borrowers of such Bank in similar circumstances. (c) Each Bank will promptly notify Borrower and the Administrative Agent of any event of which it has knowledge, occurring after the date hereof, which will entitle such Bank to compensation pursuant to this Section 8.3 and will designate a different Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, such compensation and will not, in the reasonable judgment of such Bank, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank. If such Bank shall fail to notify Borrower of any such event within ninety (90) days following the end of the month during which such event occurred, then Borrower's and Guarantor's liability for any amounts described in this Section 8.3 incurred by such Bank as a result of such event shall be limited to those attributable to the period occurring subsequent to the ninetieth (90th) day prior to, but excluding, the date upon which such Bank actually notified Borrower of the occurrence of such event. A certificate of any Bank claiming compensation under this Section 8.3 and setting forth a reasonably detailed calculation of the additional amount or amounts to be paid to it hereunder shall be conclusive in the absence of demonstrable error. In determining such amount, such Bank may use any reasonable averaging and attribution methods. (d) If at any time, any Bank shall be owed amounts pursuant to this Section 8.3, Borrower shall have the right, upon five (5) Tokyo Business Day's notice to the Administrative Agent to either (x) cause a bank, reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent, to offer to purchase the Commitments of such Bank for an amount equal to such Bank's outstanding Loans, and to become a Bank hereunder, or to obtain the agreement of one or more existing Banks to offer to purchase the Commitments of such Bank for such amount, which offer such Bank is hereby required to accept, or (y) to repay in full all Loans then outstanding of such Bank, together with interest and all other amounts due thereon, upon which event, such Bank's Commitment shall be deemed to be canceled. SECTION 8.4. Taxes. 69
(a) Any and all payments by a Credit Party to or for the account of any Bank or the Administrative Agent hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any and all present or future taxes, duties, levies, imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings, and all liabilities with respect thereto, excluding, in the case of each Bank and the Administrative Agent, taxes imposed on its income, and franchise taxes imposed on it, by the jurisdiction under the laws of which such Bank or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) is organized or any political subdivision thereof and, in the case of each Bank, taxes imposed on its income, and franchise or similar taxes imposed on it, by the jurisdiction of such Bank's Lending Office or any political subdivision thereof or by any other jurisdiction (or any political subdivision thereof) as a result of a present or former connection between such Bank or Administrative Agent and such other jurisdiction or by the United States (all such non-excluded taxes, duties, levies, imposts, deductions, charges, withholdings and liabilities being hereinafter referred to as "Non-Excluded Taxes"). If a Credit Party shall be required by law to deduct any Non-Excluded Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder, (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including, without limitation, deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 8.4) such Bank or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Credit Party shall make such deductions, (iii) the Credit Party shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance with applicable law and (iv) the Credit Party shall furnish to the Administrative Agent, at its address referred to in Section 9.1, the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof. (b) In addition, Borrower agrees to pay any present or future stamp or documentary taxes and any other excise or property taxes, or charges or similar levies which arise from any payment made hereunder or under any other Loan Document of Borrower or from the execution or delivery of, or otherwise with respect to, this Agreement, any other Loan Documents of Borrower (hereinafter referred to as "Other Taxes"). (c) In the event that Non-Excluded Taxes not imposed on the Closing Date are imposed, or Non-Excluded Taxes imposed on the Closing Date increase, the applicable Bank shall notify the Administrative Agent and the Credit Parties of such event in writing within a reasonable period following receipt of knowledge thereof. If such Bank shall fail to notify the Credit Parties of any such event within ninety (90) days following the end of the month during which such event occurred, then such Credit Parties' liability for such additional Non-Excluded Taxes incurred by such Bank as a result of such event (including payment of a make-whole amount under Section 8.4(a)(i)) shall be limited to those attributable to the period occurring subsequent to the ninetieth (90th) day prior to, but excluding, the date upon which such Bank actually notified the Credit Parties of the occurrence of such event. (d) Borrower agrees to indemnify each Bank and the Administrative Agent for the full amount of Non-Excluded Taxes or Other Taxes for which Borrower is liable under this Section 8.4 (including, without limitation, any Non-Excluded Taxes or 70
Other Taxes imposed or asserted by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this Section 8.4) paid by such Bank or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) and, so long as such Bank or Administrative Agent has promptly paid any such Non-Excluded Taxes or Other Taxes, any liability for penalties and interest arising therefrom or with respect thereto. This indemnification shall be made within 15 days from the date such Bank or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) makes demand therefor. (e) Each Bank confirms to the Administrative Agent and to each Credit Party (on the date hereof or, in the case of a Bank which becomes a party hereto pursuant to a transfer or assignment, on the date on which the relevant transfer or assignment becomes effective) that it is Qualified Institutional Investor and each Bank shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent and each Credit Party if there is any change in its status as a Qualified Institutional Investor. (f) Each Bank will promptly on request by Borrower take all reasonable steps (if any) required to be taken to establish entitlement to exemption for Borrower from withholding under any applicable Japanese laws and any applicable double tax treaty, including satisfying any reasonable information, reporting or other requirement and completion and filing of relevant forms, claims, declarations and similar documents and shall provide Borrower with copies of all forms, claims, declarations and similar documents filed for such purpose. (g) Each Bank which is established under the laws of a jurisdiction other than Japan and which is acting hereunder through a Lending Office in Japan agrees that it shall, if necessary, from time to time obtain from the relevant tax authorities a certificate certifying that such payment constitutes domestic source income (as provided for in Article 180 of the Income Tax Law of Japan (Law No. 33, 1965)) and deliver such certificate to Borrower as required by Article 180, unless prevented from so doing as a result of the introduction of, or any change in, or any change in the interpretation or the application of, any law or regulation or as a result of compliance with any law or regulation made after the date of this Agreement. Upon reasonable demand by any Credit Party to the Administrative Agent or any Bank, the Administrative Agent or Bank, as the case may be, shall deliver to the Credit Party, or to such government or taxing authority as the Credit Party may reasonably direct, any form or document that may be required or reasonably requested in writing in order to allow the Credit Party to make a payment to or for the account of such Bank or the Administrative Agent hereunder or under any other Loan Document without any deduction or withholding for or on account of any Non-Excluded Taxes or with such deduction or withholding at a reduced rate (so long as the completion, execution or submission of such form or document would not materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of the party in receipt of such demand), with any such form or document to be accurate and completed in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the Credit Party making such demand and to be executed and to be delivered with any reasonably required certification. (h) For any period with respect to which a Bank has failed to provide Borrower with the appropriate form pursuant to Section 8.4(g) (unless such failure is due to a change in treaty, law or regulation occurring subsequent to the date on which a form 71
originally was required to be provided), such Bank shall not be entitled to indemnification under Section 8.4(d) with respect to Non-Excluded Taxes; provided, however, that should a Bank, which is otherwise exempt from or subject to a reduced rate of withholding tax, become subject to Non-Excluded Taxes because of its failure to deliver a form required hereunder, Borrower shall take such steps as such Bank shall reasonably request to assist such Bank to recover such Taxes so long as Borrower shall incur no cost or liability as a result thereof. (i) If Borrower is required to pay additional amounts to or for the account of any Bank pursuant to this Section 8.4, then such Bank will change the jurisdiction of its Lending Office so as to eliminate or reduce any such additional payment which may thereafter accrue if such change, in the judgment of such Bank, is not otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank. (j) If at any time, any Bank shall be owed amounts pursuant to this Section 8.4, Borrower shall have the right, upon five (5) Tokyo Business Day's notice to the Administrative Agent to either (x) cause a bank, reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent, to offer to purchase the Commitments of such Bank for an amount equal to such Bank's outstanding Loans, and to become a Bank hereunder, or to obtain the agreement of one or more existing Banks to offer to purchase the Commitments of such Bank for such amount, which offer such Bank is hereby required to accept, or (y) to repay in full all Loans then outstanding of such Bank, together with interest and all other amounts due thereon, upon which event, such Bank's Commitment shall be deemed to be canceled. SECTION 8.5. Base Rate Loans Substituted for Affected TIBOR Loans. If (i) the obligation of any Bank to make TIBOR Loans has been suspended pursuant to Section 8.2 or (ii) any Bank has demanded compensation under Section 8.3 or 8.4 with respect to its TIBOR Loans and Borrower shall, by at least five (5) Tokyo Business Days' prior notice to such Bank through the Administrative Agent, have elected that the provisions of this Section 8.5 shall apply to such Bank, then, unless and until such Bank notifies Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension or demand for compensation no longer exist: (a) all Loans which would otherwise be made by such Bank to Borrower as TIBOR Loans shall be deemed made instead as Base Rate Loans; and (b) after each of its TIBOR Loans has been repaid, all payments of principal which would otherwise be applied to repay such TIBOR Loans shall be applied to repay its Base Rate Loans instead, and (c) Borrower will not be required to make any payment which would otherwise be required by Section 2.15 with respect to such TIBOR Loans converted to Base Rate Loans pursuant to clause (a) above. 72
ARTICLE IX MISCELLANEOUS SECTION 9.1. Notices. All notices, requests and other communications to any party hereunder shall be in writing (including bank wire, telex, facsimile transmission followed by telephonic confirmation or similar writing) and shall be given to such party: (x) in the case of each of the Credit Parties, to such Credit Party at its address, telex number or facsimile number set forth on Exhibit D attached hereto, (y) in the case of the Administrative Agent, at its address, telex number or facsimile number set forth on Exhibit D attached hereto, or (z) in the case of any Bank, at its address, telex number or facsimile number set forth in its Administrative Questionnaire. The Administrative Agent agrees to provide AMB LP with the address, telex number or facsimile number for each Bank.

SECTION 9.2. No Waivers. No failure or delay by the Administrative Agent or any Bank in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by law. SECTION 9.3. Expenses; Indemnification. (a) The Guarantors and, in the case of clause (iii) below, each Credit Party (provided Borrower shall only be liable for the enforcement costs incurred with respect to the Loan Documents to which Borrower is a party, provided, further, the Guarantors shall be liable for all enforcement costs incurred with respect to all of the Loan Documents) shall pay within thirty (30) days after written notice from the Administrative Agent, (i) all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses of the Administrative Agent (including, without limitation, reasonable fees and disbursements of special counsel Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP ), in connection with the preparation of this Agreement, the Loan Documents and the documents and instruments referred to therein, and any waiver or consent hereunder or any amendment hereof or any Default or alleged Default hereunder, (ii) all reasonable fees and disbursements of special counsel in connection with the syndication of the Loans, and (iii) if an Event of Default 73
occurs, all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent and each Bank, including, without limitation, fees and disbursements of counsel for the Administrative Agent and each of the Banks, in connection with the enforcement of the Loan Documents including, without limitation, the Mortgages and such Event of Default and collection, bankruptcy, insolvency and other enforcement proceedings resulting therefrom; provided, however, that the attorneys' fees and disbursements for which any Credit Party is obligated under this subsection (a)(iii) shall be limited to the reasonable non-duplicative fees and disbursements of (A) counsel for Administrative Agent and (B) counsel for all of the Banks as a group; and provided, further, that all other costs and expenses for which any Credit Party is obligated under this subsection (a)(iii) shall be limited to the reasonable non-duplicative costs and expenses of Administrative Agent. For purposes of this Section 9.3(a)(iii), (1) counsel for Administrative Agent shall mean a single outside law firm representing Administrative Agent and (2) counsel for all of the Banks as a group shall mean a single outside law firm representing such Banks as a group (which law firm may or may not be the same law firm representing the Administrative Agent). (b) Borrower agrees to indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Bank, their respective affiliates and the respective directors, officers, agents and employees of the foregoing (each an "Indemnitee") and hold each Indemnitee harmless from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, costs and expenses of any kind, including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel, which may be incurred by such Indemnitee in connection with any investigative, administrative or judicial proceeding that may at any time (including, without limitation, at any time following the payment of the Obligations) be asserted against any Indemnitee, as a result of, or arising out of, or in any way related to or by reason of, (i) any of the transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents or the execution, delivery or performance of any Loan Document, (ii) any violation by Borrower or its Environmental Affiliates of any applicable Environmental Law, (iii) any Environmental Claim arising out of the management, use, control, ownership or operation of property or assets by Borrower or any of its Environmental Affiliates, including, without limitation, all on-site and off-site activities of Borrower or any of its Environmental Affiliate involving Materials of Environmental Concern, (iv) the breach of any environmental representation or warranty of Borrower and/or any Guarantor set forth herein, but excluding those liabilities, losses, damages, costs and expenses (a) for which such Indemnitee has been compensated pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, (b) incurred solely by reason of the gross negligence, willful misconduct bad faith or fraud of any Indemnitee as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, (c) arising from violations of Environmental Laws relating to a Property which are caused by the act or omission of such Indemnitee after such Indemnitee takes possession of such Property or (d) owing by such Indemnitee to any third party based upon contractual obligations of such Indemnitee owing to such third party which are not expressly set forth in the Loan Documents. In addition, the indemnification set forth in this Section 9.3(b) in favor of any director, officer, agent or employee of Administrative Agent or any Bank shall be solely in their respective capacities as such director, officer, agent or employee. Borrower's obligations under this Section 9.3 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Obligations. Without limitation of the other provisions of this Section 9.3, Borrower shall 74
indemnify and hold each of the Administrative Agent and the Banks free and harmless from and against all loss, costs (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses), expenses, taxes, and damages (including consequential damages) that the Administrative Agent and the Banks may suffer or incur by reason of the investigation, defense and settlement of claims and in obtaining any prohibited transaction exemption under ERISA or the Code necessary in the Administrative Agent's reasonable judgment by reason of the inaccuracy of the representations and warranties of Borrower and/or any Guarantor, or a breach by Borrower and/or any Guarantor of the provisions, set forth in Section 4.1(f)(ii). SECTION 9.4. Sharing of Set-Offs. In addition to any rights now or hereafter granted under applicable law or otherwise, and not by way of limitation of any such rights, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default, each Bank is hereby authorized at any time or from time to time, without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind to any Credit Party or to any other Person, any such notice being hereby expressly waived, but subject to the prior consent of the Administrative Agent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, to set off and to appropriate and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) and any other indebtedness at any time held or owing by such Bank (including, without limitation, by branches and agencies of such Bank wherever located) to or for the credit or the account of, any Credit Party against and on account of the Obligations of any Credit Party then due and payable to such Bank under this Agreement or under any of the other Loan Documents, including, without limitation, all interests in Obligations purchased by such Bank. Each Bank agrees that if it shall by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, receive payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of principal and interest due with respect to any Loans advanced by it, which is greater than the proportion received by any other Bank, the Bank receiving such proportionately greater payment shall purchase such participations in the Loans made by the other Banks, and such other adjustments shall be made, as may be required so that all such payments of principal and interest with respect to the Loans made by the Banks shall be shared by the Banks pro rata; provided that nothing in this Section 9.4 shall impair the right of any Bank to exercise any right of set-off or counterclaim it may have to any deposits not received in connection with the Loans and to apply the amount subject to such exercise to the payment of indebtedness of any Credit Party other than its indebtedness under the Loans or the Guaranty. Each Credit Party agrees, to the fullest extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any holder of a participation in a Loan, whether or not acquired pursuant to the foregoing arrangements, may exercise rights of set-off or counterclaim and other rights with respect to such participation as fully as if such holder of a participation were a direct creditor of such Credit Party in the amount of such participation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any Bank may, by separate agreement with a Credit Party, waive its right to set off contained herein or granted by law and any such written waiver shall be effective against such Bank under this Section 9.4. SECTION 9.5. Amendments and Waivers. 75
(a) Except as provided below in Section 9.5(b), any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Documents may be amended or waived if, but only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and is signed by the Credit Parties and the Majority Banks (and, if the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent in its capacity as Administrative Agent are affected thereby, by the Administrative Agent); provided that (A) no amendment or waiver of the provisions of, or waiver of a default under, Article V (including, without limitation, any of the definitions of the defined terms used in Article V or any change in the notice and cure periods, if any, described in Section 6.1 and applicable to defaults under Article V), other than the provisions of Section 5.8(h) requiring Majority Bank consent, shall be effective unless signed (or otherwise consented to) by the Credit Parties and the Required Banks and (B) no amendment or waiver with respect to this Agreement or any other Loan Documents shall, unless signed by all the Banks, (i) increase or decrease the Commitment of any Bank (except for a ratable decrease in the Commitments of all Banks) or subject any Bank to any additional obligation, (ii) reduce the principal of or rate of interest on any Loan or any fees hereunder, (iii) postpone the date fixed for any payment of principal of or interest on any Loan or any fees hereunder or for any reduction or termination of any Commitment, (iv) change the percentage of the Commitments or of the aggregate unpaid principal amount of the Loans, or the number of Banks, which shall be required for the Banks or any of them to take any action under this Section 9.5(a) or any other provision of this Agreement, (v) release the Guaranty or (vi) modify the provisions of this Section 9.5. (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the Guarantors or the Existing Credit Agreement Agent propose to modify, waive or restate, or request a consent or approval with respect to, the financial covenants, reporting requirements or non-monetary Events of Default (and related definitions) of the Existing Credit Agreement in writing (which may include a written waiver of an existing actual or potential Default or Event of Default that is intended to be eliminated by such modification, restatement or waiver) (individually, a "Covenant Modification"), simultaneously with the written submission of such proposal or request to the Existing Credit Agreement bank group (such proposal or request being the "Existing Credit Agreement Proposal"), Borrower and the Guarantors shall deliver a duplicative proposal or request for a Covenant Modification with respect to the Facility to the Administrative Agent and the Banks. Borrower shall pay the same percentage fees (if any) to the Administrative Agent and the Banks as the Guarantors shall pay to the Existing Credit Agreement Agent (or agents) and the lenders under the Existing Credit Agreement in connection with such modification, restatement, waiver, consent or approval. The decision whether to accept such Covenant Modification shall require the consent of the Required Banks hereunder unless such Covenant Modification is of the nature that would require the consent of all of the Banks; it being understood that even if the applicable Banks shall fail to consent to the Covenant Modification, the provisions of the Existing Credit Agreement, as so modified, restated or waived, or the granting of any consent or approval thereunder, in writing by the "Required Banks" (as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement) thereunder (or if applicable, all of the lenders thereunder) shall control. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall Administrative Agent and the Banks be required to accept any Covenant Modification that modifies, amends or waives the Administrative Agent's rights under this Agreement with respect to the Banks as the 76
"agent" under the Facility or subjects the Administrative Agent, as the "agent" under the Facility to any additional obligations to the Banks pursuant to this Agreement. SECTION 9.6. Successors and Assigns. (a) The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns, except that the Credit Parties may not assign or otherwise transfer any of their rights under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents without the prior written consent of all Banks and the Administrative Agent and a Bank may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its interest under this Agreement except as permitted in subsection (b) and (c) of this Section 9.6. (b) Prior to the occurrence of a Event of Default, any Bank may at any time, grant to an existing Bank, one or more banks, finance companies, insurance companies or other financial institutions which are Qualified Institutional Investors (a "Participant") in minimum amounts of not less than JPY350,000,000 (or any lesser amount in the case of participations to an existing Bank) participating interests in its Commitment or any or all of its Loans. After the occurrence and during the continuance of a Event of Default, any Bank may at any time grant to any Person in any amount (also a "Participant"), participating interests in its Commitment or any or all of its Loans. Any participation made during the continuation of a Event of Default shall not be affected by the subsequent cure of such Event of Default. In the event of any such grant by a Bank of a participating interest to a Participant, whether or not upon notice to the Credit Parties and the Administrative Agent, such Bank shall remain responsible for the performance of its obligations hereunder, and the Credit Parties and the Administrative Agent shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Bank in connection with such Bank's rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement pursuant to which any Bank may grant such a participating interest shall provide that such Bank shall retain the sole right and responsibility to enforce the obligations of the Credit Parties hereunder including, without limitation, the right to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such participation agreement may provide that such Bank will not agree to any modification, amendment, waiver, consent or approval of this Agreement described in clause (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) or (v) of Section 9.5(a) without the consent of the Participant. The Credit Parties agree that each Participant shall, to the extent provided in its participation agreement, be entitled to the benefits of Article VIII with respect to its participating interest. (c) Any Bank may at any time assign to a Qualified Institution (in each case, an "Assignee") (i) prior to the occurrence of a Event of Default, in minimum amounts of not less than JPY350,000,000 and integral multiple of JPY1,000,000 thereafter (or any lesser amount in the case of assignments to an existing Bank) and (ii) after the occurrence and during the continuance of a Event of Default, in any amount, all or a proportionate part of all, of its rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and, in either case, such Assignee shall assume such rights and obligations, pursuant to a Transfer Supplement in substantially the form of Exhibit E hereto executed by such Assignee and such transferor Bank; provided, that if no Event of 77
Default shall have occurred and be continuing, such assignment shall be subject to the Administrative Agent's and Borrower's consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; and provided further that if an Assignee is an affiliate of such transferor Bank or was a Bank immediately prior to such assignment, Borrower's consent shall not be required. Upon execution and delivery of such instrument and payment by such Assignee to such transferor Bank of an amount equal to the purchase price agreed between such transferor Bank and such Assignee, such Assignee shall be a Bank party to this Agreement and shall have all the rights and obligations of a Bank with a Commitment as set forth in such instrument of assumption, and no further consent or action by any party shall be required and the transferor Bank shall be released from its obligations hereunder to a corresponding extent. In connection with any such assignment (other than an assignment by a Bank to an affiliate), the transferor Bank shall pay to the Administrative Agent an administrative fee for processing such assignment in the amount of JPY500,000. If the Assignee is established under the laws of a jurisdiction other than Japan and is acting hereunder through a Lending Office in Japan, it shall deliver to AMB LP and the Administrative Agent a certificate from the relevant tax authorities certifying that any and all payments by a Credit Party to or for the account of the Assignee constitutes domestic source income (as provided for in Article 180 of the Income Tax Law of Japan (Law No. 33, 1965)) in accordance with Section 8.4. Any assignment made during the continuation of an Event of Default shall not be affected by any subsequent cure of such Event of Default. (d) No Assignee, Participant or other transferee of any Bank's rights shall be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 8.3 or 8.4 than such Bank would have been entitled to receive with respect to the rights transferred, unless such transfer is made with AMB LP's prior written consent or by reason of the provisions of Section 8.2, 8.3 or 8.4 requiring such Bank to designate a different Lending Office under certain circumstances or at a time when the circumstances giving rise to such greater payment did not exist. (e) No Assignee of any rights and obligations under this Agreement shall be permitted to further assign less than all of such rights and obligations. No participant in any rights and obligations under this Agreement shall be permitted to sell subparticipations of such rights and obligations. (f) Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, so long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, no Bank shall be permitted to enter into an assignment of, or sell a participation interest in, its rights and obligations hereunder which would result in such Bank holding a Commitment without participants of less than JPY350,000,000 unless as a result of a cancellation or reduction of the aggregate Commitments (or in the case of the Administrative Agent, less than the Commitment of any other Bank); provided, however, that no Bank shall be prohibited from assigning its entire Commitment so long as such assignment is otherwise permitted under this Section 9.6. SECTION 9.7. Collateral. Each of the Banks represents to the Administrative Agent and each of the other Banks that it in good faith is not relying upon 78
any "margin stock" (as defined in Regulation U) as collateral in the extension or maintenance of the credit provided for in this Agreement. SECTION 9.8. Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction; Judgment Currency. (a) THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS (EXCEPT FOR THE MORTGAGES AND ADDITIONAL MORTGAGES, WHICH SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH AND GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF JAPAN) AND THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES HEREUNDER AND THEREUNDER SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH AND BE GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK (WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO THE PRINCIPLES THEREOF RELATING TO CONFLICTS OF LAW). (b) Any legal action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement or any other Loan Document (except for the Mortgages and the Additional Mortgages) and any action for enforcement of any judgment in respect thereof may be brought in the courts of the State of New York or of the United States of America for the Southern District of New York, and, by execution and delivery of this Agreement, each Credit Party hereby accepts for itself and in respect of its property, generally and unconditionally, the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and appellate courts from any thereof. Each Credit Party irrevocably consents to the service of process out of any of the aforementioned courts in any such action or proceeding by the hand delivery, or mailing of copies thereof by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, to the Credit Parties at its address set forth below. Each Credit Party hereby irrevocably waives any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any of the aforesaid actions or proceedings arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or any such other Loan Document brought in the courts referred to above and hereby further irrevocably waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court that any such action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Nothing herein shall affect the right of the Administrative Agent to serve process in any other manner permitted by law or to commence legal proceedings or otherwise proceed against any Credit Party in any other jurisdiction. (c) If for the purpose of obtaining judgment in any court it is necessary to convert a sum due hereunder in one currency into another currency, the parties hereto agree, to the fullest extent that they may effectively do so under applicable law, that the rate of exchange used shall be the spot rate at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the first currency could be purchased in New York City with such other currency by the person obtaining such judgment on the Business Day preceding that on which final judgment is given. (d) The parties agree, to the fullest extent that they may effectively do so under applicable law, that the obligations of the Credit Parties to make payments in any currency of the principal of and interest on the Loans of Borrower and any other amounts due from each Credit Party hereunder to the Administrative Agent as provided 79
herein (i) shall not be discharged or satisfied by any tender, or any recovery pursuant to any judgment (whether or not entered in accordance with Section 9.8(c)), in any currency other than the relevant currency, except to the extent that such tender or recovery shall result in the actual receipt by the Administrative Agent at its relevant office on behalf of the Banks of the full amount of the relevant currency expressed to be payable in respect of the principal of and interest on the Loans and all other amounts due hereunder (it being assumed for purposes of this clause (i) that the Administrative Agent will convert any amount tendered or recovered into the relevant currency on the date of such tender or recovery), (ii) shall be enforceable as an alternative or additional cause of action for the purpose of recovering in the relevant currency the amount, if any, by which such actual receipt shall fall short of the full amount of the relevant currency so expressed to be payable and (iii) shall not be affected by an unrelated judgment being obtained for any other sum due under this Agreement. SECTION 9.9. Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement and understanding among the parties hereto and supersedes any and all prior agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement shall become effective upon receipt by the Administrative Agent and the Credit Parties of counterparts hereof signed by each of the parties hereto (or, in the case of any party as to which an executed counterpart shall not have been received, receipt by the Administrative Agent in form satisfactory to it of telegraphic, telex or other written confirmation from such party of execution of a counterpart hereof by such party). SECTION 9.10. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH CREDIT PARTY, THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND THE BANKS HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVE ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. SECTION 9.11. Survival. All indemnities set forth herein shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and the making and repayment of the Loans hereunder. SECTION 9.12. Intentionally Deleted. SECTION 9.13. Limitation of Liability. No claim may be made by any Credit Party or any other Person acting by or through Borrower against the Administrative Agent or any Bank or the affiliates, directors, officers, employees, attorneys or agent of any of them for any punitive damages in respect of any claim for breach of contract or any other theory of liability arising out of or related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or by the other Loan Documents, or any act, omission or event occurring in connection therewith; and Borrower hereby waives, releases and agrees not to sue upon any claim for any such damages, whether or not accrued and whether or not known or suspected to exist in its favor. 80
SECTION 9.14. Recourse Obligation. This Agreement and the Obligations hereunder are fully recourse to the Credit Parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no recourse under or upon any obligation, covenant, or agreement contained in this Agreement shall be had against any officer, director, shareholder or employee of any Credit Party or any general partner of any Credit party (other than AMB Corporation as the General Partner of AMB LP), in each case except in the event of fraud or misappropriation of funds on the part of such officer, director, shareholder or employee or such general partner. SECTION 9.15. Confidentiality. The Administrative Agent and each Bank shall use reasonable efforts to assure that information about the Credit Parties and their Subsidiaries and Investment Affiliates, and the Properties thereof and their operations, affairs and financial condition, not generally disclosed to the public, which is furnished to Administrative Agent or any Bank pursuant to the provisions hereof or any other Loan Document is used only for the purposes of this Agreement and shall not be divulged to any Person other than the Administrative Agent, the Banks, and their affiliates and respective officers, directors, employees and agents who are actively and directly participating in the evaluation, administration or enforcement of the Loan and other transactions between such Bank and the Credit Parties, except: (a) to their attorneys and accountants, (b) in connection with the enforcement of the rights and exercise of any remedies of the Administrative Agent and the Banks hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, (c) in connection with assignments and participations and the solicitation of prospective assignees and participants referred to in Section 9.6 hereof, who have agreed in writing to be bound by a confidentiality agreement substantially equivalent to the terms of this Section 9.15, and (d) as may otherwise be required or requested by any regulatory authority having jurisdiction over the Administrative Agent or any Bank or by any applicable law, rule, regulation or judicial process (but only to the extent not in violation, conflict or inconsistent with the applicable regulatory requirement, request, summons or subpoena); provided, however, that in the event a Bank receives a summons or subpoena to disclose confidential information to any party, such Bank shall, if legally permitted, endeavor to notify AMB LP thereof as soon as possible after receipt of such request, summons or subpoena and the Credit Parties shall be afforded an opportunity to seek protective orders, or such other confidential treatment of such disclosed information, as the Credit Parties and Administrative Agent may deem reasonable. SECTION 9.16. Bank's Failure to Fund. (a) If a Bank does not advance to Administrative Agent such Bank's Pro Rata Share of a Loan in accordance herewith, then neither Administrative Agent nor the other Banks shall be required or obligated to fund such Bank's Pro Rata Share of such Loan. (b) As used herein, the following terms shall have the meanings set forth below: 81
(i) "Defaulting Bank" shall mean any Bank which (x) does not advance to the Administrative Agent such Bank's Pro Rata Share of a Loan in accordance herewith for a period of five (5) Tokyo Business Days after notice of such failure from Administrative Agent, (y) shall otherwise fail to perform such Bank's obligations under the Loan Documents for a period of five (5) Tokyo Business Days after notice of such failure from Administrative Agent, or (z) shall fail to pay the Administrative Agent or any other Bank, as the case may be, upon demand, such Bank's Pro Rata Share of any costs, expenses or disbursements incurred or made by the Administrative Agent pursuant to the terms of the Loan Documents for a period of five (5) Tokyo Business Days after notice of such failure from Administrative Agent, and in all cases, such failure is not as a result of a good faith dispute as to whether such advance is properly required to be made pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement, or as to whether such other performance or payment is properly required pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement. (ii) "Junior Creditor" means any Defaulting Bank which has not (x) fully cured each and every default on its part under the Loan Documents and (y) unconditionally tendered to the Administrative Agent such Defaulting Bank's Pro Rata Share of all costs, expenses and disbursements required to be paid or reimbursed pursuant to the terms of the Loan Documents. (iii) "Payment in Full" means, as of any date, the receipt by the Banks who are not Junior Creditors of an amount of cash, in Yen, sufficient to indefeasibly pay in full all Senior Debt. (iv) "Senior Debt" means (x) collectively, any and all indebtedness, obligations and liabilities of any Credit Party to the Banks who are not Junior Creditors from time to time, whether fixed or contingent, direct or indirect, joint or several, due or not due, liquidated or unliquidated, determined or undetermined, arising by contract, operation of law or otherwise, whether on open account or evidenced by one or more instruments, and whether for principal, premium, interest (including, without limitation, interest accruing after the filing of a petition initiating any proceeding referred to in Section 6.1(e) or (f)), reimbursement for fees, indemnities, costs, expenses or otherwise, which arise under, in connection with or in respect of the Loans or the Loan Documents, and (y) any and all deferrals, renewals, extensions and refundings of, or amendments, restatements, rearrangements, modifications or supplements to, any such indebtedness, obligation or liability. (v) "Subordinated Debt" means (x) any and all indebtedness, obligations and liabilities of any Credit Party to one or more Junior Creditors from time to time, whether fixed or contingent, direct or indirect, joint or several, due or not due, liquidated or unliquidated, determined or undetermined, arising by contract, operation of law or otherwise, whether on open account or evidenced by one or more instruments, and whether for principal, premium, interest (including, without limitation, interest accruing after the filing of a petition initiating any proceeding referred to in Section 6.1(e) or (f)), reimbursement for fees, indemnities, costs, expenses or otherwise, which arise under, in connection with or in respect of the Loans or the Loan Documents, and (y) any and all deferrals, renewals, extensions and refundings of, or amendments, restatements, 82
rearrangements, modifications or supplements to, any such indebtedness, obligation or liability. (c) Immediately upon a Bank's becoming a Junior Creditor and until such time as such Bank shall have cured all applicable defaults, no Junior Creditor shall, prior to Payment in Full of all Senior Debt: (i) accelerate, demand payment of, sue upon, collect, or receive any payment upon, in any manner, or satisfy or otherwise discharge, any Subordinated Debt, whether for principal, interest and otherwise; (ii) take or enforce any Liens to secure Subordinated Debt or attach or levy upon any assets of any Credit Party, to enforce any Subordinated Debt; (iii) enforce or apply any security for any Subordinated Debt; or (iv) incur any debt or liability, or the like, to, or receive any loan, return of capital, advance, gift or any other property, from, any Credit Party. (d) In the event of: (i) any insolvency, bankruptcy, receivership, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization, readjustment, composition or other similar proceeding relating to any Credit Party; (ii) any liquidation, dissolution or other winding-up of any Credit Party, voluntary or involuntary, whether or not involving insolvency, reorganization or bankruptcy proceedings; (iii) any assignment by any Credit Party for the benefit of creditors; (iv) any sale or other transfer of all or substantially all assets of any Credit Party; or (v) any other marshaling of the assets of any Credit Party; each of the Banks shall first have received Payment in Full of all Senior Debt before any payment or distribution, whether in cash, securities or other property, shall be made in respect of or upon any Subordinated Debt; provided, however, that if a Japanese court does not uphold the foregoing agreement contained in this sentence and applies different rules of distribution in the insolvency proceedings of the Borrower or the judicial foreclosure of the Mortgage, the parties shall comply with the rules of distribution adopted by such court and the last sentence of this paragraph shall apply. Any payment or distribution, whether in cash, securities or other property that would otherwise be payable or deliverable in respect of Subordinated Debt to any Junior Creditor but for this Agreement shall be paid or delivered directly to the Administrative Agent for distribution to the Banks in accordance with this Agreement until Payment in Full of all Senior Debt; 83
provided, however, that if a Japanese court does not permit the direct delivery to the Administrative Agent of the amount deliverable to any Junior Creditor in the context of the insolvency proceeding of the Borrower or the judicial foreclosure of the Mortgage, the next sentence shall apply. If any Junior Creditor receives any such payment or distribution, it shall promptly pay over or deliver the same to the Administrative Agent for application in accordance with the preceding sentence. (e) Each Junior Creditor shall file in any bankruptcy or other proceeding of any Credit Party in which the filing of claims is required by law, all claims relating to Subordinated Debt that such Junior Creditor may have against any Credit Party and assign to the Banks who are not Junior Creditors all rights of such Junior Creditor thereunder. If such Junior Creditor does not file any such claim prior to forty-five (45) days before the expiration of the time to file such claim, Administrative Agent, as attorney-in-fact for such Junior Creditor, is hereby irrevocably authorized to do so in the name of such Junior Creditor or, in Administrative Agent's sole discretion, to assign the claim to a nominee and to cause proof of claim to be filed in the name of such nominee. The foregoing power of attorney is coupled with an interest and cannot be revoked. The Administrative Agent shall, to the exclusion of each Junior Creditor (insofar as permitted by the applicable Governmental Rules), have the sole right, subject to Section 9.5 hereof, to accept or reject any plan proposed in any such proceeding and to take any other action that a party filing a claim is entitled to take. In all such cases, whether in administration, bankruptcy or otherwise, the Person or Persons authorized to pay such claim shall pay to Administrative Agent the amount payable on such claim and, to the full extent necessary for that purpose, each Junior Creditor hereby transfers and assigns to the Administrative Agent all of the Junior Creditor's rights to any such payments or distributions to which Junior Creditor would otherwise be entitled. (f) (i) If any payment or distribution of any character or any security, whether in cash, securities or other property, shall be received by any Junior Creditor in contravention of any of the terms hereof, such payment or distribution or security shall be received in trust for the benefit of, and shall promptly be paid over or delivered and transferred to, Administrative Agent for application to the payment of all Senior Debt, to the extent necessary to achieve Payment in Full. In the event of the failure of any Junior Creditor to endorse or assign any such payment, distribution or security, Administrative Agent is hereby irrevocably authorized to endorse or assign the same as attorney-in-fact for such Junior Creditor. (ii) Each Junior Creditor shall take such action (including, without limitation, the execution and filing of a financing statement with respect to this Agreement and the execution, verification, delivery and filing of proofs of claim, consents, assignments or other instructions that Administrative Agent may require from time to time in order to prove or realize upon any rights or claims pertaining to Subordinated Debt or to effectuate the full benefit of the subordination contained herein) as may, in Administrative Agent's sole and absolute discretion, be necessary or desirable to assure the effectiveness of the subordination effected by this Agreement. 84
(g) (i) Each Bank that becomes a Junior Creditor understands and acknowledges by its execution hereof that each other Bank is entering into this Agreement and the Loan Documents in reliance upon the absolute subordination in right of payment and in time of payment of Subordinated Debt to Senior Debt as set forth herein. (ii) Only upon the Payment in Full of all Senior Debt shall any Junior Creditor be subrogated to any remaining rights of the Banks which are not Defaulting Banks to receive payments or distributions of assets of Borrower made on or applicable to any Senior Debt. (iii) Each Junior Creditor agrees that it will deliver all instruments or other writings evidencing any Subordinated Debt held by it to Administrative Agent, promptly after request therefor by the Administrative Agent. (iv) No Junior Creditor may at any time sell, assign or otherwise transfer any Subordinated Debt, or any portion thereof, including, without limitation, the granting of any Lien thereon, unless and until satisfaction of the requirements of Section 9.6 above and the proposed transferee shall have assumed in writing the obligation of the Junior Creditor to the Banks under this Agreement, in a form acceptable to the Administrative Agent. (v) If any of the Senior Debt, should be invalidated, avoided or set aside, the subordination provided for herein nevertheless shall continue in full force and effect and, as between the Banks which are not Defaulting Banks and all Junior Creditors, shall be and be deemed to remain in full force and effect. (vi) Each Junior Creditor hereby irrevocably waives, in respect of Subordinated Debt, all rights (x) under Sections 361 through 365, 502(e) and 509 of the Bankruptcy Code (or any similar sections hereafter in effect under Japanese national or local law or any other Federal or state laws or legal or equitable principles relating to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganizations, liquidations or otherwise for the relief of debtors or protection of creditors), and (y) to seek or obtain conversion to a different type of proceeding or to seek or obtain dismissal of a proceeding, in each case in relation to a bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency or other proceeding under similar laws with respect to any Credit Party. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Junior Creditor hereby specifically waives (A) the right to seek to give credit (secured or otherwise) to any Credit Party in any way under Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code (or any similar sections hereafter in effect under Japanese national or local law or any other Federal or state laws or legal or equitable principles relating to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganizations, liquidations or otherwise for the relief of debtors or protection of creditors) unless the same is subordinated in all respects to Senior Debt in a manner acceptable to Administrative Agent in its sole and absolute discretion and (B) the right to receive any collateral security (including, without limitation, any "super priority" or equal or "priming" or replacement Lien) for any Subordinated Debt unless the Banks which are not Defaulting Banks have received a senior position acceptable to the Banks in their sole 85
and absolute discretion to secure all Senior Debt (in the same collateral to the extent collateral is involved). (h) (i) In addition to and not in limitation of the subordination effected by this Section 9.16, the Administrative Agent and each of the Banks which are not Defaulting Banks may in their respective sole and absolute discretion, also exercise any and all other rights and remedies available at law or in equity in respect of a Defaulting Bank; and (ii) The Administrative Agent shall give each of the Banks notice of the occurrence of a default under this Section 9.16 by a Defaulting Bank and if the Administrative Agent and/or one or more of the other Banks shall, at their option, fund any amounts required to be paid or advanced by a Defaulting Bank, the other Banks who have elected not to fund any portion of such amounts shall not be liable for any reimbursements to the Administrative Agent and/or to such other funding Banks. (i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained or implied herein, a Defaulting Bank shall not be entitled to vote on any matter as to which a vote by the Banks is required hereunder, including, without limitation, any actions or consents on the part of the Administrative Agent as to which the approval or consent of all the Banks or the Required Banks or Majority Banks is required under Article VIII, Section 9.5 or elsewhere, so long as such Bank is a Defaulting Bank; provided, however, that in the case of any vote requiring the unanimous consent of the Banks, if all the Banks other than the Defaulting Bank shall have voted in accordance with each other, then the Defaulting Bank shall be deemed to have voted in accordance with such Banks. (j) Each of the Administrative Agent and any one or more of the Banks which are not Defaulting Banks may, at their respective option, (i) advance to Borrower such Bank's Pro Rata Share of the Loans not advanced by a Defaulting Bank in accordance with the Loan Documents, or (ii) pay to the Administrative Agent such Bank's Pro Rata Share of any costs, expenses or disbursements incurred or made by the Administrative Agent pursuant to the terms of this Agreement not theretofore paid by a Defaulting Bank. Immediately upon the making of any such advance by the Administrative Agent or any one of the Banks, such Bank's Pro Rata Share and the Pro Rata Share of the Defaulting Bank shall be recalculated to reflect such advance. All payments, repayments and other disbursements of funds by the Administrative Agent to the Banks shall thereupon and, at all times thereafter be made in accordance with such Bank's recalculated Pro Rata Share unless and until a Defaulting Bank shall fully cure all defaults on the part of such Defaulting Bank under the Loan Documents or otherwise existing in respect of the Loans or this Agreement, at which time the Pro Rata Share of the Bank(s) which advanced sums on behalf of the Defaulting Bank and of the Defaulting Bank shall be restored to their original percentages. SECTION 9.17. Banks' ERISA Covenant. Each Bank, by its signature hereto or on the applicable Transfer Supplement, hereby agrees (a) that on the date any Loan is disbursed hereunder no portion of such Bank's Pro Rata Share of such Loan will constitute "assets" within the meaning of 29 C.F.R. Section 2510.3-101 of an "employee benefit 86
plan" within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA or a "plan" within the meaning of Section 4975(e)(1) of the Code, and (b) that following such date such Bank shall not allocate such Bank's Pro Rata Share of any Loan to an account of such Bank if such allocation (i) by itself would cause such Pro Rata Share of such Loan to then constitute "assets" (within the meaning of 29 C.F.R. Section 2510.3-101) of an "employee benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA or a "plan" within the meaning of Section 4975(e)(1) of the Code and (ii) by itself would cause such Loan to constitute a prohibited transaction under ERISA or the Code (which is not exempt from the restrictions of Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code and the taxes and penalties imposed by Section 4975 of the Code and Section 502(i) of ERISA) or Administrative Agent or any Bank being deemed in violation of Section 404 of ERISA. SECTION 9.18. Bank Ceasing to be a Qualified Institutional Investor. (a) Each Bank agrees that it shall immediately provide notice to the Administrative Agent and Borrower upon its receipt of knowledge that it will cease to be a Qualified Institutional Investor pursuant to the applicable laws of Japan. (b) In the event that during the Term any Bank ceases to be a Qualified Institutional Investor (such Bank, the "Non-QII Bank"), (i) the Non-QII Bank shall immediately provide notice thereof to the Administrative Agent and Borrower (to the extent the Non-QII Bank has not already provided such notice pursuant to 9.18(a) above) and (ii) regardless of whether the Non-QII Bank has actually delivered any such notice to the Administrative Agent and/or Borrower, the Administrative Agent shall have the immediate right, and shall use best efforts, to cause the Non-QII Bank to assign to a Qualified Institution all of the Non-QII Bank's rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents in accordance with Section 9.6(c), subject to the terms and conditions of Article 9.6, as applicable. (c) In the event the Administrative Agent is unable to cause the assignment of the Non-QII Bank's rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and provided that the total amount of Commitments outstanding with respect all of the Banks other than the Non-QII Bank (such Banks, the "QII Banks") exceeds the total outstanding Loans of the Non-QII Bank as of such date, Borrower shall be deemed to have made a Base Rate Borrowing for the amount of such outstanding Commitments necessary to pay in full the total outstanding Loans of the Non-QII Bank (and Borrower shall be deemed to have timely given a Notice of Borrowing pursuant to Section 2.2 and all other conditions to such Borrowing shall be deemed waived or satisfied). Such Borrowing shall be used to pay the Non-QII Bank's Loans in full. Upon payment in full of the Loans of the Non-QII Bank, the Non-QII Bank shall cease to be a Bank hereunder. (d) In the event the Administrative Agent is unable to cause the assignment of the Non-QII Bank's rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and the total outstanding Loans of the Non-QII Bank exceed the total amount of Commitments outstanding with respect all of the QII Banks as of such date, Borrower shall be deemed to have made a Base Rate Borrowing for the total amount 87
of such outstanding Commitments (and Borrower shall be deemed to have timely given a Notice of Borrowing pursuant to Section 2.2 and all other conditions to such Borrowing shall be deemed waived or satisfied). Such Borrowing shall be applied toward the payment of the Non-QII Bank's Loans and Borrower shall pay the balance of the Non-QII Bank's Loans to the extent Borrower has funds available. Upon payment in full of the Loans of the Non-QII Bank, the Non-QII Bank shall cease to be a Bank hereunder. (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Borrower shall have the right at any time to pay in full the Loans of any Non-QII Bank. SECTION 9.19. Release. At such time as the Obligations have been paid in full, the Administrative Agent and each Bank shall take such actions (at Borrower's sole cost and expense) as are necessary to release the Liens created by this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. SECTION 9.20. English Language. If this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents is translated into Japanese or any other language for the convenience of the parties or either of them, the English language version shall for all purposes be deemed to be the definitive and binding version hereof or thereof; except for Exhibit A hereto, the Mortgages and the Additional Mortgages which shall be executed in Japanese and for which only the Japanese version shall govern. SECTION 9.21. USA PATRIOT ACT. Each Bank hereby notifies Borrower that pursuant to the requirements of the USA Patriot Act (Title III of Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001)) (the "Act"), it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies the Credit Parties, which information includes the name and address of each Credit Party and other information that will allow such Bank to identify each Credit Party in accordance with the Act. SECTION 9.22. OFAC List. (a) The Guarantors certify to the Administrative Agent and each Bank that neither they nor Borrower has been designated as a "specially designated national and blocked person" on the most current list published by the U.S. Treasury Department Office of Foreign Assets Control at its official website, http://www.treas.gov/ofac/t11sdn.pdf or at any replacement website or other replacement official publication of such list (the "OFAC List"). Upon the request of Administrative Agent given at reasonable intervals, each Guarantor will update the foregoing information. (b) Each of the Administrative Agent and each Bank certify to the Guarantors and Borrower that it has not been designated as a "specially designated national and blocked person" on the OFAC list. Upon the request of any Guarantor or Borrower given at reasonable intervals, the Administrative Agent or any Bank will update the foregoing information. 88

EXHIBIT 10.2 GUARANTY OF PAYMENT GUARANTY OF PAYMENT (this "Guaranty"), made as of November 24, 2004, jointly and severally by AMB PROPERTY, L.P. ("AMB LP"), a Delaware limited partnership, having an address at Pier 1, Bay 1, San Francisco, California 94111, and AMB PROPERTY CORPORATION ("AMB Corporation"), a Maryland corporation, having an address at Pier 1, Bay 1, San Francisco, California 94111 (collectively, the "Guarantors"), for the benefit of SUMITOMO MITSUI BANKING CORPORATION, as Administrative Agent and Sole Lead Arranger and Bookmanager (the "Administrative Agent"), for the banks (the "Banks") that are from time to time parties to that certain Credit Facility Agreement (the "Credit Agreement"), dated as of the date hereof, among AMB Tokai TMK ("Borrower"), the Guarantors, the Banks and the Administrative Agent. Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Credit Agreement. W I T N E S S E T H: WHEREAS, the Banks have agreed to make loans to Borrower under the Credit Agreement in the aggregate principal amount not to exceed Twenty Billion Yen (JPY20,000,000,000) (hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Loans"); WHEREAS, each of AMB LP and AMB Corporation is the direct or indirect owner of equity interests of Borrower; WHEREAS, as a condition to the execution and delivery of the Loan Documents, the Banks have required that the Guarantors execute and deliver this Guaranty; and NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the benefits to be derived from the making of the Loans by the Banks to Borrower, and in order to induce the Administrative Agent and the Banks to enter into the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Guarantors hereby agree as follows: 1. Each Guarantor, on behalf of itself and its successors and assigns, hereby irrevocably, absolutely and unconditionally guarantees the full and punctual payment when due, whether at stated maturity or otherwise, of all Obligations of Borrower now or hereafter existing under Credit Agreement, and any and all reasonable costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements) incurred by the Administrative Agent and/or the Banks in enforcing their rights under this Guaranty (all of the foregoing obligations being the "Guaranteed Obligations"). 2. It is agreed that the Guaranteed Obligations of each Guarantor hereunder are primary, and this Guaranty shall be enforceable, jointly and severally, against each Guarantor and its respective successors and assigns without the necessity for any suit or proceeding of any kind or nature whatsoever brought by the Administrative Agent or any of the Banks against Borrower or its successors or assigns or any other party or against any security for the payment and performance of the Guaranteed Obligations and without the necessity of any notice of non-payment or non-observance or of any notice of acceptance of this Guaranty or of any notice or demand to which the
Guarantors might otherwise be entitled (including, without limitation, diligence, presentment, notice of maturity, extension of time, change in nature or form of the Guaranteed Obligations, acceptance of further security, release of further security, imposition or agreement arrived at as to the amount of or the terms of the Guaranteed Obligations, notice of adverse change in Borrower's financial condition and any other fact which might materially increase the risk to each Guarantor), all of which each Guarantor hereby expressly waives; and each Guarantor hereby expressly agrees that the validity of this Guaranty and the obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall in no way be terminated, affected, diminished, modified or impaired by reason of the assertion of or the failure to assert by the Administrative Agent or any of the Banks against Borrower or its successors or assigns, any of the rights or remedies reserved to the Administrative Agent or any of the Banks pursuant to the provisions of the Loan Documents. Each Guarantor agrees that any notice or directive given at any time to the Administrative Agent or any of the Banks which is inconsistent with the waiver in the immediately preceding sentence shall be void and may be ignored by the Administrative Agent and the Banks, and, in addition, may not be pleaded or introduced as evidence in any litigation relating to this Guaranty for the reason that such pleading or introduction would be at variance with the written terms of this Guaranty, unless the Administrative Agent has specifically agreed otherwise in a writing, signed by a duly authorized officer. Each Guarantor specifically acknowledges and agrees that the foregoing waivers are of the essence of this transaction and that, but for this Guaranty and such waivers, the Administrative Agent and the Banks would not make the requested Loan to Borrower. 3. Each Guarantor waives, and covenants and agrees that it will not at any time insist upon, plead or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any and all appraisal, valuation, stay, extension, marshaling-of-assets or redemption laws, or right of homestead or exemption, whether now or at any time hereafter in force, which may delay, prevent or otherwise affect the performance by each Guarantor of its obligations under, or the enforcement by the Administrative Agent or any of the Banks of, this Guaranty. Each Guarantor further covenants and agrees not to set up or claim any defense, counterclaim, offset, setoff or other objection of any kind to any action, suit or proceeding in law, equity or otherwise, or to any demand or claim that may be instituted or made by the Administrative Agent or any of the Banks other than the defense of the actual timely payment and performance by Borrower of the Guaranteed Obligations hereunder; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not be deemed a waiver of each Guarantor's right to assert any compulsory counterclaim, if such counterclaim is compelled under local law or rule of procedure, nor shall the foregoing be deemed a waiver of each Guarantor's right to assert any claim which would constitute a defense, setoff, counterclaim or crossclaim of any nature whatsoever against the Administrative Agent or any Bank in any separate action or proceeding. Each Guarantor represents, warrants and agrees that, as of the date hereof, its obligations under this Guaranty are not subject to any counterclaims, offsets or defenses against the Administrative Agent or any Bank of any kind. 4. The provisions of this Guaranty are for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Banks and their successors and permitted assigns, and nothing herein contained shall impair as between Borrower and the Administrative Agent and the Banks the obligations of Borrower under the Loan Documents. 5. This Guaranty shall be a continuing, unconditional and absolute guaranty and the liability of each Guarantor hereunder shall in no way be terminated, 2
affected, modified, impaired or diminished by reason of the happening, from time to time, of any of the following, all without notice or the further consent of the Guarantors: (a) any assignment, amendment, modification or waiver of or change in any of the terms, covenants, conditions or provisions of any of the Guaranteed Obligations or the Loan Documents or the invalidity or unenforceability of any of the foregoing; or (b) any extension of time that may be granted by the Administrative Agent to Borrower, any Guarantor, or their respective successors or assigns, heirs, executors, administrators or personal representatives; or (c) any action which the Administrative Agent may take or fail to take under or in respect of any of the Loan Documents or by reason of any waiver of, or failure to enforce any of the rights, remedies, powers or privileges available to the Administrative Agent under this Guaranty or available to the Administrative Agent at law, equity or otherwise, or any action on the part of the Administrative Agent granting indulgence or extension in any form whatsoever; or (d) any sale, exchange, release, or other disposition of any property pledged, mortgaged or conveyed, or any property in which the Administrative Agent and/or the Banks have been granted a lien or security interest to secure any indebtedness of Borrower to the Administrative Agent and/or the Banks; or (e) any release of any person or entity who may be liable in any manner for the payment and collection of any amounts owed by Borrower to the Administrative Agent and/or the Banks; or (f) the application of any sums by whomsoever paid or however realized to any amounts owing by Borrower to the Administrative Agent and/or the Banks under the Loan Documents in such manner as the Administrative Agent shall determine in its sole discretion; or (g) Borrower's or any Guarantor's voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution, sale of all or substantially all of their respective assets and liabilities, appointment of a trustee, receiver, liquidator, sequestrator or conservator for all or any part of Borrower's or any Guarantor's assets, insolvency, bankruptcy, assignment for the benefit of creditors, reorganization, arrangement, composition or readjustment, or the commencement of other similar proceedings affecting Borrower or any Guarantor or any of the assets of any of them, including, without limitation, (i) the release or discharge of Borrower or any Guarantor from the payment and performance of their respective obligations under any of the Loan Documents by operation of law, or (ii) the impairment, limitation or modification of the liability of Borrower or any Guarantor in bankruptcy, or of any remedy for the enforcement of the Guaranteed Obligations under any of the Loan Documents, or any Guarantor's liability under this Guaranty, resulting from the operation of any present or future provisions of the Bankruptcy Code or other present or future federal, state or applicable statute or law or from the decision in any court; or (h) any improper disposition by Borrower of the proceeds of the Loans, it being acknowledged by each Guarantor that the Administrative Agent or any Bank shall be entitled to honor any request made by Borrower for a disbursement of such 3
proceeds and that neither the Administrative Agent nor any Bank shall have any obligation to see the proper disposition by Borrower of such proceeds. 6. Each Guarantor agrees that if at any time all or any part of any payment at any time received by the Administrative Agent from Borrower or any Guarantor under or with respect to this Guaranty is or must be rescinded or returned by the Administrative Agent or any Bank for any reason whatsoever (including, without limitation, the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of Borrower or any Guarantor), then such Guarantor's obligations hereunder shall, to the extent of the payment rescinded or returned, be deemed to have continued in existence notwithstanding such previous receipt by such party, and such Guarantor's obligations hereunder shall continue to be effective or reinstated, as the case may be, as to such payment, as though such previous payment had never been made. 7. Until this Guaranty is terminated pursuant to the terms hereof, each Guarantor (i) shall have no right of subrogation against Borrower or any entity comprising same by reason of any payments or acts of performance by such Guarantor in compliance with the obligations of such Guarantor hereunder, (ii) waives any right to enforce any remedy which such Guarantor now or hereafter shall have against Borrower or any entity comprising same by reason of any one or more payment or acts of performance in compliance with the obligations of such Guarantor hereunder and (iii) from and after an Event of Default (as defined in the Credit Agreement), subordinates any liability or indebtedness of Borrower or any entity comprising same now or hereafter held by such Guarantor or any affiliate of such Guarantor to the obligations of Borrower under the Loan Documents. The foregoing, however, shall not be deemed in any way to limit any rights that any Guarantor may have at law or in equity with respect to any other partners, members or other interest holders of Borrower. 8. Each Guarantor represents and warrants to the Administrative Agent and the Banks with the knowledge that the Administrative Agent and the Banks are relying upon the same, as follows: (a) each of AMB LP and AMB Corporation is a direct or indirect owner of equity interests of Borrower; (b) based upon such relationships, each Guarantor has determined that it is in its best interests to enter into this Guaranty; (c) this Guaranty is necessary and convenient to the conduct, promotion and attainment of each Guarantor's business, and is in furtherance of each Guarantor's business purposes; (d) the benefits to be derived by each Guarantor from Borrower's access to funds made possible by the Loan Documents are at least equal to the obligations undertaken pursuant to this Guaranty; (e) each Guarantor is solvent and has full power and legal right to enter into this Guaranty and to perform its obligations under the term hereof and (i) AMB LP is organized and validly existing under the laws of the State of Delaware and AMB Corporation is organized and validly existing under the laws of the State of Maryland, (ii) each Guarantor has complied with all provisions of applicable law in connection with all 4
aspects of this Guaranty, and (iii) each person executing this Guaranty has all the requisite power and authority to execute and deliver this Guaranty; (f) to the best of each Guarantor's knowledge, there is no action, suit, proceeding, or investigation pending or threatened against or affecting such Guarantor at law, in equity, in admiralty or before any arbitrator or any governmental department, commission, board, bureau, agency or instrumentality (domestic or foreign) which is likely to materially and adversely impair the ability of such Guarantor to perform its obligations under this Guaranty; (g) the execution and delivery of, and the performance by each Guarantor of its obligations under this Guaranty, have been duly authorized by all necessary action on the part of each Guarantor and do not (i) violate any provision of any law, rule, regulation (including, without limitation, Regulation U or X of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System of the United States), order, writ, judgment, decree, determination or award presently in effect having applicability to such Guarantor or the organizational documents of such Guarantor the consequences of which violation is likely to materially and adversely impair the ability of such Guarantor to perform its obligations under this Guaranty or (ii) violate or conflict with, result in a breach of or constitute (with due notice or lapse of time or both) a default under any indenture, agreement or other instrument to which such Guarantor is a party, or by which such Guarantor or any of its property is bound, the consequences of which violation, conflict, breach or default is likely to materially and adversely impair the ability of such Guarantor to perform its obligations under this Guaranty; (h) this Guaranty has been duly executed by each Guarantor and constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of each Guarantor, enforceable against such Guarantor in accordance with its terms except as enforceability may be limited by applicable insolvency, bankruptcy or other laws affecting creditors' rights generally or general principles of equity, whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law; (i) no authorization, consent, approval, license or formal exemption from, nor any filing, declaration or registration with, any Federal, state, local or foreign court, governmental agency or regulatory authority is required in connection with the making and performance by each Guarantor of this Guaranty, except those which have already been obtained; and (j) Neither Guarantor is an "investment company" as that term is defined in, nor is it otherwise subject to regulation under, the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. 9. Each Guarantor and Administrative Agent each acknowledge and agree that this Guaranty is a guarantee of payment and performance and not of collection and enforcement in respect of any obligations which may accrue to the Administrative Agent and/or the Banks from Borrower under the provisions of any Loan Document. 10. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement, and in conjunction therewith, the Administrative Agent or any Bank may assign any or all of its rights under this Guaranty. In the event of any such assignment, the Administrative Agent shall give each Guarantor prompt notice of same. If the Administrative Agent elects to sell all the Loans or participations in the Loans and the Loan Documents, 5
including this Guaranty, the Administrative Agent or any Bank may forward to each purchaser and prospective purchaser all documents and information relating to this Guaranty or to each Guarantor, whether furnished by Borrower or any Guarantor or otherwise, subject to the terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement. 11. Each Guarantor agrees, upon the written request of the Administrative Agent, to execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent, from time to time, any modification or amendment hereto or any additional instruments or documents reasonably considered necessary by the Administrative Agent or its counsel to cause this Guaranty to be, become or remain valid and effective in accordance with its terms, provided, that, any such modification, amendment, additional instrument or document shall not increase Guarantor's obligations or diminish its rights hereunder and shall be reasonably satisfactory as to form to each Guarantor and to such Guarantor's counsel. 12. The representations and warranties of each Guarantor set forth in this Guaranty shall survive until this Guaranty shall terminate in accordance with the terms hereof. 13. This Guaranty contains the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements relating to such subject matter and may not be modified, amended, supplemented or discharged except by a written agreement signed by each Guarantor and the Administrative Agent. 14. If all or any portion of any provision contained in this Guaranty shall be determined to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect for any reason, such provision or portion thereof shall be deemed stricken and severed from this Guaranty and the remaining provisions and portions thereof shall continue in full force and effect. 15. This Guaranty may be executed in counterparts which together shall constitute the same instrument. 16. All notices, requests and other communications to any party hereunder shall be in writing (including bank wire, telex, facsimile transmission followed by telephonic confirmation or similar writing) and shall be addressed to such party at the address set forth below or to such other address as may be identified by any party in a written notice to the others: If to Guarantor to (one joint notice to both Guarantors shall be sufficient): AMB LP: AMB Property, L.P. c/o AMB Property Corporation Pier 1, Bay 1 San Francisco, California 94111 USA Attention: General Counsel Facsimile: +1 (415) 394-9001 Telephone: +1 (415) 394-9000 and 6

This Guaranty shall be binding upon each Guarantor and its successors and assigns and shall inure to the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Banks and their successors and permitted assigns. 19. The failure of the Administrative Agent to enforce any right or remedy hereunder, or promptly to enforce any such right or remedy, shall not constitute a waiver thereof, nor give rise to any estoppel against the Administrative Agent, nor excuse any Guarantor from its obligations hereunder. Any waiver of any such right or remedy to be enforceable against the Administrative Agent must be expressly set forth in a writing signed by the Administrative Agent. 20. (a) THIS GUARANTY AND THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES HEREUNDER SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH AND BE GOVERNED BY GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK PURSUANT TO SECTION 5-1401 OF THE NEW YORK GENERAL OBLIGATIONS LAW, WITHOUT REGARD TO CHOICE OF LAW RULES.

Each Guarantor irrevocably consents to the service of process out of any of the aforementioned courts in any such action or proceeding by the mailing of copies thereof by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, to such Guarantor at its address for notices set forth herein. Each Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any of the aforesaid actions or proceedings arising out of or in connection with this Guaranty brought in the courts referred to above and hereby further irrevocably waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court that any such action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Nothing herein shall affect the right of the Administrative Agent to serve process in any other manner permitted by law or to commence legal proceedings or otherwise proceed against any Guarantor in any other jurisdiction. (c) EACH GUARANTOR HEREBY WAIVES ITS RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL OF ANY AND ALL CLAIMS OR CAUSES OF ACTION BASED UPON OR ARISING OUT OF THIS GUARANTY. IT IS HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGED BY EACH GUARANTOR THAT THE WAIVER OF A JURY TRIAL IS A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT FOR THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT TO ACCEPT THIS GUARANTY AND THAT THE LOANS MADE BY THE BANKS ARE MADE IN RELIANCE UPON SUCH WAIVER. EACH GUARANTOR FURTHER WARRANTS AND REPRESENTS THAT SUCH WAIVER HAS BEEN 8
KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY MADE, FOLLOWING CONSULTATION WITH LEGAL COUNSEL. IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, THIS GUARANTY MAY BE FILED BY THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT IN COURT AS A WRITTEN CONSENT TO A NON-JURY TRIAL. (d) Each Guarantor does hereby further covenant and agree to and with the Administrative Agent that each Guarantor may be joined in any action against Borrower in connection with the Loan Documents and that recovery may be had against either or both Guarantors in such action or in any independent action against either or both Guarantors (with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations), without the Administrative Agent first pursuing or exhausting any remedy or claim against Borrower or its successors or assigns. Each Guarantor also agrees that, in an action brought with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations in any jurisdiction, they each shall be conclusively bound by the judgment in any such action by the Administrative Agent (wherever brought) against Borrower or its successors or assigns, as if Guarantors were parties to such action, even though one or both of Guarantors were not joined as a party or parties in such action. (e) Each Guarantor agrees to pay all reasonable expenses (including, without limitation, attorneys' fees and disbursements) which may be incurred by the Administrative Agent or the Banks in connection with the enforcement of their rights under this Guaranty, whether or not suit is initiated. 21. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, this Guaranty shall terminate and be of no further force or effect upon the full performance and payment of the Guaranteed Obligations hereunder. Upon termination of this Guaranty in accordance with the terms of this Guaranty, the Administrative Agent promptly shall deliver to each Guarantor such documents as such Guarantor or such Guarantor's counsel reasonably may request in order to evidence such termination. 22. All of the Administrative Agent's rights and remedies under each of the Loan Documents or under this Guaranty are intended to be distinct, separate and cumulative and no such right or remedy therein or herein mentioned is intended to be in exclusion of or a waiver of any other right or remedy available to the Administrative Agent. 23. Neither Guarantor shall use any assets of an "employee benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA or a "plan" within the meaning of Section 4975(e)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code (the "Code") to repay or secure the Loans, the Obligations or this Guaranty. Neither Guarantor shall assign, sell, pledge, encumber, transfer, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of any of its rights or interests (direct or indirect) in Borrower, or attempt to do any of the foregoing or suffer any of the foregoing, or permit any party with a direct or indirect interest or right in Borrower to do any of the foregoing, if such action would cause the Loans, the Obligations, this Guaranty, or any of the Loan Documents or the exercise of any of the Administrative Agent's or Bank's rights in connection therewith, to constitute a prohibited transaction under ERISA or the Code (unless such Guarantor furnishes to the Administrative Agent a legal opinion satisfactory to the Administrative Agent that the transaction is exempt from the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and the Code (and for this purpose, the Administrative Agent and the Banks, by accepting the benefits of this Guaranty, hereby agree to supply each Guarantor all relevant non-confidential, factual information reasonably necessary to such legal opinion and reasonably requested by such Guarantor) or would otherwise result in the Administrative Agent or any of the Banks being deemed in violation of Sections 404 9
or 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or would otherwise result in the Administrative Agent or any of the Banks being a fiduciary or party in interest under ERISA or a "disqualified person" as defined in Section 4975(e)(2) of the Code with respect to an "employee benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA or a "plan" within the meaning of Section 4975(e)(1) of the Code. The Guarantors shall jointly and severally indemnify and hold each of the Administrative Agent and the Banks free and harmless from and against all loss, costs (including attorneys' fees and expenses), expenses, taxes and damages (including consequential damages) that each of the Administrative Agent and the Banks may suffer by reason of the investigation, defense and settlement of claims and in obtaining any prohibited transaction exemption under ERISA necessary in Administrative Agent's reasonable judgment as a result of such Guarantor's action or inaction or by reason of a breach of the foregoing provisions by such Guarantor.
