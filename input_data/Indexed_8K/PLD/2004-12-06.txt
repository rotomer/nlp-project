ITEM 8.01 OTHER EVENTS.
We announced on December 2, 2004 that, through our affiliate, we have agreed to purchase all of the interest held by the Peabody Group in G. Accin S.A. de C.V. The agreement calls for a purchase price of US$0.85 per share for total consideration of approximately US$44.6 million and is subject to certain conditions, which are waivable by us. The per-share price is based on the estimated net asset value of G. Accin.
Since the interest in G. Accin that we intend to purchase exceeds certain thresholds provided in Mexican regulations, we, together with Kimco Realty Corporation and certain of G. Accin's management team, through their respective affiliates, plan to carry out a tender offer for the remaining public shares and are requesting authorization from the Comisin Nacional Bancaria y de Valores to do so. Subject to certain conditions and the receipt of necessary authorizations, we expect the tender offer to be completed in the first quarter of 2005. Upon successful completion of the tender, the tender offerors, together with certain other shareholders of G. Accin, intend to request the cancellation of the registry of the shares of G. Accin from the Mexican Securities Registry and the delisting of G. Accin from the Bolsa Mexicana de Valores, S.A. de C.V., the Mexican stock exchange.
G. Accin's core business provides management and development services for more than eight million square feet of industrial, office, retail and residential properties in Mexico. Additionally, the company has a 50% ownership interest in Cushman & Wakefield de Mxico GCI, S. de R.L. de C.V. and Central Parking System Mexico S.A. de C.V.
G. Accin has built its business through sector-specific strategic alliances with industry leaders such as us for industrial properties, Kimco Realty Corporation for retail centers and Madrid-based Grupo Lar for residential development.
G. Accin's management team, we and Kimco intend to join G. Accin's chairman Pablo Escandn Cusi as owners of the recapitalized company. Immediately following completion of the tender offer and other related transactions, shares in G. Accin are expected to be held approximately 41% by us, 27% by Sr. Escandn, 20% by Kimco and 12% by G. Accin's management team. These approximate ownership percentages assume that all shares in the public float are tendered.
The securities discussed herein have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the securities laws of any state and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements under the Securities Act and any applicable state securities laws. This report does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy the securities discussed herein.

We caution you not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which reflect our analysis only and speak only as of the date of this report or the dates indicated in the statements. We assume no obligation to update or supplement forward-looking statements.
