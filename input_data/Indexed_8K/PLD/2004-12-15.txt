          (d) the shareholders of the General Partner approve a merger or consolidation of the General Partner with any other corporation (or other entity), other than (i) a merger or consolidation which would result in the voting securities of the General Partner outstanding immediately prior thereto continuing to represent (either by remaining outstanding or by being converted into voting securities of the surviving entity) more than fifty percent (50%) of the combined voting power of the voting securities of the General Partner or such surviving entity outstanding immediately after such merger or consolidation or (ii) where more than fifty percent (50%) of the directors of the General Partner or the surviving entity after such merger or consolidation were directors of the General Partner immediately before such merger or consolidation.

provided, that, if within fifteen (15) days after any Notice of Termination (as defined in Section 3.6) is given, the party receiving such Notice of Termination notifies the other party that a dispute exists concerning the termination, then the Date of Termination shall be the date on which the dispute is finally resolved, either by mutual written agreement of the parties, or otherwise; , that the Date of Termination shall be extended by a notice of dispute only if such notice is given in good faith and the party giving such notice pursues the resolution of such dispute with reasonable diligence.

                    "Good Reason" shall mean, without the Executive's express written consent, the occurrence after a Change in Control of any of the following circumstances unless such circumstances are fully corrected (provided such circumstances are capable of correction) prior to the Date of Termination as specified in the Notice of Termination:

Location") to a location more than fifty (50) miles from such location or the Company's requiring the Executive, without the Executive's written consent, to be based anywhere other than the Principal Location, except for required travel on the Company's business to an extent substantially consistent with the Executive's business travel obligations prior to the Change in Control Date;
          (d) the Company's failure to pay to the Executive any portion of the Executive's compensation or to pay to the Executive any portion of an installment of deferred compensation under any deferred compensation program of the Company within seven (7) days of the date such compensation is due; or
          (e) the Company's failure to continue in effect any material compensation or benefit plan or practice in which the Executive is eligible to participate in on the Change in Control Date (other than any equity based plan), unless an equitable arrangement (embodied in an ongoing substitute or alternative plan) has been made with respect to such plan, or the Company's failure to continue the Executive's participation therein (or in such substitute or alternative plan) on a basis not materially less favorable, both in terms of the amount of benefits provided and the level of the Executive's participation relative to other participants, as existed at the time of the Change in Control Date;
, that the Executive's continued employment shall not constitute consent to, or a waiver of rights with respect to, any circumstance constituting Good Reason hereunder.
provided, however
          3.1.       .
Death
                              Whether or not there is a Change in Control, if the Executive's employment shall be terminated due to the Executive's death, the Company shall pay monthly to the Executive's estate for a period equal to one (1) year following the Date of Termination an amount equal to the sum of: (i) one-twelfth of the Executive's annual base compensation as in effect on the Date of Termination plus (ii) one-twelfth of any bonus at the most recent annual amount received, or entitled to be received, by the Executive for the most recent annual period. At the Executive's estate's expense, the Executive's spouse and children shall also be entitled to any continuation of health insurance coverage rights under any applicable law.
          3.2.       .
Disability
                       Whether or not there is a Change in Control, if the Executive's employment shall be terminated by reason of Disability, the Company shall pay to the Executive a single payment in an amount equal to the sum of: (i) the Executive's annual base compensation as in effect on the Date of Termination plus (ii) an amount equal to the annual bonus received, or entitled to be received, by the Executive for the most recent annual period. Such payment shall be in addition to any disability insurance payments to which the Executive is otherwise entitled. At the Executive's own expense, the Executive and the Executive's spouse and children shall also be entitled to any continuation of health insurance coverage rights under any applicable law.
 
            3.3.     .
Termination Upon Change in Control
                        If during the term or extended term of this Agreement and within two (2) years following a Change in Control, the Executive's employment with the Company is terminated, in addition to his base compensation and any bonus then payable through the Date of Termination and, at the Executive's own expense, any continuation of health insurance coverage rights under any applicable law, the Executive shall be entitled to the benefits provided below, unless such termination is (i) because of the Executive's death, Disability or retirement, (ii) by the Company for Cause or (iii) by the Executive other than for Good Reason; , that in the event the Executive's employment is terminated for any reason and subsequently a Change in Control occurs, the Executive shall not be entitled to any benefits hereunder, other than pursuant to Sections 3.1 and 3.2:
provided, however
                        (a)     the Company shall pay to the Executive, when due, the Executive's base compensation and any bonus then payable through the Date of Termination;
                        (b)     in lieu of any further salary payments to the Executive for periods subsequent to the Date of Termination, the Company shall pay as severance pay to the Executive a lump sum payment in cash within 30 days of the Date of Termination equal to the sum of the following:
                                (i)     two (2) times the Executive's annual base compensation as in effect as of the Date of Termination or immediately prior to the Change in Control Date, whichever is greater; and
                                (ii)     two (2) times the average of the annual bonus payments received, or entitled to be received, by the Executive for the three (3) most recent annual periods; that if the Executive has been employed by the Company as an executive officer for less than three (3) years, then he or she shall be paid two (2) times the average of the annual bonus payments received, or entitled to be received, by the Executive for all prior annual periods that the Executive was employed by the Company as an executive officer (annualizing any prorated bonus for a partial first year);
provided, however,
                        (c)     for a twenty-four (24) month period after such termination (the "Coverage Period"), the Company shall continue to provide the Executive and the Executive's eligible family members with medical and dental health benefits and life and disability insurance at least equal to those which would have been provided to the Executive and them if the Executive's employment had not been terminated or, if more favorable to the Executive, as in effect generally at any time thereafter; , that if the Executive becomes re-employed with another employer and is eligible to receive medical and dental health benefits and life and disability insurance under another employer's plans, the Company's obligations under this Section 3.3(c) shall be reduced to the extent comparable benefits are actually received by the Executive during the twenty-four (24) month period following the Executive's termination, and any such benefits actually received by the Executive shall be reported to the Company; and
provided, however
                        (d)     the Company shall pay to the Executive on or about the date or dates that the contributions would have been made an amount equal to the aggregate amount of
 
the Company's maximum contributions that would have been made under the Company's 401(k) plan (the "401(k) Plan") during the Coverage Period if the Executive had continued to be employed and participated in the 401(k) Plan during the Coverage Period.
          3.4.     .
Certain Additional Payments by the Company
                     (a)     Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding and except as set forth below, in the event it shall be determined that any Payment would be subject to the Excise Tax, then the Executive shall be entitled to receive an additional payment (a "Gross-Up Payment") in an amount such that after payment by the Executive of all taxes (including any interest or penalties imposed with respect to such taxes), including, without limitation, any income taxes (and any interest and penalties imposed with respect thereto) and Excise Tax imposed upon the Gross-Up Payment, the Executive retains an amount of the Gross-Up Payment equal to the Excise Tax imposed upon the Payments.
                     (b)     Subject to the provisions of Section 3.4(c), all determinations required to be made under this Section 3.4, including whether and when a Gross-Up Payment is required and the amount of such Gross-Up Payment and the assumptions to be utilized in arriving at such determination, shall be made by the nationally recognized certified public accounting firm used by the Company immediately prior to the Change in Control or, if such firm declines to serve, such other nationally recognized certified public accounting firm as may be designated by the Executive (the "Accounting Firm") which shall provide detailed supporting calculations both to the Company and the Executive within 15 business days of the receipt of notice from the Executive that there has been a Payment, or such earlier time as is requested by the Company. All fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne solely by the Company. Subject to Section 3.4(e) below, any Gross-Up Payment, as determined pursuant to this Section 3.4, shall be paid by the Company to the Executive within five days of the receipt of the Accounting Firm's determination. Any determination by the Accounting Firm shall be binding upon the Company and the Executive. For purposes of making the calculations required by this Section 3.4, the Accounting Firm may make reasonable assumptions and approximations concerning applicable taxes and may rely on reasonable, good-faith interpretations concerning the application of Sections 280G and 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 of the Code at the time of the initial determination by the Accounting Firm hereunder, it is possible that Gross-Up Payments which will not have been made by the Company should have been made ("Underpayment"), consistent with the calculations required to be made hereunder. In the event that the Company exhausts its remedies pursuant to Section 3.4(c) and the Executive thereafter is required to make a payment of any Excise Tax, the Accounting Firm shall determine the amount of the Underpayment that has occurred and any such Underpayment shall be promptly paid by the Company to or for the benefit of the Executive.
                     (c)     The Executive shall notify the Company in writing of any claim by the Internal Revenue Service that, if successful, would require the payment by the Company of the Gross-Up Payment. Such notification shall be given as soon as practicable but no later than ten business days after the Executive is informed in writing of such claim and shall apprise the Company of the nature of such claim and the date on which such claim is requested to be paid. The Executive shall not pay such claim prior to the expiration of the 30-day period following the
 
date on which it gives such notice to the Company (or such shorter period ending on the date that any payment of taxes with respect to such claim is due). If the Company notifies the Executive in writing prior to the expiration of such period that it desires to contest such claim, the Executive shall:
               (i)     give the Company any information reasonably requested by the Company relating to such claim;
               (ii)     take such action in connection with contesting such claim as the Company shall reasonably request in writing from time to time, including, without limitation, accepting legal representation with respect to such claim by an attorney reasonably selected by the Company;
               (iii)     cooperate with the Company in good faith in order effectively to contest such claim; and
               (iv)     permit the Company to participate in any proceedings relating to such claim;
provided, however, that the Company shall bear and pay directly all costs and expenses (including additional interest and penalties) incurred in connection with such contest and shall indemnify and hold the Executive harmless, on an after-tax basis, for any Excise Tax or income tax (including interest and penalties with respect thereto) imposed as a result of such representation and payment of costs and expenses. Without limitation on the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.4(c), the Company shall control all proceedings taken in connection with such contest and, at its sole option, may pursue or forgo any and all administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings and conferences with the taxing authority in respect of such claim and may, at its sole option, either direct the Executive to pay the tax claimed and sue for a refund or contest the claim in any permissible manner, and the Executive agrees to prosecute such contest to a determination before any administrative tribunal, in a court of initial jurisdiction and in one or more appellate courts, as the Company shall determine; provided, however, that if the Company directs the Executive to pay such claim and sue for a refund, the Company shall advance the amount of such payment to the Executive, on an interest-free basis and shall indemnify and hold the Executive harmless, on an after-tax basis, from any Excise Tax or income tax (including interest or penalties with respect thereto) imposed with respect to such advance or with respect to any imputed income with respect to such advance; and further provided that any extension of the statute of limitations relating to payment of taxes for the taxable year of the Executive with respect to which such contested amount is claimed to be due is limited solely to such contested amount. Furthermore, the Company's control of the contest shall be limited to issues with respect to which a Gross-Up Payment would be payable hereunder and the Executive shall be entitled to settle or contest, as the case may be, any other issue raised by the Internal Revenue Service or any other taxing authority.
               (d)     If, after the receipt by the Executive of an amount advanced by the Company pursuant to Section 3.4(c), the Executive becomes entitled to receive any refund with respect to such claim, the Executive shall (subject to the Company's complying with the requirements of Section 3.4(c)) promptly pay to the Company the amount of such refund
 
(together with any interest paid or credited thereon after taxes applicable thereto). If, after the receipt by the Executive of an amount advanced by the Company pursuant to Section 3.4(c), a determination is made that the Executive shall not be entitled to any refund with respect to such claim and the Company does not notify the Executive in writing of its intent to contest such denial of refund prior to the expiration of 30 days after such determination, then such advance shall be forgiven and shall not be required to be repaid and the amount of such advance shall offset, to the extent thereof, the amount of Gross-Up Payment required to be paid.
               (e)     Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 3.4, the Company may withhold and pay over to the Internal Revenue Service for the benefit of the Executive all or any portion of the Gross-Up Payment that it determines in good faith that it is or may be in the future required to withhold, and the Executive hereby consents to such withholding.
               (f)      .     The following terms shall have the following meanings for purposes of this Section 3.4.
Definitions
                         (i)     "Excise Tax" shall mean the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code, together with any interest or penalties imposed with respect to such excise tax.
                         (ii)     A "Payment" shall mean any payment, benefit or distribution in the nature of compensation (within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code) to or for the benefit of the Executive, whether paid or payable pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise.
  3.5.     .     Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in any stock, option or other equity incentive award plan of the Company or in any option, restricted stock or other equity-based award agreement between the Company and the Executive (regardless of whether such agreement is under any such stock, option or other equity incentive award plan), upon a Change in Control (or at such other time prior to a Change in Control as may be determined by the Board in its discretion), all options to acquire any equity securities of the Company held by the Executive shall immediately become exercisable and fully vested and all shares of restricted stock, restricted stock units, deferred stock awards and other awards based upon the Company's equity securities held by the Executive shall immediately become fully vested, exercisable or payable, as applicable, and any forfeiture provisions with respect to such awards shall immediately lapse; provided , however, that the payment of any such accelerated amounts may be delayed to the extent necessary to comply with Code Section 409A and any regulations promulgated thereunder. If the vesting of an award has been accelerated pursuant to this Section 3.5 expressly in anticipation of a Change in Control and the Board later determines that the Change in Control will not be consummated, the Board may rescind the effect of the acceleration as to any accelerated awards.
Accelerated Vesting of Options and other Equity-Based Awards upon a Change in Control
  3.6     .     Any termination of the Executive's employment by the Company or the Executive shall be communicated by written notice of termination to the other party (the "Notice of Termination"). The Notice of Termination shall indicate the specific termination provision in this Agreement relied upon and shall set forth in reasonable detail the facts and
Notice
 
circumstances claimed to provide a basis for termination of the Executive's employment under the provision so indicated.
          3.7     .

                    (a)     The Executive hereby acknowledges and agrees that all Personal Property and equipment furnished to or prepared by the Executive in the course of or incident to his employment, belongs to the Company and shall be promptly returned to the Company upon termination of the Executive's employment. "Personal Property" includes, without limitation, all electronic devices of the Company used by the Executive, including, without limitation, personal computers, facsimile machines, cellular telephones, pagers and tape recorders and all books, manuals, records, reports, notes, contracts, lists, blueprints, maps and other documents, or materials, or copies thereof (including computer files), and all other proprietary information relating to the business of the Company. Following termination, the Executive will not retain any written or other tangible material containing any proprietary information of the Company.
                    (b)     The Executive's obligations under this Section 3.7 and Section 4 hereof shall survive termination of the Executive's employment and the expiration of this Agreement.
                    (c)     Upon termination of the Executive's employment, the Executive will be deemed to have resigned from all offices and directorships then held with the Company or any affiliate.
          3.8     . The Executive shall not be required to mitigate the amount of any payment provided for herein by seeking other employment or otherwise, nor shall the amount of any payment or benefit provided for herein be reduced by any compensation earned by the Executive as the result of employment by another employer.
No Duty to Mitigate
          4.1     . In consideration of and in connection with the benefits provided to the Executive under this Agreement, the Executive hereby agrees that the Executive will not, during the Executive's employment or at any time thereafter directly or indirectly disclose or make available to any person, firm, corporation, association or other entity for any reason or purpose whatsoever, any Confidential Information (as defined below). The Executive agrees that, upon termination of his employment with the Company, all Confidential Information in his possession that is in written or other tangible form (together with all copies or duplicates thereof, including computer files) shall be returned to the Company and shall not be retained by the Executive or furnished to any third party, in any form except as provided herein; , , that the Executive shall not be obligated to treat as confidential, or return to the Company copies of any Confidential Information that (i) was publicly known at the time of disclosure to the Executive, (ii) becomes publicly known or available thereafter other than by any means in violation of this Agreement or any other duty owed to the Company by the Executive, or (iii) is lawfully disclosed to the Executive by a third party. As used in this Agreement the term "Confidential Information" means information disclosed to the Executive or
Confidentiality
provided
however
 
known by the Executive as a consequence of or through his relationship with the Company, about the owners, tenants, employees, consultants, vendors, business methods, public relations methods, organization, procedures, property acquisition and development, or finances, including, without limitation, information of or relating to owner or tenant lists of the Company and its affiliates.
          4.2     . During the term of the Executive's employment, the Executive shall not engage in any activities, directly or indirectly, in respect of commercial real estate, and will not make any investment in respect of industrial real estate, other than through ownership of not more than five percent (5%) of the outstanding shares of a public company engaged in such activities and through investments listed on Schedule I hereto.
Noncompetition

Nonsolicitation
          5.1     
Successors; Binding Agreement
                            (a)     The Company shall require any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company to expressly assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform it if no such succession had taken place. Failure of the Company to obtain such assumption and agreement prior to the effectiveness of any such succession shall be a breach of this Agreement and shall entitle the Executive to receive compensation from the Company in the same amount and on the same terms to which the Executive would be entitled hereunder if the Executive terminated the Executive's employment for Good Reason following a Change in Control, except that for purposes of implementing the foregoing, the date on which any such succession becomes effective shall be deemed the Date of Termination. Unless expressly provided otherwise, "Company" as used herein shall mean the Company as defined in this Agreement and any successor to its business and/or assets as aforesaid.
                     (b)    This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Executive and the Executive's personal or legal representatives, executors, administrators, successors, heirs, distributees, devisees and legatees. If the Executive should die while any amount would still be payable to the Executive hereunder had the Executive continued to live, all such amounts, unless otherwise provided herein, shall be paid in accordance with the terms of his Agreement to the Executive's devisee, legatee or other designee or, if there is no such designee, to the Executive's estate.
          5.2     . The Executive acknowledges that the remedies at law for any breach by him of the provisions of Sections 3.7 or 4 hereof may be
Injunctive Relief and Enforcement
