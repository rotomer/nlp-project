ITEM 8.01. OTHER EVENTS
     During the period January 1, 2004 through December 16, 2004, AMB Property, L.P., our subsidiary of which we are the general partner, and its affiliates acquired 62 operating buildings, aggregating approximately 7.3 million square feet, for a total purchase price, excluding estimated acquisition capital, of $667.2 million. The total purchase price includes non-cash increases of $5.1 million relating to mortgage premiums or discounts on existing assumed debt and $13.4 million associated with intangible liabilities for the value attributable to below market leases. The buildings were purchased with $206.1 million in assumed debt and $442.6 million in cash.
     All of these buildings were acquired from unrelated third parties in unrelated transactions and represent individually insignificant acquisitions.
FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS
     Some of the information included in this report contains forward-looking statements, such as those related to the purchase price and financial statements of property acquisitions, which are made pursuant to the safe-harbor provisions of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Because these forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, there are important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, and you should not rely on the forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. The events or circumstances reflected in forward-looking statements might not occur. You can identify forward-looking statements by the use of forward-looking terminology such as "believes," "expects," "may," "will," "should," "seeks," "approximately," "intends," "plans," "pro forma," "estimates" or "anticipates" or the negative of these words and phrases or similar words or phrases. You can also identify forward-looking statements by discussions of strategy, plans or intentions. Forward-looking statements are necessarily dependent on assumptions, data or methods that may be incorrect or imprecise and we may not be able to realize them. We caution you not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which reflect our analysis only and speak only as of the date of this report or the dates indicated in the statements. We assume no obligation to update or supplement forward-looking statements. The following factors, among others, could cause actual results and future events to differ materially from those set forth or contemplated in the forward-looking statements: defaults on or non-renewal of leases by tenants, increased interest rates and operating costs, our failure to obtain necessary outside financing, difficulties in identifying properties to acquire and in effecting acquisitions, our failure to successfully integrate acquired properties and operations, our failure to divest properties we have contracted to sell or to timely reinvest proceeds from any divestitures, risks and uncertainties affecting property development and construction (including construction delays, cost overruns, our inability to obtain necessary permits and public opposition to these activities), our failure to qualify and maintain our status as a real estate investment trust, environmental uncertainties, risks related to natural disasters, financial market fluctuations, changes in real estate and zoning laws, risks related to doing business internationally and increases in real property tax rates. Our success also depends upon economic trends generally, including interest rates, income tax laws, governmental regulation, legislation, population changes and certain other matters discussed under the heading "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsBusiness Risks" and elsewhere in our most recent annual report for the year ended December 31, 2003 in Amendment No. 2 on Form 10-K/A.

This Historical Summary is the responsibility of the Property's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on this Historical Summary based on our audit.

An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the Historical Summary. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the Historical Summary. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
The accompanying Historical Summary was prepared for the purpose of complying with the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (for inclusion in the Form 8-K of AMB Property Corporation) as described in Note 1 and is not intended to be a complete presentation of the Property's revenues and expenses.

The source of funding for these acquisitions consisted of approximately $90,313 in cash and $80,682 of assumed debt. The cash portion of the acquisition price was funded with existing cash and contributions from joint venture partners.

Table of Contents
(3) The following table sets forth the incremental rental revenues and operating expenses of the 2004 Property Acquisitions during the nine month period ended September 30, 2004 based on the historical operations of such properties for the periods prior to acquisition by the Operating Partnership or its affiliates. In addition, the following table sets forth the private capital income which is earned based on 7.5% of the minority interests' share of net operating income.
The Operating Partnership or its affiliates purchased the 2004 Property Acquisitions with proceeds from dispositions, borrowings on the unsecured credit facility, the assumption of mortgage indebtedness and contributions from minority interests.
Each of the Coltongo Distribution Center, AMB Capronilaan Logistics Center, International Airport Center - JFK D, Cobia Distribution Center, IAH Logistics Center, AMB District Industrial and AMB Sivert Distribution does not have historical revenue and operating expenses as each of them was either a sale/leaseback transaction or was vacant prior to acquisition and would be deemed a development property. As such, no property operations have been reflected in the accompanying pro forma statement of operations related to these acquisition.
The minority interests' share of income includes the minority interests' share of depreciation and amortization and the minority interests' share of interest expense (see (4) and (5), respectively, for the depreciation and amortization and the interest expense adjustment).
Table of Contents
(4) The following table sets forth the initial allocation of land and building and other costs based on the preliminary purchase price allocation for the 2004 Property Acquisitions and may differ from the actual purchase price allocation upon realization of any accrued costs. Building and other costs include intangible assets for the value attributable to above market leases, in-place leases and lease origination costs. The total purchase price is increased by intangible liabilities for the value attributable to below market leases. This table also reflects the estimated incremental depreciation and amortization for the 2004 Property Acquisitions in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 141, ("SFAS 141"), using the estimated useful lives of the real estate investments and related intangibles based on the preliminary purchase price allocation. The 2004 Property Acquisitions that are located on-tarmac, which is land owned by federal, state or local airport authorities, and subject to ground leases, are depreciated over the lesser of 40 years or the contractual term of the underlying ground lease.
Business Combinations
Each of the Coltongo Distribution Center, AMB Capronilaan Logistics Center, International Airport Center - JFK D, Cobia Distribution Center, IAH Logistics Center, AMB District Industrial and AMB Sivert Distribution was either a sale/leaseback transaction or was vacant prior to acquisition and would be deemed a development property. As such, no depreciation and amortization adjustment has been reflected in the accompanying pro forma statement of operations related to these acquisitions.
Table of Contents
(5) The following table sets forth the assumed mortgages, interest rates and the incremental interest expense related to the assumed mortgages for the 2004 Property Acquisitions. Any mortgage premium or discount on existing debt that is assumed is amortized into interest expense over the term of the related debt instrument using the effective-interest method. In addition, this table sets forth the incremental interest expense for the line of credit based on the average additional outstanding balance of the line of credit multiplied by the average interest rate.
If the market rates of interest on the variable debt changed by a 1/8 percent variance (or approximately 24 basis points), then the increase or decrease in interest expense on the variable rate debt would be $0.4 million annually.
(6) Reflects the limited partnership unitholders share of income based on the limited partnership unitholders average ownership of 5.44%.
