ITEM 8.01 OTHER EVENTS.
          On October 14, 2005, our executive vice president, John T. Roberts, Jr., through his trust, adopted a pre-arranged stock trading plan to exercise a portion of his vested stock options and sell the resulting shares received from such stock option exercises as a part of his personal long term investment strategy for asset diversification, liquidity and estate planning. This stock trading plan was adopted in accordance with guidelines specified under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and our policies regarding stock transactions.
          Up to 204,282 shares of our common stock may be traded under Mr. Roberts' 10b5-1 plan upon exercise of vested stock options contributed to his 10b5-1 plan. As of October 14, 2005, Mr. Roberts has beneficial ownership of 298,754 shares of our common stock and, not including the options to purchase 204,282 shares of our common stock that may be exercised pursuant to his 10b5-1 plan, options to purchase 284,922 shares of our common stock. All transactions under his 10b5-1 plan will be disclosed publicly in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Forward Looking Statements
Some of the information included in this report contains forward-looking statements, such as those related to our executive vice president's future trades under his 10b5-1 plan which are made pursuant to the safe-harbor provisions of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Because these forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, there are important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, and you should not rely on the forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. The events or circumstances reflected in forward-looking statements might not occur. You can identify forward-looking statements by the use of forward-looking terminology such as "believes," "expects," "may," "will," "should," "seeks," "approximately," "intends," "plans," "pro forma," "estimates" or "anticipates" or the negative of these words and phrases or similar words or phrases. You can also identify forward-looking statements by discussions of strategy, plans or intentions. Forward-looking statements are necessarily dependent on assumptions, data or methods that may be incorrect or imprecise and we may not be able to realize them. We caution you not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which reflect our analysis only and speak only as of the date of this report or the dates indicated in the statements. We assume no obligation to update or supplement forward-looking statements. The following factors, among others, could cause actual results and future events to differ materially from those set forth or contemplated in the forward-looking statements: defaults on or non-renewal of leases by tenants, increased interest rates and operating costs, our failure to obtain necessary outside financing, difficulties in identifying properties to acquire and in effecting acquisitions, our failure to successfully integrate acquired properties and operations, our failure to divest properties we have contracted to sell or to timely reinvest proceeds from any divestitures, risks and uncertainties affecting property development and construction (including construction delays, cost overruns, our inability to obtain necessary permits and public opposition to these activities), our failure to qualify and maintain our status as a real estate investment trust, environmental uncertainties, risks related to natural disasters, financial market fluctuations, changes in real estate and zoning laws, risks related to doing business internationally and increases in real property tax rates. Our success also depends upon economic trends generally, including interest rates, income tax laws, governmental regulation, legislation, population changes and certain other matters discussed under the heading "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Business Risks" and elsewhere in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004.
