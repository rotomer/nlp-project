Item 8.01. Other Events.
     On December 6, 2005, we executed an underwriting agreement in connection with the public offering of 3,000,000 shares of our 7.00% Series O Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, at a price of $25.00 per share, under our shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-68283), and pursuant to the terms set forth in a prospectus dated December 17, 1998, as supplemented by a preliminary prospectus supplement dated December 5, 2005 and a final prospectus supplement dated December 6, 2005. We expect the transaction to close on December 13, 2005.
     Dividends on the series O preferred stock will be payable quarterly in equal amounts in arrears on the 15th day of each January, April, July and October of each year, commencing on April 15, 2006 (or, if any such date is not a business day, on the next succeeding business day). Except in limited circumstances to preserve our status as a real estate investment trust, we may not redeem the series O preferred stock until December 13, 2010. On or after that date, we may redeem the series O preferred stock in whole or in part, for cash at a redemption price of $25.00 per share, plus all accumulated and unpaid dividends on such series O preferred stock. The series O preferred stock will have no stated maturity, will not be subject to any sinking fund or mandatory redemption and will not be convertible into any other securities. We intend to apply to list the series O preferred stock on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "AMB  PrO". For additional information concerning these securities, please refer to the exhibits attached to this report.
     We expect to receive net proceeds from this offering of approximately $72,187,500 after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated transaction expenses payable by us. We will use the net proceeds from the sale of the series O preferred stock for general purposes, which may include the repurchase or redemption of a portion of the preferred units issued by our subsidiaries, AMB Property, L.P. or AMB Property II, L.P.

Forward Looking Statements
     Some of the information included in this report contains forward-looking statements, such as statements pertaining to future plans, including anticipated closings, use of proceeds and estimated net proceeds. Because these forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, there are important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, and you should not rely on the forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. The events or circumstances reflected in forward-looking statements might not occur. You can identify forward-looking statements by the use of forward-looking terminology such as "believes," "expects," "may," "will," "should," "seeks," "approximately," "intends," "plans," "pro forma," "estimates" or "anticipates" or the negative of these words and phrases or similar words or phrases. You can also identify forward-looking statements by discussions of strategy, plans or intentions. Forward-looking statements are necessarily dependent on assumptions, data or methods that may be incorrect or imprecise and we may not be able to realize them. We caution you not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which reflect our analysis only and speak only as of the date of this report or the dates indicated in the statements. We assume no obligation to update or supplement forward-looking statements. The following factors, among others, could cause actual results and future events to differ materially from those set forth or contemplated in the forward-looking statements: defaults on or non-renewal of leases by tenants, increased interest rates and operating costs, our failure to obtain necessary outside financing, difficulties in identifying properties to acquire and in effecting acquisitions, our failure to successfully integrate acquired properties and operations, our failure to divest properties we have contracted to sell or to timely reinvest proceeds from any divestitures, risks and uncertainties affecting property development and construction (including construction delays, cost overruns, our inability to obtain necessary permits and public opposition to these activities), our failure to qualify and maintain our status as a real estate investment trust, environmental uncertainties, risks related to natural disasters, financial market fluctuations, changes in real estate and zoning laws, risks related to doing business internationally and increases in real property tax rates. Our success also depends upon economic trends generally, including interest rates, income tax laws, governmental regulation, legislation, population changes and certain other matters
 
discussed under the heading "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsBusiness Risks" and elsewhere in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and in the prospectus supplement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 7, 2005 pursuant to Rule 424(b).
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

          (b) Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the REIT, the Operating Partnership and the REIT's directors, its officers who sign the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the REIT or the Operating Partnership within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the foregoing indemnities from the REIT and the Operating Partnership to such Underwriter, but only with reference to information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the REIT in writing by such Underwriter through you expressly for use in the Registration Statement, the Permitted Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus, which information is limited to that set forth on hereto.
Exhibit A
          (c) In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to Section 8(a) or 8(b), such person (the "") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "") in writing and the indemnifying party, upon request of the indemnified party, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the
indemnified party
indemnifying party
 
indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in respect of the legal expenses of any indemnified party in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified parties and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Such firm shall be designated in writing by the Representatives, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 8(a), and by the REIT or the Operating Partnership, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 8(b). The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party in writing to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by the second and third sentences of this paragraph, the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 60 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request and (ii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of each indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding.
          (d) To the extent the indemnification provided for in Section 8(a) or 8(b) is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the REIT and the Operating Partnership on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Shares or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the REIT and the Operating Partnership on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the REIT and the Operating Partnership on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the offering of the Shares shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds from the offering of the Shares (before deducting expenses) received by the REIT and the total underwriting
 
discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate Public Offering Price of the Shares. The relative fault of the REIT and the Operating Partnership on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the REIT or the Operating Partnership or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 8 are several in proportion to the respective number of Shares they have purchased hereunder, and not joint.
          (e) The REIT, the Operating Partnership and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in Section 8(d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Shares underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The remedies provided for in this Section 8 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.
          (f) The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in this Section 8 and the representations, warranties and other statements of the REIT and the Operating Partnership contained in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any person controlling any Underwriter or by or on behalf of the REIT, the Operating Partnership or the REIT's officers or directors or any person controlling the REIT or the Operating Partnership and (iii) acceptance of and payment for any of the Shares.
     9. The obligations of the Underwriters under this Agreement may be terminated at any time on or prior to the Closing Date, by notice to the REIT and the Operating Partnership from the Underwriters, without liability on the part of the Underwriters to the REIT and the Operating Partnership, if, prior to delivery and payment for the Shares, in the sole judgment of the Underwriters, (i) trading in any of the equity securities of the REIT shall have been suspended by the Commission, by an exchange that lists such equity securities or by the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation National Market System, (ii) trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange shall have been suspended or limited or minimum or maximum prices shall have been generally established on such exchange, or additional material governmental restrictions, not in force on the date of this
Termination
.
 
Agreement, shall have been imposed upon trading in securities generally by such exchange or by order of the Commission or any court or other governmental authority, (iii) a general banking moratorium shall have been declared by either Federal or New York State authorities or (iv) any material adverse change in the financial or securities markets in the United States or in political, financial or economic conditions in the United States or any material outbreak or material escalation of hostilities or declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war or other material calamity or crisis, including, without limitation, an act of terrorism, shall have occurred the effect of any of which is such as to make it, in the judgment of the Underwriters, impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offering, sale or delivery of the Shares on the terms and in the manner contemplated by the Prospectus, the General Disclosure Package and this Agreement.
     10This Agreement shall become effective upon the execution and delivery hereof by the parties hereto. If, on the Closing Date or the Option Closing Date, as the case may be, any one or more of the Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Shares that it has or they have agreed to purchase hereunder on such date, and the aggregate number of Shares which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase is not more than one-tenth of the aggregate number of the Shares to be purchased on such date, the other Underwriters shall be obligated severally in the proportions that the number of Firm Shares set forth opposite their respective names in bears to the aggregate number of Firm Shares set forth opposite the names of all such non-defaulting Underwriters, or in such other proportions as you may specify, to purchase the Shares which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase on such date; that in no event shall the number of Shares that any Underwriter has agreed to purchase pursuant to this Agreement be increased pursuant to this Section 10 by an amount in excess of one-ninth of such number of Shares without the written consent of such Underwriter. If, on the Closing Date, any Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Firm Shares and the aggregate number of Firm Shares with respect to which such default occurs is more than one-tenth of the aggregate number of Firm Shares to be purchased and arrangements satisfactory to the Representatives and the REIT for the purchase of such Firm Shares are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the REIT. In any such case, either the Representatives or the REIT shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date, but in no event for longer than seven (7) days, in order that the required changes, if any, in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus and the General Disclosure Package or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. If, on the Option Closing Date, any Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Additional Shares and the aggregate number of Additional Shares with respect to which such default occurs is more than one-tenth of the aggregate number of Additional Shares to be purchased, the non-defaulting Underwriters shall have the option to (i) terminate their obligation hereunder to purchase Additional Shares or (ii) purchase not less than the number of Additional Shares that such non-defaulting Underwriters would have been obligated to purchase in the absence of such default. Any action taken under this paragraph shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement.
