ITEM 7.01     REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE.
     On January 26, 2006, our chairman and chief executive officer, Hamid R. Moghadam, exercised 500,000 vested stock options in a stock-for-stock transaction. The net effect of this transaction was to increase Mr. Moghadam's shareholdings by 292,982 common shares. Mr. Moghadam deferred these shares, which represent the gains from this stock option exercise, into his account established under our deferred compensation plan. Mr. Moghadam did not sell any shares of our common stock in the open market as part of this transaction. The options that Mr. Moghadam exercised were granted on November 24, 1997 in connection with our initial public offering and had an expiration date of November 24, 2007.
     As of January 26, 2006, after his stock option exercise and contribution of the resulting shares of our common stock into his deferred compensation account, Mr. Moghadam has beneficial ownership of 2,520,113 common shares and common limited partnership units (of which 388,126 are units), and he held options to purchase up to 3,107,193 shares of our common stock (of which 2,947,063 shares are fully vested and exercisable).
     This transaction will also be disclosed publicly in a Section 16 filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
