     (b) Neither Operating Partnership nor the Guarantor will take any action that would result in an Agent, the Operating Partnership or the Guarantor being required to file with the Commission pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act a Free Writing Prospectus prepared by an Agent or on an Agent's behalf that such Agent would otherwise not have been required to file thereunder.
     (c) If the Time of Sale Prospectus is being used to solicit offers to buy Notes at a time when the Prospectus is not yet available to prospective purchasers and any event shall occur or condition exist as a result of which it is necessary to amend or supplement the Time of Sale Prospectus in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances, not misleading, or if any event shall occur or condition exist as a result of which the Time of Sale Prospectus conflicts with the information contained in the Registration Statement then on file, or if, in the opinion of counsel to the Operating Partnership and the Guarantor or counsel to the Agents, it is necessary to amend or supplement the Time of Sale Prospectus to comply with applicable law, the Operating Partnership and the Guarantor will forthwith prepare, file with the Commission and furnish, at the Operating Partnership and Guarantor's expense, to each Agent and to any dealer upon request, either amendments or supplements to the Time of Sale Prospectus so that the statements in the Time of Sale Prospectus as so amended or supplemented will not, in the light of the circumstances when delivered to a prospective purchaser, be misleading or so that the Time of Sale Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, will no
 
longer conflict with the Registration Statement, or so that the Time of Sale Prospectus, as amended or supplemented will comply with applicable law.
     (d) Prior to the termination of the offering of the Notes pursuant to this Distribution Agreement or pursuant to any Terms Agreement, the Operating Partnership and the Guarantor will not file any Time of Sale Prospectus or Prospectus Supplement (including any pricing supplement) relating to the Notes or any amendment to the Registration Statement relating to the Notes unless the Operating Partnership and the Guarantor have previously furnished to the Agents copies thereof for their review and will not file any such proposed supplement or amendment to which the Agents reasonably object; , that (i) the foregoing requirement shall not apply to any of the Company's filings with the Commission required to be filed pursuant to Section 13(a), 13(c), 13(f), 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act and (ii) any Prospectus Supplement that merely sets forth the terms or a description of particular Notes shall only be reviewed and approved by the Agent or Agents offering or purchasing such Notes. Subject to the foregoing sentence, the Operating Partnership and the Guarantor will promptly cause each Prospectus Supplement to be filed with or transmitted for filing to the Commission in accordance with Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act. The Operating Partnership and the Guarantor will promptly advise the Agents (A) of the filing of any amendment or supplement to the Basic Prospectus (except that notice of the filing of an amendment or supplement to the Basic Prospectus that merely sets forth the terms or a description of particular Notes shall only be given to the Agent or Agents offering or purchasing such Notes and the Operating Partnership and the Guarantor shall not be required to so advise the Agents of the filing of its filings with the Commission required to be filed pursuant to Section 13(a), 13(c), 13(f), 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act), (B) of the filing and effectiveness of any amendment to the Registration Statement, except for the filing of its filings with the Commission required to be filed pursuant to Section 13(a), 13(c), 13(f), 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, (C) of any request by the Commission for any amendment to the Registration Statement or any amendment or supplement to the Basic Prospectus or for any additional information, (D) of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or the institution or threatening of any proceeding for that purpose and (E) of the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of the Notes for sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose. The Operating Partnership and the Guarantor will use best efforts to prevent the issuance of any such stop order or notice of suspension of qualification and, if issued, to obtain as soon as possible the withdrawal thereof. If the Basic Prospectus is amended or supplemented as a result of the filing under the Exchange Act of any document incorporated by reference in the Prospectus, no Agent shall be obligated to solicit offers to purchase Notes so long as it is not reasonably satisfied with such document.
provided, however
     (e) If, at any time when a prospectus (or in lieu thereof the notice referred to in Rule 173(a) under the Securities Act) relating to the Notes is required to be delivered under the Securities Act, any event occurs or condition exists as a result of which the Prospectus, as then amended or supplemented, would include an untrue statement of a material fact, or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein,

If the Operating Partnership and the Guarantor shall decide to amend or supplement the Registration Statement or Prospectus, as then amended or supplemented, it shall so advise the Agents promptly by telephone (with confirmation in writing) and, at its expense, shall prepare and cause to be filed promptly with the Commission an amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or Prospectus, as then amended or supplemented, satisfactory in all respects to the Agents, that will correct such statement or omission or effect such compliance and will supply such amended or supplemented Prospectus to the Agents in such quantities as they may reasonably request. If the documents, certificates, opinions and letters furnished to the Agents pursuant to Sections 3(g), 5(a), 5(b) and 5(c) hereof in connection with the preparation and filing of such amendment or supplement are satisfactory in all respects to the Agents, upon the filing with the Commission of such amendment or supplement to the Prospectus or upon the effectiveness of an amendment to the Registration Statement, the Agents will resume the solicitation of offers to purchase Notes hereunder. Notwithstanding any other provision of this paragraph, until the distribution of any Notes an Agent may own as principal has been completed, if any event described above in this paragraph occurs, the Operating Partnership and the Guarantor will, at their own expense, forthwith prepare and cause to be filed promptly with the Commission an amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or Prospectus, as then amended or supplemented, satisfactory in all respects to such Agent and the Operating Partnership and the Guarantor, will supply such amended or supplemented Prospectus to such Agent in such quantities as it may reasonably request and shall furnish to such Agent pursuant to Sections 3(g), 5(a), 5(b) and 5(c) hereof such documents, certificates, opinions and letters specified therein in connection with the preparation and filing of such amendment or supplement.

     (h) The Operating Partnership and the Guarantor will endeavor to qualify the Notes and the Guarantees for offer and sale under the securities or Blue Sky laws of such jurisdictions as the Agents shall reasonably request and to maintain such qualifications for as long as the Agents shall reasonably request.
     (i) The Operating Partnership and the Guarantor shall furnish to the Agents such relevant documents and certificates of officers of the Company relating to the business, operations and affairs of the Company, the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any amendments or supplements thereto, any Time of Sale Prospectus, the Indenture, the Notes, this Distribution Agreement, the Administrative Procedures, any Terms Agreement and the performance by the Company of its obligations hereunder or thereunder as the Agents may from time to time reasonably request.
     (j) The Operating Partnership and the Guarantor, as applicable, shall notify the Agents promptly in writing of any downgrading, or of its receipt of any notice of any intended or potential downgrading or of any review for possible change that does not indicate the direction of the possible change, in the rating accorded the Company, any of the Operating Partnership's or the Guarantor's securities by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization," as such term is defined for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Securities Act.
     (k) The Operating Partnership and the Guarantor will, whether or not any sale of Notes is consummated or this Distribution Agreement or any Terms Agreement is terminated, pay all expenses incident to the performance of its obligations under this Distribution Agreement and any Terms Agreement, including: (i) the preparation and filing of the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus prepared by or on behalf of, used by, or referred to by the Operating Partnership or the Guarantor and all amendments and supplements thereto, (ii) the preparation, issuance and delivery of the Notes and the Guarantees, (iii) the fees and disbursements of the Company's counsel and accountants and of the Trustee and its counsel, (iv) the qualification of the Notes and Guarantees under securities or Blue Sky laws in accordance with the provisions of Section 3(e) hereof, including filing fees and the fees and disbursements of counsel for the Agents in connection therewith and in connection with the preparation of any Blue Sky or Legal Investment Memoranda, (v) the printing and delivery to the Agents in quantities as hereinabove stated of copies of the Registration Statement and all amendments thereto and of the Prospectus and any

In any such proceeding, any Indemnified Party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Party unless (i) the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be

inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood that the Indemnifying Party shall not, in respect of the legal expenses of any Indemnified Party in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified parties and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Such firm shall be designated in writing by the Agents, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 6(a), and by the Guarantor, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 6(b). The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the Indemnifying Party agrees to indemnify the Indemnified Party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an Indemnified Party shall have requested an Indemnifying Party in writing to reimburse the Indemnified Party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by the second and third sentences of this paragraph, the Indemnifying Party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 60 days after receipt by such Indemnifying Party of the aforesaid request and (ii) such Indemnifying Party shall not have reimbursed the Indemnified Party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No Indemnifying Party shall, without the prior written consent of each Indemnified Party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding.
     (d) To the extent the indemnification provided for in Section 6(a) or 6(b) is unavailable to an Indemnified Party or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each Indemnifying Party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Party thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Operating Partnership and the Guarantor on the one hand and the Agents on the other hand from the offering of the Notes to which such losses, claims damages or liabilities relates or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause 6(d)(i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause 6(d)(i) above but also the relative fault of the Operating Partnership and the Guarantor on the one hand and of the Agents on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Operating Partnership and the Guarantor on the one hand and the Agents on the other hand in connection with such offering of the Notes shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from such offering of the Notes (before deducting expenses) received by the Operating Partnership or the Guarantor bear to the total discounts and commissions received by the Agents in respect thereof as set forth in the Prospectus. The relative fault of the Operating Partnership and the Guarantor on the one hand and the Agents on the other hand shall be determined by
 
reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Operating Partnership and the Guarantor or by the Agents and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Agents' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 6 are several in the proportion that the principal amount of the Notes the sale of which by or through such Agent gave rise to such losses, claims, damages or liabilities bears to the aggregate principal amount of the Notes the sale of which by or through any Agent gave rise to such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, and not joint.
     (e) The Operating Partnership and the Guarantor and the Agents agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 6 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Agents were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in Section 6(d). The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in Section 6(d) shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 6, no Agent shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Notes referred to in Section 6(d) that were offered and sold to the public through such Agent exceeds the amount of any damages that such Agent has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The remedies provided for in this Section 6 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any Indemnified Party at law or in equity.
     (f) The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in this Section 6 and the representations, warranties and other statements of the Company contained in or made pursuant to this Distribution Agreement or any Terms Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Distribution Agreement or any such Terms Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of any Agent or any person controlling any Agent or by or on behalf of the Company, the Guarantor's officers or directors or any person controlling the Operating Partnership or the Guarantor and (iii) acceptance of and payment for any of the Notes.
     7. In acting under this Distribution Agreement and in connection with the sale of any Notes by the Operating Partnership (other than Notes sold to an Agent as principal pursuant to a Terms Agreement), each Agent is acting solely as agent of the Operating Partnership and does not assume any obligation towards or relationship of agency or trust with any purchaser of Notes. An Agent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to assist the Operating Partnership in obtaining performance by each purchaser whose offer to purchase Notes has been solicited by such Agent and accepted by the Operating Partnership, but such Agent shall not have any liability to the Operating Partnership or the Company in the event
Position of the Agents
.
 
any such purchase is not consummated for any reason. If the Operating Partnership shall default in its obligations to deliver Notes to a purchaser whose offer it has accepted, the Operating Partnership shall hold the relevant Agent harmless against any loss, claim, damage or liability arising from or as a result of such default and shall, in particular, pay to such Agent the commission it would have received had such sale been consummated.
     8. This Distribution Agreement may be terminated at any time by the Operating Partnership or, as to any Agent, by the Operating Partnership or such Agent upon the giving of written notice of such termination to the other parties hereto, but without prejudice to any rights, obligations or liabilities of any party hereto accrued or incurred prior to such termination. In the event of such termination with respect to any Agent, this Distribution Agreement shall remain in full force and effect with respect to any Agent as to which such termination has not occurred. The termination of this Distribution Agreement shall not require termination of any Terms Agreement, and the termination of any such Terms Agreement shall not require termination of this Distribution Agreement. If this Distribution Agreement is terminated, the provisions of the third paragraph of Section 2(a), Section 2(e), the last sentence of Section 3(e), and Sections 3(f), 3(k), 6, 7, 9, 10 and 13 hereof shall survive; that if at the time of termination an offer to purchase Notes has been accepted by the Operating Partnership but the time of delivery to the purchaser or its agent of such Notes has not occurred, the provisions of Sections 1, 2(b), 2(c), 3(d), 3(g), 3(h), 3(i), 3(j), 4 and 5 hereof shall also survive until such delivery has been made.

Except as herein otherwise
 
expressly provided, such action shall become effective when such instrument or instruments are delivered to the Trustee and, where it is hereby expressly required, to the Operating Partnership. Such instrument or instruments (and the action embodied therein and evidenced thereby) are herein sometimes referred to as the "Act" of the Holders signing such instrument or instruments or so voting at any such meeting. Proof of execution of any such instrument or of a writing appointing any such agent, or of the holding by any Person of a Security, shall be sufficient for any purpose of this Indenture and conclusive in favor of the Trustee and the Operating Partnership and any agent of the Trustee or the Operating Partnership, if made in the manner provided in this Section. The record of any meeting of Holders shall be proved in the manner provided in Section 1306.

Where such execution is by a signer acting in a capacity other than his individual capacity, such certificate or affidavit shall also constitute sufficient proof of his authority. The fact and date of the execution of any such instrument or writing, or the authority of the Person executing the same, may also be proved in any other reasonable manner which the Trustee deems sufficient in its reasonable discretion.
     (c) The ownership of Securities shall be proved by the Security Register.
     (d) If the Operating Partnership shall solicit from the Holders any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act, the Operating Partnership may, at its option, in or pursuant to a Board Resolution, fix in advance a record date for the determination of Holders entitled to give such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act, but the Operating Partnership shall have no obligation to do so. Notwithstanding TIA Section 316(c), such record date shall be the record date specified in or pursuant to such Board Resolution, which shall be a date not earlier than the date 30 days prior to the first solicitation of Holders generally in connection therewith and not later than the date such solicitation is completed. If such a record date is fixed, such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act may be given before or after such record date, but only the Holders of record at the close of business on such record date shall be deemed to be Holders for the purposes of determining whether Holders of the requisite proportion of outstanding Securities have authorized or agreed or consented to such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act, and for that purpose the Outstanding Securities shall be computed as of such record date; provided that no such authorization, agreement or consent by the Holders on such record date shall be deemed effective unless it shall become effective pursuant to the provisions of this Indenture not later than eleven months after the record date.
     (e) Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act of the Holder of any Security shall bind every future Holder of the same Security and the Holder of every Security issued upon the registration of transfer thereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu thereof in respect of anything done, omitted or suffered
 
to be done by the Trustee, any Security Registrar, any Paying Agent, any Authenticating Agent or the Operating Partnership in reliance thereon, whether or not notation of such action is made upon such Security.

     (1) the Trustee by any Holder or by the Operating Partnership shall be sufficient upon receipt for every purpose hereunder if made, given, furnished or filed in writing to or with the Trustee at its Corporate Trust Office, Attention: Corporate Trust Department, or
     (2) the Operating Partnership by the Trustee or by any Holder shall be sufficient upon receipt for every purpose hereunder (unless otherwise herein expressly provided) if in writing and mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to the Operating Partnership addressed to it at the address of its principal office specified in the first paragraph of this Indenture, marked for the attention of the Chief Financial Officer, with a copy to the General Counsel, or at any other address previously furnished in writing to the Trustee by the Operating Partnership.
     SECTION 106. NOTICE TO HOLDERS; WAIVER. Where this Indenture provides for notice of any event to Holders by the Operating Partnership or the Trustee, such notice shall be sufficiently given (unless otherwise herein expressly provided) if in writing and mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to each such Holder affected by such event, at his address as it appears in the Security Register, not later than the latest date, and not earlier than the earliest date, prescribed for the giving of such notice. In any case where notice to Holders is given by mail, neither the failure to mail such notice, nor any defect in any notice so mailed, to any particular Holder shall affect the sufficiency of such notice with respect to other Holders. Any notice mailed to a Holder in the manner herein prescribed shall be conclusively deemed to have been received by such Holder five Business Days after being deposited in the mail, whether or not such Holder actually receives such notice.
     If by reason of the suspension of or irregularities in regular mail service or by reason of any other cause it shall be impracticable to give such notice by mail, then such notification to Holders as shall be made with the approval of the Trustee shall constitute a sufficient notification to such Holders for every purpose hereunder.
     Where this Indenture provides for notice in any manner, such notice may be waived in writing by the Person entitled to receive such notice, either before or after the event, and such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice. Waivers of notice by Holders shall be filed with the Trustee, but such filing shall not be a condition precedent to the validity of any action taken in reliance upon such waiver.

This Indenture is subject to the provisions of the TIA that are required to be part of this Indenture and shall, to the extent applicable, be governed by such provisions.
     SECTION 112. LEGAL HOLIDAYS. In any case where any Interest Payment Date, Redemption Date, Repayment Date, Stated Maturity or Maturity of any Security shall not be a Business Day, then (notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture or any Security), payment of interest or principal (and premium, if any) need not be made on such date, but may be made on the next succeeding Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on the Interest Payment Date, Redemption Date, Repayment Date, or at the Stated Maturity or Maturity, as the case may be, provided that no interest shall accrue on the amount so payable for the period from and after such Interest Payment Date, Redemption Date, Repayment Date, Stated Maturity or Maturity, as the case may be.
     SECTION 113. COUNTERPARTS. This Indenture may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which so executed shall be deemed to be an original, but all such counterparts shall together constitute but one and the same Indenture.

Subject to the provisions of Section 303 and, if applicable Section 304, the Trustee shall deliver and redeliver any Security in permanent global form in the manner and upon instructions given by the Person or Persons specified therein or pursuant to Section 301 or in the applicable Operating Partnership Order. If an Operating Partnership Order pursuant to Section 304 or 305 has been or is delivered, any instructions by the Operating Partnership with respect to endorsement or delivery or redelivery of a Security in global form shall be in writing but need not comply with Section 102 and need not be accompanied by an Opinion of Counsel.
     The provisions of the last sentence of Section 303 shall apply to any Security represented by a Security in global form if such Security was never issued and sold by the Operating Partnership and the Operating Partnership delivers to the Trustee the Security in global form together with written instructions (which need not comply with Section 102 and need not be accompanied by an Opinion of Counsel) with regard to the reduction in the principal amount of Securities represented thereby, together with the written statement contemplated by the last sentence of Section 303.

The terms of the Securities of any series may provide, without limitation, that the Securities shall be authenticated and delivered by the Trustee on original issue from time to time upon telephonic or written order of persons designated in or pursuant to the relevant Board Resolution, Officers' Certificate or supplemental indenture, as the case may be (telephonic instructions to be promptly confirmed in writing by such person) and that such persons are authorized to determine, consistent with such Board Resolution, Officers' Certificate or supplemental indenture, as the case may be, such terms and conditions of the Securities of such series as are specified in such Board Resolution, Officers' Certificate or supplemental indenture, as the case may be. All Securities of any one series need not be issued at the same time and, unless otherwise provided in the applicable supplemental indenture, a series may be reopened, without the consent of the Holders, for issuance of additional Securities of such series.
     SECTION 302. DENOMINATIONS . The Securities of any series shall be issuable in denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiple thereof.
     SECTION 303. EXECUTION, AUTHENTICATION, DELIVERY AND DATING. The Securities shall be executed on behalf of the Operating Partnership by its General Partner by such General Partner's Chairman, President or any Vice President. If a Guarantor is a corporation its Guarantee shall be executed on behalf of such Guarantor by its Chairman, President or any Vice President and if a Guarantor is a partnership or a limited liability company its Guarantee shall be executed on behalf of such Guarantor by the Chairman, President or any Vice President of its general partner or manager, as applicable. The signature of any of these officers on the Securities or Guarantees, if any, may be manual or facsimile signatures of the present or any future such authorized officer and may be imprinted or otherwise reproduced on the Securities or the Guarantees.
     The Guarantees or Securities bearing the manual or facsimile signatures of individuals who were at any time the proper officers of the Operating Partnership's General Partner, the
 
Guarantors (or the general partner or manager of such Guarantor) or any corporate successor of the Operating Partnership or any Guarantor, as applicable, shall bind the Operating Partnership or the applicable Guarantor, notwithstanding that such individuals or any of them have ceased to hold such offices prior to the authentication and delivery of such Securities or Guarantees or did not hold such offices at the date of such Securities or Guarantees.
     Each Security and Guarantee shall be dated the date of its authentication.
     No Security or Guarantee shall be entitled to any benefit under this Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose unless there appears on such Security a certificate of authentication substantially in the form provided for herein duly executed by the Trustee by manual signature of an authorized signatory, and such certificate upon any Security shall be conclusive evidence, and the only evidence, that such Security has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder and is entitled to the benefits of this Indenture. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Security shall have been authenticated and delivered hereunder but never issued and sold by the Operating Partnership, and the Operating Partnership shall deliver such Security to the Trustee for cancellation as provided in Section 309 together with a written statement (which need not comply with Section 102 and need not be accompanied by an Opinion of Counsel) stating that such Security has never been issued and sold by the Operating Partnership, for all purposes of this Indenture such Security shall be deemed never to have been authenticated and delivered hereunder and shall never be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture.
     SECTION 304. TEMPORARY SECURITIES. Pending the preparation of definitive Securities of any series, the Operating Partnership may execute, and upon Operating Partnership Order the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, temporary Securities which are printed, lithographed, typewritten, mimeographed or otherwise produced, in any authorized denomination, substantially of the tenor of the definitive Securities in lieu of which they are issued, in registered form, and with such appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions and other variations as the officers executing such Securities may determine, as conclusively evidenced by their execution of such Securities. In the case of Securities of any series, such temporary Securities may be in global form.
     If temporary Securities of any series are issued, the Operating Partnership will cause definitive Securities of that series to be prepared without unreasonable delay. After the preparation of definitive Securities of such series, the temporary Securities of such series shall be exchangeable for definitive Securities of such series upon surrender of the temporary Securities of such series at the office or agency of the Operating Partnership in a Place of Payment for that series, without charge to the Holder. Upon surrender for cancellation of any one or more temporary Securities of any series, the Operating Partnership shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a like principal amount of definitive Securities of the same series of authorized denominations. Until so exchanged, the temporary Securities of any series shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Securities of such series.
 
     SECTION 305. REGISTRATION, REGISTRATION OF TRANSFER AND EXCHANGE. The Operating Partnership shall cause to be kept at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee or in any office or agency of the Operating Partnership in a Place of Payment a register for any series of Securities (the registers maintained in such office or in any such office or agency of the Operating Partnership in a Place of Payment being herein sometimes referred to collectively as the "Security Register") in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Operating Partnership shall provide for the registration of Securities and of transfers and exchanges of Securities. The Security Register shall be in written form or any other form capable of being converted into written form within a reasonable time. The Trustee, at its Corporate Trust Office and at the office of its affiliate in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York at the address set forth in Section 1002 (or at such other address at which the Trustee's affiliate's New York office may subsequently be located), is hereby initially appointed "Security Registrar" for the purpose of registering Securities and transfers and exchanges of Securities on such Security Register as herein provided. In the event that the Trustee shall cease to be Security Registrar, it shall have the right to examine the Security Register at all reasonable times.
     Subject to the provisions of this Section 305, upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Security of any series at any office or agency of the Operating Partnership in a Place of Payment for that series, the Operating Partnership shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in the name of the designated transferee or transferees, one or more new Securities of the same series, of any authorized denominations and of a like aggregate principal amount, bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding, and containing identical terms and provisions. Subject to the provisions of this Section 305, at the option of the Holder, Securities of any series may be exchanged for other Securities of the same series, of any authorized denomination or denominations and of a like aggregate principal amount, containing identical terms and provisions, upon surrender of the Securities to be exchanged at any such office or agency. Whenever any such Securities are so surrendered for exchange, the Operating Partnership shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the Securities which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive.
     Any permanent global Security shall be exchangeable only as provided in this paragraph. If the depositary for any permanent global Security is DTC, then, unless the terms of such global Security expressly permit such global Security to be exchanged in whole or in part for definitive Securities, a global Security may be transferred, in whole but not in part, only to a nominee of DTC, or by a nominee of DTC to DTC, or to a successor to DTC for such global Security selected or approved by the Operating Partnership or to a nominee of such successor to DTC. If at any time (i) DTC notifies the Operating Partnership that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depositary for the applicable global Security or Securities or if at any time DTC ceases to be a clearing agency registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 if so required by applicable law or regulation, and, in either case, a successor depositary is not appointed by the Operating Partnership within 90 days after the Operating Partnership receives such notice or becomes aware of such ineligibility, (ii) the Operating Partnership in its sole discretion determines that such global Securities shall be exchangeable for definitive Securities or (iii) there shall have occurred and be continuing an Event of Default under this Indenture with respect to the Securities of any series and beneficial owners representing a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities represented by such global Securities advise DTC to cease
 
acting as depositary, then the Operating Partnership shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, definitive Securities of like series, rank, tenor and terms in definitive form in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of such global Security or Securities. If any beneficial owner of an interest in a permanent global Security is otherwise entitled to exchange such interest for Securities of such series and of like tenor and principal amount of another authorized form and denomination, as specified by Board Resolution and the applicable supplemental indenture as contemplated by Section 301 and provided that any applicable notice provided in the permanent global Security shall have been given, then without unnecessary delay but in any event not later than the earliest date on which such interest may be so exchanged, the Operating Partnership shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, definitive Securities in aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of such beneficial owner's interest in such permanent global Security. On or after the earliest date on which such interests may be so exchanged, such permanent global Security shall be surrendered for exchange by DTC or such other depositary as shall be specified in the Operating Partnership Order with respect thereto to the Trustee, as the Operating Partnership's agent for such purpose. If a Security is issued in exchange for any portion of a permanent global Security after the close of business at the office or agency where such exchange occurs on (i) any Regular Record Date and before the opening of business at such office or agency on the relevant Interest Payment Date, or (ii) any special Record Date and before the opening of business at such office or agency on the related proposed date for payment of Defaulted Interest, Interest or Defaulted Interest, as the case may be, such interest will not be payable on such Interest Payment Date or proposed date for payment, as the case may be, in respect of such Security, but will be payable on such Interest Payment Date or proposed date for payment, as the case may be, only to the Person to whom interest in respect of such portion of such permanent global Security is payable in accordance with the provisions of this Indenture.
     All Securities issued upon any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities shall be the valid obligations of the Operating Partnership, evidencing the same Debt, and entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture, as the Securities surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange.
     Every Security presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or for exchange or redemption shall (if so required by the Operating Partnership or the Security Registrar) be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Operating Partnership and the Security Registrar duly executed by the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing.
     No service charge shall be made to the Holder for any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, but the Operating Partnership may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, other than exchanges pursuant to Section 304, 906 or 1107.
     The Operating Partnership or the Trustee, as applicable, shall not be required (i) to issue, register the transfer of or exchange any Security if such Security may be among those selected for redemption during a period beginning at the opening of business 15 days before selection of the Securities to be redeemed under Section 1103 and ending at the close of business on the day of the mailing of the relevant notice of redemption, or (ii) to register the transfer of or exchange
 
any Security so selected for redemption in whole or in part, except, in the case of any Security to be redeemed in part, the portion thereof not to be redeemed, or (iii) if applicable, to issue, register the transfer of or exchange any Security which has been surrendered for repayment at the option of the Holder, except the portion, if any, of such Security not to be so repaid.
     SECTION 306. MUTILATED, DESTROYED, LOST AND STOLEN SECURITIES. If any mutilated Security or a Security with a Guarantee appertaining thereto is surrendered to the Trustee or the Operating Partnership, together with, in proper cases, indemnity as may be required by the Operating Partnership or the Trustee to save each of them or any agent of either of them harmless, the Operating Partnership shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a new Security of the same series and principal amount, containing identical terms and provisions and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding, with Guarantees corresponding to the Guarantees appertaining to the surrendered Security.
     If there shall be delivered to the Operating Partnership and to the Trustee (i) evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Security or Guarantee, and (ii) such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them and any agent of either of them harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the Operating Partnership or the Trustee that such Security or Guarantee has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the Operating Partnership shall execute and upon its request the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in lieu of any such destroyed, lost or stolen Security or in exchange for the Security to which a destroyed, lost or stolen Guarantee appertains, a new Security of the same series and principal amount, containing identical terms and provisions and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding with Guarantees corresponding to the Guarantees appertaining to such destroyed, lost or stolen Security or to the Security to which such destroyed, lost or stolen Guarantee appertains.
     Notwithstanding the provisions of the previous two paragraphs, in case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security has become or is about to become due and payable, the Operating Partnership in its discretion may, instead of issuing a new Security, pay such Security.
     Upon the issuance of any new Security under this Section, the Operating Partnership may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected therewith.
     Every new Security of any series issued pursuant to this Section in lieu of any destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall constitute an original additional contractual obligation of the Operating Partnership, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Securities of that series duly issued hereunder.
     The provisions of this Section are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities or Guarantees.
 
     SECTION 307. PAYMENT OF INTEREST; INTEREST RIGHTS PRESERVED. Except as otherwise specified with respect to a series of Securities in accordance with the provisions of Section 301, interest on any Security that is payable, and is punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date shall be paid to the Person in whose name that Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest at the office or agency of the Operating Partnership maintained for such purpose pursuant to Section 1002; provided, however, that each installment of interest on any Security may at the Operating Partnership's option be paid by (i) mailing a check for such interest, payable to or upon the written order of the Person entitled thereto pursuant to Section 308, to the address of such Person as it appears on the Security Register or (ii) wire transfer to an account maintained by the payee located in the United States.
     Unless otherwise provided as contemplated by Section 301, interest, if any, payable on any permanent global Security on any Interest Payment Date will be paid to DTC, with respect to that portion of such permanent global Security held for its account by Cede & Co. (or by another nominee of DTC or by DTC) for the purpose of permitting such party to credit the interest received by it in respect of such permanent global Security to the accounts of the beneficial owners thereof.
     Except as otherwise specified with respect to a series of Securities in accordance with the provisions of Section 301, any interest on any Security of any series that is payable, but is not punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date (herein called "Defaulted Interest") shall forthwith cease to be payable to the registered Holder thereof on the relevant Regular Record Date by virtue of having been such Holder, and such Defaulted Interest may be paid by the Operating Partnership, at its election in each case, as provided in clause (1) or (2) below:
     (1) The Operating Partnership may elect to make payment of any Defaulted Interest to the Persons in whose names the Securities of such series (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest, which shall be fixed in the following manner. The Operating Partnership shall notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of Defaulted Interest proposed to be paid on each Security of such series and the date of the proposed payment (which shall not be less than 20 days after such notice is received by the Trustee), and at the same time the Operating Partnership shall deposit with the Trustee an amount of money (except as otherwise specified pursuant to Section 301 for the Securities of such series) equal to the aggregate amount proposed to be paid in respect of such Defaulted Interest or shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for such deposit on or prior to the date of the proposed payment, such money when deposited to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such Defaulted Interest as in this clause provided. Thereupon the Trustee shall fix a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest which shall be not more than 15 days and not less than 10 days prior to the date of the proposed payment and not less than 10 days after the receipt by the Trustee of the notice of the proposed payment. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Operating Partnership of such Special Record Date and, in the name and at the expense of the Operating Partnership, shall cause notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor to be mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to
 
each Holder of such series at his address as it appears in the Security Register not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date. The Trustee shall, in the name and at the expense of the Operating Partnership, cause a similar notice to be published at least once in an Authorized Newspaper in each Place of Payment, but such publications shall not be a condition precedent to the establishment of such Special Record Date. Notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor having been mailed as aforesaid, such Defaulted Interest shall be paid to the Persons in whose names the Securities of such series (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on such Special Record Date and shall no longer be payable pursuant to the following clause (2).
     (2) The Operating Partnership may make payment of any Defaulted Interest on the Securities of any series in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which such Securities may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, if, after notice given by the Operating Partnership to the Trustee of the proposed payment pursuant to this clause, such manner of payment shall be deemed practicable by the Trustee.
     Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section and Section 305, each Security delivered under this Indenture upon registration of transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of any other Security shall carry the rights to interest accrued and unpaid, and to accrue, which were carried by such other Security.
     SECTION 308. PERSONS DEEMED OWNERS. Prior to due presentment of a Security for registration of transfer, the Operating Partnership, the Guarantors, the Trustee and any agent of the Operating Partnership or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name such Security is registered as the owner of such Security for the purpose of receiving payment of principal of (and premium, if any), and (subject to Sections 305 and 307) interest on, such Security and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not such Security be overdue, and neither the Operating Partnership, the Guarantors, the Trustee nor any agent of the Operating Partnership, the Guarantors or the Trustee shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
     None of the Operating Partnership, the Guarantors, the Trustee, any Paying Agent or the Security Registrar will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests of a Security in global form or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interests.
     Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any global Security, nothing herein shall prevent the Operating Partnership, the Trustee, or any agent of the Operating Partnership or the Trustee from giving effect to any written certification, proxy or other authorization furnished by any depositary, as a Holder, with respect to such global Security or impair, as between such depositary and owners of beneficial interests in such global Security, the operation of customary practices governing the exercise of the rights of such depositary (or its nominee) as Holder of such global Security.
 
     SECTION 309. CANCELLATION. All Securities surrendered for payment, redemption, repayment at the option of the Holder, or registration of transfer or exchange shall, if surrendered to any Person other than the Trustee, be delivered to the Trustee, and any such Securities surrendered directly to the Trustee for any such purpose shall be promptly canceled by it. The Operating Partnership may at any time deliver to the Trustee for cancellation any Securities previously authenticated and delivered hereunder which the Operating Partnership may have acquired in any manner whatsoever, and may deliver to the Trustee (or to any other Person for delivery to the Trustee) for cancellation any Securities previously authenticated hereunder which the Operating Partnership has not issued and sold, and all Securities so delivered shall be promptly canceled by the Trustee. If the Operating Partnership shall so acquire any of the Securities, however, such acquisition shall not operate as a redemption or satisfaction of the indebtedness represented by such Securities unless and until the same are surrendered to the Trustee for cancellation. No Securities shall be authenticated in lieu of or in exchange for any Securities canceled as provided in this Section, except as expressly permitted by or pursuant to this Indenture. Canceled Securities held by the Trustee shall be destroyed by the Trustee and the Trustee shall deliver a certificate of such destruction to the Operating Partnership, unless by a Operating Partnership Order the Operating Partnership directs their return to it.
     SECTION 310. COMPUTATION OF INTEREST. Interest on the Securities of any series shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months.
     SECTION 401. SATISFACTION AND DISCHARGE OF INDENTURE. This Indenture shall upon Operating Partnership Request cease to be of further effect with respect to any series of Securities specified in such Operating Partnership Request (except as hereinafter provided in this Section 401). The Trustee, upon receipt of an Operating Partnership Order, and at the expense of the Operating Partnership, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture as to such series when:
     (1) either:
     (A) all Securities of such series theretofore authenticated and delivered have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or
     (B) all Securities of such series (x):
     (i) have become due and payable, or
     (ii) will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity within one year, or
     (iii) if redeemable at the option of the Operating Partnership, are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Operating Partnership,
 
and (y) the Operating Partnership, in the case of (i), (ii) or (iii) above, has irrevocably deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee as trust funds in trust, an amount sufficient to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on such Securities, for principal (and premium, if any) and interest to the date of such deposit (in the case of Securities which have become due and payable) or to the Stated Maturity or Redemption Date, as the case may be;
     (2) the Operating Partnership has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable hereunder by the Operating Partnership; and
     (3) the Operating Partnership has delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent herein provided for relating to the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture as to such series have been complied with.
     Notwithstanding the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture, the obligations of the Operating Partnership to the Trustee and any predecessor Trustee under Section 606, the obligations of the Operating Partnership to any Authenticating Agent under Section 611 and, if money shall have been deposited with and held by the Trustee pursuant to subclause (B) of clause (1) of this Section, the obligations of the Operating Partnership and the Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series under Sections 305, 306, 402, 1002 and 1003, shall survive.
     SECTION 402. APPLICATION OF TRUST FUNDS. Subject to the provisions of the last paragraph of Section 1003, all money deposited with the Trustee pursuant to Section 401 shall be held in trust and applied by it, in accordance with the provisions of the Securities and this Indenture, to the payment, either directly or through any Paying Agent (other than the Operating Partnership acting as its own Paying Agent) as the Trustee may determine, to the Persons entitled thereto, of the principal (and premium, if any), and interest, if any, for whose payment such money has been deposited with or received by the Trustee, but such money need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law.
     SECTION 501. EVENTS OF DEFAULT. "Event of Default," means, with respect to any series of Securities, any one of the following events (whatever the reason for such Event of Default and whether or not it shall be voluntary or involuntary or be effected by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental body):
     (1) default in the payment of any interest on any Security of that series, when such interest becomes due and payable, and continuance of such default for a period of 30 days; or
 
     (2) default in the payment of any principal of or premium, if any, on any Security of that series when it becomes due and payable at its Maturity (whether at Stated Maturity, upon redemption or otherwise); or
     (3) default in the performance or breach of any covenant or warranty of the Operating Partnership in this Indenture with respect to any Security of that series (other than a covenant or warranty a default in whose performance or whose breach is elsewhere in this Section specifically dealt with or included herein solely for the benefit of a series of Securities other than that series), and continuance of such default or breach for a period of 60 days after there has been given, by registered or certified mail, to the Operating Partnership by the Trustee or to the Operating Partnership and the Trustee by the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series, a written notice specifying such default or breach and requiring to be remedied and stating that such notice is a "Notice of Default" hereunder; or
     (4) (a) default by the Operating Partnership or any Subsidiary of the Operating Partnership in the payment (whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration, upon required prepayment or otherwise), beyond any period of grace provided therefor, of any principal of or interest on any bond, note, debenture or other evidence of indebtedness, or (b) any other breach or default (or other event or condition) shall occur under any agreement, indenture or instrument relating to any such bond, Security, debenture or other evidence of indebtedness beyond any cure period provided therefor, if as a result thereof the holder or holders of any such bond, Security, debenture or other evidence of indebtedness (or a person on behalf of such holder or holders) has the immediate right to cause (upon the giving of notice, if required) any such bond, Security, debenture or other evidence of indebtedness to become or be declared due and payable, or required to be prepaid, redeemed, purchased or defeased (or an offer of prepayment, redemption, purchase or defeasance be made), prior to its stated maturity (other than by a scheduled mandatory prepayment), which in the aggregate under (a) and (b) have a principal amount equal to or greater than $20,000,000 without such bond, note, debenture or other evidence of indebtedness having been discharged, or such breach or default having been cured, within a period of 10 days after there has been given, by registered or certified mail, to the Operating Partnership by the Trustee or to the Operating Partnership and the Trustee by the Holders of at least 25% of the Outstanding Securities of such series, a written notice specifying such breach or default and requiring such bond, note, debenture or other evidence of indebtedness to be discharged, or such breach or default to be cured and stating that such notice is a "Notice of Default" hereunder; or
     (5) Intentionally Omitted
     (6) the Operating Partnership, the General Partner or any Significant Subsidiary pursuant to or within the meaning of any Bankruptcy Law:
     (A) commences a voluntary case or proceeding,
 
     (B) consents to the entry of an order or decree for relief against it in an involuntary case or to the commencement of any bankruptcy or insolvency case or proceeding against it,
     (C) consents to the appointment of a Custodian (as defined below) of it or for any substantial part of its property, or
     (D) makes a general assignment for the benefit of its creditors; or
     (7) a court of competent jurisdiction enters an order or decree under any Bankruptcy Law that:
     (A) is for relief against the Operating Partnership, the General Partner or any Significant Subsidiary in an involuntary case,
     (B) adjudges the Operating Partnership, the General Partner or any Significant Subsidiary bankrupt or insolvent,
     (C) approves as properly filed a petition seeking reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition of or in respect of the Operating Partnership, the General Partner or any Significant Subsidiary,
     (D) appoints a Custodian of the Operating Partnership, the General Partner or any Significant Subsidiary or for all or any substantial part of the property of the Operating Partnership, the General Partner or any Significant Subsidiary, or
     (E) orders the winding up or liquidation of the Operating Partnership, the General Partner or any Significant Subsidiary.
and the order or decree described in this clause (7) remains unstayed and in effect for 60 days.
     As used in this Section 501, the term "Bankruptcy Law" means Title 11 U.S. Code or any similar federal or state law for the relief of debtors and the term "Custodian" means any receiver, trustee, assignee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official under any Bankruptcy Law.
     SECTION 502. ACCELERATION OF MATURITY; RESCISSION AND ANNULMENT. If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of any series at the time outstanding occurs and is continuing, then and in every such case the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series may declare the principal of all the Securities of that series to be due and payable immediately, by a notice in writing to the Operating Partnership (and to the Trustee if given by the Holders), and upon the delivery of any such declaration to the Operating Partnership such principal or specified portion thereof shall become immediately due and payable.
     At any time after such a declaration of acceleration with respect to Securities of any series has been made and before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been
 
obtained by the Trustee as hereinafter in this Article provided, the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series, by written notice to the Operating Partnership and the Trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences if:
     (1) the Operating Partnership has paid or deposited with the Trustee a sum sufficient to pay:
     (A) all overdue installments of interest on all Outstanding Securities of that series,
     (B) the principal of (and premium, if any, on) any Outstanding Securities of that series which have become due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration and interest thereon at the rate or rates borne by or provided for in such Securities,
     (C) to the extent that payment of such interest is lawful, interest upon overdue installments of interest at the rate or rates borne by or provided for in such Securities, and
     (D) all sums paid or advanced by the Trustee hereunder and the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel; and
     (2) all Events of Default with respect to Securities of that series, other than the nonpayment of the principal of (or premium, if any) or interest on Securities of that series which have become due solely by such declaration of acceleration, have been cured or waived as provided in Section 513.
     No such rescission shall affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereon.
          SECTION 503. COLLECTION OF INDEBTEDNESS AND SUITS FOR ENFORCEMENT BY TRUSTEE. The Operating Partnership covenants that if:
     (1) default is made in the payment of any installment of interest on any Security of any series when such interest becomes due and payable and such default continues for a period of 30 days, or
     (2) default is made in the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any, on) any Security of any series at its Maturity,
then the Operating Partnership will, upon demand of the Trustee and provided that such default has not been cured, pay to the Trustee, for the benefit of the Holders of such Securities of such series, the whole amount then due and payable on such Securities for principal (and premium, if any) and interest, with interest upon any overdue principal (and premium, if any) and, to the extent that payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable, upon any overdue installments of interest at the rate or rates borne by or provided for in such Securities, and, in addition thereto,
 
such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of collection, including the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel.
     If the Operating Partnership fails to pay such amounts forthwith upon such demand, the Trustee, in its own name and as trustee of an express trust, may institute a judicial proceeding for the collection of the sums so due and unpaid, and may prosecute such proceeding to judgment or final decree, and may enforce the same against the Operating Partnership or any Guarantor or any other obligor upon such Securities or Guarantees of such series and collect the moneys adjudged or decreed to be payable in the manner provided by law out of the property of the Operating Partnership or Guarantor or any other obligor upon such Securities or Guarantees of such series, wherever situated.
     If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of any series occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may in its discretion proceed to protect and enforce its rights and the rights of the Holders of Securities of such series and any related Guarantees by such appropriate judicial proceedings as the Trustee shall deem most effectual to protect and enforce any such rights, whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement in this Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any power granted herein, or to enforce any other proper remedy.
     SECTION 504. TRUSTEE MAY FILE PROOFS OF CLAIM.

     (4) the Trustee for 60 days after its receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity has failed to institute any such proceeding; and
     (5) no direction inconsistent with such written request has been given to the Trustee during such 60-day period by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series;
it being understood and intended that no one or more of such Holders shall have any right in any manner whatever by virtue of, or by availing of, any provision of this Indenture to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights of any other of such Holders, or to obtain or to seek to obtain priority or preference over any other of such Holders or to enforce any right under this Indenture, except in the manner herein provided and for the equal and ratable benefit of all such Holders.

Except as otherwise provided with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities or Guarantees in the last paragraph of Section 306, no right or remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to the Trustee or to the Holders is intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every right and remedy shall, to the extent permitted by law, be cumulative and in addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise. The assertion or employment of any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any other appropriate right or remedy.
     SECTION 511. DELAY OR OMISSION NOT WAIVER. No delay or omission of the Trustee or of any Holder to exercise any right or remedy accruing upon any Event of Default shall impair any such right or remedy or constitute a waiver of any such Event of Default or an acquiescence therein.

     (2) in respect of a covenant or provision hereof which under Article Nine cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Security of such series affected.
     Upon any such waiver, such default shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured, for every purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other default or Event of Default or impair any right consequent thereon.
 
     SECTION 514. WAIVER OF USURY, STAY OR EXTENSION LAWS. The Operating Partnership covenants (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) that it will not at any time insist upon, or plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any usury, stay or extension law wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, which may affect the covenants or the performance of this Indenture; and the Operating Partnership (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) hereby expressly waives all benefit or advantage of any such law, and covenants that it will not hinder, delay or impede the execution of any power herein granted to the Trustee, but will suffer and permit the execution of every such power as though no such law had been enacted.

Within 90 days after the occurrence of any default hereunder with respect to the Securities of any series, the Trustee shall transmit, in the manner and to the extent provided in TIA Section 313(c), notice to Holders of such default hereunder actually known to the Trustee, unless such default shall have been cured or waived; provided, however, that, except in the case of a default in the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any) or interest on any Security of such series, the Trustee shall be protected in withholding such notice if and so long as a Responsible Officer of the Trustee in good faith determines, that the withholding of such notice is in the interests of such Holders; and provided further that in the case of any default or breach of the character specified in Section 501(4) with respect to the Securities, no such notice to Holders shall be given until at least 60 days after the occurrence thereof.

     (a) In case of the appointment hereunder of a successor Trustee with respect to all Securities, every such successor Trustee shall execute, acknowledge and deliver to the Operating Partnership and to the retiring Trustee an instrument accepting such appointment, and thereupon the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective and such successor Trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee; but, on request of the Operating Partnership or the successor Trustee, such retiring Trustee shall, upon payment of its charges, execute and deliver an instrument transferring to such successor Trustee all the rights, powers and trusts of the retiring Trustee, and shall duly assign, transfer and deliver to such successor Trustee all property and money held by such retiring Trustee hereunder, subject nevertheless to its lien and claim, if any, provided for in Section 606.

deliver to such successor Trustee all property and money held by such retiring Trustee hereunder with respect to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates.
     (c) Upon request of any such successor Trustee, the Operating Partnership shall execute any and all instruments for more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to such successor Trustee all such rights, powers and trusts referred to in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section, as the case may be.
     (d) No successor Trustee shall accept its appointment unless at the time of such acceptance such successor Trustee shall be qualified and eligible under this Article Six.
 
     SECTION 610. MERGER, CONVERSION, CONSOLIDATION OR SUCCESSION TO BUSINESS. Any corporation into which the Trustee may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which the Trustee shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to all or substantially all of the corporate trust business of the Trustee, shall be the successor of the Trustee hereunder, provided such corporation shall be otherwise qualified and eligible under this Article, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of any of the parties hereto. In case any Securities shall have been authenticated, but not delivered, by the Trustee then in office, any successor by merger, conversion or consolidation to such authenticating Trustee may adopt such authentication and deliver the Securities so authenticated with the same effect as if such successor Trustee had itself authenticated such Securities. In case any Securities shall not have been authenticated by such predecessor Trustee, any such successor Trustee may authenticate and deliver such Securities, in either its own name or that of its predecessor Trustee, with the full force and effect which this Indenture provides for the certificate of authentication of the Trustee.
     SECTION 611. APPOINTMENT OF AUTHENTICATING AGENT. At any time when any of the Securities remain Outstanding, the Trustee may appoint an Authenticating Agent or Agents with respect to one or more series of Securities which shall be authorized to act on behalf of the Trustee to authenticate Securities of such series issued upon exchange, registration of transfer or partial redemption or repayment thereof, and Securities so authenticated shall be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture and shall be valid and obligatory for all purposes as if authenticated by the Trustee hereunder. Any such appointment shall be evidenced by an instrument in writing signed by a Responsible Officer of the Trustee, a copy of which instrument shall be promptly furnished to the Operating Partnership. Wherever reference is made in this Indenture to the authentication and delivery of Securities by the Trustee or the Trustee's certificate of authentication, such reference shall be deemed to includeauthentication and delivery on behalf of the Trustee by an Authenticating Agent and a certificate of authentication executed on behalf of the Trustee by an Authenticating Agent. Each Authenticating Agent shall be acceptable to the Operating Partnership and shall at all times be a bank or trust company or corporation organized and doing business and in good standing under the laws of the United States of America or of any State or the District of Columbia, authorized under such laws to act as Authenticating Agent, having (or whose bank holding company has) a combined capital and surplus of not less than $100,000,000 and subject to supervision or examination by Federal or state authorities. If such Authenticating Agent publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or the requirements of the aforesaid supervising or examining authority, then for the purposes of this Section, the combined capital and surplus of such Authenticating Agent shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published. In case at any time an Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, such Authenticating Agent shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect specified in this section.
     Any corporation into which an Authenticating Agent may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which such Authenticating Agent shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to the corporate agency or corporate trust business of an Authenticating Agent, shall continue to be an Authenticating Agent, provided such corporation shall be otherwise eligible under this
 
Section, without the execution or filing of any paper or further act on the part of the Trustee or the Authenticating Agent.
     An Authenticating Agent for any series of Securities may at any time resign by giving written notice of resignation to the Trustee for such series and to the Operating Partnership. The Trustee for any series of Securities may at any time terminate the agency of an Authenticating Agent by giving written notice of termination to such Authenticating Agent and to the Operating Partnership. Upon receiving such a notice of resignation or upon such a termination, or in case at any time such Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, the Trustee for such series may appoint a successor Authenticating Agent which shall be acceptable to the Operating Partnership and shall give notice of such appointment to all Holders of Securities of the series with respect to which such Authenticating Agent will serve in the manner set forth in Section 106. Any successor Authenticating Agent upon acceptance of its appointment hereunder shall become vested with all the rights, powers and duties of its predecessor hereunder, with like effect as if originally named as an Authenticating Agent herein. No successor Authenticating Agent shall be appointed unless eligible under the provisions of this Section.
     The Operating Partnership agrees to pay to each Authenticating Agent from time to time reasonable compensation including reimbursement of its reasonable expenses for its services under this Section.
     If an appointment with respect to one or more series is made pursuant to this Section, the Securities of such series may have endorsed thereon, in addition to or in lieu of the Trustee's certificate of authentication, an alternate certificate of authentication substantially in the following form:
     This is one of the Securities of the series designated therein referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.
 
     SECTION 701. DISCLOSURE OF NAMES AND ADDRESSES OF HOLDERS. Every Holder, by receiving and holding the Securities, agrees with the Operating Partnership and the Trustee that neither the Operating Partnership nor the Trustee nor any Authenticating Agent nor any Paying Agent nor any Security Registrar shall be held accountable by reason of the disclosure of any information as to the names and addresses of the Holders in accordance with TIA Section 312, regardless of the source from which such information was derived, and that the Trustee shall not be held accountable by reason of mailing any material pursuant to a request made under TIA Section 312(b).
     SECTION 702. REPORTS BY TRUSTEE. Within 60 days after May 15 of each year commencing with the first May 15 after the first issuance of Securities pursuant to this Indenture, the Trustee shall transmit by mail to all Holders as provided in TIA Section 313(c) a brief report dated as of such May 15 if required by TIA Section 313(a).
     SECTION 703. OPERATING PARTNERSHIP TO FURNISH TRUSTEE NAMES AND ADDRESSES OF HOLDERS. The Operating Partnership will furnish or cause to be furnished to the Trustee:
     (a) semi-annually, not later than 15 days after the Regular Record Date for interest for any series of Securities, a list in such form as the Trustee may reasonably require, of the names and addresses of the Holders of such series as of such Regular Record Date, and
     (b) at such other times as the Trustee may request in writing, within 30 days after the receipt by the Operating Partnership of any such request, a list of similar form and content as of a date not more than 15 days prior to the time such list is furnished.
provided, however, that, so long as the Trustee is the Security Registrar, no such list shall be required to be furnished.
 
     SECTION 801. CONSOLIDATIONS AND MERGERS OF OPERATING PARTNERSHIP AND SALES, LEASES AND CONVEYANCES PERMITTED SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONDITIONS. The Operating Partnership will not, in any transaction or series of related transactions, consolidate with, or sell, lease, assign, transfer or otherwise convey all or substantially all of its assets to, or merge with or into, any other Person unless (i) either the Operating Partnership shall be the continuing Person, or the successor Person (if other than the Operating Partnership) formed by or resulting from any such consolidation or merger or which shall have received the transfer of such assets shall be a corporation, partnership, limited liability company or other entity organized and existing under the laws of the United States of America or a State thereof or the District of Columbia and shall expressly assume, by supplemental indenture executed by such successor Person and delivered by it to the Trustee (which supplemental indenture shall comply with Article Nine hereof and shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee), the due and punctual payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest payable in respect of, all of the Outstanding Securities, according to their tenor, and the due and punctual performance and observance of all of the other covenants and conditions contained in this Indenture and the Securities to be performed or observed by the Operating Partnership; (ii) immediately after giving effect to such transaction and treating any Debt (including Acquired Debt) which becomes an obligation of the Operating Partnership or any of its Affiliates as a result thereof as having been incurred by the Operating Partnership or such Affiliate at the time of such transaction, no Event of Default, and no event which, after notice or the lapse of time, or both, would become an Event of Default, shall have occurred and shall be continuing; and (iii) the Operating Partnership shall have delivered to the Trustee the Officers' Certificate and Opinion of Counsel required pursuant to Section 803 below. In the event that the Operating Partnership is not the continuing Person then, for purposes of clause (ii) of the preceding sentence, the successor Person shall be deemed to be the "Operating Partnership" referred to in such clause (ii).
     SECTION 802. RIGHTS AND DUTIES OF SUCCESSOR PERSON. In case of any such consolidation, sale, lease, assignment, transfer, conveyance or merger and upon any such assumption by the successor, such successor Person shall succeed to and be substituted for and may exercise every right and power of the Operating Partnership, with the same effect as if it had been named as the "Operating Partnership" herein; and the predecessor Person shall be released, except in the case of a lease, from any further obligation under this Indenture and the Securities.
     SECTION 803. OFFICERS' CERTIFICATE AND OPINION OF COUNSEL. Any consolidation, sale, lease, assignment, transfer, conveyance or merger permitted under Section 801 is also subject to the condition precedent that the Trustee receive an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that any such consolidation, sale, lease, assignment, transfer, conveyance or merger, and the assumption by any successor Person, complies with the provisions of this Article and that all conditions precedent herein provided for relating to such transaction have been complied with.
 
     SECTION 901. SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURES WITHOUT CONSENT OF HOLDERS. Without the consent of any Holders, the Operating Partnership, when authorized by or pursuant to a Board Resolution, the applicable Guarantors and the Trustee, at any time and from time to time, may enter into one or more indentures supplemental hereto, in form satisfactory to the Trustee, for any of the following purposes:
     (1) to evidence the succession of another Person to the Operating Partnership or any Guarantor and the assumption by any such successor of the covenants of the Operating Partnership herein and in the Securities or Guarantees; or
     (2) to add to the covenants of the Operating Partnership or any Guarantor for the benefit of the Holders of all or any series of Securities (and if such covenants are to be for the benefit of less than all series of Securities, stating that such covenants are expressly being included solely for the benefit of such series) or to surrender any right or power herein conferred upon the Operating Partnership or any Guarantor; or
     (3) to add any additional Events of Default for the benefit of the Holders of all or any series of Securities (and if such Events of Default are to be for the benefit of less than all series of Securities, stating that such Events of Default are expressly being included solely for the benefit of such series); provided, however, that in respect of any such additional Events of Default such supplemental indenture may provide for a particular period of grace after default (which period may be shorter or longer than that allowed in the case of other defaults) or may provide for an immediate enforcement upon such default or may limit the remedies available to the Trustee upon such default or may limit the right of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of that or those series of Securities to which such additional Events of Default apply to waive such default; or
     (4) to add or change any provisions of this Indenture to facilitate the issuance of the Securities in certificate form, provided that such amendment shall not adversely affect the interest of the Holders of any Securities in any material respect; or
     (5) to secure the Securities or Guarantees; or
     (6) to evidence and provide for the acceptance of appointment hereunder by a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of one or more series and to add to or change any of the provisions of this Indenture as shall be necessary to provide for or facilitate the administration of the trusts hereunder by more than one Trustee; or
     (7) to cure any ambiguity, to correct or supplement any provision herein which may be defective or inconsistent with any other provision herein or to make any other provisions with respect to matters or questions arising under this Indenture which shall not be inconsistent with the provisions of this Indenture, provided such action shall not adversely affect the interests of the Holders of Securities of any series or any related Guarantees in any material respect; or
 
     (8) to supplement any of the provisions of this Indenture to such extent as shall be necessary to permit or facilitate the discharge, defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the case may be, of any series of Securities pursuant to Sections 401, 1202 and 1203; provided that any such action shall not adversely affect the interests of the Holders of Securities of such series and any related Guarantees or any other series of Securities in any material respect.
     SECTION 902. SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURES WITH CONSENT OF HOLDERS. With the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of all Outstanding Securities of any series affected by such supplemental indenture, by Act of said Holders delivered to the Operating Partnership, the Guarantors and the Trustee, the Operating Partnership, when authorized by or pursuant to a Board Resolution, and the Trustee may enter into an indenture or indentures supplemental hereto for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of this Indenture or of the Securities of such series or of modifying in any manner the rights of the Holders of Securities of such series and any related Guarantees under this Indenture; provided, however, that no such supplemental indenture shall, without the consent of the Holder of any Outstanding Security affected thereby:
     (1) change the Stated Maturity of the principal of (or premium, if any, on) or any installment of principal of, or premium, if any, or the Interest Payment Date with respect to, any Security; or reduce the principal amount thereof or the rate or amount of interest thereon, or any premium payable thereon, or adversely affect any right of the Holder to repayment of such Security at such Holder's option, or change any Place of Payment where, or the coin or currency in which, the principal of any Security or any premium or interest thereon is payable, or impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after the Stated Maturity, or Interest Payment Date, as applicable, thereof (or, in the case of redemption, on or after the Redemption Date) or that would be provable in bankruptcy, or
     (2) reduce the percentage in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series, the consent of whose Holders is required for any such supplemental indenture or the consent of whose Holders is required for any waiver with respect to such series (or compliance with certain provisions of this Indenture or certain defaults hereunder and their consequences) provided for in this Indenture, or reduce the requirements of Section 1304 for quorum or voting, or
     (3) modify any of the provisions of this Section, Section 513 or Section 1013, except to increase the percentage required to effect such action or to provide that certain other provisions of this Indenture cannot be modified or waived without the consent of the Holder of any Outstanding Security affected thereby, or
     (4) impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on or with respect to any such Security.
     It shall not be necessary for any Act of Holders under this Section to approve the particular form of any proposed supplemental indenture, but it shall be sufficient if such Act
 
shall approve the substance thereof. A supplemental indenture which changes or eliminates any covenant or other provision of this Indenture which has expressly been included solely for the benefit of one or more particular series of Securities, or which modifies the rights of the Holders of Securities of such series with respect to such covenant or other provision, shall be deemed not to affect the rights under this Indenture of the Holders of Securities of any other series.
 
SECTION 903. EXECUTION OF SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURES. In executing, or accepting the additional trusts created by, any supplemental indenture permitted by this Article or the modification thereby of the trusts created by this Indenture, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive, and shall be fully protected in relying upon, an Opinion of Counsel stating that the execution of such supplemental indenture is authorized or permitted by this Indenture. The Trustee may, but shall not be obligated to, enter into any such supplemental indenture which affects the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under this Indenture or otherwise.
     SECTION 904. EFFECT OF SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURES. Upon the execution of any supplemental indenture under this Article Nine, this Indenture shall be modified in accordance therewith, and such supplemental indenture shall form a part of this Indenture for all purposes; and every Holder theretofore authenticated and delivered hereunder shall be bound thereby.
     SECTION 905. CONFORMITY WITH TRUST INDENTURE ACT. Every supplemental indenture executed pursuant to this Article Nine shall conform to the requirements of the Trust Indenture Act as then in effect.
     SECTION 906. REFERENCE IN SECURITIES TO SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURES. Securities authenticated and delivered after the execution of any supplemental indenture pursuant to this Article Nine may, and shall, if required by the Trustee, bear a notation in form approved by the Trustee as to any matter provided for in such supplemental indenture. If the Operating Partnership shall so determine, new Securities of any series so modified as to conform, in the opinion of the Trustee and the Operating Partnership, to any such supplemental indenture may be prepared and executed by the Operating Partnership and authenticated and delivered by the Trustee in exchange for Outstanding Securities of such series.
     SECTION 1001. PAYMENT OF PRINCIPAL, PREMIUM, IF ANY, AND INTEREST. The Operating Partnership covenants and agrees for the benefit of the Holders of any series of Securities that it will duly and punctually pay the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on the Securities of that series in accordance with the terms of such series of Securities and this Indenture.
 
     SECTION 1002. MAINTENANCE OF OFFICE OR AGENCY. The Operating Partnership shall maintain in each Place of Payment for any series of Securities an office or agency where Securities of that series may be presented or surrendered for payment or conversion, where Securities of that series may be surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange and where notices and demands to or upon the Operating Partnership in respect of the Securities of that series and this Indenture may be served. The Operating Partnership will give prompt written notice to the Trustee of the location, and any change in the location, of each such office or agency. If at any time the Operating Partnership shall fail to maintain any such required office or agency or shall fail to furnish the Trustee with the address thereof, such presentations, surrenders, notices and demands shall be made or served at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee (and the Operating Partnership hereby appoints the Trustee its agent to receive all such presentations, surrenders, notices and demands), and the Operating Partnership hereby appoints the same as its agent to receive such presentations, surrenders, notices and demands.
     The Operating Partnership may from time to time designate one or more other offices or agencies where the Securities of one or more series may be presented or surrendered for any or all of such purposes, and may from time to time rescind such designations; provided, however, that no such designation or rescission shall in any manner relieve the Operating Partnership of its obligation to maintain an office or agency in accordance with the requirements set forth above for Securities of any series for such purposes. The Operating Partnership will give prompt written notice to the Trustee of any such designation or rescission and of any change in the location of any such other office or agency. Unless otherwise specified pursuant to Section 301 with respect to a series of Securities, the Operating Partnership hereby designates as the Place of Payment for any series of Securities the office or agency of the Operating Partnership in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, and initially appoints the Trustee, at the office of its affiliate, State Street Bank and Trust Company, which on the date of this Indenture are located at 61 Broadway, 15 Floor, New York, New York 10006 in such city and as its agent to receive all such presentations, surrenders, notices and demands and appoints the Trustee, at its Corporate Trust Office and at the office of its affiliate, State Street Bank and Trust Company, in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, as Paying Agent and Security Registrar. The Operating Partnership may subsequently appoint a different office or agency in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York and a different Paying Agent and Security Registrar for the Securities of any Series.
th
     SECTION 1003. MONEY FOR SECURITIES PAYMENTS TO BE HELD IN TRUST. If the Operating Partnership shall at any time act as its own Paying Agent with respect to any series of any Securities, it will, on or before each due date of the principal of (or premium, if any) or interest on the Securities of that series, segregate and hold in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled thereto the sum in which the Securities of such series are payable (except as otherwise specified pursuant to Section 301 for the Securities of such series) sufficient to pay the principal (and premium, if any) and interest so becoming due until such sums shall be paid to such Persons or otherwise disposed of as herein provided, and will promptly notify the Trustee of its action or failure so to act.
     Whenever the Operating Partnership shall have one or more Paying Agents for any series of Securities, it will, on or before each due date of the principal of (or premium, if any) or interest on any Securities of that series, deposit with a Paying Agent a sum sufficient to pay the
 
principal (and premium, if any) and interest so becoming due, such sum to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such principal, premium and interest and (unless such Paying Agent is the Trustee) the Operating Partnership will promptly notify the Trustee of its action or failure so to act.
     The Operating Partnership will cause each Paying Agent other than the Trustee to execute and deliver to the Trustee an instrument in which such Paying Agent shall agree with the Trustee, subject to the provisions of this Section, that such Paying Agent will:
     (1) hold all sums held by it for the payment of principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on the Securities in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled thereto until such sums shall be paid to such Persons or otherwise disposed of as herein provided;
     (2) give the Trustee notice of any default by the Operating Partnership (or any other obligor upon the Securities) in the making of any such payment of principal (or premium, if any) or interest; and
     (3) at any time during the continuance of any such default upon the written request of the Trustee, forthwith pay to the Trustee all sums so held in trust by such Paying Agent.
     The Operating Partnership may at any time, for the purpose of obtaining the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture or for any other purpose, pay, or by Operating Partnership Order direct any Paying Agent to pay, to the Trustee all sums held in trust by the Operating Partnership or such Paying Agent, such sums to be held by the Trustee upon the same trusts as those upon which such sums were held by the Operating Partnership or such Paying Agent; and, upon such payment by any Paying Agent to the Trustee, such Paying Agent shall be released from all further liability with respect to such sums.
     Any money deposited with the Trustee or any Paying Agent, or held by the Operating Partnership, in trust for the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any) or interest on any Security of any series and remaining unclaimed for two years after such principal or premium, if any), or interest has become due and payable shall, if such money was then on deposit with the Trustee or any Paying Agent, be paid to the Operating Partnership upon Operating Partnership Request or (if then held by the Operating Partnership) shall be discharged from such trust, and the Holder of such Security shall thereafter, as an unsecured general creditor, look only to the Operating Partnership and the Guarantors for payment of such principal of (or premium, if any) or interest on, such Security and all liability of the Trustee or such Paying Agent with respect to such trust money, and all liability of the Operating Partnership as trustee thereof, shall thereupon cease; provided, however, that the Trustee or such Paying Agent, before being required to make any such repayment, may at the expense of the Operating Partnership cause to be published once, in an Authorized Newspaper, notice that such money remains unclaimed and that, after a date specified therein, which shall not be less than 30 days from the date of such publication, any unclaimed balance of such money then remaining will be repaid to the Operating Partnership.
 
     SECTION 1004. AGGREGATE DEBT TEST. The Operating Partnership will not, and will not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, incur any Debt (including, without limitation, Acquired Debt) if, immediately after giving effect to the incurrence of such Debt and the application of the proceeds therefrom on a pro forma basis, the aggregate principal amount of all outstanding Debt of the Operating Partnership and its Subsidiaries (determined on a consolidated basis in accordance with GAAP) is greater than 60% of the sum of (without duplication) (i) the Total Assets of the Operating Partnership and its Subsidiaries as of the last day of the then most recently ended fiscal quarter and (ii) the aggregate purchase price of any real estate assets or mortgages receivable acquired, and the aggregate amount of any securities offering proceeds received (to the extent such proceeds were not used to acquire real estate assets or mortgages receivable or used to reduce Debt), by the Operating Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries since the end of such fiscal quarter, including the proceeds obtained from the incurrence of such additional Debt, determined on a consolidated basis in accordance with GAAP. For purposes of the foregoing Debt shall be deemed to be "incurred" by the Operating Partnership or a Subsidiary whenever the Operating Partnership and its Subsidiary shall create, assume, guarantee or otherwise become liable in respect thereof.
     SECTION 1005. DEBT SERVICE TEST. The Operating Partnership will not, and will not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, incur any Debt (including, without limitation, Acquired Debt) if the ratio of Consolidated Income Available for Debt Service to the Annual Debt Service Charge for the period consisting of the four consecutive fiscal quarters most recently ended prior to the date on which such additional Debt is to be incurred shall have been less than 1.5:1 on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the incurrence of such Debt and the application of the proceeds therefrom, and calculated on the assumption that (i) such Debt and any other Debt (including without limitation, Acquired Debt) incurred by the Operating Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries since the first day of such four-quarter period had been incurred, and the application of the proceeds therefrom (including to repay or retire other Debt) had occurred, on the first day of such period, (ii) the repayment or retirement of any other Debt of the Operating Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries since the first day of such four-quarter period had occurred on the first day of such period (except that, in making such computation, the amount of Debt under any revolving credit facility, line of credit or similar facility shall be computed based upon the average daily balance of such Debt during such period), and (iii) in the case of any acquisition or disposition by the Operating Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries of any asset or group of assets, in any such case with a fair market value (determined in good faith by the Board of Directors) in excess of $1 million, since the first day of such four-quarter period, whether by merger, stock purchase or sale or asset purchase or sale or otherwise, such acquisition or disposition had occurred as of the first day of such period with the appropriate adjustments with respect to such acquisition or disposition being included in such pro forma calculation. If the Debt giving rise to the need to make the foregoing calculation or any other Debt incurred after the first day of the relevant four-quarter period bears interest at a floating rate then, for purposes of calculating the Annual Debt Service Charge, the interest rate on such Debt shall be computed on a pro forma basis by applying the average daily rate which would have been in effect during the entire such four-quarter period to the greater of the amount of such Debt outstanding at the end of such period or the average amount of Debt outstanding during such period. For purposes of the foregoing Debt shall be deemed to be "incurred" by the Operating Partnership or a Subsidiary whenever the Operating Partnership and its Subsidiary shall create, assume, guarantee or otherwise become liable in respect thereof.
 
     SECTION 1006. SECURED DEBT TEST. The Operating Partnership will not, and will not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, incur any Debt (including, without limitation, Acquired Debt) secured by any Lien on any property or assets of the Operating Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries, whether owned on the date of this Indenture or thereafter acquired, if, immediately after giving effect to the incurrence of such Debt and the application of the proceeds therefrom on a pro forma basis, the aggregate principal amount (determined on a consolidated basis in accordance with GAAP) of all outstanding Debt of the Operating Partnership and its Subsidiaries which is secured by any Lien on any property or assets of the Operating Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries is greater than 40% of the sum of (without duplication) (i) the Total Assets of the Operating Partnership and its Subsidiaries as of the last day of the then most recently ended fiscal quarter and (ii) the aggregate purchase price of any real estate assets or mortgages receivable acquired, and the aggregate amount of any securities offering proceeds received (to the extent such proceeds were not used to acquire real estate assets or mortgages receivable or used to reduce Debt), by the Operating Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries since the end of such fiscal quarter, including the proceeds obtained from the incurrence of such additional Debt, determined on a consolidated basis in accordance with GAAP. For purposes of the foregoing Debt shall be deemed to be "incurred" by the Operating Partnership or a Subsidiary whenever the Operating Partnership and its Subsidiary shall create, assume, guarantee or otherwise become liable in respect thereof.
     SECTION 1007. MAINTENANCE OF TOTAL UNENCUMBERED ASSETS. The Operating Partnership will not have at any time Total Unencumbered Assets of less than 150% of the aggregate principal amount of all outstanding Unsecured Debt of the Operating Partnership and its Subsidiaries, determined on a consolidated basis in accordance with GAAP.
     SECTION 1008. EXISTENCE. Subject to Article Eight, the Operating Partnership will do or cause to be done all things necessary to preserve and keep in full force and effect its existence, rights (charter and statutory) and franchises; provided, however, that the Operating Partnership will not be required to preserve any right or franchise if the applicable Board of Directors determines that the preservation thereof is no longer desirable in the conduct of its business and that the loss thereof is not disadvantageous in any material respect to the Holders.
     SECTION 1009. MAINTENANCE OF PROPERTIES. The Operating Partnership will cause all of its properties used or useful in the conduct of its business or the business of any Subsidiary to be maintained and kept in good condition, repair and working order and supplied with all necessary equipment and will cause to be made all necessary repairs, renewals, replacements, betterments and improvements thereof, all as in the judgment of the Operating Partnership may be necessary so that the business carried on in connection therewith may be properly and advantageously conducted at all times.
     SECTION 1010. INSURANCE. The Operating Partnership will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to keep in force upon all of its properties and operations policies of insurance carried with responsible companies in such amounts and covering all such risks as shall be customary in the industry in accordance with prevailing market conditions and availability.
 
     SECTION 1011. PAYMENT OF TAXES AND OTHER CLAIMS. The Operating Partnership will pay or discharge or cause to be paid or discharged, before the same shall become delinquent, (1) all taxes, assessments and governmental charges levied or imposed upon it or any Subsidiary or upon the income, profits or property of the Operating Partnership or any Subsidiary, and (2) all lawful claims for labor, materials and supplies which, if unpaid, might by law become a lien upon the property of the Operating Partnership or any Subsidiary; provided, however, that the Operating Partnership will not be required to pay or discharge or cause to be paid or discharged any such tax, assessment, charge or claim whose amount, applicability or validity is being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings.
     SECTION 1012. PROVISION OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION. The Operating Partnership will:
     (1) file with the Trustee, within 15 days after the Operating Partnership or the General Partner is required to file the same with the Commission, copies of the annual reports and of the information, documents and other reports (or copies of such portions of any of the foregoing as the Commission may from time to time by rules and regulations prescribe) which the Operating Partnership or the General Partner may be required to file with the Commission pursuant to Section 13 or Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; or, if the Operating Partnership or the General Partner is not required to file information, documents or reports pursuant to any of such Sections, then it will file with the Trustee and the Commission, in accordance with rules and regulations prescribed from time to time by the Commission, such of the supplementary and periodic information, documents and reports which may be required pursuant to Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in respect of a security listed and registered on a national securities exchange as may be prescribed from time to time in such rules and regulations;
     (2) file with the Trustee and the Commission, in accordance with rules and regulations prescribed from time to time by the Commission, such additional information, documents and reports with respect to compliance by the Operating Partnership and the General Partner with the conditions and covenants of this Indenture as may be required from time to time by such rules and regulations; and
     (3) transmit by mail to the Holders, within 30 days after the filing thereof with the Trustee, in the manner and to the extent provided in TIA Section 313(c), such summaries of any information, documents and reports required to be filed by the Operating Partnership and the Guarantor pursuant to paragraphs (1) and (2) of this Section as may be required by rules and regulations prescribed from time to time by the Commission.
 
     SECTION 1013. SUBSIDIARY GUARANTEES. (a) The Operating Partnership will not permit any of its Subsidiaries to guarantee or secure through the granting of Liens, the payment of any Debt of the Company or any Guarantor and (b) the Operating Partnership will not and will not permit any of its Subsidiaries to pledge any intercompany notes representing obligations of any of its Subsidiaries, to secure the payment of any debt of the Operating Partnership or any Guarantor, in each case unless such Subsidiary (a "Subsidiary Guarantor"), the Operating Partnership and the Trustee execute and deliver a supplemental indenture evidencing such Subsidiary's Guarantee (providing for the unconditional Guarantee by such Subsidiary, on a senior basis, of the Securities). If any Subsidiary Guarantor is released from all of its obligations described in clause (a) or (b) of the preceding sentence, such Subsidiary Guarantor shall also be released from its unconditional Guarantee of the Securities pursuant to such supplemental indenture and Article XIV hereof.
     SECTION 1014. WAIVER OF CERTAIN COVENANTS. The Operating Partnership may omit in any particular instance to comply with any term, provision or condition set forth in Sections 1004 to 1012, inclusive if before or after the time for such compliance the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of all Outstanding Securities of such series, by Act of such Holders, either waive such compliance in such instance or generally waive compliance with such covenant or condition, but no such waiver shall extend to or affect such covenant or condition except to the extent so expressly waived, and, until such waiver shall become effective, the obligations of the Operating Partnership and the duties of the Trustee in respect of any such term, provision or condition shall remain in full force and effect.
     SECTION 1015. STATEMENT AS TO COMPLIANCE. The Operating Partnership will deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, a brief certificate from its General Partner's principal executive officer, principal financial officer or principal accounting officer as to his or her knowledge of the Operating Partnership's compliance with all conditions and covenants under this Indenture and, in the event of any noncompliance specifying such noncompliance and the nature and status thereof, provided that if the Operating Partnership has been succeeded to by a corporate successor pursuant to the provisions hereof such certificate will be from such successor's principal executive officer, principal financial officer or principal accounting officer. For purposes of this Section 1015, such compliance shall be determined without regard to any period of grace or requirement of notice under this Indenture.
     SECTION 1101. APPLICABILITY OF ARTICLE. Securities of any series which are redeemable before their Stated Maturity shall be, unless set forth otherwise in the supplemental indenture applicable to such series, redeemable, in whole or in part, before their Stated Maturity at the option of the Operating Partnership on any date (a "Redemption Date") at the Redemption Price.
 
     SECTION 1102. ELECTION TO REDEEM; NOTICE TO TRUSTEE. The election of the Operating Partnership to redeem any Securities shall be evidenced by or pursuant to a Board Resolution. In case of any redemption at the election of the Operating Partnership of less than all of the Securities of any series, the Operating Partnership shall, at least 45 days prior to the giving of the notice of redemption referred to in Section 1104 (unless a shorter notice shall be satisfactory to the Trustee), notify the Trustee of such Redemption Date and of the principal amount of Securities of such series to be redeemed.
     SECTION 1103. SELECTION BY TRUSTEE OF SECURITIES TO BE REDEEMED. If less than all the Securities of any series are to be redeemed, the particular Securities to be redeemed shall be selected not more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date by the Trustee, from the Outstanding Securities of such series not previously called for redemption (excluding any such Outstanding Securities held by the Operating Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries), by such method as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate and which may provide for the selection for redemption of portions (equal to the minimum authorized denomination for Securities of that series or any integral multiple thereof) of the principal amount of Securities of such series of a denomination larger than the minimum authorized denomination for Securities of that series.
     The Trustee shall promptly notify the Operating Partnership and the Security Registrar (if other than itself) in writing of the Securities selected for redemption and, in the case of any Securities selected for partial redemption, the principal amount thereof to be redeemed.
     For all purposes of this Indenture, unless the context otherwise requires, all provisions relating to the redemption of Securities shall relate, in the case of any Security redeemed or to be redeemed only in part, to the portion of the principal amount of such Security which has been or is to be redeemed.
     SECTION 1104. NOTICE OF REDEMPTION. Notice of redemption shall be given in the manner provided in Section 106 and may be further specified in an indenture supplemental hereto, not less than 30 days nor more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date to each Holder to be redeemed, but failure to give such notice in the manner herein provided to the Holder of any Security designated for redemption as a whole or in part, or any defect in the notice to any such Holder, shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other such Security or portion thereof.
     Any notice that is mailed to the Holders in the manner herein provided shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the Holder receives the notice.
     All notices of redemption shall state:
     (1) the Redemption Date,
     (2) the Redemption Price and the amount of accrued interest to the Redemption Date payable as provided in Section 1106, if any,
 
     (3) if less than all Outstanding Securities of any series are to be redeemed, the identification (and, in the case of partial redemption, the principal amount) of the particular Security or Securities to be redeemed,
     (4) in case any Security is to be redeemed in part only, the notice shall state that on and after the Redemption Date, upon surrender of such Security, the Holder will receive, without a charge, a new Security or Securities of such series of authorized denominations for the principal amount thereof remaining unredeemed,
     (5) that on the Redemption Date the Redemption Price and accrued interest to the Redemption Date payable as provided in Section 1106, will become due and payable upon each such Security, or the portion thereof, to be redeemed and, if applicable, that interest thereon shall cease to accrue on and after said date,
     (6) the Place or Places of Payment where such Securities, maturing after the Redemption Date, are to be surrendered for payment of the Redemption Price and accrued interest, and
     (7) the CUSIP number and series of such Security.
     SECTION 1105. DEPOSIT OF REDEMPTION PRICE. At or prior to 12:00 noon (New York Time) on any Redemption Date, the Operating Partnership shall deposit with the Trustee or with a Paying Agent (or, if the Operating Partnership is acting as its own Paying Agent, segregate and hold in trust as provided in Section 1003) an amount of money sufficient to pay on the Redemption Date the Redemption Price of, and (except if the Redemption Date shall be an Interest Payment Date) accrued interest on all the Securities or portions thereof which are to be redeemed on that date.
     SECTION 1106. SECURITIES PAYABLE ON REDEMPTION DATE. Notice of redemption having been given as aforesaid, the Securities so to be redeemed shall, on the Redemption Date, become due and payable at the Redemption Price therein specified (together with accrued interest to the Redemption Date), and from and after such date (unless the Operating Partnership shall default in the payment of the Redemption Price or accrued interest) such Securities shall cease to bear interest. Upon surrender of any such Security for redemption in accordance with said notice such Security shall be paid by the Operating Partnership at the Redemption Price, together with accrued interest to the Redemption Date.

     If any Security called for redemption shall not be so paid upon surrender thereof for redemption, the principal (and premium, if any) shall, until paid, bear interest from the Redemption Date at the rate borne by or provided in the Security.
 
     SECTION 1107. SECURITIES REDEEMED IN PART. Any Security which is to be redeemed only in part (pursuant to the provisions of this Article) shall be surrendered at a Place of Payment therefor (with, if the Operating Partnership or the Trustee so requires, due endorsement by, or a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Operating Partnership and the Trustee duly executed by, the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing) and the Operating Partnership shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder of such Security without service charge a new Security or Securities of the same series, of any authorized denomination as requested by such Holder in aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for the unredeemed portion of the principal of the Security so surrendered.
     SECTION 1201. OPERATING PARTNERSHIP'S OPTION TO EFFECT DEFEASANCE OR COVENANT DEFEASANCE. The Operating Partnership may at its option by Board Resolution, at any time, with respect to any series of Securities elect to have Section 1202 or Section 1203 be applied to such Outstanding Securities upon compliance with the conditions set forth below in this Article. The Operating Partnership's right, if any, to elect defeasance pursuant to Section 1202 or covenant defeasance pursuant to Section 1203 may only be exercised with respect to all of the Outstanding Securities of any series.
     SECTION 1202. DEFEASANCE AND DISCHARGE. Upon the Operating Partnership's exercise of the above option applicable to this Section 1202 with respect to any Securities of or within a series, the Operating Partnership shall be deemed to have been discharged from its obligations with respect to such Outstanding Securities on the date the conditions set forth in Section 1204 are satisfied (hereinafter "defeasance"). For this purpose, such defeasance means that the Operating Partnership shall be deemed to have paid and discharged the entire indebtedness represented by such Outstanding Securities, which shall thereafter be deemed to be "Outstanding" only for the purposes of Section 1205 and the other Sections of this Indenture referred to in clauses (A) through (D) below, and to have satisfied all of its other obligations under such Securities and this Indenture insofar as such Securities are concerned (and the Trustee, at the expense of the Operating Partnership, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging the same), except for the following which shall survive until otherwise terminated or discharged hereunder: (A) the rights of Holders of such outstanding Securities to receive, solely from the trust fund described in Section 1204 and as more fully set forth in such Section, payments in respect of the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on such Securities when such payments are due, (B) the Operating Partnership's obligations with respect to such Securities under Sections 304, 305, 306, 1002 and 1003, (C) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee hereunder (including, without limitation, those in Section 606 hereof) and (D) this Article Twelve. Subject to compliance with this Article Twelve the Operating Partnership may exercise its option under this Section 1202 notwithstanding the prior exercise of its option under Section 1203 with respect to such Securities.
 
     SECTION 1203. COVENANT DEFEASANCE. Upon the Operating Partnership's exercise of the above option applicable to this Section 1203 with respect to any Securities of or within a series, the Operating Partnership shall be released from its obligations under Sections 1004 to 1012, inclusive, (except that the Operating Partnership shall remain subject to the covenant set forth in Section 1008 to preserve and keep in full force and effect its corporate existence, except as permitted under Article Eight) and its obligations under any other covenant, with respect to such Outstanding Securities appertaining thereto on and after the date the conditions set forth in Section 1204 are satisfied (hereinafter, "covenant defeasance"), and such Securities shall thereafter be deemed to be not "Outstanding" for the purposes of any direction, waiver, consent or declaration or Act of Holders (and the consequences of any thereof) in connection with Sections 1004 to 1012, inclusive, or such other covenant, but shall continue to be deemed "Outstanding" for all other purposes hereunder. For this purpose, such covenant defeasance means that with respect to such Outstanding Securities the Operating Partnership may omit to comply with and shall have no liability in respect of any term, condition or limitation set forth in any such Section or such other covenant, whether directly or indirectly, by reason of any reference elsewhere herein to any such Section or such other covenant or by reason of reference in any such Section or such other covenant to any other provision herein or in any other document, and such omission to comply shall not constitute a default or an Event of Default under Section 501(3) or otherwise, as the case may be, provided, however, that except as specified above, the remainder of this Indenture and such Securities shall be unaffected thereby.
     SECTION 1204. CONDITIONS TO DEFEASANCE OR COVENANT DEFEASANCE. The following shall be the conditions to application of Section 1202 or Section 1203 to any Outstanding Securities of or within a series:
     (a) The Operating Partnership shall irrevocably have deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee (or another trustee satisfying the requirements of Section 607 who shall agree to comply with the provisions of this Article Twelve applicable to it) funds in trust for the purpose of making the following payments, specifically pledged as security for, and dedicated solely to, the benefit of the Holders of such Securities, (1) an amount as is then specified as payable at Stated Maturity and on Interest Payment Dates, as applicable, or, if such defeasance or covenant defeasance is to be effected in compliance with subsection (f) below, on the relevant Redemption Date, as the case may be, (2) Government Obligations applicable to such Securities which through the scheduled payment of principal and interest in respect thereof in accordance with their terms will provide, not later than one day before the due date of any payment of principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on such Securities, money in an amount as is then specified as payable at Stated Maturity and on Interest Payment Dates, as applicable, or, if such defeasance or covenant defeasance is to be effected in compliance with subsection (f) below on the relevant Redemption Date, as the case may be, or (3) a combination thereof, in any case, in an amount sufficient without consideration of any reinvestment of such principal and interest, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants expressed in a written certification thereof delivered to the Trustee, to pay and discharge, and which shall be applied by the Trustee (or other qualifying trustee) to pay and discharge the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on such Outstanding Securities on the Stated Maturity of such principal or installment of
 
principal, Interest Payment Dates, on the applicable Redemption Date, as the case may be.
     (b) Such defeasance or covenant defeasance shall not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute, a default under, this Indenture or any other material agreement or instrument to which the Operating Partnership is a party or by which it is bound.
     (c) No Event of Default or event which with notice or lapse of time or both would become an Event of Default with respect to such Securities shall have occurred and be continuing on the date of such deposit or, insofar as Sections 501(6) and 501(7) are concerned, at any time during the period ending on the 91 day after the date of such deposit (it being understood that this condition shall not be deemed satisfied until the expiration of such period).
st
     (d) In the case of an election under Section 1202, the Operating Partnership shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel stating that (i) the Operating Partnership has received from, or there has been published by, the Internal Revenue Service a ruling, or (ii) since the date of this Indenture there has been a change in the applicable Federal income tax law, in either case to the effect that, and based thereon such opinion shall confirm that, the Holders of such Outstanding Securities will not recognize income, gain or loss for Federal income tax purposes as a result of such defeasance and will be subject to Federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such defeasance had not occurred.
     (e) In the case of an election under Section 1203, the Operating Partnership shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the Holders of such Outstanding Securities will not recognize income, gain or loss for Federal income tax purposes as a result of such covenant defeasance and will be subject to Federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such covenant defeasance had not occurred.
     (f) If the monies or Government Obligations or combination thereof as the case may be, deposited under subsection (a) above are sufficient to pay the principal of, and premium, if any, and interest on such Securities provided such Securities are redeemed on a particular Redemption Date, the Operating Partnership shall have given the Trustee irrevocable instructions to redeem such Securities on such date and to provide notice of such redemption to Holders as provided in or pursuant to this Indenture.
     (g) The Operating Partnership shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent to the defeasance under Section 1202 or the covenant defeasance under Section 1203 (as the case may be) have been complied with and an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that, as a result of a deposit pursuant to subsection (a) above and the related exercise of the Operating Partnership's option under Section 1202 or Section 1203 (as the case may be), registration is not required under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, by
 
the Operating Partnership, with respect to the trust funds representing such deposit or by the Trustee for such trust funds.
     SECTION 1205. DEPOSITED MONEY AND GOVERNMENT OBLIGATIONS TO BE HELD IN TRUST; OTHER MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS. Subject to the provisions of the last paragraph of Section 1003, all money and Government Obligations (including the proceeds thereof) deposited with the Trustee (or other qualifying trustee, collectively for purposes of this Section 1205, the "Trustee") pursuant to Section 1204 in respect of any Outstanding Securities of any series shall be held in trust and applied by the Trustee, in accordance with the provisions of such Securities and this Indenture, to the payment, either directly or through any Paying Agent (other than the Operating Partnership acting as its own Paying Agent) as the Trustee may determine, to the Holders of such Securities of all sums due and to become due thereon in respect of principal (and premium, if any) and interest, but such money need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law.
     The Operating Partnership shall pay and indemnify the Trustee against any tax, fee or other charge imposed on or assessed against the Government Obligations deposited pursuant to Section 1204 or the principal and interest received in respect thereof other than any such tax, fee or other charge which by law is for the account of the Holders of such Outstanding Securities.
     Anything in this Article to the contrary notwithstanding, subject to Section 606, the Trustee shall deliver or pay to the Operating Partnership from time to time upon Operating Partnership Request any money or Government Obligations (or other property and any proceeds therefrom) held by it as provided in Section 1204 which, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants expressed in a written certification thereof delivered to the Trustee, are in excess of the amount thereof which would then be required to be deposited to effect a defeasance or covenant defeasance, as applicable, in accordance with this Article.
 
     SECTION 1206. REINSTATEMENT. If the Trustee or Paying Agent is unable to apply any cash or Government Obligations deposited pursuant to Section 1204 in accordance with this Indenture or the Securities of the applicable series by reason of any legal proceeding or by reason of any order or judgment of any court or governmental authority enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting such application, then the Operating Partnership's obligations under this Indenture and the Securities of such series shall be revived and reinstated as though no deposit had occurred pursuant to Section 1204 until such time as the Trustee or Paying Agent is permitted to apply such money in accordance with this Indenture and the Securities of such series: provided, however, that if the Operating Partnership makes any payment of principal of, premium, if any, or interest on any Security of such series following the reinstatement of its obligations, the Operating Partnership shall be subrogated to the rights of the Holders of such Securities to receive such payment from the cash and Government Obligations held by the Trustee or Paying Agent.
     SECTION 1301. PURPOSES FOR WHICH MEETINGS MAY BE CALLED. A meeting of Holders of Securities of any series may be called at any time and from time to time pursuant to this Article to make, give or take any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action provided by this Indenture to be made, given or taken by Holders of Securities of such series.

     SECTION 1401. GUARANTEES. The provisions of this Article Fourteen shall be applicable to the Securities and Guarantees. Each Guarantor (which term includes any successor Person under this Indenture and any Subsidiary Guarantor pursuant to Section 1013 of this Indenture) for consideration received hereby jointly and severally unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees on a senior basis (each a "Guarantee", and collectively, the "Guarantees") to the Holders from time to time of the Securities (a) the full and prompt payment of the principal of and any premium, if any, on any Security when and as the same shall become due, whether at the maturity thereof, by acceleration, redemption or otherwise and (b) the full and prompt payment of any interest on any Security when and as the same shall become due and payable. Each and every default in the payment of the principal of or interest or any premium on any Security shall give rise to a separate cause of action hereunder, and separate suits may be brought hereunder as each cause of action arises. The obligations of the Guarantors hereunder shall be evidenced by Guarantees accompanying the Securities issued hereunder.
     An Event of Default under this Indenture or the Securities shall constitute an event of default under the Guarantees, and shall entitle the Holders to accelerate the obligations of the Guarantors hereunder in the same manner and to the same extent as the obligations of the Company.
     Subject to Section 1013 with respect to Subsidiary Guarantors, the obligations of the Guarantors hereunder shall be absolute and unconditional and shall remain in full force and
 
effect until the entire principal and interest and any premium on the Securities shall have been paid or provided for in accordance with provisions of this Indenture, and, unless as otherwise expressly set forth in this Article, such obligations shall not be affected, modified or impaired upon the happening from time to time of any event, including without limitation any of the following, whether or not with notice to, or the consent of, the Guarantors:
               (a) the failure to give notice to the Guarantors of the occurrence of an Event of Default;
               (b) the waiver, surrender, compromise, settlement, release or termination of the payment, performance or observance by the Operating Partnership or the Guarantors of any or all of the obligations, covenants or agreements of either of them contained in this Indenture or the Securities;
               (c) the acceleration, extension or any other changes in the time for payment of any principal of or interest or any premium on any Security or for any other payment under this Indenture or of the time for performance of any other obligations, covenants or agreements under or arising out of this Indenture or the Securities;
               (d) the modification or amendment (whether material or otherwise) of any obligation, covenant or agreement set forth in this Indenture or the Securities;
               (e) the taking or the omission of any of the actions referred to in this Indenture and in any of the actions under the Securities;
               (f) any failure, omission, delay or lack on the part of the Trustee to enforce, assert or exercise any right, power or remedy conferred on the Trustee in this Indenture, or any other action or acts on the part of the Trustee or any of the Holders from time to time of the Securities;
               (g) the voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution, sale or other disposition of all or substantially all the assets, marshaling of assets and liabilities, receivership, insolvency, bankruptcy, assignment for the benefit of creditors, reorganization, arrangement, composition with creditors or readjustment of, or other similar proceedings affecting the Guarantors or the Operating Partnership or any of the assets of any of them, or any allegation or contest of the validity of the Guarantee in any such proceedings;
               (h) to the extent permitted by law, the release or discharge by operation of law of the Guarantors from the performance or observance of any obligation, covenant or agreement contained in this Indenture;
               (i) to the extent permitted by law, the release or discharge by operation of law of the Operating Partnership from the performance or observance of any obligation, covenant or agreement contained in this Indenture;
               (j) the default or failure of the Operating Partnership or the Trustee fully to perform any of its obligations set forth in this Indenture or the Securities;
 
               (k) the invalidity, irregularity or unenforceability of this Indenture or the Securities or any part of any thereof;
               (l) any judicial or governmental action affecting the Operating Partnership or any Securities or consent or indulgence granted by the Operating Partnership by the Holders or by the Trustee; or
               (m) the recovery of any judgment against the Operating Partnership or any action to enforce the same or any other circumstance which might constitute a legal or equitable discharge of a surety or guarantor.
     The Guarantees shall remain in full force and effect and continue to be effective should any petition be filed by or against the Operating Partnership for liquidation or reorganization of the Operating Partnership, should the Operating Partnership become insolvent or make an assignment for the benefit of creditors or should a receiver or trustee be appointed for all or any significant part of the Operating Partnership's assets, and shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time any payment in respect of the Securities is, pursuant to applicable law, rescinded or reduced in amount, or must otherwise be restored or returned by any obligee on the Securities, whether as a "voidable preference," "fraudulent transfer" or otherwise, all as though such payment had not been made. In the event that any payment, or any part thereof, is rescinded, reduced, restored or returned, the Securities shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be reinstated and deemed reduced only by such amount paid and not so rescinded, reduced, restored or returned.
     For purposes of this Article 14, each Subsidiary Guarantor's liability (a Subsidiary Guarantor's "Base Guaranty Liability") shall be that amount from time to time equal to the aggregate liability of a Guarantor hereunder, but shall be limited to the lesser of (A) the aggregate amount of the obligation as stated in the second sentence of this Section 1401 with respect to the Securities, and (B) the amount, if any, which would not have (i) rendered such Subsidiary Guarantor "insolvent" (as such term is defined in Section 101(29) of the Federal Bankruptcy Code and in Section 271 of the Debtor and Creditor Law of the State of New York, as each is in effect at the date of this Indenture) or (ii) left it with unreasonably small capital at the time its Guarantee of the Securities was entered into, after giving effect to the incurrence of existing Debt immediately prior to such time, provided that, it shall be a presumption in any lawsuit or other proceeding in which a Subsidiary Guarantor is a party that the amount guaranteed is the amount set forth in (A) above unless a creditor or representative of creditors of such Subsidiary Guarantor or a trustee in bankruptcy of the Subsidiary Guarantor, as debtor in possession, otherwise proves in such a lawsuit that the aggregate liability of the Subsidiary Guarantor is limited to the amount set forth in (B). In making any determination as to the solvency or sufficiency of capital of a Subsidiary Guarantor in accordance with the previous sentence, the right of such Subsidiary Guarantor to contribution from other Guarantors to subrogation pursuant to the next paragraph and any other rights such Subsidiary Guarantor may have contractual or otherwise, shall be taken into account.
     The Guarantors shall have the right to seek contribution from any non-paying Guarantor so long as the exercise of such right does not impair the rights of the Holders under the Guarantees.
 
     The validity and enforceability of any Guarantee shall not be affected by the fact that it is not affixed to any particular Security.
     Each of the Guarantors hereby agrees that its Guarantee set forth in Section 1401 shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding any failure to endorse on each Security a notation of such Guarantee.
     If an officer of a Guarantor whose signature is on this Indenture or a Security no longer holds that office at the time the Trustee authenticates such Security or at any time thereafter, such Guarantor's Guarantee of such Security shall be valid nevertheless.
     The delivery of any Security by the Trustee, after the authentication thereof hereunder shall constitute due delivery of any Guarantee set forth in this Indenture on behalf of the Guarantor.
     SECTION 1402. PROCEEDINGS AGAINST THE GUARANTORS. In the event of a default in the payment of principal of or any premium on any Security when and as the same shall become due, whether at the Stated Maturity thereof, by acceleration, call for redemption or otherwise, or in the event of a default in the payment of any interest on any Security when and as the same shall become due, the Trustee shall have the right to proceed first and directly against the Guarantors under this Indenture without first proceeding against the Operating Partnership or exhausting any other remedies which it may have and without resorting to any other Security held by the Trustee.
     The Trustee shall have the right, power and authority to do all things it deems necessary or otherwise advisable to enforce the provisions of this Indenture relating to the Guarantees and protect the interests of the Holders of the Securities and, in the event of a default in payment of the principal of or any premium on any Security when and as the same shall become due, whether at the Stated Maturity thereof, by acceleration, call for redemption or otherwise, or in the event of a default in the payment of any interest on any Security when and as the same shall become due, the Trustee may institute or appear in such appropriate judicial proceedings as the Trustee shall deem most effectual to protect and enforce any of its rights and the rights of the Holders, whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement in this Indenture relating to the Guarantee or in aid of the exercise of any power granted herein, or to enforce any other proper remedy.

     SECTION 1403. GUARANTEES FOR BENEFIT OF HOLDERS. The Guarantees contained in this Indenture are entered into by the Guarantors for the benefit of the Holders from time to time of the Securities. Such provisions shall not be deemed to create any right in, or to be in whole or in part for the benefit of, any person other than the Trustee, the Guarantors, the Holders from time to time of the Securities, and their permitted successors and assigns.
     SECTION 1404. MERGER OR CONSOLIDATION OF GUARANTORS. Each Guarantor will not, in any transaction or series of related transactions, consolidate with, or sell, lease, assign, transfer or otherwise convey all or substantially all of its assets to, or merge with or into, any other Person unless (i) either such Guarantor shall be the continuing Person, or the successor Person (if other than such Guarantor) formed by or resulting from any such consolidation or merger or which shall have received the transfer of such assets is a corporation, partnership, limited liability company or other entity organized and existing under the laws of the United States of America or a State thereof or the District of Columbia and shall expressly assume, by supplemental indenture executed by such successor corporation and delivered by it to the Trustee (which supplemental indenture shall comply with Article Nine hereof and shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee), all of such Guarantor's obligations with respect to Outstanding Securities and the observance of all of the covenants and conditions contained in this Indenture and its Guarantee to be performed or observed by the Guarantor; (ii) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, no Event of Default, and no event which, after notice or the lapse of time, or both, would become an Event of Default, shall have occurred and shall be continuing; and (iii) such Guarantor shall have delivered to the Trustee the Officers' Certificate and Opinion of Counsel required pursuant to below. In the event that such Guarantor is not the continuing corporation, then, for purposes of clause (ii) of the preceding sentence, the successor corporation shall be deemed to be such "Guarantor" referred to in such clause (ii). Any consolidation, merger, sale, lease, assignment, transfer or conveyance permitted under Section 1404 is also subject to the condition precedent that the Trustee receive an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that any such consolidation, merger, sale, lease, assignment, transfer or conveyance, and the assumption by any successor corporation, complies with the provisions of this Article and that all conditions precedent herein provided for relating to such transaction have been complied with.
     SECTION 1405. ADDITIONAL GUARANTORS. Any Person may become a Guarantor by executing and delivering to the Trustee (a) a supplemental indenture in form and substance satisfactory to the Trustee, which subjects such person to the provisions of this Indenture as a Guarantor, and (b) an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such supplemental indenture has been duly authorized and executed by such person and constitutes the legal, valid, binding and enforceable obligation of such person (subject to such customary exceptions concerning fraudulent conveyance laws, creditors' rights and equitable principles as may be acceptable to the Trustee in its discretion).
     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Indenture to be duly executed, all as of the day and year first above written.

Unless the Holder of this Note is notified otherwise, the place where notices or demands to or upon the Operating Partnership in respect of this Note and the Indenture may be served shall be the corporate trust office of the Trustee at 100 Wall Street, Suite 1600, New York, New York 10005.
     To receive payment of a U.S. dollar denominated Note upon redemption (if applicable) or at maturity, a Holder must make presentation and surrender of such Note on or before the Redemption Date or Maturity Date, as applicable. To receive payment of a Note denominated in a Foreign Currency (as defined on the reverse hereof) or composite currency upon redemption or at maturity, a Holder must make presentation and surrender of such Note not less than two Business Days prior to the Redemption Date or Maturity Date, as applicable.

     Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Addendum is attached hereto or "Other/Additional Provisions" apply to this Note as specified on the face hereof, this Note shall be subject to the terms set forth in such Addendum or such "Other/Additional Provisions."
 
     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Operating Partnership has caused this Instrument to be duly executed.
 
     This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of debt securities of the Operating Partnership (hereinafter called the "Securities") of the series hereinafter specified, unlimited in aggregate principal amount, all issued or to be issued under or pursuant to an Indenture dated as of June 30, 1998, as supplemented by the Seventh Supplemental Indenture dated as of August 10, 2006 (herein collectively called the "Indenture"), among the Operating Partnership, AMB Property Corporation, a Maryland corporation and sole general partner of the Operating Partnership (the "Guarantor"), and U. S. Bank National Association, as successor-in-interest to State Street Bank and Trust Company of California, N.A., as trustee (the "Trustee"); to which Indenture reference is hereby made for a specification of the rights and limitation of rights thereunder of the Holders of the Securities, the rights and obligations thereunder of the Operating Partnership and the rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Trustee. The Securities may be issued in one or more series, which different series may be issued in various aggregate principal amounts, may mature at different times, may bear interest (if any) at different rates, may be subject to different redemption or repayment provisions (if any), may be subject to different covenants and defaults and may otherwise vary as provided in the Indenture. This Note is one of a series designated as "Series C Medium-Term Notes" (hereinafter referred to as the "Notes") of the Operating Partnership, of up to $500,000,000 in aggregate principal amount. All terms used in this Note which are defined in the Indenture and which are not otherwise defined in this Note shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture. The terms of the Notes include those stated in the Indenture and those made a part of the Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended. The Notes are subject to all such terms, and the Holders are referred to the Indenture and such Act for a statement of such terms. To the extent any provision of this Note conflicts with the provisions of the Indenture, the provisions of the Indenture shall govern and be controlling.
     Unless stated to the contrary on the face hereof, this Note is issuable only in registered form without coupons in Book-Entry form represented by one or more global notes (each a "Global Note") recorded in the book-entry system maintained by the Depository. If specified on the face hereof, this Note is issuable in certificated form issued to, and registered in the name of, the beneficial owner or its nominee (a "Certificated Note").
     Unless a different minimum Authorized Denomination is set forth on the face hereof, this Note is issuable in minimum denominations of (i) if the Specified Currency of this Note is U.S. dollars, U.S. $1,000 and in any larger amount in integral multiples of $1,000 and (ii) if the Specified Currency of this Note is a currency other than U.S. dollars (a "Foreign Currency") or is a composite currency, the equivalent in such Foreign Currency or composite currency determined in accordance with the Market Exchange Rate (as defined below) for such Foreign Currency or composite currency on the Business Day immediately preceding the date on which the Operating Partnership accepts an offer to purchase a Note, of U.S. $1,000 (rounded to an integral multiple of 1,000 units of the Foreign Currency or composite currency), and in any larger amount in integral multiples of 1,000 units.
     If this is a Global Note representing Book-Entry Notes, this Note may be transferred or exchanged only through DTC. In the manner and subject to the limitations provided in the Indenture, if this is a Certificated Note, it may be transferred or exchanged, without charge except for any tax or other governmental charge imposed in relation thereto, for other Notes of authorized denominations for a like aggregate principal amount, at the office or agency of the Operating Partnership in the Borough of Manhattan of The City of New York, or, at the option of the Holder, such office or agency, if any, maintained by the Operating Partnership in the city in which the principal executive offices of the Operating Partnership are located or the city in which the principal corporate trust office of the Trustee is located.
     The principal (and premium, if any) and interest on, this Note is payable by the Operating Partnership in the Specified Currency.
     If this Note is denominated in a Foreign Currency, in the event that the Foreign Currency is not available for payment at a time at which any payment is required hereunder due to the imposition of exchange controls or other circumstances beyond the control of the Operating Partnership or is no longer used by the government of the
 
country issuing such currency or for the settlement of transactions by public institutions within the international banking community, the Operating Partnership may, in full satisfaction of its obligation to make such payment, make instead a payment in an equivalent amount of U.S. dollars, determined by the Exchange Rate Agent, as specified on the face hereof, on the basis of the Market Exchange Rate for such Foreign Currency on the second Business Day prior to such payment date or, if such Market Exchange Rate is not then available, on the basis of the most recently available Market Exchange Rate; provided, however, that if such Specified Currency is replaced by a single European currency, the payment of principal of (and premium, if any) or interest, if any, on this Note denominated in such currency shall be effected in the new single European currency in conformity with legally applicable measures taken pursuant to, or by virtue of, the treaty establishing the European Community, as amended by the treaty on European Unity. The "Market Exchange Rate" for the Specified Currency means the noon dollar buying rate in The City of New York for cable transfers for the Specified Currency as certified for customs purposes by (or if not so certified, as otherwise determined by) the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Any payment made under such circumstances in U.S. dollars or a new single European currency where the required payment is in a Specified Currency other than U.S. dollars or such single European currency, respectively, will not constitute an Event of Default (as defined in the Indenture).
     If the Specified Currency is a composite currency and if such composite currency is unavailable due to the imposition of exchange controls or other circumstances beyond the control of the Operating Partnership, then the Operating Partnership will be entitled to satisfy its obligations to the Holder of this Note by making such payment in U.S. dollars. The amount of each payment in U.S. dollars shall be computed by the Exchange Rate Agent on the basis of the equivalent of the composite currency in U.S. dollars. The component currencies of the composite currency for this purpose (collectively, the "Component Currencies" and each, a "Component Currency") shall be the currency amounts that were components of the composite currency as of the last day on which the composite currency was used. The equivalent of the composite currency in U.S. dollars shall be calculated by aggregating the U.S. dollar equivalents of the Component Currencies. The U.S. dollar equivalent of each of the Component Currencies shall be determined by the Exchange Rate Agent on the basis of the most recently available Market Exchange Rate for each such Component Currency, or as otherwise specified on the face hereof.
     If the official unit of any Component Currency is altered by way of combination or subdivision, the number of units of the currency as a Component Currency shall be divided or multiplied in the same proportion. If two or more Component Currencies are consolidated into a single currency, the amounts of those currencies as Component Currencies shall be replaced by an amount in such single currency equal to the sum of the amounts of the consolidated Component Currencies expressed in such single currency. If any Component Currency is divided into two or more currencies, the amount of the original Component Currency shall be replaced by the amounts of such two or more currencies, the sum of which shall be equal to the amount of the original Component Currency.
     All determinations referred to above made by the Exchange Rate Agent shall be at its sole discretion and shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive for all purposes and binding on the Holder of this Note.
     If a Redemption Commencement Date is specified on the face hereof, this Note may be redeemed, whether or not any other Note is concurrently redeemed, at the option of the Operating Partnership, in whole, or from time to time in part, on any Business Day on or after such Redemption Commencement Date and prior to the Maturity Date, upon mailing by first-class mail, postage prepaid, a notice of such redemption not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the actual date of redemption ("Redemption Date"), to the Holder of this Note at such Holder's address appearing in the Security Register, as provided in the Indenture (provided that, if the Holder of this Note is a Depository or a nominee of a Depository, notice of such redemption shall be given in accordance with any applicable provisions of such written agreement between the Operating Partnership, the Trustee and such Depository (or its nominee) as may be in effect from time to time), at the Redemption Price (as defined below), together in each case with interest accrued to the Redemption Date (subject to the right of the Holder of record on a Regular Record Date to receive interest due on an Interest Payment Date). The "Redemption Price" shall be equal to (i) the Initial Redemption Percentage specified on the face of this Note, as adjusted downward on each anniversary of the Redemption Commencement Date by the Annual Redemption Price Reduction, if any, specified on the face hereof, multiplied by (ii) the unpaid Principal Amount of this Note to be redeemed. In the event of redemption of this Note in part only, a new Note or Notes of this series, and of like tenor, for the unredeemed portion hereof will be issued in the name of the Holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof.
 
     If an Optional Repayment Date(s) is specified on the face hereof, this Note will be subject to repayment by the Operating Partnership at the option of the Holder hereof on such Optional Repayment Date(s), in whole or in part in increments of U.S. $1,000 or other increments specified on the face hereof (as long as any remaining principal is at least $1,000 or another specified minimum denomination), at the Repayment Price specified on the face hereof, together with unpaid interest accrued hereon to the date of repayment ("Repayment Date"). For this Note to be repaid, this Note must be received, together with the form hereon entitled "Option to Elect Repayment" duly completed, by the Trustee at its corporate trust office at 100 Wall Street, Suite 1600, New York, New York 10005 (or at such other address of which the Operating Partnership shall from time to time designate and notify Holders of the Notes) at least 30 but not more than 60 days prior to the Repayment Date. Exercise of such repayment option by the Holder hereof will be irrevocable. In the event of repayment of this Note in part only, a new Note of like tenor for the unrepaid portion hereof and otherwise having the same terms as this Note shall be issued in the name of the Holder hereof upon the presentation and surrender hereof.
     If this is a Global Note representing Book-Entry Notes, only the Depository may exercise the repayment option in respect of this Note. Accordingly, if this is a Global Security representing Book-Entry Notes and the beneficial owner desires to have all or any portion of the Book-Entry Note represented by this Global Security repaid, the beneficial owner must instruct the participant through which he owns his interest to direct the Depository to exercise the repayment option on his behalf by delivering this Note and duly completed election form to the Trustee as aforesaid.
     If this Note is an Original Issue Discount Note, as specified on the face hereof, the amount payable to the Holder of this Note in the event of redemption, repayment or acceleration of maturity will be equal to the sum of (i) the Issue Price specified on the face hereof (increased by any accruals of the Discount, as defined below) multiplied, in the event of any redemption or repayment of this Note (if applicable), by the Redemption Price or Repayment Price, as the case may be, and (ii) any unpaid interest on this Note accrued from the Original Issue Date to the Redemption Date, Repayment Date or date of acceleration of maturity, as the case may be. The difference between the Issue Price, as specified on the face hereof, and 100% of the principal amount of this Note is referred to herein as the "Discount".
     For purposes of determining the amount of Discount that has accrued as of any Redemption Date, Repayment Date or date of acceleration of maturity of this Note, such Discount will be accrued so as to cause the yield on the Note to be constant. The constant yield will be calculated using a 30-day month, 360-day year convention, a compounding period that, except for the Initial Period (as defined below), corresponds to the shortest period between Interest Payment Dates (with ratable accruals within a compounding period) and an assumption that the maturity of this Note will not be accelerated. If the period from the Original Issue Date to the initial Interest Payment Date (the "Initial Period") is shorter than the compounding period for this Note, a proportionate amount of the yield for an entire compounding period will be accrued. If the Initial Period is longer than the compounding period, then such period will be divided into a regular compounding period and a short period, with the short period being treated as provided in the preceding sentence.
     In case a default, as defined in the Indenture, shall occur and be continuing with respect to the Notes, the principal amount of all Notes then outstanding under the Indenture may be declared or may become due and payable upon the conditions and in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture. The Indenture provides that such declaration may in certain events be annulled by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes outstanding.
     To the extent permitted by, and as provided in, the Indenture, the Operating Partnership may enter into one or more supplements to the Indenture for the purpose of modifying or altering the Indenture, without the consent of any Holders of Notes, for the limited purposes described in the Indenture.
     To the extent permitted by, and as provided in, the Indenture, the Operating Partnership may enter into one or more supplements to the Indenture for the purpose of modifying or altering the rights and obligations of the Operating Partnership and the Holders of the Securities (as defined in the Indenture) with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of all Outstanding Securities (as defined in the Indenture) of any series affected, evidenced as provided in the Indenture.
 
     The Indenture contains provisions for legal defeasance and covenant defeasance with respect to the Notes, in each case, upon compliance with certain conditions set forth therein, which provisions apply to the Notes.
     The Operating Partnership, the Trustee, any Authenticating Agent, any paying agent and any Security registrar may deem and treat the registered Holder hereof as the absolute owner hereof (whether or not this Note shall be overdue and notwithstanding any notice of ownership or other writing hereon by anyone other than the Operating Partnership or any Security registrar) for the purpose of receiving payment of or on account of the principal hereof (and premium, if any), and interest hereon, and for all other purposes, and none of the Operating Partnership, the Trustee, an Authenticating Agent, a paying agent nor the Security registrar shall be affected by any notice to the contrary. All such payments shall be valid and effectual to satisfy and discharge the liability upon this Note to the extent of the sum or sums so paid.
     No recourse under or upon any obligation, covenant or agreement of the Indenture or of this Note, or for any claim based thereon or otherwise in respect thereof, shall be had against any incorporator, partner, stockholder, officer or director, as such, past, present or future, of the Operating Partnership or the Guarantor or of any successor entity, either directly or through the Operating Partnership or the Guarantor, whether by virtue of any constitution, statute or rule of law, or by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty or otherwise; it being expressly understood that the Indenture and this Note are solely corporate obligations, and that no such personal liability whatever shall attach to, or is or shall be incurred by the incorporators, partners, stockholders, officers or directors, as such, of the Operating Partnership or the Guarantor or of any successor entity, or any of them, because of the creation of the indebtedness authorized by the Indenture, or under or by reason of the obligations, covenants or agreements contained in the Indenture or this Note or implied therefrom; and that any and all such personal liability, either at common law or in equity or by constitution or statute, or any and all such rights and claims against, every such incorporator, partner, stockholder, officer or director, as such, because of the creation of the indebtedness authorized by the Indenture, or under or by reason of the obligations, covenants or agreements contained in the Indenture or this Note or implied therefrom, are, by acceptance of this Note, hereby expressly waived and released as a condition of, and as consideration for, the issue of this Note. In the event of any sale or transfer of its assets and liabilities substantially as an entirety to a successor entity, the predecessor entity may be dissolved and liquidated as more fully set forth in the Indenture.
     All U.S. dollar amounts used in or resulting from calculations referred to in this Note shall be rounded to the nearest cent (with one half cent being rounded upwards).
     THIS NOTE SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.
 
     FOR VALUE RECEIVED, the undersigned hereby, jointly and severally with the Subsidiary Guarantors, if any, unconditionally guarantees to the Holder of the accompanying Series C Medium-Term Note (the "Note") issued by AMB Property, L.P. (the "Operating Partnership") under an Indenture dated as of June 30, 1998, as supplemented by the Seventh Supplemental Indenture dated as of August 10, 2006 (herein collectively called the "Indenture"), among the Operating Partnership, AMB Property Corporation, a Maryland corporation and sole general partner of the Operating Partnership (the "Guarantor"), and U.S. Bank National Association, as successor-in-interest to State Street Bank and Trust Company of California, N.A., as trustee (the "Trustee"), (a) the full and prompt payment of the principal of and premium, if any, on such Note when and as the same shall become due and payable, whether at the Maturity Date (as defined in the Note), by acceleration, by redemption, repurchase or otherwise, and (b) the full and prompt payment of the interest on such Note when and as the same shall become due and payable, according to the terms of such Note and of the Indenture. In case of the failure of the Operating Partnership punctually to pay any such principal, premium or interest, the undersigned hereby agrees to cause any such payment to be made punctually when and as the same shall become due and payable, whether at the Maturity Date, upon acceleration, by redemption or repayment or otherwise, and as if such payment were made by the Operating Partnership. The undersigned hereby agrees, jointly and severally with the Subsidiary Guarantors, if any, that its obligations hereunder shall be as principal and not merely as surety, and shall be absolute and unconditional, and shall not be affected, modified or impaired by the following: (a) the failure to give notice to the Guarantors of the occurrence of an Event of Default under the Indenture; (b) the waiver, surrender, compromise, settlement, release or termination of the payment, performance or observance by the Operating Partnership or the Guarantors of any or all of the obligations, covenants or agreements of either of them contained in the Indenture or any Note; (c) the acceleration, extension or any other changes in the time for payment of any principal of or interest or any premium on any Note or for any other payment under the Indenture or of the time for performance of any other obligations, covenants or agreements under or arising out of the Indenture or any Note; (d) the modification or amendment (whether material or otherwise) of any obligation, covenant or agreement set forth in the Indenture or any Note; (e) the taking or the omission of any of the actions referred to in the Indenture and in any of the actions under any Note; (f) any failure, omission, delay or lack on the part of the Trustee to enforce, assert or exercise any right, power or remedy conferred on the Trustee in the Indenture, or any other action or acts on the part of the Trustee or any of the Holders from time to time of any Note; (g) the voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution, sale or other disposition of all or substantially all the assets, marshaling of assets and liabilities, receivership, insolvency, bankruptcy, assignment for the benefit of creditors, reorganization, arrangement, composition with creditors or readjustment of, or other similar proceedings affecting the Guarantors or the Operating Partnership or any of the assets of any of them, or any allegation or contest of the validity of this Parent Guarantee in any such proceeding; (h) to the extent permitted by law, the release or discharge by operation of law of the Guarantors from the performance or observance of any obligation, covenant or agreement contained in the Indenture; (i) to the extent permitted by law, the release or discharge by operation of law of the Operating Partnership from the performance or observance of any obligation, covenant or agreement contained in the Indenture; (j) the default or failure of the Operating Partnership or the Trustee fully to perform any of its obligations set forth in the Indenture or any Note; (k) the invalidity, irregularity or unenforceability of the Indenture or any Note or any part of any thereof; (l) any judicial or governmental action affecting the Operating Partnership or any Note or consent or indulgence granted to the Operating Partnership by the Holders or by the Trustee; or (m) the recovery of any judgment against the Operating Partnership or any action to enforce the same or any other circumstance which might constitute a legal or equitable discharge of a surety or guarantor. The undersigned hereby waives diligence, presentment, demand of payment, filing of claims with a court in the event of merger, sale, lease or conveyance of all or substantially all of its assets, insolvency or bankruptcy of any Guarantor or the Operating Partnership, any right to require a proceeding first against any other Guarantor or the Operating Partnership, protest or notice with respect to such Note or the indebtedness evidenced thereby and all demands whatsoever, and covenants that this Parent Guarantee will not be discharged except by complete performance of the obligations contained in such Note and in this Parent Guarantee.
     No reference herein to such Indenture and no provision of this Parent Guarantee or of such Indenture shall alter or impair the guarantee of the undersigned, which is absolute and unconditional, of the full and prompt payment of the principal of and premium, if any, and interest on the Note.
 
     THIS PARENT GUARANTEE SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.
     This Parent Guarantee shall not be valid or obligatory for any purpose until the certificate of authentication on the Note shall have been executed by the Trustee under the Indenture referred to above by the manual signature of one of its authorized officers. The validity and enforceability of this Parent Guarantee shall not be affected by the fact that it is not affixed to any particular Note.
     An Event of Default under the Indenture or any Note shall constitute an event of default under this Parent Guarantee, and shall entitle the Holder of the Note to accelerate the obligations of the undersigned hereunder in the same manner and to the same extent as the obligations of the Operating Partnership.
     Notwithstanding any other provision of this Parent Guarantee to the contrary, the undersigned hereby waives any claims or other rights which it may now have or hereafter acquire against any other Guarantor or the Operating Partnership that arise from the existence or performance of its obligations under this Parent Guarantee (all such claims and rights are referred to as "Guarantor's Conditional Rights"), including, without limitation, any right of subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration, contribution, or indemnification, any right to participate in any claim or remedy against any Guarantor or the Operating Partnership, whether or not such claim, remedy or right arises in equity or under contract, statute or common law, by any payment made hereunder or otherwise, including without limitation, the right to take or receive from any Guarantor or the Operating Partnership, directly or indirectly, in cash or other property or by setoff or in any other manner, payment or security on account of such claim or other rights. The undersigned hereby agrees not to exercise any rights which may be acquired by way of contribution under this Parent Guarantee or any other agreement, by any payment made hereunder or otherwise, including, without limitation, the right to take or receive from any other guarantor, directly or indirectly, in cash or other property or by setoff or in any other manner, payment or security on account of such contribution rights. If, notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, any amount shall be paid to the undersigned on account of the Guarantor's Conditional Rights and either (i) such amount is paid to such undersigned party at any time when the indebtedness shall not have been paid or performed in full, or (ii) regardless of when such amount is paid to such undersigned party, any payment made by any Guarantor or the Operating Partnership to a Holder that is at any time determined to be a Preferential Payment (as defined below), then such amount paid to the undersigned shall be held in trust for the benefit of such Holder and shall forthwith be paid such Holder to be credited and applied upon the indebtedness, whether matured or unmatured. Any such payment is herein referred to as a "Preferential Payment" to the extent any Guarantor or the Operating Partnership makes any payment to such Holder in connection with the Note, and any or all of such payment is subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required to be repaid or paid over to a trustee, receiver or any other entity, whether under any bankruptcy act or otherwise.
     To the extent that any of the provisions of the immediately preceding paragraph shall not be enforceable, the undersigned agrees that until such time as the indebtedness has been paid and performed in full and the period of time has expired during which any payment made by any Guarantor, the Operating Partnership or the undersigned to a Holder may be determined to be a Preferential Payment, Guarantor's Conditional Rights to the extent not validly waived shall be subordinate to Holders' right to full payment and performance of the indebtedness and the undersigned shall not enforce any of Guarantor's Conditional Rights until such time as the indebtedness has been paid and performed in full and the period of time has expired during which any payment made by any Guarantor, the Operating Partnership or the undersigned to Holders may be determined to be a Preferential Payment.
     The obligations of the undersigned to the Holder of the Note and to the Trustee pursuant to this Parent Guarantee and the Indenture are expressly set forth in Article 14 of the Indenture and reference is hereby made to the Indenture for the precise terms of this Parent Guarantee and all of the other provisions of the Indenture to which this Parent Guarantee relates.
     Capitalized terms used in this Parent Guarantee which are not defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.
 
     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned has caused this Parent Guarantee to be duly executed.

     , a Delaware limited partnership (hereinafter called the "Operating Partnership", which term includes any successor under the Indenture referred to below), for value received, hereby promises to pay to the Registered Holder specified on the face hereof or registered assigns ("Holder"), upon presentation and surrender of this Note, on the Maturity Date specified on the face hereof (except to the extent repaid or redeemed prior to the Maturity Date) the Principal Amount specified on the face hereof in the Specified Currency specified on the face hereof, and to pay interest thereon at the Initial Interest Rate per annum specified on the face hereof until the Initial Interest Reset Date specified on the face hereof and, thereafter, at the rate determined in accordance with the provisions on the reverse hereof, depending on the Interest Rate Basis specified on the face hereof, until the principal hereof is paid or duly made available for payment.
AMB Property, L.P.
     The Operating Partnership will pay interest (other than defaulted interest) on each Interest Payment Date, (as defined below) commencing with the first Interest Payment Date next succeeding the Original Issue Date specified on the face hereof, to the person who is the Holder of this Note on the applicable Regular Record Date (as defined below); provided that if the Original Issue Date occurs between a Regular Record Date and an Interest Payment Date, the Operating Partnership will make the first payment of interest on the Interest Payment Date following the next Regular Record Date to the registered owner on that Regular Record Date. Unless otherwise specified on the face hereof, the "Regular Record Date" with respect to this Note shall be the fifteenth calendar day immediately preceding the related Interest Payment Date or Dates, whether or not such date shall be a Business Day (as defined below).
     The Operating Partnership will pay interest due on the Maturity Date, Redemption Date (as defined on the reverse hereof) or Repayment Date (as defined on the reverse hereof), as applicable, to the same person to whom it is paying the principal amount; provided that if the Operating Partnership would have made a regular interest payment on the Maturity Date, Redemption Date or Repayment Date, as the case may be, it will make that regular interest payment to the Holder as of the applicable Regular Record Date, even if it is not the same person to whom it is paying the principal amount.
     Any such interest not so punctually paid or duly provided for ("Defaulted Interest") will forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on any Regular Record Date, and shall be paid, at the election of the Operating Partnership, to either (i) to the Holder at the close of business on a special record date (the "Special Record Date") for the payment of such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the Trustee (as defined on the reverse hereof), notice whereof shall be given to the Holder of this Note by the Trustee not less than 10 calendar days prior to such Special Record Date or (ii) at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which this Note may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided for in the Indenture.
     Unless specified on the face hereof, payments of interest on this Note with respect to any Interest Payment Date, Maturity Date, Redemption Date or Repayment Date, as applicable, will include interest accrued from and including each immediately preceding Interest Payment Date (or from and including the Original Date of Issue if no interest has been paid or duly provided for), to, but excluding, the Interest Payment Date, Maturity Date, Redemption Date or Repayment Date, as the case may be. However, in case the interest rate on this Note is reset daily or weekly, unless otherwise specified on the face hereof, the interest payments will include interest accrued only from, but excluding, the Regular Record Date through which interest has been paid (or from and including the Original Issue Date, if no interest has been paid with respect to this Note) through and including the Regular Record Date next preceding the applicable Interest Payment Date, except that the interest payment on the Maturity Date, Redemption Date or Repayment Date, as applicable, will include interest accrued to, but excluding, the Maturity Date, Redemption Date or Repayment Date, as the case may be.
     Payment of principal (and premium, if any) and interest on, this Note on any day, if the Holder of this Note is DTC (or its nominee or other depository, a "Depository"), will be made in accordance with any applicable provisions of such written agreement between the Operating Partnership, the Trustee and the Depository (or its nominee) as may be in effect from time to time. Otherwise payment of principal (and premium, if any) and interest on, this Note on any day shall be payable and this Note may be surrendered for the registration of transfer or exchange at the corporate trust office of the Trustee at 100 Wall Street, Suite 1600, New York, New York 10005, unless the Holder of this Note is notified otherwise; provided, however, that at the option of the Operating Partnership, interest may be paid by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address shall appear in the Operating Partnership's Security Register or by wire transfer, if proper wire instructions are on file with the Trustee or are received at presentment, to an account maintained by the payee located in the United States. Unless the Holder of this Note is notified otherwise, the
 
place where notices or demands to or upon the Operating Partnership in respect of this Note and the Indenture may be served shall be the corporate trust office of the Trustee at 100 Wall Street, Suite 1600, New York, New York 10005.
     To receive payment of a U.S. dollar denominated Note upon redemption (if applicable) or at maturity, a Holder must make presentation and surrender of such Note on or before the Redemption Date or Maturity Date, as applicable. To receive payment of a Note denominated in a Foreign Currency (as defined on the reverse hereof) or composite currency upon redemption or at maturity, a Holder must make presentation and surrender of such Note not less than two Business Days prior to the Redemption Date or Maturity Date, as applicable. Upon presentation and surrender of a Note denominated in a Foreign Currency or composite currency at any time after the date two Business Days prior to the Redemption Date or Maturity Date, as applicable, the Operating Partnership will pay the principal amount (and premium, if any) of such Note, and any interest due upon redemption or at maturity (unless the Redemption Date or Maturity Date is an Interest Payment Date), two Business Days after such presentation and surrender.
     For procedures relating to the receipt of payment upon repayment, if applicable, see the reverse hereof.
     The Calculation Agent (which shall be U.S. Bank National Association unless otherwise specified on the face hereof, and which may be changed by the Operating Partnership from time to time) will generally determine the Initial Interest Rate as if the Original Issue Date of the Note were an Interest Reset Date. The Interest Reset Dates and Interest Payment Dates, each specified on the face hereof, are determined by the frequency with which the interest rate resents (the "Interest Reset Frequency"). Interest will be payable, in the case of Notes which reset daily, weekly or monthly, on the third Wednesday of each month or on the third Wednesday of each March, June, September and December of each year, as specified on the face hereof; in the case of Notes which reset quarterly, on the third Wednesday of March, June, September and December of each year; in the case of Notes which reset semi-annually, on the third Wednesday of the two months of each year specified on the face hereof; and in the case of Notes which reset annually, on the third Wednesday of the month specified on the face hereof (each an "Interest Payment Date"), and in each case, on the Maturity Date.
     The Calculation Agent will compute the interest for each day in the applicable interest period by dividing the interest rate applicable to each such day by (i) 360 in the case of CD Rate Notes, Commercial Paper Rate Notes, EURIBOR Notes, Federal Funds Rate Notes, LIBOR Notes or Prime Rate Notes, or (ii) by the actual number of days in the year in the case of CMT Rate Notes or Treasury Rate Notes. The interest factor for Notes for which the interest rate is calculated with reference to two or more Interest Rate Bases (as described below) will be calculated in each period in the same manner as if only the lowest of the applicable Interest Rates Bases applied.
     Except as specified on the face hereof, the Interest Reset Frequency on this Note will be daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, semi-annually or annually, as specified on the face hereof. Except as specified on the face hereof, if this Note resets daily, the Interest Reset Date will be each Business Day; if this Note resets weekly, the Interest Reset Date will be the Wednesday of each week (with the exception of weekly reset Treasury Rate Notes, which reset Tuesday of each week except as provided below); if this Note resets monthly, the Interest Reset Date will be the third Wednesday of each month; if this Note resets quarterly, the Interest Reset Date will be the third Wednesday of each March, June, September and December of each year; if this Note resets semi-annually, the Interest Reset Date will be the third Wednesday of each of the two months of each year specified on the face hereof; and if this Note resets annually, the Interest Reset Date will be the third Wednesday of the month of each year as specified on the face hereof.
     The interest rate in effect on each day that is not an Interest Reset Date will be the interest rate determined as of the Interest Determination Date (as specified on the face hereof) pertaining to the immediately preceding Interest Reset Date and the interest rate in effect on any day that is an Interest Reset Date will be the interest rate determined as of the Interest Determination Date pertaining to such Interest Reset Date; provided, however, that the interest rate in effect for the period, if any, from the Original Issue Date to the Initial Interest Reset Date will be the Initial Interest Rate; provided, further, that if this Note is a Floating Rate/Fixed Rate Note the interest rate in effect for the period commencing on the Fixed Rate Commencement Date specified on the face hereof to the Maturity Date shall be the Fixed Interest Rate specified on the face hereof or, if no interest rate is specified, the interest rate in effect on the day immediately preceding the Fixed Rate Commencement Date.
 
     If any Interest Reset Date would otherwise be a day that is not a Business Day, the Interest Reset Date shall be postponed to the next succeeding day that is a Business Day, except that in the case of a LIBOR Note or a Note for which LIBOR is an applicable Interest Rate Basis and such Business Day falls in the next succeeding calendar month, such Interest Reset Date will be the immediately preceding Business Day. In addition, if the Treasury Rate is an applicable Interest Rate Basis and an auction falls on the day that would be an Interest Reset Date, then the Interest Reset Date will be postponed to the first Business Day after the auction.
     If an Interest Payment Date (other than the Maturity Date, Redemption Date or Repayment Date) for this Note falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the Interest Payment Date will be postponed to the next Business Day. However, if the postponement would cause the Interest Payment Date for a LIBOR-based or a EURIBOR-based Note to be in the next calendar month, the Interest Payment Date will be moved to the immediately preceding Business Day. If the Maturity Date or Redemption Date or Repayment Date, if any, for a Note falls on a day that is not a Business Day, principal and interest will be paid on the next Business Day; provided that interest on the payment will not accrue for the period from the original Interest Payment Date, Maturity Date or Redemption Date or Repayment Date, as the case may be, to the date of such payment on the next Business Day.
     "Business Day" as used herein means any day, other than a Saturday or Sunday, (a) that is neither a legal holiday nor a day on which banking institutions are authorized or required by law or regulation to close (x) in The City of New York or (y) for notes denominated in a specified currency other than U.S. dollars, Australian dollars or euro, in the principal financial center of the country of the specified currency or (z) for notes denominated in Australian dollars, in Sydney, and (b) for notes denominated in euro, that is also a day on which the Trans-European Automated Real-time Gross Settlement Express Transfer System, which is commonly referred to as "TARGET," is operating.
     The Calculation Agent shall calculate the interest rate on this Note on or before each Calculation Date (as defined below) and, upon request, provide the Holder of this Note the interest rate (the "Floating Interest Rate") then in effect and, if different, the Floating Interest Rate which will become effective as a result of a determination made for the next Interest Reset Date with respect to this Note. The Calculation Agent's determination of any Floating Interest Rate will be final and binding in the absence of manifest error.

Except as otherwise provided herein, all percentages resulting from any interest rate calculation will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred-thousandth of a percentage point, with five one-millionths of a percentage point rounded upwards (e.g., 9.876545% (or .09876545) would be rounded to 9.87655% (or         .0987655)), and all U.S. dollar amounts used in or resulting from such calculation with be rounded to the nearest cent or, in the case of a foreign currency or composite currency, to the nearest unit (with one-half cent being rounded upward).
     Notwithstanding the other provisions herein, the Floating Interest Rate hereon which may accrue during any interest period shall not be greater than the Maximum Interest Rate, if any, or less than the Minimum Interest Rate, if any, each as set forth on the face hereof, and, in addition, the Floating Interest Rate shall in no event be higher than the maximum rate permitted by New York law, as the same may be modified by United States law of general application.

Commencing on the Initial Reset Date, the rate at which interest on this Note shall be payable shall be reset as of each Interest Reset Date; provided, however, that the interest rate in effect for the period, if any, from the Original Issue Date to the Initial Interest Reset Date shall be the Initial Interest Rate.

TRUSTEE'S CERTIFICATE OF AUTHENTICATION This is one of the Securities of the series designated and referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.
 
     This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of debt securities of the Operating Partnership (hereinafter called the "Securities") of the series hereinafter specified, unlimited in aggregate principal amount, all issued or to be issued under or pursuant to an Indenture dated as of June 30, 1998, as supplemented by the Seventh Supplemental Indenture dated as of August 10, 2006 (herein collectively called the "Indenture"), among the Operating Partnership, AMB Property Corporation, a Maryland corporation and sole general partner of the Operating Partnership (the "Guarantor"), and U.S. Bank National Association, as successor-in-interest to State Street Bank and Trust Company of California, N.A., as trustee (the "Trustee"); to which Indenture reference is hereby made for a specification of the rights and limitation of rights thereunder of the Holders of the Securities, the rights and obligations thereunder of the Operating Partnership and the rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Trustee. The Securities may be issued in one or more series, which different series may be issued in various aggregate principal amounts, may mature at different times, may bear interest (if any) at different rates, may be subject to different redemption or repayment provisions (if any), may be subject to different covenants and defaults and may otherwise vary as provided in the Indenture. This Note is one of a series designated as "Series C Medium-Term Notes" (hereinafter referred to as the "Notes") of the Operating Partnership, of up to $500,000,000 in aggregate principal amount. All terms used in this Note which are defined in the Indenture and which are not otherwise defined in this Note shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture. The terms of the Notes include those stated in the Indenture and those made a part of the Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended. The Notes are subject to all such terms, and the Holders are referred to the Indenture and such Act for a statement of such terms. To the extent any provision of this Note conflicts with the provisions of the Indenture, the provisions of the Indenture shall govern and be controlling.
     Unless stated to the contrary on the face hereof, this Note is issuable only in registered form without coupons in Book-Entry form represented by one or more global notes (each a "Global Note") recorded in the book-entry system maintained by the Depository. If specified on the face hereof, this Note is issuable in certificated form issued to, and registered in the name of, the beneficial owner or its nominee (a "Certificated Note").
     Unless a different minimum Authorized Denomination is set forth on the face hereof, this Note is issuable in minimum denominations of (i) if the Specified Currency of this Note is U.S. dollars, U.S. $1,000 and in any larger amount in integral multiples of $1,000 and (ii) if the Specified Currency of this Note is a currency other than U.S. dollars (a "Foreign Currency") or is a composite currency, the equivalent in such Foreign Currency or composite currency determined in accordance with the Market Exchange Rate (as defined below) for such Foreign Currency or composite currency on the Business Day immediately preceding the date on which the Operating Partnership accepts an offer to purchase a Note, of U.S. $1,000 (rounded to an integral multiple of 1,000 units of the Foreign Currency or composite currency), and in any larger amount in integral multiples of 1,000 units.
     If this is a Global Note representing Book-Entry Notes, this Note may be transferred or exchanged only through DTC. In the manner and subject to the limitations provided in the Indenture, if this is a Certificated Note, it may be transferred or exchanged, without charge except for any tax or other governmental charge imposed in relation thereto, for other Notes of authorized denominations for a like aggregate principal amount, at the office or agency of the Operating Partnership in the Borough of Manhattan of The City of New York, or, at the option of the Holder, such office or agency, if any, maintained by the Operating Partnership in the city in which the principal executive offices of the Operating Partnership are located or the city in which the principal corporate trust office of the Trustee is located.
     The principal (and premium, if any) and interest on, this Note is payable by the Operating Partnership in the Specified Currency.
     If this Note is denominated in a Foreign Currency, in the event that the Foreign Currency is not available for payment at a time at which any payment is required hereunder due to the imposition of exchange controls or
 
other circumstances beyond the control of the Operating Partnership or is no longer used by the government of the country issuing such currency or for the settlement of transactions by public institutions within the international banking community, the Operating Partnership may, in full satisfaction of its obligation to make such payment, make instead a payment in an equivalent amount of U.S. dollars, determined by the Exchange Rate Agent, as specified on the face hereof, on the basis of the Market Exchange Rate for such Foreign Currency on the second Business Day prior to such payment date or, if such Market Exchange Rate is not then available, on the basis of the most recently available Market Exchange Rate; provided, however, that if such Specified Currency is replaced by a single European currency, the payment of principal of (and premium, if any) or interest, if any, on this Note denominated in such currency shall be effected in the new single European currency in conformity with legally applicable measures taken pursuant to, or by virtue of, the treaty establishing the European Community, as amended by the treaty on European Unity. The "Market Exchange Rate" for the Specified Currency means the noon dollar buying rate in The City of New York for cable transfers for the Specified Currency as certified for customs purposes by (or if not so certified, as otherwise determined by) the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Any payment made under such circumstances in U.S. dollars or a new single European currency where the required payment is in a Specified Currency other than U.S. dollars or such single European currency, respectively, will not constitute an Event of Default (as defined in the Indenture).
     If the Specified Currency is a composite currency and if such composite currency is unavailable due to the imposition of exchange controls or other circumstances beyond the control of the Operating Partnership, then the Operating Partnership will be entitled to satisfy its obligations to the Holder of this Note by making such payment in U.S. dollars. The amount of each payment in U.S. dollars shall be computed by the Exchange Rate Agent on the basis of the equivalent of the composite currency in U.S. dollars. The component currencies of the composite currency for this purpose (collectively, the "Component Currencies" and each, a "Component Currency") shall be the currency amounts that were components of the composite currency as of the last day on which the composite currency was used. The equivalent of the composite currency in U.S. dollars shall be calculated by aggregating the U.S. dollar equivalents of the Component Currencies. The U.S. dollar equivalent of each of the Component Currencies shall be determined by the Exchange Rate Agent on the basis of the most recently available Market Exchange Rate for each such Component Currency, or as otherwise specified on the face hereof.
     If the official unit of any Component Currency is altered by way of combination or subdivision, the number of units of the currency as a Component Currency shall be divided or multiplied in the same proportion. If two or more Component Currencies are consolidated into a single currency, the amounts of those currencies as Component Currencies shall be replaced by an amount in such single currency equal to the sum of the amounts of the consolidated Component Currencies expressed in such single currency. If any Component Currency is divided into two or more currencies, the amount of the original Component Currency shall be replaced by the amounts of such two or more currencies, the sum of which shall be equal to the amount of the original Component Currency.
     All determinations referred to above made by the Exchange Rate Agent shall be at its sole discretion and shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive for all purposes and binding on the Holder of this Note.
     If a Redemption Commencement Date is specified on the face hereof, this Note may be redeemed, whether or not any other Note is concurrently redeemed, at the option of the Operating Partnership, in whole, or from time to time in part, on any Business Day on or after such Redemption Commencement Date and prior to the Maturity Date, upon mailing by first-class mail, postage prepaid, a notice of such redemption not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the actual date of redemption ("Redemption Date"), to the Holder of this Note at such Holder's address appearing in the Security Register, as provided in the Indenture (provided that, if the Holder of this Note is a Depository or a nominee of a Depository, notice of such redemption shall be given in accordance with any applicable provisions of such written agreement between the Operating Partnership, the Trustee and such Depository (or its nominee) as may be in effect from time to time), at the Redemption Price (as defined below), together in each case with interest accrued to the Redemption Date (subject to the right of the Holder of record on a Regular Record Date to receive interest due on an Interest Payment Date). The "Redemption Price" shall be equal to (i) the Initial Redemption Percentage specified on the face of this Note, as adjusted downward on each anniversary of the Redemption Commencement Date by the Annual Redemption Price Reduction, if any, specified on the face hereof, multiplied by (ii) the unpaid Principal Amount of this Note to be redeemed. In the event of redemption of this Note
 
in part only, a new Note or Notes of this series, and of like tenor, for the unredeemed portion hereof will be issued in the name of the Holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof.
     If an Optional Repayment Date(s) is specified on the face hereof, this Note will be subject to repayment by the Operating Partnership at the option of the Holder hereof on such Optional Repayment Date(s), in whole or in part in increments of U.S. $1,000 or other increments specified on the face hereof (as long as any remaining principal is at least $1,000 or another specified minimum denomination), at the Repayment Price specified on the face hereof, together with unpaid interest accrued hereon to the date of repayment ("Repayment Date"). For this Note to be repaid, this Note must be received, together with the form hereon entitled "Option to Elect Repayment" duly completed, by the Trustee at its corporate trust office at 100 Wall Street, Suite 1600, New York, New York 10005 (or at such other address of which the Operating Partnership shall from time to time designate and notify Holders of the Notes) at least 30 but not more than 60 days prior to the Repayment Date. Exercise of such repayment option by the Holder hereof will be irrevocable. In the event of repayment of this Note in part only, a new Note of like tenor for the unrepaid portion hereof and otherwise having the same terms as this Note shall be issued in the name of the Holder hereof upon the presentation and surrender hereof.
     If this is a Global Note representing Book-Entry Notes, only the Depository may exercise the repayment option in respect of this Note. Accordingly, if this is a Global Security representing Book-Entry Notes and the beneficial owner desires to have all or any portion of the Book-Entry Note represented by this Global Security repaid, the beneficial owner must instruct the participant through which he owns his interest to direct the Depository to exercise the repayment option on his behalf by delivering this Note and duly completed election form to the Trustee as aforesaid.
     If this Note is an Original Issue Discount Note, as specified on the face hereof, the amount payable to the Holder of this Note in the event of redemption, repayment or acceleration of maturity will be equal to the sum of (i) the Issue Price specified on the face hereof (increased by any accruals of the Discount, as defined below) multiplied, in the event of any redemption or repayment of this Note (if applicable), by the Redemption Price or Repayment Price, as the case may be, and (ii) any unpaid interest on this Note accrued from the Original Issue Date to the Redemption Date, Repayment Date or date of acceleration of maturity, as the case may be. The difference between the Issue Price, as specified on the face hereof, and 100% of the principal amount of this Note is referred to herein as the "Discount".
     For purposes of determining the amount of Discount that has accrued as of any Redemption Date, Repayment Date or date of acceleration of maturity of this Note, such Discount will be accrued so as to cause the yield on the Note to be constant. The constant yield will be calculated using a 30-day month, 360-day year convention, a compounding period that, except for the Initial Period (as defined below), corresponds to the shortest period between Interest Payment Dates (with ratable accruals within a compounding period) and an assumption that the maturity of this Note will not be accelerated. If the period from the Original Issue Date to the initial Interest Payment Date (the "Initial Period") is shorter than the compounding period for this Note, a proportionate amount of the yield for an entire compounding period will be accrued. If the Initial Period is longer than the compounding period, then such period will be divided into a regular compounding period and a short period, with the short period being treated as provided in the preceding sentence.
     In case a default, as defined in the Indenture, shall occur and be continuing with respect to the Notes, the principal amount of all Notes then outstanding under the Indenture may be declared or may become due and payable upon the conditions and in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture. The Indenture provides that such declaration may in certain events be annulled by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes outstanding.
     To the extent permitted by, and as provided in, the Indenture, the Operating Partnership may enter into one or more supplements to the Indenture for the purpose of modifying or altering the Indenture, without the consent of any Holders of Notes, for the limited purposes described in the Indenture.
     To the extent permitted by, and as provided in, the Indenture, the Operating Partnership may enter into one or more supplements to the Indenture for the purpose of modifying or altering the rights and obligations of the
 
Operating Partnership and the Holders of the Securities (as defined in the Indenture) with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of all Outstanding Securities (as defined in the Indenture) of any series affected, evidenced as provided in the Indenture.
     The Indenture contains provisions for legal defeasance and covenant defeasance with respect to the Notes, in each case, upon compliance with certain conditions set forth therein, which provisions apply to the Notes.
     The Operating Partnership, the Trustee, any Authenticating Agent, any paying agent and any Security registrar may deem and treat the registered Holder hereof as the absolute owner hereof (whether or not this Note shall be overdue and notwithstanding any notice of ownership or other writing hereon by anyone other than the Operating Partnership or any Security registrar) for the purpose of receiving payment of or on account of the principal hereof (and premium, if any), and interest hereon, and for all other purposes, and none of the Operating Partnership, the Trustee, an Authenticating Agent, a paying agent nor the Security registrar shall be affected by any notice to the contrary. All such payments shall be valid and effectual to satisfy and discharge the liability upon this Note to the extent of the sum or sums so paid.
     No recourse under or upon any obligation, covenant or agreement of the Indenture or of this Note, or for any claim based thereon or otherwise in respect thereof, shall be had against any incorporator, partner, stockholder, officer or director, as such, past, present or future, of the Operating Partnership or the Guarantor or of any successor entity, either directly or through the Operating Partnership or the Guarantor, whether by virtue of any constitution, statute or rule of law, or by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty or otherwise; it being expressly understood that the Indenture and this Note are solely corporate obligations, and that no such personal liability whatever shall attach to, or is or shall be incurred by the incorporators, partners, stockholders, officers or directors, as such, of the Operating Partnership or the Guarantor or of any successor entity, or any of them, because of the creation of the indebtedness authorized by the Indenture, or under or by reason of the obligations, covenants or agreements contained in the Indenture or this Note or implied therefrom; and that any and all such personal liability, either at common law or in equity or by constitution or statute, or any and all such rights and claims against, every such incorporator, partner, stockholder, officer or director, as such, because of the creation of the indebtedness authorized by the Indenture, or under or by reason of the obligations, covenants or agreements contained in the Indenture or this Note or implied therefrom, are, by acceptance of this Note, hereby expressly waived and released as a condition of, and as consideration for, the issue of this Note. In the event of any sale or transfer of its assets and liabilities substantially as an entirety to a successor entity, the predecessor entity may be dissolved and liquidated as more fully set forth in the Indenture.
     All U.S. dollar amounts used in or resulting from calculations referred to in this Note shall be rounded to the nearest cent (with one half cent being rounded upwards).
     THIS NOTE SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.
