Other Events.
     On August 25, 2006, we sold and issued 2,000,000 shares of our 6.85% Series P Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, in a public offering at a price of $25.00 per share, under our shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-68283), and pursuant to the terms set forth in a prospectus dated December 17, 1998, as supplemented by a preliminary prospectus supplement dated August 17, 2006 and a final prospectus supplement dated August 18, 2006. We executed an underwriting agreement in connection with the transaction on August 18, 2006, which is filed as an exhibit to and incorporated by reference into this report.
     We will pay cumulative dividends on the Series P Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock from August 25, 2006 at the rate of 6.85% per annum of the $25.00 liquidation preference per share, which is equivalent to $1.7125 per share per year. Dividends on the Series P Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock will be payable quarterly in arrears on the 15th day of each January, April, July and October, or, if such date is not a business day, on the next succeeding business day, beginning on January 16, 2007. The shares of Series P Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock have no stated maturity, are not subject to any sinking fund or mandatory redemption and are not convertible into any other securities. Holders of shares of Series P Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock generally have no voting rights, except for limited rights if we fail to pay dividends for six or more quarterly periods (whether or not consecutive) and in certain other events. Except in limited circumstances to preserve our status as a real estate investment trust, we may not redeem the Series P Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock until August 25, 2011. On or after that date, we may, at our option, redeem the Series P Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock in whole or from time to time in part, for cash at a redemption price of $25.00 per share, plus all accumulated and unpaid dividends on such Series P Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock to the redemption date.
     We have listed the Series P Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "AMB  PrP". Trading in the Series P Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock is expected to commence on September 7, 2006. For additional information concerning these securities, please refer to the exhibits attached to this report.
     We received net proceeds from this offering of approximately $47,975,000 after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated transaction expenses payable by us. We will use the net proceeds from the sale of the Series P Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock for general corporate purposes, which may include the acquisition or development of additional properties, the repayment of indebtedness, including inter-company indebtedness, the redemption or other repurchase of outstanding securities, capital expenditures and increasing our working capital. Pending the application of the net proceeds, we may invest the proceeds in short-term securities or temporarily reduce borrowings under revolving credit facilities.
 
     We have contributed the net proceeds of the offering to our operating partnership, AMB Property, L.P., and in exchange, our operating partnership issued to us 2,000,000 6.85% Series P Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units. AMB Property, L.P. will pay us cumulative distributions on the Series P Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units from August 25, 2006 at the rate of 6.85% per annum of the $25.00 value per unit, which is equivalent to $1.7125 per unit per year. Distributions on the Series P Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units will be payable quarterly in arrears on the 15th day of each January, April, July and October, or, if such date is not a business day, on the next succeeding business day, beginning on January 16, 2007. The Series P Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units have no stated maturity, are not subject to any sinking fund or mandatory redemption and are not convertible into any other securities. On or after August 25, 2011, AMB Property, L.P. may, at its option, redeem the Series P Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units in whole or from time to time in part, for cash at a redemption price of $25.00 per unit, plus all accumulated and unpaid distributions on such Series P Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units to the redemption date.

Covenants of the REIT and the Operating Partnership
     (a) The REIT will advise the Representatives promptly of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or of the institution of any proceedings for that purpose, and will use their best efforts to prevent the issuance of any such stop order and to obtain as soon as possible the lifting thereof, if issued, and will advise the Representatives promptly of any examination pursuant to 8(e) of the Securities Act or of the REIT or Operating Partnership becoming the subject of a proceeding under 8A of the Securities Act in connection with any

Indemnity and Contribution
          (a) The REIT and the Operating Partnership, jointly and severally, agree to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses (including, without limitation, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with defending or investigating any such action or claim) arising out of or caused by (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or any amendment thereof, the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement, Prospectus Supplement, the Prospectus or any Issuer Represented Free Writing Prospectus (in each case, as amended or supplemented if the REIT and the Operating Partnership shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto) or in any documents filed under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act and incorporated by reference or deemed to be incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement, Prospectus Supplement, the Prospectus or the General Disclosure Package or in any application or other document executed by or on behalf of the Company or based on written information furnished by or on behalf of the Company filed in any jurisdiction in order to qualify the Shares under the securities or blue sky laws thereof or filed with the Commission, (ii) any omission or alleged omission to state in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or the General Disclosure Package a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or (iii) any act or failure to act or any alleged act or failure to act by any Underwriter in connection with, or relating in any manner to, the Shares or the offering contemplated hereby, and which is included as part of or referred to in any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense arising out of or based upon matters covered by clause (i) or (ii) above (, , that the REIT and the Operating Partnership shall not be liable under this clause (iii) to the extent it is finally judicially determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense resulted directly from any such acts or failures to act undertaken or omitted to be taken by such Underwriter through its gross negligence or willful misconduct), except insofar as such losses, claims, damage, liabilities or expenses are caused by any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission based upon information relating to any Underwriter furnished to the REIT and the Operating Partnership in writing by such Underwriter through you expressly for use in the Registration Statement, the Permitted Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus, which information is limited to that set forth on hereof. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability that the REIT or the Operating Partnership might otherwise have.
provided
however
Exhibit A
 
          (b) Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the REIT, the Operating Partnership and the REIT's directors, its officers who sign the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the REIT or the Operating Partnership within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the foregoing indemnities from the REIT and the Operating Partnership to such Underwriter, but only with reference to information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the REIT in writing by such Underwriter through you expressly for use in the Registration Statement, the Permitted Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus, which information is limited to that set forth on hereto.
Exhibit A
          (c) In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to Section 8(a) or 8(b), such person (the "") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "") in writing and the indemnifying party, upon request of the indemnified party, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in respect of the legal expenses of any indemnified party in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified parties and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Such firm shall be designated in writing by the Representatives, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 8(a), and by the REIT or the Operating Partnership, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 8(b). The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party in writing to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by the second and third sentences of this paragraph, the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 60 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request and (ii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of each indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding.

indemnifying party
 
          (d) To the extent the indemnification provided for in Section 8(a) or 8(b) is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the REIT and the Operating Partnership on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Shares or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the REIT and the Operating Partnership on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the REIT and the Operating Partnership on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the offering of the Shares shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds from the offering of the Shares (before deducting expenses) received by the REIT and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate Public Offering Price of the Shares. The relative fault of the REIT and the Operating Partnership on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the REIT or the Operating Partnership or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 8 are several in proportion to the respective number of Shares they have purchased hereunder, and not joint.
          (e) The REIT, the Operating Partnership and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in Section 8(d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Shares underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The remedies provided for in this Section 8 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.
          (f) The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in this Section 8 and the representations, warranties and other statements of the REIT and the Operating Partnership
 
contained in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any person controlling any Underwriter or by or on behalf of the REIT, the Operating Partnership or the REIT's officers or directors or any person controlling the REIT or the Operating Partnership and (iii) acceptance of and payment for any of the Shares.
     9. The obligations of the Underwriters under this Agreement may be terminated at any time on or prior to the Closing Date, by notice to the REIT and the Operating Partnership from the Underwriters, without liability on the part of the Underwriters to the REIT and the Operating Partnership, if, prior to delivery and payment for the Shares, in the sole judgment of the Underwriters, (i) trading in any of the securities of the REIT or the Operating Partnership shall have been suspended by the Commission, by any exchange that lists such securities or in any over-the-counter market, (ii) trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange shall have been suspended or limited or minimum or maximum prices shall have been generally established on such exchange, or additional material governmental restrictions, not in force on the date of this Agreement, shall have been imposed upon trading in securities generally by such exchange or by order of the Commission or any court or other governmental authority, (iii) a general banking moratorium shall have been declared by either Federal or New York State authorities or (iv) any material adverse change in the financial or securities markets in the United States or in political, financial or economic conditions in the United States or any material outbreak or material escalation of hostilities or declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war or other material calamity or crisis, including, without limitation, an act of terrorism, shall have occurred the effect of any of which is such as to make it, in the judgment of the Underwriters, impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offering, sale or delivery of the Shares on the terms and in the manner contemplated by the Prospectus, the General Disclosure Package and this Agreement.

Without the Consent of the Limited Partners, the General Partner shall not, directly or indirectly, participate in or otherwise acquire any interest in any real or personal property, except its General Partner Interest, its interest in any Subsidiary Partnership(s) (held directly or indirectly through a Qualified REIT Subsidiary) that the General Partner holds in order to maintain such Subsidiary Partnership's status as a partnership, and such bank accounts, similar instruments or other short-term investments as it deems necessary to carry out its responsibilities contemplated under this Agreement and the Charter. In the event the General Partner desires to contribute cash to any Subsidiary Partnership to acquire or maintain an interest of 1% or less in the capital of such partnership, the General Partner may acquire such cash from the Partnership in exchange for a reduction in the General Partner's Units, in an amount equal to the amount of such cash divided by the Fair Market Value of a REIT Share on the day such cash is received by the General Partner.

If, at any time, the General Partner acquires material assets (other than on behalf of the Partnership) the definition of "REIT Shares Amount" and the definition of "Deemed Value of Partnership Interests" shall be adjusted, as reasonably agreed to by the General Partner and the other Limited Partners, to reflect the relative Fair Market Value of a share of capital stock of the General Partner relative to the Deemed Partnership Interest Value of the related Partnership Unit. The General Partner's General Partner Interest in the Partnership, its minority interest in any Subsidiary Partnership(s) (held directly or indirectly through a Qualified REIT Subsidiary) that the General Partner holds in order to maintain such Subsidiary Partnership's status as a partnership, and interests in such short-term liquid investments, bank accounts or similar instruments as the General Partner deems necessary to carry out its responsibilities contemplated under this Agreement and the Charter are interests which the General Partner is permitted to acquire and hold for purposes of this .

also a Subsidiary of the Partnership, except pursuant to transactions that are on terms that are fair and reasonable and no less favorable to the Partnership than would be obtained from an unaffiliated third party.
     B. The General Partner, in its sole and absolute discretion and without the approval of the Limited Partners, may propose and adopt on behalf of the Partnership employee benefit plans funded by the Partnership for the benefit of employees of the General Partner, the Partnership, Subsidiaries of the Partnership or any Affiliate of any of them in respect of services performed, directly or indirectly, for the benefit of the Partnership, the General Partner, or any of the Partnership's Subsidiaries. The General Partner also is expressly authorized to cause the Partnership to issue to it Partnership Units corresponding to REIT Shares issued by the General Partner pursuant to its Stock Incentive Plan or any similar or successor plan and to repurchase such Partnership Units from the General Partner to the extent necessary to permit the General Partner to repurchase such REIT Shares in accordance with such plan.
     Section 7.7
Indemnification
     A. The Partnership shall indemnify an Indemnitee from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, joint or several, expenses (including legal fees and expenses), judgments, fines, settlements, and other amounts arising from any and all claims, demands, actions, suits or proceedings, civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, that relate to the operations of the Partnership as set forth in this Agreement in which any Indemnitee may be involved, or is threatened to be involved, as a party or otherwise, unless it is established that: (i) the act or omission of the Indemnitee was material to the matter giving rise to the proceeding and either was committed in bad faith or was the result of active and deliberate dishonesty; (ii) the Indemnitee actually received an improper personal benefit in money, property or services; or (iii) in the case of any criminal proceeding, the Indemnitee had reasonable cause to believe that the act or omission was unlawful. Without limitation, the foregoing indemnity shall extend to any liability of any Indemnitee, pursuant to a loan guaranty or otherwise, for any indebtedness of the Partnership or any Subsidiary of the Partnership (including, without limitation, any indebtedness which the Partnership or any Subsidiary of the Partnership has assumed or taken subject to), and the General Partner is hereby authorized and empowered, on behalf of the Partnership, to enter into one or more indemnity agreements consistent with the provisions of this in favor of any Indemnitee having or potentially having liability for any such indebtedness. The termination of any proceeding by judgment, order or settlement does not create a presumption that the Indemnitee did not meet the requisite standard of conduct set forth in this . The termination of any proceeding by conviction or upon a plea of or its equivalent, or any entry of an order of probation prior to judgment, creates a rebuttable presumption that the Indemnitee acted in a manner contrary to that specified in this . Any indemnification pursuant to this shall be made only out of the assets of the Partnership, and any insurance proceeds from the liability policy covering the General Partner and any Indemnitee, and neither the General Partner nor any Limited Partner shall have any obligation to contribute to the capital of the Partnership or otherwise provide funds to enable the Partnership to fund its obligations under this .

The Partnership may purchase and maintain insurance, on behalf of the Indemnitees and such other Persons as the General Partner shall determine, against any liability that may be asserted against or expenses that may be incurred by any such Person in connection with the Partnership's activities, regardless of whether the Partnership would have the power to indemnify such Person against such liability under the provisions of this Agreement.
     E. For purposes of this , the Partnership shall be deemed to have requested an Indemnitee to serve as fiduciary of an employee benefit plan whenever the performance by it of its duties to the Partnership also imposes duties on, or otherwise involves services by, it to the plan or participants or beneficiaries of the plan; excise taxes assessed on an Indemnitee with respect to an employee benefit plan pursuant to applicable law shall constitute fines within the meaning of ; and actions taken or omitted by the Indemnitee with respect to an employee benefit plan in the performance of its duties for a purpose reasonably believed by it to be in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of the plan shall be deemed to be for a purpose which is not opposed to the best interests of the Partnership.

     F. In no event may an Indemnitee subject the Limited Partners to personal liability by reason of the indemnification provisions set forth in this Agreement.

distributions authorized and declared on the Series J Preferred Units and all classes or series of outstanding Parity Preferred Units (including the Series K Preferred Units, the Series L Preferred Units, the Series M Preferred Units, the Series O Preferred Units and the Series P Preferred Units) shall be authorized and declared so that the amount of distributions authorized and declared per Series J Preferred Unit and such other classes or series of Parity Preferred Units shall in all cases bear to each other the same ratio that accrued distributions per Series J Preferred Unit and such other classes or series of Parity Preferred Units (which shall not include any accumulation in respect of unpaid distributions for prior distribution periods if such class or series of Parity Preferred Units do not have cumulative distribution rights) bear to each other. No interest, or sum of money in lieu of interest, shall be payable in respect of any distributions or payments on Series J Preferred Units which may be in arrears.

Redemption Price
provided
however
Section 18.5
          B. . (i) The Redemption Price of the Series J Preferred Units (other than the portion thereof consisting of accumulated but unpaid distributions) is payable solely out of the sale proceeds of capital stock of the General Partner, which will be contributed by the General Partner to the Partnership as an additional capital contribution, or out of the sale of limited partner interests in the Partnership and from no other source. For purposes of the preceding sentence, "capital stock" means any equity securities (including Common Stock and Preferred Stock (as such terms are defined in the Charter)), depository shares, interests, participation or other ownership interests (however designated) and any rights (other than debt securities convertible into or exchangeable for equity securities) or options to purchase any of the foregoing.
Limitation on Redemption
          (ii) The Partnership may not redeem fewer than all of the outstanding Series J Preferred Units unless all accumulated and unpaid distributions have been paid on all Series J Preferred Units for all quarterly distribution periods terminating on or prior to the date of redemption.
          C.

No failure to give or defect in such notice shall affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any Series J Preferred Units except as to the holder to whom such notice was defective or not given. In addition to any information required by law, each such notice shall state: (a) the redemption date, (b) the Redemption Price, (c) the aggregate number of Series J Preferred Units to be redeemed and if fewer than all of the outstanding Series J Preferred Units are to be redeemed, the number of Series J Preferred Units to be redeemed held by such holder, which number shall equal such holder's share (based on the percentage of the aggregate number of outstanding Series J Preferred Units that the total number of Series J Preferred Units held by such holder represents) of the aggregate number of Series J Preferred Units to be redeemed, (d) the place or places where such Series J Preferred Units are to be surrendered for payment of the Redemption Price, (e) that distributions on the Series J Preferred Units to be redeemed will cease to accumulate on such redemption date and (f) that payment of the Redemption Price will be made upon presentation and surrender of such Series J Preferred Units.
Procedures for Redemption.
pro rata
          (ii) If the Partnership gives a notice of redemption in respect of Series J Preferred Units (which notice will be irrevocable) then, by 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the redemption date, the Partnership will deposit irrevocably in trust for the benefit of the Series
 
J Preferred Units being redeemed funds sufficient to pay the applicable Redemption Price and will give irrevocable instructions and authority to pay such Redemption Price to the holders of the Series J Preferred Units upon surrender of the Series J Preferred Units by such holders at the place designated in the notice of redemption. On and after the date of redemption, distributions will cease to accumulate on the Series J Preferred Units or portions thereof called for redemption, unless the Partnership defaults in the payment thereof. If any date fixed for redemption of Series J Preferred Units is not a Business Day, then payment of the Redemption Price payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay) except that, if such Business Day falls in the next calendar year, such payment will be made on the immediately preceding Business Day, in each case with the same force and effect as if made on such date fixed for redemption. If payment of the Redemption Price is improperly withheld or refused and not paid by the Partnership, distributions on such Series J Preferred Units will continue to accumulate from the original redemption date to the date of payment, in which case the actual payment date will be considered the date fixed for redemption for purposes of calculating the applicable Redemption Price.

Transfer Restrictions
          The Series J Preferred Units shall be subject to the provisions of Article 11 hereof; , , that the Series J Preferred Units shall not be subject to the right of first refusal of the General Partner as described in hereof. No transfer of Series J Preferred Units, or other action by the holder or holders of such Units, is permitted, without the consent of the General Partner which consent may be given or withheld in its sole and absolute discretion, if such transfer or other action would result in more than two partners holding all outstanding Series J Preferred Units within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.7704-1(h)(1)(ii) (without regard to Treasury Regulation Section 1.7704-1(h)(3)(ii)); , , that the General Partner's consent may not be unreasonably withheld if (a) such transfer or other action would not result in more than five partners holding all outstanding Series J Preferred Units within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.7704-1(h)(1)(ii) (without regard to Treasury Regulation Section 1.7704-1(h)(3)(ii)) and (b) the General Partner cannot rely on Treasury Regulation Section 1.7704-1(h) to avoid classification of Operating Partnership as a PTP. In addition, no transfer may be made to any person if such transfer would cause the exchange of the Series J Preferred Units for Series J Preferred Shares, as provided herein, to be required to be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or any state securities laws. If (i) the holders of 51% of the Series J Preferred Units conclude based on results or projected results that there exists (in the reasonable judgment of such holders) an imminent and substantial risk that such holder's interest in the Partnership represents or will represent more than 19.5% of the total profits or capital interests in the Partnership for a taxable year (the ""), (ii) such holders deliver to the General Partner an opinion of independent counsel to the effect that there is a substantial risk that such holder's interest in the Partnership represents or will represent more than the 19.5% Limit (determined in accordance with Regulations Section 1.731-2(e)(4)), and (iii) the General Partner agrees with the conclusions referred to in clauses (i) and (ii) of this sentence, such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld, then such holders shall, subject to the above limitations, be permitted to transfer so much of their Series J Preferred Units as may be appropriate to alleviate the risk of not satisfying the 19.5% Limit to the trust described in , with such holders having the rights set forth in such Exhibit.

Furthermore, the Series J Preferred Units, if the holders of 51% of all outstanding Series J Preferred Units so determine, may be exchanged in whole but not in part (regardless of whether held by one or more holders) for Series J Preferred Shares if (1) the holders of 51% of all outstanding Series J Preferred Units conclude based on results or projected results that there exists (in the reasonable judgment of such holder) an imminent and substantial risk that the holder's interest in the Partnership represents or will represent more than the 19.5% Limit, (2) such holders deliver to the General Partner an opinion of independent counsel to the effect that there is a substantial risk that its interest in the Partnership does not or will not satisfy the 19.5% Limit and (3) the General Partner agrees with the conclusions referred to in clauses (1) and (2) of this sentence, such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld; , , that if, as a result of such conclusion, such holders' interest in the Partnership is reduced pursuant to the last sentence of hereof (which procedure shall be available to such holders to the exclusion of the procedure under this sentence for so long as, on a cumulative basis, sales of 10% or fewer of the Series J Preferred Units originally issued by the Partnership would in the opinion of the above-referenced counsel reduce the risk that such holders' interest in the Partnership would not satisfy the 19.5% Limit to less than a substantial risk, and thereafter shall be a permitted alternative to the procedure pursuant to this sentence) or the risk of such holder not satisfying the 19.5% Limit otherwise is reduced below a substantial risk, then an exchange in whole under this sentence shall not be permitted unless and until a change in facts occurs and a further determination by such holders is made under this sentence.

In the event an exchange would result in Excess Units, as a condition to such exchange, each holder of such units agrees to provide representations and covenants reasonably requested by the General Partner relating to (i) the widely held nature of the interests in such holder, sufficient to assure the General Partner that the holder's ownership of stock of the General Partner (without regard to the limits described above) will not cause any individual to own in excess of 9.0% of the stock of the General Partner; and (ii) to the extent such holder can so represent and covenant without obtaining information from its owners, the holder's ownership of tenants of the Partnership and its affiliates. For purposes of determining the number of Excess Units under this , the "Beneficial Ownership Limit" and "Constructive Ownership Limit" set forth in the Series J Articles Supplementary shall be deemed to be 9.0%. To the extent the General Partner would not be able to pay the cash set forth above in exchange for the Excess Units, and to the extent consistent with the Charter, the General Partner agrees that it will grant to the holders of the Series J Preferred Units exceptions to the Beneficial Ownership Limit and Constructive Ownership Limit set forth in the Series J Articles Supplementary sufficient to allow such holders to exchange all of their Series J Preferred Units for Series J Preferred Stock, such holders furnish to the General Partner representations acceptable to the General Partner in its sole and absolute discretion which assure the General Partner that such exceptions will not jeopardize the General Partner's tax status as a REIT for purposes of federal and applicable state law. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, no Series J Limited Partner shall be entitled to effect an exchange of Series J Preferred Units for Series J Preferred Shares to the extent that ownership or right to acquire such shares would cause the Partner or any other Person or, in the opinion of counsel selected by the General Partner, may cause the Partner or any other Person, to violate the restrictions on ownership and transfer of Series J Preferred Shares set forth in the Charter, taking into account any exceptions thereto granted by the Company in accordance with the terms of the Charter.

Transfer Restrictions
          The Series K Preferred Units shall be subject to the provisions of Article 11 hereof; , , that the Series K Preferred Units shall not be subject to the right of first refusal of the General Partner as described in hereof. No transfer of Series K Preferred Units, or other action by the holder or holders of such Units, is permitted, without the consent of the General Partner which consent may be given or withheld in its sole and absolute discretion, if such transfer or other action would result in more than two partners holding all outstanding Series K Preferred Units within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.7704-1(h)(1)(ii) (without regard to Treasury Regulation Section 1.7704-1(h)(3)(ii)); , , that the General Partner's consent may not be unreasonably withheld if (a) such transfer or other action would not result in more than five partners holding all outstanding Series K Preferred Units within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.7704-1(h)(1)(ii) (without regard to Treasury Regulation Section 1.7704-1(h)(3)(ii)) and (b) the General Partner cannot rely on Treasury Regulation Section 1.7704-1(h) to avoid classification of Operating Partnership as a PTP.
