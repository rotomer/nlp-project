     On February 14, 2007, seven subsidiaries of AMB-SGP, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, which is a subsidiary of ours, entered into a loan agreement for a $305 million secured financing. The loan agreement is with The Prudential Insurance Company of America and Prudential Mortgage Capital Company, LLC, as lenders. The loan is secured by more than sixty buildings owned by such subsidiaries of AMB-SGP, L.P. $160 million of the loan will be securitized and sold on the open market, and the remaining portion will be held in the lenders' general accounts. AMB-SGP, L.P. is a guarantor of certain standard recourse carve-outs under the loan agreement.
     On the same day, pursuant to the loan agreement the same seven subsidiaries delivered four promissory notes to the two lenders, each of which matures on March 5, 2012. One note, issued to Prudential Mortgage Capital Company, has a principal of $160 million and an interest rate that is fixed at 5.29%. The three other notes were issued to The Prudential Insurance Company. One is $40 million note with an interest rate of 81 basis points above the one-month LIBOR rate, a second has a principal of $84 million and a fixed interest rate of 5.90%, and the final note has a principal of $21 million and bears interest at a rate of 135 basis points above the one-month LIBOR rate.
     The loan agreement contains affirmative covenants, including financial reporting requirements and maintenance of specified insurance coverage, and negative covenants, including limitations on non-affiliated transfers, mergers and consolidations. In addition, the loan agreement includes events (including, without limitation, a non-payment under the loan, a breach of warranties and representations in any material respect and non-compliance with covenants and cross-defaults), each of which, if not cured within the time period, if any, specified in the loan agreement, would constitute an event of default. Upon the occurrence and continuance of such events of default, the lenders may elect to accelerate the outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest under the loan agreement. Further, outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest thereon automatically accelerate upon the occurrence of certain other events of default, including without limitation and as described more fully in the loan agreement, the commencement of any voluntary or involuntary proceeding seeking liquidation, reorganization or other relief of the debts of AMB-SGP, L.P. or its subsidiaries under any bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law.
     A copy of the loan agreement and the four promissory notes are attached hereto as Exhibits 10.1, 10.2, 10.3, 10.4 and 10.5 respectively and are incorporated into this current report by reference.

     (i) Except as otherwise provided herein, the Balance shall bear interest at the Reference Rate (as defined in Paragraph 11(k) below).
     (ii) In the case of each Interest Period (as defined in Paragraph 11(h) below) after the first Interest Period, Borrower shall be deemed to have selected the Alternate Rate (as defined in Paragraph 11(a) below) under this Note for the entire outstanding principal balance of this Note if for any reason the LIBOR Rate (as defined in Paragraph 11(i) below) shall not be in effect or available to Lender, and interest shall accrue at the Alternate Rate until the next Interest Period for which the LIBOR Rate is in effect or available. To the extent that the Alternate Rate is applicable to this Note, the rate of interest, computed in accordance with Paragraph 11(a) of this Note, shall change effective as of the opening of business on the day on which each such change in such fluctuating rate shall occur. With respect to each Interest Period, interest shall accrue from the first day of such Interest Period through and including the last day of such Interest Period.
     (iii) Provided that no Event of Default has occurred under any of the Documents, and provided further that the LIBOR Rate is available to Lender on the Determination Date (as defined in Paragraph 11(d) hereof) for such Interest Period for an amount equal to the entire Balance, and except as provided in Paragraph 1(a)(ii) above, the Reference Rate shall automatically be the applicable rate for the entire outstanding principal balance of this Note for
 
each Interest Period. If requested by Lender, Borrower shall immediately confirm the Reference Rate and the duration of the applicable Interest Period by acknowledging receipt of a written confirmation of the Reference Rate and Interest Period delivered by Lender to Borrower. Lender shall not be obligated to accept a deposit in the London interbank market in order to charge interest at the Reference Rate.
     (iv) Without limiting the effect of any other provision of this Note, if and to the extent that Lender (or its source of funds) may directly or indirectly be required to maintain reserves against "Eurocurrency liabilities" under Federal Reserve Regulation D (as at any time amended) or any other federal or state law, statute or regulation of similar import (""), Borrower shall pay to Lender on the last day of each and every Interest Period additional interest (as determined by Lender and disclosed to Borrower) for each such Interest Period at an interest rate per annum, at all times during such Interest Period for this Note, equal to the excess of (a) the rate obtained by dividing the LIBOR Rate for such Interest Period by a percentage equal to one hundred percent (100%) the reserve percentage applicable during such Interest Period under regulations issued from time to time by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or under any Other Reserve Laws (or if more than one such percentage is so applicable, the daily average of such percentages for those days in such Interest Period during which any such percentage shall be so applicable) for determining the maximum reserve requirement (including, without limitation, any marginal reserve requirement) for Lender (or its source of funds) in respect of liabilities or assets consisting of or including "Eurocurrency liabilities" under Federal Reserve Regulation D (as at any time amended) or under Other Reserve Laws having a term equal to such Interest Period, over (b) the LIBOR Rate for such Interest Period.

     (x)  taxes (or the withholding of amounts for taxes) assessed against Lender in connection with the Loan, including, without limitation, income, excise and interest equalization taxes (other than United States or state income taxes) as well as all levies, imports, duties, or fees whether now in existence or as the result of a change in, or promulgation of, any treaty, statute or regulation or interpretation thereof, or any directive, guideline or otherwise, by a central bank or fiscal authority or any other entity (whether or not having the force of law) or a change in the basis of, or time of payment of, such taxes and other amounts resulting therefrom;
 
     (y)  without duplicating any item in (iv) above any reserve or special deposit requirements against or with respect to assets or liabilities or deposits outstanding under a LIBOR Rate (including, without limitation, those imposed under the Monetary Control Act of 1978) currently required by, or resulting from a change in, or the promulgation of, such requirements by treaty, statute, regulation, interpretation thereof, or any directive, guidelines, or otherwise by a central bank or fiscal authority (whether or not having the force of law); and
     (z)  any other costs resulting from Lender's compliance in connection with the Loan and relating to and resulting form the Loan with treaties, statutes, or regulations promulgated by or of a central bank or fiscal authority or other entity (and having the force of law).
A certificate as to the amount of any of the foregoing amounts prepared by Lender, signed by an authorized officer of Lender and submitted to Borrower shall be conclusive as to the matters therein set forth, absent manifest error. This Note shall not be deemed to have been paid and/or satisfied in full until all of the foregoing amounts, in addition to the principal balance hereof and all interest thereon and all other sums due and payable hereunder and under the Documents, shall have been paid.

     (b)  Upon an Event of Default, including a breach of Section 2.1 of the Loan Agreement, Lender may declare the Balance, unpaid accrued interest, the Breakage Fee, any applicable Prepayment Premium (defined below), and other amounts due under the terms of this Note, and all other Obligations to be immediately due and payable in full.

Computation of Interest
     (i) Except as otherwise provided herein, the Balance shall bear interest at the Reference Rate (as defined in Paragraph 11(k) below).
     (ii) In the case of each Interest Period (as defined in Paragraph 11(h) below) after the first Interest Period, Borrower shall be deemed to have selected the Alternate Rate (as defined in Paragraph 11(a) below) under this Note for the entire outstanding principal balance of this Note if for any reason the LIBOR Rate (as defined in Paragraph 11(i) below) shall not be in effect or available to Lender, and interest shall accrue at the Alternate Rate until the next Interest Period for which the LIBOR Rate is in effect or available. To the extent that the Alternate Rate is applicable to this Note, the rate of interest, computed in accordance with Paragraph 11(a) of this Note, shall change effective as of the opening of business on the day on which each such change in such fluctuating rate shall occur. With respect to each Interest Period, interest shall accrue from the first day of such Interest Period through and including the last day of such Interest Period.
     (iii) Provided that no Event of Default has occurred under any of the Documents, and provided further that the LIBOR Rate is available to Lender on the Determination Date (as defined in Paragraph 11(d) hereof) for such Interest Period for an amount equal to the entire Balance, and except as provided in Paragraph 1(a)(ii) above, the Reference Rate shall automatically be the applicable rate for the entire outstanding principal balance of this Note for
 
each Interest Period. If requested by Lender, Borrower shall immediately confirm the Reference Rate and the duration of the applicable Interest Period by acknowledging receipt of a written confirmation of the Reference Rate and Interest Period delivered by Lender to Borrower. Lender shall not be obligated to accept a deposit in the London interbank market in order to charge interest at the Reference Rate.
     (iv) Without limiting the effect of any other provision of this Note, if and to the extent that Lender (or its source of funds) may directly or indirectly be required to maintain reserves against "Eurocurrency liabilities" under Federal Reserve Regulation D (as at any time amended) or any other federal or state law, statute or regulation of similar import (""), Borrower shall pay to Lender on the last day of each and every Interest Period additional interest (as determined by Lender and disclosed to Borrower) for each such Interest Period at an interest rate per annum, at all times during such Interest Period for this Note, equal to the excess of (a) the rate obtained by dividing the LIBOR Rate for such Interest Period by a percentage equal to one hundred percent (100%) the reserve percentage applicable during such Interest Period under regulations issued from time to time by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or under any Other Reserve Laws (or if more than one such percentage is so applicable, the daily average of such percentages for those days in such Interest Period during which any such percentage shall be so applicable) for determining the maximum reserve requirement (including, without limitation, any marginal reserve requirement) for Lender (or its source of funds) in respect of liabilities or assets consisting of or including "Eurocurrency liabilities" under Federal Reserve Regulation D (as at any time amended) or under Other Reserve Laws having a term equal to such Interest Period, over (b) the LIBOR Rate for such Interest Period. Terms used in Regulation D shall have the same meanings when used herein. Each such determination made by Lender and each such notification by Lender to Borrower under this subparagraph of the amount of additional interest payable hereunder shall be conclusive as to the matters set forth therein.

     (x)  taxes (or the withholding of amounts for taxes) assessed against Lender in connection with the Loan, including, without limitation, income, excise and interest equalization taxes (other than United States or state income taxes) as well as all levies, imports, duties, or fees whether now in existence or as the result of a change in, or promulgation of, any treaty, statute or regulation or interpretation thereof, or any directive, guideline or otherwise, by a central bank or fiscal authority or any other entity (whether or not having the force of law) or a change in the basis of, or time of payment of, such taxes and other amounts resulting therefrom;
 
     (y)  without duplicating any item in (iv) above any reserve or special deposit requirements against or with respect to assets or liabilities or deposits outstanding under a LIBOR Rate (including, without limitation, those imposed under the Monetary Control Act of 1978) currently required by, or resulting from a change in, or the promulgation of, such requirements by treaty, statute, regulation, interpretation thereof, or any directive, guidelines, or otherwise by a central bank or fiscal authority (whether or not having the force of law); and
     (z)  any other costs resulting from Lender's compliance in connection with the Loan and relating to and resulting form the Loan with treaties, statutes, or regulations promulgated by or of a central bank or fiscal authority or other entity (and having the force of law).
A certificate as to the amount of any of the foregoing amounts prepared by Lender, signed by an authorized officer of Lender and submitted to Borrower shall be conclusive as to the matters therein set forth, absent manifest error. This Note shall not be deemed to have been paid and/or satisfied in full until all of the foregoing amounts, in addition to the principal balance hereof and all interest thereon and all other sums due and payable hereunder and under the Documents, shall have been paid.

The Late Charge shall be secured by the Documents. The imposition of the Late Charge, and/or requirement that interest be paid at the Default Rate (defined below) shall not be construed in any way to (i) excuse Borrower from its obligation to make each payment under this Note promptly when due or (ii) preclude Lender from exercising any rights or remedies available under the Documents upon an Event of Default.
     (b)  Upon an Event of Default, including a breach of Section 2.1 of the Loan Agreement, Lender may declare the Balance, unpaid accrued interest, the Breakage Fee, any applicable Prepayment Premium (defined below), and other amounts due under the terms of this Note, and all other Obligations to be immediately due and payable in full.
