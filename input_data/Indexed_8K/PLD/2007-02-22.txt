Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
     On January 29, 2007, the 7.75% Series D Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units of AMB Property II, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership and our subsidiary, were transferred from one institutional investor to another institutional investor. In connection with that transfer, AMB Property II, L.P. agreed to amend the terms of the Series D Preferred Units to, among other things, change the rate applicable to the Series D Preferred Units from 7.75% to 7.18% and change the date prior to which the Series D Preferred Units may not be redeemed from May 5, 2004 to February 22, 2012. The Fourteenth Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of AMB Property II, L.P., dated February 22, 2007, reflects the amendment and restatement of the Thirteenth Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of AMB Property II, L.P. to effect these changes to the Series D Preferred Units. A copy of the Fourteenth Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of AMB Property II, L.P., dated February 22, 2007 is attached to this report as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated by reference in this report.
     On February 16, 2007, we amended and restated our bylaws to, among other things, remove the terms providing for a plurality vote as the standard in the election of directors in uncontested elections and to provide instead for the election of directors by a majority vote in uncontested elections. A copy of the amended and restated bylaws is attached to this report as Exhibit 3.2 and incorporated by reference in this report.
     On February 22, 2007, in connection with the transfer of the 7.75% Series D Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units of AMB Property II, L.P. described above, we filed with the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland Articles Supplementary Reestablishing and Refixing the Rights and Preferences of the 7.75% Series D Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock as 7.18% Series D Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, a copy of which is attached to this report as Exhibit 3.1 and is incorporated by reference in this report. We amended the terms of the Series D Preferred Stock to, among other things, reflect the change in the rate applicable to Series D Preferred Stock from 7.75% to 7.18 % and the change in the date prior to which Series D Preferred Stock may not be redeemed from May 5, 2004 to February 22, 2012.
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits.
     The following exhibits are filed as part of this report:
 
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

 
Exhibit 3.1
     AMB Property Corporation, a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of Maryland (the "Corporation"), certifies to the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland (the "Department") that:
     FIRST: Pursuant to the authority expressly vested in the Board of Directors of the Corporation (the "Board") by Article IV of the Charter of the Corporation, and pursuant to Section 2-105 of the Maryland General Corporation Law, the Board, or a duly authorized committee thereof, adopted resolutions on March 5, 1999 and on May 5, 1999, and caused to be filed with the Department on May 5, 1999, Articles Supplementary (the "Original Series D Articles Supplementary") classifying and designating as a separate class of Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Preferred Stock"), shares of 7.75% Series D Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, and establishing 1,595,337 as the number of shares to be so classified and designated (such shares, the "Original Series D Preferred Shares").
     SECOND: No Original Series D Preferred Shares are issued or outstanding.
     THIRD: Pursuant to the authority expressly vested in the Board as aforesaid, the Board adopted resolutions on December 7, 2006, authorizing the Corporation, among other things, to issue up to a stated maximum number of shares of Preferred Stock of the Corporation, having a stated maximum aggregate liquidation preference and dividend rate and certain other stated terms applicable to the issuance thereof, and appointing, pursuant to the MGCL and the powers contained in the Bylaws of the Corporation, a committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors comprised of Hamid R. Moghadam and delegating to the Committee to the fullest extent permitted by Maryland law and the Charter and Bylaws of the Corporation, all powers of the Board of Directors with respect to classifying, authorizing, approving, ratifying and confirming the terms of the Preferred Stock to be issued, including, without limitation, the preferences, conversion and other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends and other distributions, qualifications and terms and conditions of redemption, and determining the consideration per share to be received in respect of the issuance and sale of each share of Preferred Stock to be issued and sold, and the number of shares of Preferred Stock to be so classified or reclassified and issued by the Corporation, subject to the limitations set forth in the resolutions of the Board of Directors adopted on December 7, 2006.
 
     FOURTH: Pursuant to the authority conferred upon the Committee as aforesaid, the Committee has, on January 29, 2007, adopted resolutions reclassifying the shares of Preferred Stock previously classified to be and become the Original Series D Preferred Shares, and redesignating the Original Series D Preferred Shares, again as a separate class of Preferred Stock, as the "7.18% Series D Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock", par value $0.01 per share, with the preferences, conversions and other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends and other distributions, qualifications and terms and conditions of redemption and other terms and conditions of such 7.18% Series D Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (within the limitations set by the Board of Directors in the resolutions adopted on December 7, 2006 and referred to in Article THIRD of these Articles Supplementary) and establishing or confirming 1,595,337 as the number of shares of Original Series D preferred Stock to be so reclassified and redesignated, and authorizing the issuance thereof.
     FIFTH: The separate class of Preferred Stock of the Corporation created by the resolutions duly adopted by the Board of Directors of the Corporation and by the Committee and referred to in Article FOURTH of these Articles Supplementary, shall have the designation, number of shares, preferences, conversion and other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends, qualifications, terms and conditions of redemption and other terms and conditions as follows (and which, upon any restatement of the Charter, may be made a part of Article IV thereof, with any necessary or appropriate changes to the numeration or lettering of the sections or subsections hereof):
     (1) . A class of Preferred Stock, designated the "7.18% Series D Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock" (the "Series D Preferred Stock"), is hereby established. The number of shares of Series D Preferred Stock shall be 1,595,337 (the "Series D Preferred Shares").
Designation and Number
     (2) . The Series D Preferred Shares will rank, with respect to dividend rights and rights upon voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, (a) senior to all classes or series of Common Stock (as defined in the Charter) and to all equity securities of the Corporation the terms of which provide that such equity securities shall rank junior to such Series D Preferred Shares; (b) on a parity with all equity securities issued by the Corporation other than those referred to in clauses (a) and (c); and (c) junior to all equity securities issued by the Corporation which rank senior to the Series D Preferred Shares in accordance with Section 6(d) of this Article FIFTHThe term "equity securities" does not include convertible debt securities, until the same are converted into equity securities.
Rank

     (3) .
Dividends
     (a) Holders of Series D Preferred Shares shall be entitled to receive, if, when and as authorized by the Board, out of funds legally available for the payment of dividends, cumulative preferential cash dividends at the rate of 7.18% of the $50.00 liquidation preference per annum (equivalent to $3.59 per annum per share). Such dividends shall accumulate on a daily basis computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months and be cumulative, shall accrue from the original date of issuance and shall be payable quarterly (such quarterly periods for purposes of payment and accrual will be the quarterly periods ending on the dates specified in this sentence and not calendar year quarters) in equal amounts in arrears on the
 
15th day of each January, April, July and October, or, if not a business day, the next succeeding business day (each a "Dividend Payment Date"). Dividends shall be payable to holders of record as they appear in the share records of the Corporation at the close of business on the applicable record date (each, a "Dividend Record Date"), which shall be the date designated by the Board for the payment of dividends that is not more than 30 nor less than 10 days prior to the applicable payment date therefor. Any dividend payable on the Series D Preferred Shares for any partial dividend period shall be prorated and computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. If any date on which distributions are to be made on the Series D Preferred Stock is not a Business Day (as defined herein), then payment of the distribution to be made on such date will be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay) except that, if such Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar year, such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day, in each case with the same force and effect as if made on such date. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained herein, each outstanding share of Series D Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, and shall receive, a dividend with respect to any Dividend Record Date equal to the dividend paid with respect to each other share of Series D Preferred Stock which is outstanding on such date which shall be equal to the greatest dividend per share payable on any such share on such date. In addition, notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, each share of Series D Preferred Stock shall also continue to accrue all accrued and unpaid distributions up to the exchange date on any Series D Preferred Unit (as defined in the Fourteenth Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of AMB Property II, L.P., dated as of February 22, 2007, as amended and supplemented from time to time (the "Subsidiary Partnership Agreement")) validly exchanged into such share of Series D Preferred Stock in accordance with the provisions of the Subsidiary Partnership Agreement.
     (b) No dividend on the Series D Preferred Shares shall be authorized by the Board or be paid or set apart for payment by the Corporation at such time as the terms and provisions of any agreement of the Corporation, including any agreement relating to its indebtedness, prohibits such authorization, payment or setting apart for payment or provides that such authorization, payment or setting apart for payment would constitute a breach thereof, or a default thereunder, or if such authorization or payment shall be restricted or prohibited by law.
     (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, dividends on the Series D Preferred Shares shall accumulate whether or not restrictions exist in respect thereof, whether or not there are funds legally available for the payment thereof and whether or not such dividends are declared or authorized. Accrued but unpaid dividends on the Series D Preferred Shares will accumulate as of the Dividend Payment Date on which they first become payable or on the date of redemption, as the case may be.
     (d) If any Series D Preferred Shares are outstanding, no full dividends will be declared or paid or set apart for payment on any other equity securities of the Corporation of any other class or series ranking, as to distributions or upon voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, junior to or on a parity with the Series D Preferred Shares unless full cumulative dividends have been or contemporaneously are declared and paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof irrevocably set apart in trust for such payment on the Series D Preferred Shares for all dividend periods. When dividends are not paid in full (or a sum sufficient for such full payment is not so set apart) upon the Series D Preferred
 
Shares and any other equity securities ranking as to distributions on a parity with the Series D Preferred Shares all dividends declared upon the Series D Preferred Shares and any other equity securities of the Corporation ranking on a parity with the Series D Preferred Stock as to distributions and upon voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation shall be declared pro rata so that the amount of dividends declared per Series D Preferred Share and each such other equity securities shall in all cases bear to each other the same ratio that accumulated dividends per Series D Preferred Share and such other equity securities (which shall not include any accumulation in respect of unpaid dividends for prior dividend periods if such other equity securities do not have a cumulative dividend) bear to each other. No interest, or sum of money in lieu of interest, shall be payable in respect of any dividend payment or payments on Series D Preferred Shares which may be in arrears.
     (e) Except as provided in the immediately preceding paragraph, unless full cumulative dividends on the Series D Preferred Shares have been or contemporaneously are declared and paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof is irrevocably set apart in trust for payment for all dividend periods, no dividends (other than in Common Stock or other equity securities of the Corporation ranking junior to the Series D Preferred Shares as to distributions and upon voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution and winding up of the Corporation) shall be declared or paid or set aside for payment nor shall any other dividend be declared or made upon the Common Stock or any other equity securities of the Corporation ranking as to distributions or upon voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation junior to or on a parity with the Series D Preferred Stock nor shall any Common Stock or any other equity securities of the Corporation ranking junior to or on a parity with the Series D Preferred Stock as to distributions or upon voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation be redeemed, purchased or otherwise acquired for any consideration (or any monies be paid to or made available for a sinking fund for the redemption of any such securities) by the Corporation (except by conversion into or exchange for other equity securities of the Corporation ranking junior to the Series D Preferred Stock as to distributions and upon voluntary and involuntary liquidation, dissolution and winding up of the Corporation, and except pursuant to Section 7 of this Article FIFTH to ensure the Corporation's continued status as a real estate investment trust (a "REIT") for Federal income tax purposes or comparable Charter provisions with respect to other classes or series of the Corporation's stock).
     (f) Accumulated but unpaid dividends on the Series D Preferred Shares will not bear interest and holders of Series D Preferred Shares shall not be entitled to any dividend in excess of full cumulative dividends as described above. Any dividend payment made on the Series D Preferred Shares shall first be credited against the earliest accumulated but unpaid dividend due with respect to such shares which remains payable.
     (g) If, for any taxable year, the Corporation elects to designate as a "capital gain dividend" (as defined in Section 857 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code")), any portion (the "Capital Gains Amount") of the dividends paid or made available for the year to holders of every class or series of stock of the Corporation, the portion of the Capital Gains Amount that shall be allocable to holders of the Series D Preferred Stock shall be the amount that the total dividends (as determined for Federal income tax purposes) paid or made available to the holders of the Series D Preferred Stock for the year bears to the aggregate amount of dividends (as determined for Federal income tax purposes) paid or made available to
 
the holders of all classes or series of stock of the Corporation for such year.
     (4) 
Liquidation Preference.
     (a) In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, the holders of Series D Preferred Shares then outstanding shall be entitled to receive out of the assets of the Corporation legally available for distribution to its stockholders remaining after payment or provision for payment of all debts and liabilities of the Corporation, a liquidation preference in cash of $50.00 per share, plus an amount equal to any accumulated or accrued and unpaid dividends to the date of such payment, before any distribution of assets is made to holders of Common Stock or any other equity securities of the Corporation that rank junior to the Series D Preferred Shares as to liquidation rights.
     (b) If, upon any such voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, the assets of the Corporation are insufficient to make full payment to holders of Series D Preferred Shares and the corresponding amounts payable on all shares of other classes or series of equity securities of the Corporation ranking on a parity with the Series D Preferred Shares as to liquidation rights then the holders of the Series D Preferred Shares and all other such classes or series of equity securities shall share ratably in any such distribution of assets in proportion to the full liquidating distributions to which they would otherwise be respectively entitled.
     (c) Written notice of any such liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, stating the payment date or dates when, and the place or places where, the amounts distributable in such circumstances shall be payable, shall be given by first class mail, postage pre-paid, not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the payment date stated therein, to each record holder of the Series D Preferred Shares at the respective addresses of such holders as the same shall appear on the stock transfer records of the Corporation.
     (d) After payment of the full amount of the liquidating distributions to which they are entitled, the holders of Series D Preferred Shares will have no right or claim to any of the remaining assets of the Corporation.
     (e) The consolidation or merger of the Corporation with or into any other entity, a merger of another entity with or into the Corporation, a statutory share exchange by the Corporation or a sale, lease, transfer or conveyance of all or substantially all of the property or business of the Corporation shall not be deemed to constitute a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation.
     (f) In determining whether a distribution (other than upon voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation) by dividend, redemption or other acquisition of shares of stock of the Corporation or otherwise is permitted under the MGCL, no effect shall be given to amounts that would be needed, if the Corporation were to be dissolved at the time of the distribution, to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution of holders of the Series D Preferred Shares whose preferential rights upon dissolution are superior to those receiving the distribution.
 
     (5) 
Optional Redemption.
     (a) The Series D Preferred Shares are not redeemable prior to February 22, 2012. To ensure that the Corporation remains a qualified REIT for Federal income tax purposes, however, the Series D Preferred Shares shall be subject to the provisions of Section 7 of this Article FIFTH pursuant to which Series D Preferred Shares owned by a stockholder in excess of the Ownership Limit (as defined in Section 7 of this Article FIFTH) or certain other limitations shall automatically be transferred to a Trust for the benefit of a Charitable Beneficiary (as defined in Section 7 of this Article FIFTH) and the Corporation shall have the right to purchase such shares, as provided in Section 7 of this Article FIFTH. On and after February 22, 2012, the Corporation, at its option, upon giving notice as provided below, may redeem the Series D Preferred Shares, in whole or from time to time in part, for cash, at a redemption price of $50.00 per share, plus all accumulated and unpaid dividends on such Series D Preferred Shares to the date fixed for redemption.
     (b) [Intentionally Deleted]
     (c) If fewer than all of the outstanding Series D Preferred Shares are to be redeemed, the shares to be redeemed shall be selected pro rata (as nearly as practicable without creating fractional shares).
     (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, unless full cumulative dividends on all Series D Preferred Shares shall have been or contemporaneously are declared and paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set apart for payment for all past dividend periods and the then current dividend period, no Series D Preferred Shares shall be redeemed unless all outstanding Series D Preferred Shares are simultaneously redeemed; , , that the foregoing shall not prevent the purchase by the Corporation of Series D Preferred Shares pursuant to Section 7 of this Article FIFTH or otherwise in order to ensure that the Corporation remains qualified as a REIT for Federal or state income tax purposes or the purchase or acquisition of Series D Preferred Shares pursuant to a purchase or exchange offer made on the same terms to holders of all outstanding Series D Preferred Shares. In addition, unless full cumulative dividends on all outstanding Series D Preferred Shares have been or contemporaneously are declared and paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof irrevocably set apart in trust for payment for all dividend periods, the Corporation shall not purchase or otherwise acquire directly or indirectly any Series D Preferred Shares or any equity securities of the Corporation ranking junior to or on a parity with the Series D Preferred Shares as to dividends or upon voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation (except by conversion into or exchange for equity securities of the Corporation ranking junior to the Series D Preferred Shares as to dividends and upon voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation and except pursuant to Section 7 of this Article FIFTH or comparable Charter provisions with respect to other classes or series of the Corporation's stock).
provided
however
     (e) The holders of shares of Series D Preferred Stock at the close of business on a Dividend Record Date will be entitled to receive the dividend payable with respect to the shares of Series D Preferred Stock held on the corresponding Dividend Payment Date notwithstanding the redemption thereof between such Dividend Record Date and the corresponding Dividend
 
Payment Date or the Corporation's default in the payment of the dividend due. Except as provided herein, the Corporation will make no payment or allowance for unpaid dividends, whether or not in arrears, on Series D Preferred Shares to be redeemed.
     (f) The following provisions set forth the procedures for Redemption:
          (i) Notice of redemption will be given by publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the City of New York, such publication to be made once a week for two successive weeks commencing not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the redemption date. A similar notice will be (i) faxed and (ii) mailed by the Corporation, postage prepaid, not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the redemption date, addressed to the respective holders of record of the Series D Preferred Shares to be redeemed at their respective addresses as they appear on the share records of the Corporation. No failure to give such notice or any defect therein or in the mailing thereof shall affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any Series D Preferred Shares except as to the holder to whom notice was defective or not given.
          (ii) In addition to any information required by law or by the applicable rules of any exchange upon which the Series D Preferred Shares may be listed or admitted to trading, such notice shall state: (A) the redemption date; (B) the redemption price; (C) the number of Series D Preferred Shares to be redeemed; (D) the place or places where the certificates evidencing shares of Series D Preferred Shares are to be surrendered for payment of the redemption price; and (E) that dividends on the Series D Preferred Shares to be redeemed will cease to accumulate on such redemption date. If fewer than all of the Series D Preferred Shares held by any holder are to be redeemed, the notice mailed to such holder shall also specify the number of Series D Preferred Shares to be redeemed from such holder.
          (iii) On or after the redemption date, each holder of Series D Preferred Shares to be redeemed shall present and surrender the certificates representing such holder's Series D Preferred Shares to the Corporation at the place designated in the notice of redemption and shall be entitled to the redemption price and any accrued or accumulated and unpaid dividends payable upon such redemption upon such surrender and thereupon the redemption price of such shares (including all accumulated and unpaid dividends up to the redemption date) shall be paid to or on the order of the person whose name appears on such certificate representing Series D Preferred Shares as the owner thereof and each surrendered certificate shall be canceled. If fewer than all the shares represented by any such certificate representing Series D Preferred Shares are to be redeemed, a new certificate shall be issued representing the unredeemed shares.
          (iv) If notice of redemption of any Series D Preferred Shares has been given and if the funds necessary for such redemption have been irrevocably set aside by the Corporation in trust for the benefit of the holders thereof, then from and after the redemption date all dividends on such Series D Preferred Shares shall cease to accumulate and any such Series D Preferred Shares will no longer be deemed outstanding and all rights of the holders thereof will terminate, except the right to receive the redemption price (including all accrued or accumulated and unpaid dividends up to the redemption date) and such shares shall not thereafter be transferred (except with the consent of the Corporation) on the Corporation's stock transfer records. At its election, the Corporation, prior to a redemption date, may irrevocably deposit the redemption price (including accumulated and unpaid dividends to the redemption date) of the
 
Series D Preferred Shares so called for redemption in trust for the holders thereof with a bank or trust company, in which case the redemption notice to holders of the Series D Preferred Shares to be redeemed shall (A) state the date of such deposit, (B) specify the office of such bank or trust company as the place of payment of the redemption price and (C) require such holders to surrender the certificates representing such shares at such place on or about the date fixed in such redemption notice (which may not be later than the redemption date) against payment of the redemption price (including all accrued or accumulated and unpaid dividends to the redemption date). Any monies so deposited which remain unclaimed by the holders of the Series D Preferred Shares at the end of two years after the redemption date shall be returned by such bank or trust company to the Corporation.
     (g) Any Series D Preferred Shares that shall at any time have been redeemed shall, after such redemption, have the status of authorized but unissued Preferred Stock, without further designation as to series or class until such shares are once more designated as part of a particular series or class by the Board.
     (6) 
Voting Rights.
     (a) Holders of the Series D Preferred Shares will not have any voting rights, except as set forth below.
     (b) (i) Whenever dividends on any Series D Preferred Shares shall remain unpaid for six or more quarterly periods (whether or not consecutive) (a "Preferred Dividend Default"), the holders of such Series D Preferred Shares (voting as a single class with all other equity securities of the Corporation ranking on a parity with the Series D Preferred Shares as to dividends and upon voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable, ("Parity Preferred Stock")) will be entitled to vote for the election of two additional directors of the Corporation (the "Preferred Stock Directors"), who will be elected by a plurality of the votes cast in such election for a one-year term and until their successors are duly elected and shall qualify (or until such director's right to hold such office terminates as provided herein, whichever occurs earlier, subject to such director's earlier death, disqualification, resignation or removal), at a special meeting called by the holders of at least 20% of the outstanding Series D Preferred Shares or the holders of shares of any other class or series of Parity Preferred Stock with respect to which dividends are so unpaid (unless such request is received less than 90 days before the date fixed for the next annual or special meeting of stockholders) or, if the request for a special meeting is received by the Corporation less than 90 days before the date fixed for the next annual or special meeting of stockholders, at the next annual or special meeting of stockholders, and at each subsequent annual meeting until all dividends accumulated on the Series D Preferred Shares for all past dividend periods and the dividend for the then current dividend period shall have been fully paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof irrevocably set aside in trust for payment in full.
     (ii) At any time when the voting rights described in Section 6(b)(i) above shall have vested, a proper officer of the Corporation shall call or cause to be called, a special meeting of the holders of Series D Preferred Stock and all the series of Parity Preferred Stock upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable (collectively, the "Parity Securities")
 
by mailing or causing to be mailed to such holders a notice of such special meeting to be held not less than ten and not more than 45 days after the date such notice is given. The record date for determining holders of the Parity Securities entitled to notice of and to vote at such special meeting will be the close of business on the third business day preceding the day on which such notice is mailed. At any such special meeting, all of the holders of the Parity Securities, by plurality vote, voting together as a single class without regard to series will be entitled to elect two directors on the basis of one vote per $25.00 of liquidation preference to which such Parity Securities are entitled by their terms (excluding amounts in respect of accumulated and unpaid dividends) and not cumulatively. Notice of all meetings at which holders of the Series D Preferred Shares shall be entitled to vote will be given to such holders at their addresses as they appear in the transfer records. If a Preferred Dividend Default shall terminate after the notice of a special meeting has been given but before such special meeting has been held, the Corporation shall, as soon as practicable after such termination, mail or cause to be mailed notice of such termination to holders of the Series D Preferred Shares that would have been entitled to vote at such special meeting.
     (c) If and when all accumulated dividends and the dividend for the then current dividend period on the Series D Preferred Shares shall have been paid in full or declared by the Corporation and irrevocably set aside in trust for payment in full, the holders of Series D Preferred Shares shall be divested of the voting rights set forth in Section 6(b) of this Article FIFTH (subject to revesting in the event of each and every Preferred Dividend Default) and, if all accumulated dividends have been paid in full or declared by the Corporation and irrevocably set aside in trust for payment in full on all other classes or series of Parity Preferred Stock upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable, the term of office of each Preferred Stock Director so elected shall forthwith terminate.

Such transfer to the Trustee shall be deemed to be effective as of the close of business on the business day prior to the purported Transfer or other event that results in a transfer to the Trust pursuant to Section 7(b)(ii). The Trustee shall be appointed by the Corporation and shall be a Person unaffiliated with the Corporation, any Purported Beneficial Transferee, or any Purported Record Transferee. Each Charitable Beneficiary shall be designated by the Corporation as provided in Section 7(c)(vi) of these Articles Supplementary.

Upon such sale, the interest of the Charitable Beneficiary in the shares of Series D Preferred Stock sold shall terminate and the Trustee shall distribute the net proceeds of the sale to the Purported Record Transferee and to the Charitable Beneficiary as provided in this Section 7(c)(iv). The Purported Record Transferee shall receive the lesser of (1) the price paid by the Purported Record Transferee for the shares of Series D Preferred Stock in the transaction that resulted in such transfer to the Trust (or, if the event which resulted in the transfer to the Trust did not involve a purchase of such shares of Series D Preferred Stock at Market Price, the Market Price of such shares of Series D Preferred Stock on the day of the event which resulted in the transfer of such shares of Series D Preferred Stock to the Trust) and (2) the price per share received by the Trustee (net of any commissions and other expenses of sale) from the sale or other disposition of the shares of Series D Preferred Stock held in the Trust. Any net sales proceeds in excess of the amount payable to the Purported Record Transferee shall be immediately paid to the Charitable Beneficiary together with any dividends or other distributions thereon. If, prior to the discovery by the Corporation that shares of such Series D Preferred Stock have been transferred to the Trustee, such shares of Series D Preferred Stock are sold by a Purported Record Transferee then (i) such shares of Series D Preferred Stock shall be deemed to have been sold on behalf of the Trust and (ii) to the extent that the Purported Record Transferee received an amount for such shares of Series D Preferred Stock that exceeds the amount that such Purported Record Transferee was entitled to receive pursuant to this Section 7(c)(iv), such excess shall be paid to the Trustee upon demand.
          (v) Series D Preferred Stock transferred to the Trustee shall be deemed to have been offered for sale to the Corporation, or its designee, at a price per share equal to the lesser of (i) the price paid by the Purported Record Transferee for the shares of Series D Preferred Stock in the transaction that resulted in such transfer to the Trust (or, if the event which resulted in the transfer to the Trust did not involve a purchase of such shares of Series D Preferred Stock at Market Price, the Market Price of such shares of Series D Preferred Stock on the day of the event which resulted in the transfer of such shares of Series D Preferred Stock to the Trust) and (ii) the Market Price on the date the Corporation, or its designee, accepts such offer. The Corporation shall have the right to accept such offer until the Trustee has sold the shares of Series D Preferred Stock held in the Trust pursuant to Section 7(c)(iv). Upon such a sale to the Corporation, the interest of the Charitable Beneficiary in the shares of Series D Preferred Stock sold shall terminate and the Trustee shall distribute the net proceeds of the sale to the Purported Record Transferee and any dividends or other distributions held by the Trustee with respect to such Series D Preferred Stock shall thereupon be paid to the Charitable Beneficiary.
 
          (vi) By written notice to the Trustee, the Corporation shall designate one or more nonprofit organizations to be the Charitable Beneficiary of the interest in the Trust such that the Series D Preferred Stock held in the Trust would not violate the restrictions set forth in Section 7(b)(i) in the hands of such Charitable Beneficiary.
     (d) . If the Board of Directors or a committee thereof or other designees if permitted by the MGCL shall at any time determine in good faith that a Transfer or other event has taken place in violation of Section 7(b) of these Articles Supplementary or that a Person intends to acquire, has attempted to acquire or may acquire beneficial ownership (determined without reference to any rules of attribution), Beneficial Ownership or Constructive Ownership of any shares of Series D Preferred Stock of the Corporation in violation of Section 7(b) of these Articles Supplementary, the Board of Directors or a committee thereof or other designees if permitted by the MGCL shall take such action as it deems advisable to refuse to give effect or to prevent such Transfer, including, but not limited to, causing the Corporation to redeem shares of Series D Preferred Stock, refusing to give effect to such Transfer on the books of the Corporation or instituting proceedings to enjoin such Transfer; that any Transfers (or, in the case of events other than a Transfer, ownership or Constructive Ownership or Beneficial Ownership) in violation of Section 7(b)(i) of these Articles Supplementary, shall automatically result in the transfer to a Trust as described in Section 7(b)(ii) and any Transfer in violation of Section 7(b)(iii) shall automatically be void irrespective of any action (or non-action) by the Board of Directors.
Remedies For Breach
provided, however,
ab initio
     (e) . Any Person who acquires or attempts to acquire shares of Series D Preferred Stock in violation of Section 7(b) of these Articles Supplementary, or any Person who is a Purported Beneficial Transferee such that an automatic transfer to a Trust results under Section 7(b)(ii) of these Articles Supplementary, shall immediately give written notice to the Corporation of such event and shall provide to the Corporation such other information as the Corporation may request in order to determine the effect, if any, of such Transfer or attempted Transfer on the Corporation's status as a REIT.
Notice of Restricted Transfer
     (f) . Prior to the Restriction Termination Date each Person who is a beneficial owner or Beneficial Owner or Constructive Owner of Series D Preferred Stock and each Person (including the shareholder of record) who is holding Series D Preferred Stock for a beneficial owner or Beneficial Owner or Constructive Owner shall provide to the Corporation such information that the Corporation may request, in good faith, in order to determine the Corporation's status as a REIT.
Owners Required To Provide Information
     (g) . Nothing contained in these Articles Supplementary (but subject to Section 7(n) of these Articles Supplementary) shall limit the authority of the Board of Directors to take such other action as it deems necessary or advisable to protect the Corporation and the interests of its shareholders by preservation of the Corporation's status as a REIT.
Remedies Not Limited
     (h) . In the case of an ambiguity in the application of any of the provisions of this Section 7 of these Articles Supplementary, including any definition contained in Section 7(a), the Board of Directors shall have the power to determine the application of the provisions of this Section 7 with respect to any situation based on the facts known to it (subject, however, to the provisions of Section 7(n) of these Articles Supplementary). In the event Section 7 requires
Ambiguity
 
an action by the Board of Directors and these Articles Supplementary fail to provide specific guidance with respect to such action, the Board of Directors shall have the power to determine the action to be taken so long as such action is not contrary to the provisions of Section 7. Absent a decision to the contrary by the Board of Directors (which the Board may make in its sole and absolute discretion), if a Person would have (but for the remedies set forth in Section 7(b)) acquired Beneficial or Constructive Ownership of Series D Preferred Stock in violation of Section 7(b)(i), such remedies (as applicable) shall apply first to the shares of Series D Preferred Stock which, but for such remedies, would have been actually owned by such Person, and second to shares of Series D Preferred Stock which, but for such remedies, would have been Beneficially Owned or Constructively Owned (but not actually owned) by such Person, pro rata among the Persons who actually own such shares of Series D Preferred Stock based upon the relative number of the shares of Series D Preferred Stock held by each such Person.

          (ii) Subject to Section 7(b)(i)(C), the Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, may exempt a Person from the limitation on a Person Constructively Owning Series D Preferred Stock in violation of Section 7(b)(i)(B), if the Corporation obtains such representations and undertakings from such Person as are reasonably necessary in the opinion of the Board of Directors to ascertain that such Person does not and will not own, actually or Constructively, an interest in a tenant of the Corporation (or a tenant of any entity owned in whole or in part by the Corporation) that would cause the Corporation to own, actually or Constructively, more than a 9.8% interest (as set forth in Section 856(d)(2)(B) of the Code) in such tenant and that any violation or attempted violation will result in such Series D Preferred Stock being transferred to a Trust in accordance with Section 7(b)(ii) of these Articles Supplementary. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the inability of a Person to make the certification described in this Section 7()(ii) shall not prevent the Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, from exempting such Person from the limitation on a Person Constructively Owning Series D Preferred Stock in violation of Section 7(b)(i)(B) if the Board of Directors determines that the resulting application of Section 856(d)(2)(B) of the Code would affect the characterization of less than 0.5% of the gross income (as such term is used in Section 856(c)(2) of the Code) of the Corporation in any taxable year, after taking into account the effect of this sentence with respect to all other capital stock of the Corporation to which this sentence applies.

Exhibit 3.2
     Section 1. The principal executive office of AMB Property Corporation, a Maryland corporation (the "Corporation"), shall be located at such place or places as the board of directors may designate.
     Section 2. The Corporation may also have offices at such other places as the board of directors may from time to time determine or the business of the Corporation may require.
     Section 1. All meetings of the stockholders shall be held in the City of San Francisco, State of California, at such place as may be fixed from time to time by the board of directors, or at such other place as shall be designated from time to time by the board of directors and stated in the notice of the meeting.
     Section 2. An annual meeting of stockholders shall be held during the month of May in each year, on the date and at the time during such month as may be determined from time to time by resolution adopted by the board of directors, at which the stockholders shall elect a board of directors, and transact such other business as may properly be brought before the meeting in accordance with these bylaws. To be properly brought before the annual meeting, business must be either (i) specified in the notice of annual meeting (or any supplement or amendment thereto) given by or at the direction of the board of directors, (ii) otherwise brought before the annual meeting by or at the direction of the board of directors, or (iii) otherwise brought before the annual meeting by a stockholder. In addition to any other applicable requirements, for business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder, the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the secretary of the Corporation. To be timely, a stockholder's notice must be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the Corporation, not less than fifty (50) days nor more than seventy-five (75) days prior to the meeting; provided, however, that in the event that less than sixty-five (65) days' notice or prior public disclosure of the date of the annual meeting is given or made to stockholders, notice by a stockholder to be timely must be so received not later than the close of business on the fifteenth (15th) day following the day on which such notice of the date of the annual meeting was mailed or such public disclosure was made, whichever first occurs. A stockholder's notice to the secretary shall set forth (a) as to each matter the stockholder proposes to bring before the annual meeting (i) a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the annual meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the annual meeting, (ii) the name and record address of the stockholder proposing such business, (iii) the class, series and number of shares of capital stock of the Corporation which are beneficially owned by the stockholder, and (iv) any material interest of the stockholder in such business, and (b) as to the stockholder giving the notice (i) the name and record address of the stockholder and (ii) the class, series and number of shares of capital stock of the Corporation which are beneficially
 
owned by the stockholder. Notwithstanding anything in these bylaws to the contrary, no business shall be conducted at the annual meeting except in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Article II, Section 2. The officer of the Corporation presiding at an annual meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine that business was not properly brought before the annual meeting in accordance with the provisions of this Article II, Section 2, and if he should so determine, he shall so declare to the annual meeting and any such business not properly brought before the meeting shall not be transacted.
     Section 3. A majority of the stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders, the holders of which are present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business except as otherwise provided by law, by the Corporation's charter or by these bylaws. A quorum, once established, shall not be broken by the withdrawal of enough votes to leave less than a quorum and the votes present may continue to transact business until adjournment. If, however, such quorum shall not be present or represented at any meeting of the stockholders, a majority of the voting stock represented in person or by proxy may adjourn the meeting from time to time until a date not more than 120 days after the original record date, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum shall be present or represented. At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present or represented, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally notified. If the adjournment is for more than 120 days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote thereat.
     Section 4. When a quorum is present at any meeting, the vote of the holders of a majority of the stock having voting power present in person or represented by proxy shall decide any question brought before such meeting, unless the question is one upon which, by express provision of the Maryland General Corporation Law ("MGCL") or the rules of any securities exchange on which the Corporation's capital stock is listed or the Corporation's charter or these bylaws, a different vote is required, in which case such express provision shall govern and control the decision of such question.
     Section 5. At each meeting of the stockholders, each stockholder having the right to vote may vote in person or may authorize another person or persons to act for him by proxy in any manner permitted by applicable law. All proxies must be filed with the secretary of the Corporation at the beginning of each meeting in order to be counted in any vote at the meeting. Subject to the provisions of the charter of the Corporation, each stockholder shall have one vote for each share of stock having voting power registered in his name on the books of the Corporation on the record date set by the board of directors as provided in Article V, Section 6 hereof.
     Section 6.
     a. Subject to clause (d) below of this Section 6, a favorable vote of a majority of the aggregate of (x) the votes cast "for" a director nominee and (y) the votes cast "against" a director nominee (or if directors are to be elected upon a favorable vote of a majority of the votes cast but in such circumstances stockholders generally are not offered the opportunity to cast a vote "against" a director nominee but instead are offered the opportunity to "withhold" votes, any
 
votes designated to be "withheld" from voting in respect of a director nominee, which for these limited purposes will be deemed a vote cast and have the affect of a vote "against"), at a meeting of the stockholders duly called and held at which a quorum is present, shall be required to elect such director nominee. For purposes of determining whether a director nominee has received a favorable vote of a majority of the aggregate of the votes cast, a majority of the aggregate votes cast means that the number of shares voted "for" a director must exceed the number of votes cast "against" that director (or, if the director is nevertheless to be elected upon a favorable vote of a majority of the votes cast but stockholders generally are not offered the opportunity to cast a vote "against" the director nominee but instead are offered the opportunity to "withhold" votes, then the number of shares voted "for" a director must exceed the number of votes "withheld" from voting in respect of such director nominee, which for these limited purposes will be deemed a vote cast). A vote will be considered withheld from a director nominee only if a stockholder is provided the opportunity to and does affirmatively withhold authority to vote for such director nominee in any proxy granted by such stockholder, in any event in accordance with instructions contained in the proxy statement or accompanying proxy card circulated for the meeting of stockholders at which the election of directors is to be held or in a ballot to be submitted by such stockholder in person at such meeting. A "broker non-vote" or abstention (or similar expression) shall not in any event be deemed a vote cast for these purposes.
     b. If an otherwise incumbent director is not re-elected but would nevertheless for any reason otherwise remain in office, the director shall tender his or her resignation to the Board, subject to subsequent acceptance. The Nominating & Governance Committee will make a recommendation to the Board on whether to accept or reject the resignation, or whether other action should be taken. The Board will act on the Committee's recommendation and publicly disclose its decision and the rationale behind it within 90 days from the date of the certification of the election results. The director who tenders his or her resignation will not participate in the Board's decision.
     c. Directors properly elected shall hold office until the next annual meeting of stockholders and until their successors shall be duly elected and qualified. Directors need not be stockholders. If, for any cause, the Board of Directors shall not have been elected at an annual meeting, they may be elected as soon thereafter as convenient at a special meeting of the stockholders called for that purpose in the manner provided in these bylaws.
     d. The foregoing to the contrary notwithstanding, in the event that the number of director nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected at a meeting, then a plurality of all the votes cast at such meeting shall be sufficient to elect a director, and therefore, and for the avoidance of doubt, the director nominees shall not be elected at such meeting by a favorable vote of a majority of the votes cast. In such case, stockholders shall be permitted to vote only "for" or to designate their votes to be "withheld" in respect of a director nominee, and shall not in such circumstance be permitted to vote "against" a nominee; and under such circumstances a vote designated to be "withheld", although present for purposes of establishing the presence of a quorum, will not be deemed a vote cast or a vote "against".
     Section 7. Special meetings of the stockholders, for any purpose or purposes, unless otherwise proscribed by the charter, may be called at any time by the president, the chairman of the board, or by a majority of the directors, or by a committee of the board of directors which has
 
been duly designated by the board of directors and whose powers and authority, as provided in a resolution of the board of directors or these bylaws, include the power to call such meetings. In addition, a special meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation shall be called by the secretary of the Corporation on the written request of stockholders entitled to cast at least fifty percent (50%) of all votes entitled to be cast at the meeting, except that, in the case of a special meeting called to consider any matter which is substantially the same as a matter voted on at any special meeting for the stockholders held during the preceding twelve (12) months, the secretary of the Corporation shall not be required to call any such special meeting unless requested by stockholders entitled to cast a majority of all of the votes entitled to be cast at the meeting.
     Section 8. Business transacted at any special meeting of stockholders shall be limited to the purposes stated in the notice. Where the Corporation's notice of meeting specifies that directors are to be elected at such special meeting, nominations of persons for election to the board of directors may be made (i) pursuant to the Corporation's notice of meeting, (ii) by or at the direction of the board of directors or (iii) by any committee of persons appointed by the board of directors with authority therefor or by a stockholder as provided in Section 2 of Article III hereof.
     Section 9. Whenever stockholders are required or permitted to take any action at a meeting, a written notice of the meeting shall be given which notice shall state the place, date and hour of the meeting, and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called. The written notice of any meeting shall be given to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting not less than 10 nor more than 90 days before the date of the meeting. If mailed, notice is given when deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, directed to the stockholder at his address as it appears on the records of the Corporation.
     Section 10. Notwithstanding any other provision of the charter of the Corporation or these bylaws, Subtitle 7 of Title 3 of the MGCL (as the same may hereafter be amended from time to time) shall not apply to the voting rights of any shares of stock of the Corporation now or hereafter held by any existing or future stockholder of the Corporation (regardless of the identity of such stockholder).
     Section 1. The board of directors shall consist of a minimum of five (5) and a maximum of thirteen (13) directors. The number of directors shall be fixed or changed from time to time, within the minimum and maximum, by the then elected directors, provided that at least a majority of the directors shall be Independent Directors, as defined from time to time by the Listing Standards of the New York Stock Exchange and any other relevant laws, rules and regulations. Any determination by the board of directors as to the qualification of any director as an "Independent Director" shall be conclusive for all purposes. Until increased or decreased by the directors pursuant to these bylaws, the exact number of directors shall be ten (10). The directors need not be stockholders. Except as provided in Section 2 of this Article III with respect to vacancies, the directors shall be elected as provided in the charter at each annual meeting of the stockholders, and each director elected shall hold office until his successor is elected and qualified or until his death, retirement, resignation or removal.
 
     Section 2. (a) Nominations of persons for election to the board of directors of the Corporation at the annual meeting of stockholders may be made (i) pursuant to the Corporation's notice of meeting; (ii) by or at the direction of the board of directors or (iii) by any committee of persons appointed by the board of directors with authority therefor or by any stockholder of the Corporation entitled to vote for the election of directors at the meeting who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Article III, Section 2(a). Such nominations by any stockholder shall be made pursuant to timely notice in writing to the Secretary of the Corporation. To be timely, a stockholder's notice shall be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not less than 50 days nor more than 75 days prior to the meeting; provided, however, that in the event that less than 65 days notice or prior public disclosure of the date of the meeting is given or made to stockholders, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so received not later than the close of business of the fifteenth (15th) day following the day on which such notice of the date of the meeting was mailed or such public disclosure was made, whichever first occurs. Such stockholder's notice to the Secretary shall set forth (i) as to each person whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for election or re-election as a director, (a) the name, age, business address and residence address of the person, (b) the principal occupation or employment of the person, (c) the class, series and number of shares of capital stock of the Corporation which are beneficially owned by the person, (d) any other information relating to the person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations for proxies for election of directors pursuant to the Rules and Regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission under Section 14 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (e) such person's written consent to serve as a director if elected, and (f) a statement whether such person, if elected or re-elected, or as a condition thereto, will tender an irrevocable resignation effective upon such person's failure to receive the required vote for re-election at the next meeting at which such person would face re-election and upon acceptance of such resignation by the Board, in accordance with the Corporation's Corporate Governance Principles (and assuming that such person would otherwise remain in office as a director notwithstanding such failure); and (ii) as to the stockholder giving the notice (a) the name and record address of the stockholder and (b) the class, series and number of shares of capital stock of the Corporation which are beneficially owned by the stockholder. The Corporation may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information as may reasonably be required by the Corporation to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as a director of the Corporation. Except as may otherwise be provided in these bylaws or any other agreement relating to the right to designate nominees for election to the board of directors, no person shall be eligible for election as a director of the Corporation unless nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth herein. The officer of the Corporation presiding at an annual meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine that a nomination was not made in accordance with the foregoing procedure, and if he should so determine, he shall so declare to the meeting and the defective nomination shall be disregarded.
          (b) Except as may otherwise be provided pursuant to Article IV of the Corporation's charter with respect to any rights of holders of preferred stock to elect additional directors and any other requirement in these bylaws or other agreement relating to the right to designate nominees for election to the board of directors, should a vacancy in the board of directors occur or be created (whether arising through death, retirement or resignation), such vacancy shall be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors, even though less than a quorum of the board of directors or, in the case of a vacancy resulting from an increase in the number of directors, by a majority of the entire board of directors. In the case of a
 
vacancy created by the removal of a director, the vacancy shall be filled by the stockholders of the Corporation entitled to elect the director who was removed at the next annual meeting of stockholders or at a special meeting of stockholders called for such purpose, provided, however, that such vacancy may be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors, subject to approval by the stockholders entitled to elect the director who was removed at the next annual meeting of stockholders or at a special meeting of stockholders called for such purpose. A director so elected to fill a vacancy shall serve for the remainder of the term.
     Section 3. The property and business of the Corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of its board of directors. In addition to the powers and authorities by these bylaws expressly conferred upon it, the board may exercise all such powers of the Corporation and do all such lawful acts and things as are not by statute or by the Corporation's charter or by these bylaws directed or required to be exercised or done by the stockholders.
     Section 4. The directors may hold their meetings and have one or more offices, and keep the books of the Corporation, outside the State of Maryland.
     Section 5. Regular meetings of the board of directors may be held at such time and place as shall from time to time be determined by resolution of the board, and no additional notice shall be required.
     Section 6. Special meetings of the board of directors may be called by the President or the Chairman of the board of directors on forty-eight hours' notice to each director, either personally or by mail or by telegram; special meetings shall be called by the President or the Secretary in like manner and on like notice on the written request of two directors unless the board consists of only one director, in which case special meetings shall be called by the President or Secretary in like manner and on like notice on the written request of the sole director.
     Section 7. Unless otherwise restricted by the Corporation's charter or these bylaws, any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the board of directors or of any committee thereof may be taken without a meeting, if all members of the board or committee, as the case may be, consent thereto in writing, and the writing or writings are filed with the minutes of proceedings of the board or committee.
     Section 8. Unless otherwise restricted by the Corporation's charter or these bylaws, members of the board of directors, or any committee designated by the board of directors, may participate in a meeting of the board of directors, or any committee, by means of conference telephone or similar communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other, and such participation in a meeting shall constitute presence in person at such meeting.
     Section 9. By virtue of resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors prior to or at the time of adoption of these Bylaws and designated irrevocable, any business combination (as defined in Section 3-601(e) of the MGCL) between the Corporation and any of its present or future stockholders, or any affiliates or associates of the Corporation or any present or future
 
stockholder of the Corporation, or any other person or entity or group of persons or entities, is exempt from the provisions of Subtitle 6 of Title 3 of the MGCL entitled "Special Voting Requirements," including, but not limited to, the provisions of Section 3-602 of such Subtitle. The Board of Directors may not revoke, alter or amend such resolution, or otherwise elect to have any business combination of the Corporation be subject to the provisions of Subtitle 6 of Title 3 of the MGCL without the approval of the holders of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Corporation by the affirmative vote of a majority of all votes entitled to be cast in respect of such shares of Common Stock.
     Section 10. Notwithstanding any other provision of these bylaws, all actions which the board of directors may take to approve a transaction between (i) the Corporation, AMB Property, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the "Operating Partnership"), or any subsidiary of the Corporation or the Operating Partnership, on the one hand, and (ii) (a) any executive officer or director of the Corporation, the Operating Partnership or any subsidiary of the Corporation or the Operating Partnership, or (b) any limited partner of the Operating Partnership or (c) any affiliate of the foregoing executive officer, director or limited partner (not including the Corporation, the Operating Partnership or any subsidiary of the Corporation or the Operating Partnership), on the other hand, shall require, for valid approval, the approval of a majority of the Independent Directors; provided, however, that this approval requirement shall not apply to arrangements between the Corporation or the Operating Partnership and any executive officer or director acting in the executive officer's or director's position as such, including but not limited to employment agreements and compensation matters.
     Section 11. A director may resign at any time upon written notice to the Corporation's board of directors, chairman of the board, president or secretary. Any such resignation shall take effect at the time or upon the satisfaction of any condition specified therein or, if no time or condition is specified, upon receipt thereof, and the acceptance of such resignation, unless required by the terms thereof (including for example any resignation contemplated by Article II Section 6(b) of these bylaws), shall not be necessary to make such resignation effective.
     Section 12. The board of directors may, by resolution passed by a majority of the whole board, designate one or more committees, each such committee to consist of not less than the minimum number of directors required for committees of the board of directors under the MGCL. The board may designate one or more directors as alternate members of any committee, who may replace any absent or disqualified member at any meeting of the committee. Any such committee, to the extent provided in the resolution of the board of directors, and to the maximum extent permitted under the MGCL, shall have and may exercise all the powers and authority of the board of directors in the management of the business and affairs of the Corporation, and may authorize the seal of the Corporation to be affixed to all papers which may require it; but no such committee shall have the power or authority in reference to amending the charter, adopting an agreement of merger or consolidation, recommending to the stockholders the sale, lease or exchange of all or substantially all of the Corporation's property and assets, recommending to the stockholders a dissolution of the Corporation or a revocation of a dissolution or any other
 
matter requiring the approval of the stockholders of the Corporation, or amending the bylaws of the Corporation; and no such committee shall have the power or authority to authorize or declare a dividend, to authorize the issuance of stock (except that, if the board of directors has given general authorization for the issuance of stock providing for or establishing a method or procedure for determining the maximum number of shares to be issued, a committee of the board of directors may, in accordance with that general authorization or any stock option or other plan or program adopted by the board of directors: authorize or fix the terms of stock subject to classification or reclassification, including the designations and any of the preferences, conversion or other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends, qualifications, or terms or conditions of redemption of such shares; within the limits established by the board of directors, fix the number of any such class or series of stock or authorize the increase or decrease in the number of shares of any series or class; and otherwise establish the terms on which any stock may be issued, including the price and consideration for such stock), or to approve any merger or share exchange, regardless of whether the merger or share exchange requires stockholder approval.
     Section 13. The Corporation shall from and after the incorporation have the following committees, the specific authority and members of which shall be as designated herein, in such committee's charter or otherwise by resolution of the board of directors:
     (i) An Executive Committee, which shall have such authority as granted by the board of directors, including the power to acquire, dispose and finance investments for the Corporation (including the issuance by the Operating Partnership, in the Corporation's capacity as the Operating Partnership's general partner, of additional units or other equity interests) and approve the execution of contracts and agreements, including those related to the borrowing of money by the Corporation, and generally exercise all other powers of the board except as prohibited by law; provided, however, that the issuance of additional units or other equity interests of the Operating Partnership, to the extent that such interests are exchangeable into shares of the Corporation's capital stock, may be issued only if the Corporation has reserved for issuance such shares of capital stock issuable upon the exchange of such units or other equity interests.
     (ii) An Audit Committee, which shall consist solely of Independent Directors and which shall engage the independent public accountants, review with the independent public accountants the plans and results of the audit engagement, approve professional services provided by the independent public accountants, review the independence of the independent public accountants, consider the range of audit and non-audit fees and review the adequacy of the Corporation's internal accounting controls.
     (iii) A Compensation Committee, which shall consist solely of Independent Directors and which shall determine compensation for the Corporation's executive officers, and will review and make recommendations concerning proposals by management with respect to compensation, bonus, employment agreements and other benefits and policies respecting such matters for the executive officers of the Corporation.
 
     (iv) A Nominating and Governance Committee, which shall, among other things, submit nominations for members of the Board of Directors, recommend composition of the committees of the Board of Directors, review the size and composition of the Board of Directors, review guidelines for corporate governance, and conduct annual reviews of the Board of Directors and the Chief Executive Officer.
     Section 14. Each committee shall keep regular minutes of its meetings and report the same to the board of directors when required. The presence of a majority of the total membership of any committee shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at any meeting of such committee and the act of a majority of those present shall be necessary and sufficient for the taking of any action thereat.
     Section 15. Unless otherwise restricted by the charter of the Corporation or these bylaws, the board of directors shall have the authority to fix the compensation of non-employee directors. The non-employee directors may be paid their expenses, if any, of attendance at each meeting of the board of directors and may be paid a fixed sum for attendance at each meeting of the board of directors or a stated salary as director. Officers of the Corporation who are also members of the board of directors shall not be paid any director's fees.
     Section 16. The Corporation shall indemnify, in the manner and to the maximum extent permitted by law, any person (or the estate of any person) who is or was a party to, or is threatened to be made a party to, any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether or not by or in the right of the Corporation, and whether civil, criminal, administrative, investigative, or otherwise, by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of the Corporation or that such person while a director or officer of the Corporation, is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, trustee, partner, member, agent or employee of another corporation, partnership, limited liability company, association, joint venture, trust or other enterprise. To the maximum extent permitted by law, the indemnification provided herein shall include expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement, and any such expenses may be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding.
     Neither the amendment nor repeal of this Section 14 of this Article III, nor the adoption or amendment of any other provision of the charter or bylaws of the Corporation inconsistent with this Section, shall apply to or affect in any respect the applicability of the preceding paragraph with respect to any act or failure to act which occurred prior to such amendment, repeal or adoption.
     The indemnification and reimbursement of expenses provided herein shall not be deemed to limit the right of the Corporation to indemnify any other person against any liability and expenses to the fullest extent permitted by law, nor shall it be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which any person seeking indemnification from the Corporation may be entitled under any agreement, the charter or bylaws of the Corporation, a vote of stockholders or Independent
 
Directors, or otherwise, both as to action in such person's official capacity as an officer or director and as to action in another capacity, at the request of the Corporation, while acting as an officer or director of the Corporation.
     Section 1. The officers of this Corporation shall be chosen by the board of directors and shall include a president, a vice president, a secretary and a treasurer. The Corporation may also have at the discretion of the board of directors such other officers as are desired, including a chairman of the board, additional vice presidents, a chief executive officer, a chief financial officer, a chief operating officer, one or more managing directors, one or more assistant secretaries and one or more assistant treasurers, and such other officers as may be appointed in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of this Article IV. In the event there are two or more vice presidents, then one or more may be designated as executive vice president, senior vice president, vice president/acquisitions or other similar or dissimilar title. At the time of the election of officers, the directors may by resolution determine the order of their rank. Any number of offices may be held by the same person, unless the charter or these bylaws otherwise provide, except that one individual may not simultaneously hold the office of president and vice president.
     Section 2. The board of directors, at its first meeting after each annual meeting of stockholders, shall choose the officers of the Corporation.
     Section 3. The board of directors may appoint such other officers and agents as it shall deem necessary who shall hold their offices for such terms and shall exercise such powers and perform such duties as shall be determined from time to time by the board.
     Section 4. The salaries of all officers and agents of the Corporation shall be fixed by the board of directors, provided, however, that the compensation of the Corporation's executive officers shall be determined by the Compensation Committee.
     Section 5. The officers of the Corporation shall hold office until their successors are chosen and qualify in their stead. Any officer elected or appointed by the board of directors may be removed at any time, with or without cause, by the affirmative vote of a majority of the board of directors. If the office of any officer or officers becomes vacant for any reason, the vacancy shall be filled by the board of directors.
     Section 6. Any officer may resign at any time upon written notice to the Corporation's board of directors, chairman of the board, president or secretary. Any such resignation shall take effect at the time specified therein or, if the time is not specified, upon receipt thereof, and the acceptance of such resignation, unless required by the terms thereof, shall not be necessary to make such resignation effective. Any such resignation will not prejudice the rights, if any, of the Corporation under any contract to which the officer is a party.
 
     Section 7. The chairman of the board, if such an officer be elected, shall, if present, preside at all meetings of the board of directors and exercise and perform such other powers and duties as may be from time to time assigned to him by the board of directors or prescribed by the bylaws. If there is no president, the chairman of the board shall in addition be the chief executive officer of the Corporation and shall have the powers and duties prescribed in Section 8 of this Article IV. If there is a president, then in the absence or disability of the president, the chairman of the board shall perform all the duties of the president, and when so acting, shall have all the powers of and be subject to all the restrictions upon the president.
     Section 8. Subject to such supervisory powers, if any, as may be given by the board of directors to the chairman of the board, if there be such an officer, the chief executive officer shall, subject to the control of the board of directors, have general supervision, direction and control of the business and officers of the Corporation. He shall have the general powers and duties of management usually vested in the office of chief executive officer of corporations, and shall have such other powers and duties as may be prescribed by the board of directors or these bylaws.
     Section 9. Subject to such supervisory powers, if any, as may be given by the board of directors to the chairman of the board, if there be such an officer, the president shall, subject to the control of the board of directors, have general supervision, direction and control of the business and officers of the Corporation. He shall preside at all meetings of the stockholders and, in the absence of the chairman of the board, or if there be none, at all meetings of the board of directors. He shall have the general powers and duties of management usually vested in the office of president of corporations, and shall have such other powers and duties as may be prescribed by the board of directors or these bylaws.
     Section 10. Subject to such supervisory powers, if any, as may be given by the board of directors to the chairman of the board, chief executive officer or the president, if there be such an officer, the chief operating officer shall, subject to the control of the board of directors, have the supervision, direction and control of the day to day operations of the Corporation.

Designation and Number

Series D Preferred Units
Section 17.2.
Ranking
          The Series D Preferred Units shall, with respect to distribution rights and rights upon voluntary or involuntary liquidation, winding up or dissolution of the Partnership, rank (i) senior to the Common Units and to all Partnership Units the terms of which provide that such Partnership Units shall rank junior to the Series D Preferred Units; (ii) on a parity with all other Parity Preferred Units; and (iii) junior to all Partnership Units which rank senior to the Series D Preferred Units.
Section 17.3.
Distributions
          A. . Subject to the rights of holders of Parity Preferred Units as to the payment of distributions (including pursuant to hereof), holders of Series D Preferred Units will be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Partnership acting through the General Partner, out of Available Cash, cumulative preferential cash distributions in an amount equal to the Series D Priority Return. Such distributions will be payable (A) quarterly (such quarterly periods for purposes of payment and accrual will be the quarterly periods ending on the dates specified in this sentence and not calendar year quarters) in arrears, on the 25th day of March, June, September and December of each year and (B) in the event of (i) an exchange of Series D Preferred Units into Series D Preferred Shares, or (ii) a redemption of Series D Preferred Units, on the exchange date or redemption date, as applicable (each a ""), commencing on the first of such payment dates to occur following their original date of issuance. If any date on which distributions are to be made on the Series D Preferred Units is not a Business Day, then payment of the distribution to be made on such date will be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay) except that, if such Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar year, such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day, in each case with the same force and effect as if made on such date.

For purposes of clarifying the relative distribution priority rights among the Series I Preferred Units and the Series D Preferred Units, the payment of distributions with respect to a series of such Preferred Units prior to the payment of distributions with respect to another such series of Preferred Units, solely as a result of the
Payment of Distributions
Sections 5.1 and 22.3A
Series D Preferred Unit Distribution Payment Date
Series D Preferred Unit Partnership Record Date
 
distribution payment dates with respect to a series of Preferred Units occurring on a different date from another series of Preferred Units, shall not be deemed to create a priority in favor of one series of Preferred Units over any other series of Preferred Units.
          B. . Notwithstanding the foregoing, distributions on the Series D Preferred Units will accrue whether or not the terms and provisions of any agreement of the Partnership at any time prohibit the current payment of distributions, whether or not the Partnership has earnings, whether or not there are funds legally available for the payment of such distributions and whether or not such distributions are authorized. Accrued but unpaid distributions on the Series D Preferred Units will accumulate as of the Preferred Unit Distribution Payment Date on which they first become payable.
Distributions Cumulative
          C. . (i) So long as any Series D Preferred Units are outstanding, no distribution of cash or other property shall be authorized, declared, paid or set apart for payment on or with respect to any class or series of Partnership Interest represented by Junior Units, nor shall any Junior Units or Parity Preferred Units be redeemed, purchased or otherwise acquired for any consideration (or any monies be paid to or made available for a sinking fund for the redemption of any such Junior Units or Parity Preferred Units) by the Partnership (except by conversion into or exchange for other Junior Units or Parity Preferred Units, as the case may be) unless, in each case, full cumulative distributions have been or contemporaneously are authorized and paid or authorized and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set apart for such payment on the Series D Preferred Units and all classes and series of outstanding Parity Preferred Units for all distribution periods. The foregoing sentence will not prohibit (a) distributions payable solely in Junior Units, (b) the exchange of Junior Units or Parity Preferred Units into Partnership Interests of the Partnership ranking junior to the Series D Preferred Units as to distributions and upon voluntary and involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Partnership, or (c) distributions necessary to enable the Operating Partnership to redeem partnership interests corresponding to Series D Preferred Shares and any Parity Preferred Stock with respect to distributions or Junior Stock to be purchased by AMB pursuant to the REIT Charter to preserve AMB's status as a REIT; that such redemption shall be upon the same terms as the corresponding stock purchase pursuant to the REIT Charter.
Priority as to Distributions
provided
          (ii) So long as distributions have not been paid in full (or a sum sufficient for such full payment is not so set apart) upon the Series D Preferred Units and any other Parity Preferred Units, all distributions authorized and declared on the Series D Preferred Units and all classes or series of outstanding Parity Preferred Units shall be authorized and declared so that the amount of distributions authorized and declared per Series D Preferred Unit and such other classes or series of Parity Preferred Units shall in all cases bear to each other the same ratio that accrued distributions per Series D Preferred Unit and such other classes or series of Parity Preferred Units (which shall not include any accumulation in respect of unpaid distributions for prior distribution periods if such class or series of Parity Preferred Units do not have cumulative distribution rights) bear to each other.

case the actual payment date will be considered the date fixed for redemption for purposes of calculating the applicable Series I Redemption Price.

Each Class B Common Limited Partner covenants and agrees with the Partnership that all Tendered Units shall be delivered to the Partnership, in the case of a redemption for a Cash Amount, or AMB, in the case of an exchange for a REIT Share Amount, free and clear of all liens, claims and encumbrances whatsoever and should any such liens, claims and/or encumbrances exist or arise with respect to such Tendered Units, the Partnership or AMB, as the case may be, shall be under no obligation to acquire the same. Each Class B Common Limited Partner further agrees that, in the event any state or local property transfer tax is payable as a result of the transfer of its Tendered Units to the Partnership or AMB (or their designee), such Class B Common Limited Partner shall assume and pay such transfer tax.

Notwithstanding the provisions of or any other provision of this Agreement, a Class B Common Limited Partner (i) shall not be entitled to effect a Class B Redemption for cash or an exchange for REIT Shares to the extent the ownership or right to acquire REIT Shares pursuant to such exchange by such Partner on the Specified Redemption Date would cause such Partner or any other Person, or, in the opinion of counsel selected by AMB, may cause such Partner or any other Person, to violate the restrictions on ownership and transfer of REIT Shares set forth in Article IV.E of the REIT Charter and (ii) shall have no rights under this Agreement to acquire REIT Shares which would otherwise be prohibited under the REIT Charter. To the extent any attempted Class B Redemption or exchange for REIT Shares would be in violation of this , it shall be null and void and such Class B Common Limited Partner shall not acquire any rights or economic interest in the cash otherwise payable upon such redemption or the REIT Shares otherwise issuable upon such exchange.
