ITEM 2.02    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.
On April 18, 2007, we issued a press release entitled "AMB Property Corporation Announces First Quarter Results," which sets forth disclosure regarding our results of operations for the first quarter of 2007. A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1. This section and the attached exhibit are provided under Item 2.02 of Form 8-K and are furnished to, but not filed with, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
ITEM 5.02    DEPARTURE OF DIRECTORS OR CERTAIN OFFICERS; ELECTION OF DIRECTORS; APPOINTMENT OF CERTAIN OFFICERS; COMPENSATORY ARRANGEMENTS OF CERTAIN OFFICERS.
Mr. Michael A. Coke, our executive vice president, intends to leave his employment with us on May 1, 2007 and be available to us on a consulting basis from time to time after May 1. On May 1, 2007, pursuant to his Separation Agreement and Release of All Claims, dated November 21, 2006, we expect to make certain payments owed to Mr. Coke and to accelerate the vesting of a portion of his shares of currently unvested restricted common stock and options to purchase shares of our common stock.
ITEM 8.01    OTHER EVENTS.
On April 18, 2007, we reported results for the first quarter of 2007.
Funds from operations per fully diluted share and unit was $0.57 for the first quarter of 2007, as compared to $0.52 for the same quarter in 2006. The current quarter results include $0.12 per share of development profits, as compared to $0.01 per share in the first quarter of 2006.
Net income available to common stockholders per fully diluted share for the first quarter of 2007 was $0.23, as compared to $0.26 for the same quarter in 2006. The decrease for the quarter was due primarily to a lower level of gains on the disposition of operating properties.
Operating Results
Our operating portfolio occupancy at March 31, 2007 was 95.2%, down 90 basis points from December 31, 2006, and up 90 basis points from March 31, 2006. Cash-basis same store net operating income in the first quarter of 2007 increased 6.3% over the same period in 2006, primarily due to higher average occupancy and increased rental rates. In the first quarter of 2007, rents on lease renewals and rollovers in our operating portfolio increased 2.8%, as compared to a decline of 11.5% in the first quarter of 2006.
Investment Activity
New development and renovation starts in the quarter totaled approximately 1.9 million square feet in five projects in North America and Asia, with an estimated total investment of $191 million. At quarter end, our development and renovation pipeline totaled 14.7 million square feet in 44 projects globally, with an estimated total investment of $1.4 billion.
 
Our development business includes contributions of stabilized properties to affiliated private capital funds or sale of projects to third parties. During the first quarter, we contributed or sold four development projects totaling 661,300 square feet for a gross sale price of $81 million.
As previously announced, we issued approximately 8.4 million shares of common stock in the first quarter of 2007. In the near term, we intend to use the proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes and, over the long term, to expand our global development business, which will contribute to the growth of our private capital business.
We intend to accelerate the pace of our development startsfrom a projected $1.1 billion in 2007 to $1.6 billion in 2010. In addition to increasing our share in our current markets, we intend to expand into new locations along the global supply chain. For example, in the first quarter, we entered Korea with a development at Seoul's international airport and a seaport in Nagoya, Japan with the development of a one million square foot distribution facility. We are actively seeking the right opportunity in India and in both Central and Eastern Europe.
During the quarter, we acquired 1.8 million square feet of industrial distribution space in eight properties at a total acquisition cost of approximately $142 million, $122 million of which was acquired for two of our co-investment funds: AMB Alliance Fund III and AMB Japan Fund I.
Additions and Promotions of Officers
During the quarter, we announced that Thomas Olinger joined us as our chief financial officer and Nina Tran was promoted to senior vice president, chief accounting officer. Also during the quarter, Mark Saturno was promoted to senior vice president, managing director of our West-Central Region in North America, and Thomas Marquis joined the Shanghai office as senior vice president, managing director of our operations in China. Mark Hansen joined us as vice president, responsible for our value-added conversion business.

AMB Property, L.P. redeemed the Series J Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units for $40.0 million, plus an additional $8,888.89, representing payment in full of the amount of accrued and unpaid distributions on the Series J Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units. AMB Property, L.P. redeemed the Series K Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units for $40.0 million, plus an additional $8,888.89, representing payment in full of the amount of accrued and unpaid distributions on the Series K Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units.
 
On April 17, 2007, another of our subsidiaries, AMB Property II, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, repurchased all 510,000 of its outstanding 8.00% Series I Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units from a single institutional investor. AMB Property II, L.P. repurchased the units for $25.5 million, plus an additional $124,318.69, representing payment in full of the amount of accrued and unpaid distributions, less applicable withholding, on the Series I Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units.
SUPPLEMENTAL EARNINGS MEASURES
Funds From Operations and Funds from Operations per Share and Unit. We believe that net income, as defined by GAAP, is the most appropriate earnings measure. However, we consider funds from operations, or FFO, and funds from operations per fully diluted share and unit, or FFOPS, as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT, to be useful supplemental measures of our operating performance. FFO is defined as net income, calculated in accordance with GAAP, less gains (or losses) from dispositions of real estate held for investment purposes and real estate-related depreciation, and adjustments to derive our pro rata share of FFO of consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures. FFOPS is FFO per share of fully diluted company common stock and partnership unit. Further, we do not adjust FFO or FFOPS to eliminate the effects of non-recurring charges. We believe that FFO and FFOPS, as defined by NAREIT, are meaningful supplemental measures of our operating performance because historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time, as reflected through depreciation and amortization expenses. However, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market and other conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient. Thus, NAREIT created FFO and FFOPS as supplemental measures of operating performance for real estate investment trusts that exclude historical cost depreciation and amortization, among other items, from net income, as defined by GAAP. We believe that the use of FFO and FFOPS, combined with the required GAAP presentations, has been beneficial in improving the understanding of operating results of real estate investment trusts among the investing public and making comparisons of operating results among such companies more meaningful. We consider FFO and FFOPS to be useful measures for reviewing comparative operating and financial performance because, by excluding gains or losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets and real estate depreciation and amortization, FFO and FFOPS can help the investing public compare the operating performance of a company's real estate between periods or as compared to other companies. While FFO and FFOPS are relevant and widely used measures of
 
operating performance of real estate investment trusts, they do not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to those measures in evaluating our liquidity or operating performance. FFO and FFOPS also do not consider the costs associated with capital expenditures related to our real estate assets nor are FFO or FFOPS necessarily indicative of cash available to fund our future cash requirements. Further, our computation of FFO and FFOPS may not be comparable to FFO or FFOPS reported by other real estate investment trusts that do not define the terms in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently than we do.
We believe that net income, as defined by GAAP, is the most appropriate earnings measure. However, we consider same store net operating income (SS NOI) to be a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance. Properties that are considered part of the same store pool include all properties that were owned as of the end of both the current and prior year reporting periods and exclude development properties for both the current and prior reporting periods. The same store pool is set annually and excludes properties purchased and developments stabilized after December 31, 2005. In deriving SS NOI, we define NOI as rental revenues (as calculated in accordance with GAAP), including reimbursements, less straight-line rents and amortization of lease intangibles and property operating expenses, which excludes depreciation, amortization, general and administrative expenses and interest expense. We exclude straight-line rents and amortization of lease intangibles in calculating SS NOI because we believe it provides a better measure of actual cash basis rental growth for a year-over-year comparison. In addition, we believe that SS NOI helps the investing public compare the operating performance of our real estate with that of other companies. While SS NOI is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance of real estate investment trusts, it does not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to those measures in evaluating our liquidity or operating performance. SS NOI also does not reflect general and administrative expenses, interest expense, depreciation and amortization costs, capital expenditures and leasing costs, or trends in development and construction activities that could materially impact our results from operations. Further, our computation of SS NOI may not be comparable to that of other real estate companies, as they may use different methodologies for calculating SS NOI.

Forward Looking Statements
Some of the information included in this report contains forward-looking statements, such as those related to demand for our product, rental rate growth, development and renovation projects (including our ability to lease such projects, square feet at stabilization or completion, costs and total investment amounts), future business plans (such as expansion into additional markets) and the expected departure date of Michael Coke and his intentions to provide consulting services to us, which are made pursuant to the safe-harbor provisions of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Because these forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, there are important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, and you should not rely on the forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. The events or circumstances reflected in forward-looking statements might not occur. You can identify forward-looking statements by the use of forward-looking terminology such as "believes," "expects," "may," "will," "should," "seeks," "approximately," "intends," "plans," "pro forma," "estimates" or "anticipates" or the negative of these words and phrases or similar words or phrases. You can also identify forward-looking statements by discussions of strategy, plans or intentions. Forward-looking statements are necessarily dependent on assumptions, data or methods that may be incorrect or imprecise and we may not be able to realize them. We caution you not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which reflect our analysis only and speak only as of the date of this report or the dates indicated in the statements. We assume no obligation to update or supplement forward-looking statements. The following factors, among others, could cause actual results and future events to differ materially from those set forth or contemplated in the forward-looking statements: defaults on or non-renewal of leases by tenants, increased interest rates and operating costs, our failure to obtain necessary outside financing, re-financing risks, risks related to debt and equity security financings (including dilution risk), difficulties in identifying properties to acquire and in effecting acquisitions, our failure to successfully integrate acquired properties and operations, our failure to divest properties we have contracted to sell or to timely reinvest proceeds from any divestitures, risks and uncertainties affecting property development and construction (including construction delays, cost overruns, our inability to obtain necessary permits and public opposition to these activities), our failure to qualify and maintain our status as a real estate investment trust, failure to maintain our current credit agency ratings, environmental uncertainties, risks related to natural disasters, financial market fluctuations, changes in general economic conditions or in the real estate sector, changes in real estate and zoning laws, a downturn in the U.S., California or global economy, risks related to doing business internationally and global expansion, losses in excess of our insurance coverage, unknown liabilities acquired in connection with acquired properties or otherwise and increases in real property tax rates. Our success also depends upon economic trends generally, including interest rates, income tax laws, governmental regulation, legislation, population changes and certain other matters discussed under the heading "Risk Factors" and elsewhere in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2006.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
AMB PROPERTY CORPORATION
ANNOUNCES FIRST QUARTER RESULTS
SAN FRANCISCO, April 18, 2007  AMB Property Corporation (NYSE:AMB), a leading global developer and owner of industrial real estate, today reported results for the first quarter of 2007.
Funds from operations per fully diluted share and unit ("FFOPS") was $0.57 for the first quarter of 2007, as compared to $0.52 for the same quarter in 2006. The current quarter results include $0.12 per share of development profits, as compared to $0.01 per share in the first quarter of 2006. FFOPS results in the first quarter exceeded the high end of the company's previous guidance by $0.05 per share, primarily due to the better than expected performance of our operating portfolio and higher profitability on development projects contributed during the quarter.
Net income available to common stockholders per fully diluted share ("EPS") for the first quarter of 2007 was $0.23, as compared to $0.26 for the same quarter in 2006. The decrease for the quarter was due primarily to a lower level of gains on the disposition of operating properties.
Operating Results
AMB's operating portfolio occupancy at March 31, 2007 was 95.2%, down 90 basis points from December 31, 2006, and up 90 basis points from March 31, 2006. Cash-basis same store net operating income ("SSNOI") in the first quarter of 2007 increased 6.3% over the same period in 2006, primarily due to higher average occupancy and increased rental rates. In the first quarter of 2007, rents on lease renewals and rollovers in AMB's operating portfolio increased 2.8%, as compared to a decline of 11.5% in the first quarter of 2006.
Hamid R. Moghadam, AMB chairman and CEO, said, "We have started off the year with a strong quarter, demonstrating the strength of global trade as the main driver of our business. Real estate fundamentals are solid, and demand for our product is leading to meaningful rental rate growth, most notably in our supply constrained and infill markets at or adjacent to many of the world's largest seaports and airports tied to global trade."
Investment Activity
New development and renovation starts in the quarter totaled approximately 1.9 million square feet in five projects in North America and Asia, with an estimated total investment of $191 million. At quarter end, AMB's development and renovation pipeline totaled 14.7 million square feet in 44 projects globally, with an estimated total investment of $1.4 billion.
The company's development business includes contributions of stabilized properties to affiliated private capital funds or sale of projects to third parties. During the first quarter, AMB contributed or sold four development projects totaling 661,300 square feet for a gross sale price of $81 million.
 
As previously announced, AMB issued 8.4 million shares of common stock in the first quarter of 2007. In the near term, the company intends to use the proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes and, over the long term, to expand its global development business, which will contribute to the growth of its private capital business.
"For the past six years, we have successfully built a global development business to meet the demand from our customers who continue to build out their distribution networks. To take advantage of what we see as an opportunity to add to our customer offerings and profitably expand our development activities, we intend to accelerate the pace of our development startsfrom a projected $1.1 billion in 2007 to $1.6 billion in 2010. In addition to increasing share in our current markets, we're expanding into new critical locations along the global supply chain. For example, in the first quarter, we entered Korea with a development at Seoul's international airport and Nagoya, Japan's largest seaport by cargo volume, with the development of a one million square foot distribution facility. We are actively seeking the right opportunity in India, and markets in both Central and Eastern Europe are on the horizon, as well," added Mr. Moghadam.
During the quarter, AMB acquired 1.8 million square feet of industrial distribution space in eight properties at a total acquisition cost of approximately $142 million, $122 million of which was acquired for two of the company's co-investment funds: AMB Alliance Fund III and AMB Japan Fund I.
Additions and Promotions of Company Officers
During the quarter, AMB announced that Thomas Olinger joined the company as chief financial officer and Nina Tran was promoted to senior vice president, chief accounting officer. Also during the quarter, Mark Saturno was promoted to senior vice president, managing director of AMB's West-Central Region in North America, and Thomas Marquis joined the Shanghai office as senior vice president, managing director of AMB's operation in China. Mark Hansen joined the company as vice president, responsible for AMB's value-added conversion business.
Annual Meeting of Stockholders
The Annual Meeting of Stockholders will be held on Thursday, May 10, 2007 at 1:00 p.m. PDT. Stockholders are invited to attend the meeting at the company's corporate headquarters located at Pier 1, Bay 1, in San Francisco, California. The proxy statement, Annual Report to Stockholders, voting materials and meeting information were mailed on or about March 26, 2007.
Supplemental Earnings Measure
AMB reports FFOPS and unit in accordance with the standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts. Included in the footnotes to the company's attached financial statements is a discussion of why management believes FFOPS is a useful supplemental measure of operating performance, ways in which investors might use FFOPS when assessing the company's financial performance and FFOPS's limitations as a measurement tool. Reconciliation from net income to funds from operations is provided in the attached tables and published in AMB's quarterly supplemental analyst package, available on the company's website at www.amb.com.
 
The company believes that net income, as defined by GAAP, is the most appropriate earnings measure. However, the company considers same store net operating income (SSNOI) to be a useful supplemental measure of its operating performance. Properties that are considered part of the same store pool include all properties that were owned as of the end of both the current and prior year reporting periods and exclude development properties for both the current and prior reporting periods. The same store pool is set annually and excludes properties purchased and developments stabilized after December 31, 2005. In deriving SSNOI, the company defines NOI as rental revenues (as calculated in accordance with GAAP), including reimbursements, less straight-line rents, property operating expenses and real estate taxes. The company excludes straight-line rents in calculating SSNOI because the company believes it provides a better measure of actual cash basis rental growth for a year-over-year comparison. In addition, the company believes that SSNOI helps the investing public compare the company's operating performance with that of other companies. While SSNOI is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance of real estate investment trusts, it does not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to those measures in evaluating AMB's liquidity or operating performance. SSNOI also does not reflect general and administrative expenses, interest expense, depreciation and amortization costs, capital expenditures and leasing costs, or trends in development and construction activities that could materially impact its results from operations. Further, the company's computation of SSNOI may not be comparable to that of other real estate companies, as they may use different methodologies for calculating SSNOI. Reconciliation from net income to SSNOI is published in the company's quarterly supplemental analyst package, available on the company's website at www.amb.com.
