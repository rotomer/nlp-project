Section 10.17
          (i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained or implied herein, a Defaulting Bank shall not be entitled to vote on any matter as to which a vote by the Banks is required hereunder, including, without limitation, any actions or consents on the part of the Administrative Agent as to which the approval or consent of all the Banks or the Majority Banks is required under , or elsewhere, so long as such Bank is a Defaulting Bank; , however, that in the case of any vote requiring the unanimous consent of the Banks, if all the Banks other than the Defaulting Bank shall have voted in accordance with each other, then the Defaulting Bank shall be deemed to have voted in accordance with such Banks.

All payments, repayments and other disbursements of funds by the Administrative Agent to Banks shall thereupon and, at all times thereafter be made in accordance with such Bank's recalculated Pro Rata Share unless and until a Defaulting Bank shall fully cure all defaults on the part of such Defaulting Bank under the Loan Documents or otherwise existing in respect of the Loans or this Agreement, at which time the Pro Rata Share of the Bank(s) which advanced sums on behalf of the Defaulting Bank and of the Defaulting Bank shall be restored to their original percentages.
          (k) For the avoidance of doubt, none of the provisions in this shall have the effect of creating a Lien in favor of the Senior Creditors over the Subordinated Debt and/or other related rights and claims of the Junior Creditors.

1. In the section for the proposed currency, insert the date the loan is made or continued, and the FX rate to convert from the currency to USD.
2. For a new loan, replace the "0" loan amount in the formula with the proposed loan amount in that currency. The formula then calculates the USD equivalent amount. No change is needed if a loan is being continued.
3. Check the Available Commitment amounts in Column O for that currency. If any amounts are negative, the loan is not authorized.
4. Check the Total Available Commitment amounts at the top of the spreadsheet (Column G, rows 7-12). If any amounts are negative, the loan is not authorized.
Note: Letters of credit should be treated as if they were loans; however, the title should be changed to "LC Amount" for clarity.
For a loan payoff or LC expiration:
1. Delete the date and FX rate.
2. In the cell for the Loan Amt, change the amount in the formula for the USD calculation back to "0."
