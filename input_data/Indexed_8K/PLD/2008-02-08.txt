     On February 8, 2008, our President, Europe & Asia, Guy F. Jaquier, adopted a pre-arranged stock trading plan to exercise a portion of his vested stock options and sell the resulting shares received from such stock option exercises as a part of his personal long term investment strategies for asset diversification, liquidity and estate planning. This stock trading plan was adopted in accordance with guidelines specified under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and our policies regarding stock transactions.
     Up to 79,480 shares of our common stock may be traded under Mr. Jaquier's 10b5-1 plan upon exercise of vested stock options contributed to his 10b5-1 plan. As of February 8, 2008, Mr. Jaquier has beneficial ownership of 85,627 shares of our common stock and, not including the options to purchase 79,480 shares of our common stock that may be exercised pursuant to his 10b5-1 plan, options to purchase 328,646 shares of our common stock.
     All transactions under this 10b5-1 plan will be disclosed publicly in filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
Forward Looking Statements
Some of the information included in this report contains forward-looking statements, such as those related to future trades under the 10b5-1 plan referenced above, which are made pursuant to the safe-harbor provisions of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Because these forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, there are important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, and you should not rely on the forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. The events or circumstances reflected in forward-looking statements might not occur. You can identify forward-looking statements by the use of forward-looking terminology such as "believes," "expects," "may," "will," "should," "seeks," "approximately," "intends," "plans," "pro forma," "estimates" or "anticipates" or the negative of these words and phrases or similar words or phrases. You can also identify forward-looking statements by discussions of strategy, plans or intentions. Forward-looking statements are necessarily dependent on assumptions, data or methods that may be incorrect or imprecise and we may not be able to realize them. We caution you not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which reflect our analysis only and speak only as of the date of this report or the dates indicated in the statements. We assume no obligation to update or supplement forward-looking statements. The following factors, among others, could cause actual results and future events to differ materially from those set forth or contemplated in the forward-looking statements: defaults on or non-renewal of leases by tenants, increased interest rates and operating costs, our failure to obtain necessary outside financing, re-financing risks, risks related to our obligations in the event of certain defaults under joint venture and other debt, risks related to debt and equity security financings (including dilution risk), difficulties in identifying properties to acquire and in effecting acquisitions, our failure to successfully integrate acquired properties and operations, our failure to divest properties we have contracted to sell            or to timely reinvest proceeds from any divestitures, risks and uncertainties affecting property development and construction (including construction delays, cost overruns, our inability to obtain necessary permits and public opposition to these activities), our failure to qualify and maintain our status as a real estate investment trust, risks related to our tax structuring, failure to maintain our current credit agency ratings, environmental uncertainties, risks related to natural disasters, financial market fluctuations, changes in general economic conditions or in the real estate sector, changes in real estate and zoning laws, a downturn in the U.S., California or global economy, risks related to doing business internationally and global expansion, losses in excess of our insurance coverage, unknown liabilities acquired in connection with acquired properties or otherwise and increases in real property tax rates. Our success also depends upon economic trends generally, including interest rates, income tax laws, governmental regulation, legislation, population changes and certain other matters discussed under the heading "Risk Factors" and elsewhere in our most recent annual report for the year ended December 31, 2006 on Form 10-K and our quarterly report for the quarter ended June 30, 2007 on Form 10-Q, and any amendments thereto.
