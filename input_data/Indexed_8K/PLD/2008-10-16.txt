ITEM 2.02. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
On October 16, 2008, we issued a press release entitled "AMB Property Corporation Announces Third Quarter 2008 Results," which sets forth disclosure regarding our results of operations for the third quarter of 2008. A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1. This section and the attached exhibit are provided under Item 2.02 of Form 8-K and are furnished to, but not filed with, the Securities and Exchange Commission.
ITEM 8.01 OTHER EVENTS
On October 16, 2008, we reported results for the third quarter and first nine months of 2008. Funds from operations per fully diluted share and unit ("FFOPS") was $0.70 for the third quarter of 2008, as compared to $0.99 for the same quarter in 2007. The year-over-year variance is primarily related to timing of gains on contribution of development properties to the company's private capital co-investment ventures. FFOPS for the nine months ended September 30, 2008 was $2.41, as compared to $2.31 for the same period in 2007.
Net income available to common stockholders per fully diluted share ("EPS") for the third quarter of 2008 was $0.24, as compared to $0.69 for the same quarter in 2007. EPS for the nine months ended September 30, 2008 was $1.37, as compared to $2.04 for the same period in 2007.
Owned and Managed Portfolio Operating Results
AMB's operating portfolio was 95.4 percent occupied at September 30, 2008, up 20 basis points from June 30, 2008. Cash-basis same store net operating income ("SSNOI"), without the effects of lease termination fees, increased 3.5 percent in the third quarter and 4.9 percent in the first nine months of 2008, over the same periods in 2007. For the trailing four quarters ended September 30, 2008, average rent change on renewals and rollovers in AMB's operating portfolio increased 4.1 percent, following an average increase of 4.3 percent for the trailing four quarters ended June 30, 2008.
Investment Activity
During the quarter, the company commenced development on 1.6 million square feet in the Americas and Europe, with an estimated total investment of $132 million. At quarter end, AMB's development pipeline, which included investments held through unconsolidated joint ventures, totaled approximately 17.8 million square feet globally, with an estimated total investment of $1.5 billion.
The company's development business includes contributions of stabilized properties to affiliated private capital co-investment ventures or sale of projects to third parties. During the third quarter, AMB contributed or sold 2.2 million square feet in the Americas and Asia, including contributions to three of its co-investment ventures, for an aggregate value of approximately $192 million.
Also during the quarter, AMB acquired 1.6 million square feet of industrial distribution space for an aggregate acquisition cost of approximately $140 million. Property and land acquisitions
Table of Contents
during the quarter expanded AMB's presence in target markets in the Americas and Asia, including Beijing and Guangzhou, which were market entries for AMB.
Financing Activities
During the quarter, AMB closed a $230 million, two-year secured term loan priced at LIBOR plus 130 basis points. The loan includes a one-year extension, which can be exercised at the company's option. Additionally, AMB closed on $768 million in property level financings in the U.S., Europe and Japan.
Organizational Update
As previously announced in the quarter, AMB acquired the remaining 42 percent equity interest in G. Accion, S.A. de C.V. ("G. Accion") that it had not previously owned. G.Accion is now a wholly owned subsidiary and has been renamed AMB Property Mexico. This newly unified platform will continue to develop, lease, acquire and operate industrial real estate in Mexico.
During the quarter, AMB and the City and County of San Francisco Employees' Retirement System contributed their interests in AMB Partners II, a co-investment venture comprising 10.3 million square feet of U.S. industrial property, to AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III in exchange for partnership interests in Fund III.
Supplemental Earnings Measure
Included in the footnotes to the company's attached financial statements is a discussion of why management believes FFOPS is a useful supplemental measure of operating performance, ways in which investors might use FFOPS when assessing the company's financial performance and FFOPS's limitations as a measurement tool. Reconciliation from net income to funds from operations and FFOPS is provided in the attached tables and published in the company's quarterly supplemental analyst package, available on the company's website at www.amb.com. The company believes that net income, as defined by GAAP, is the most appropriate earnings measure. However, the company considers cash-basis same store net operating income (SSNOI) to be a useful supplemental measure of its operating performance. Properties that are considered part of the same store pool include all properties that were owned as of the end of both the current and prior year reporting periods and exclude development properties for both the current and prior reporting periods. The same store pool is set annually and excludes properties purchased and developments stabilized after December 31, 2006. In deriving SSNOI, the company defines NOI as rental revenues, including reimbursements, less property operating expenses, both of which are calculated in accordance with GAAP. Property operating expenses exclude depreciation, amortization, general and administrative expenses and interest expense. The company defines SSNOI to also exclude straight-line rents and amortization of lease intangibles. The company considers SSNOI to be an appropriate and useful supplemental performance measure because it reflects the operating performance of the real estate portfolio excluding effects of non-cash adjustments and provides a better measure of actual cash basis rental growth for a year-over-year comparison. In addition, the company believes that SSNOI helps the investing public compare the company's operating performance with that of other
Table of Contents
companies. While SSNOI is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance of real estate investment trusts, it does not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to those measures in evaluating the company's liquidity or operating performance. SSNOI also does not reflect general and administrative expenses, interest expense, depreciation and amortization costs, capital expenditures and leasing costs, or trends in development and construction activities that could materially impact its results from operations. Further, the company's computation of SSNOI may not be comparable to that of other real estate companies, as they may use different methodologies for calculating SSNOI. Reconciliation from net income to SSNOI is published in the company's quarterly supplemental analyst package, available on the company's website at www.amb.com.
"Owned and managed" is defined by the company as assets in which the company has at least a 10 percent ownership interest, is the property or asset manager, and which it intends to hold for the long-term.
AMB Property Corporation is a global developer and owner of industrial real estate, focused on major hub and gateway distribution markets in the Americas, Europe and Asia. As of September 30, 2008, AMB owned, or had investments in, on a consolidated basis or through unconsolidated joint ventures, properties and development projects expected to total approximately 158.4 million square feet (14.7 million square meters) in 49 markets within 15 countries. AMB invests in properties located predominantly in the infill submarkets of its targeted markets. The company's portfolio is comprised of High Throughput Distribution facilitiesindustrial properties built for speed and located near airports, seaports and ground transportation systems.

In connection with the formation of a co-investment venture, AMB may warehouse assets that are acquired with the intent to contribute these assets to the newly formed venture. Some of the properties held for contribution may, under certain circumstances, be required to be depreciated under U.S. GAAP. If this circumstance arises, AMB intends to include in its calculation of FFO gains or losses related to the contribution of previously depreciated real estate to joint ventures. Although such a change, if instituted, will be a departure from the current NAREIT definition, AMB believes such calculation of FFO will better reflect the value created as a result of the
Table of Contents
contributions. To date, AMB has not included gains or losses from the contribution of previously depreciated warehoused assets in FFO.
AMB believes that FFO and FFOPS are meaningful supplemental measures of its operating performance because historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with U.S. GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time, as reflected through depreciation and amortization expenses. However, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market and other conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient. Thus, FFO and FFOPS are supplemental measures of operating performance for real estate investment trusts that exclude historical cost depreciation and amortization, among other items, from net income, as defined by U.S. GAAP. AMB believes that the use of FFO and FFOPS, combined with the required U.S. GAAP presentations, has been beneficial in improving the understanding of operating results of real estate investment trusts among the investing public and making comparisons of operating results among such companies more meaningful. AMB considers FFO and FFOPS to be useful measures for reviewing comparative operating and financial performance because, by excluding gains or losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets and real estate depreciation and amortization, FFO and FFOPS can help the investing public compare the operating performance of a company's real estate between periods or as compared to other companies. While FFO and FFOPS are relevant and widely used measures of operating performance of real estate investment trusts, these measures do not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to those measures in evaluating AMB's liquidity or operating performance. FFO and FFOPS also do not consider the costs associated with capital expenditures related to AMB's real estate assets nor are FFO or FFOPS necessarily indicative of cash available to fund AMB's future cash requirements.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
AMB PROPERTY CORPORATION
ANNOUNCES THIRD QUARTER 2008 RESULTS
SAN FRANCISCO, October 16, 2008  AMB Property Corporation (NYSE: AMB), a leading global developer and owner of industrial real estate, today reported results for the third quarter and first nine months of 2008. Funds from operations per fully diluted share and unit ("FFOPS") was $0.70 for the third quarter of 2008, as compared to $0.99 for the same quarter in 2007. The year-over-year variance is primarily related to timing of gains on contribution of development properties to the company's private capital co-investment ventures. FFOPS for the nine months ended September 30, 2008 was $2.41, as compared to $2.31 for the same period in 2007.
Net income available to common stockholders per fully diluted share ("EPS") for the third quarter of 2008 was $0.24, as compared to $0.69 for the same quarter in 2007. EPS for the nine months ended September 30, 2008 was $1.37, as compared to $2.04 for the same period in 2007.
Owned and Managed Portfolio Operating Results
AMB's operating portfolio was 95.4 percent occupied at September 30, 2008, up 20 basis points from June 30, 2008. Cash-basis same store net operating income ("SSNOI"), without the effects of lease termination fees, increased 3.5 percent in the third quarter and 4.9 percent in the first nine months of 2008, over the same periods in 2007. For the trailing four quarters ended September 30, 2008, average rent change on renewals and rollovers in AMB's operating portfolio increased 4.1 percent, following an average increase of 4.3 percent for the trailing four quarters ended June 30, 2008.
"We continue to run AMB for the long term. Our operating fundamentals remained solid through the third quarter as a result of our long-established focus on the best markets around the globe," said Hamid R. Moghadam, AMB's chairman & CEO. "The environment became more challenging at the beginning of the fourth quarter, so it may be difficult to keep this pace of growth into 2009. However, we are confident that AMB's strategy, people and portfolio will outperform on a relative basis, even in a more difficult economic environment. We remain focused on sound execution and long-term value preservation."
Investment Activity
During the quarter, the company commenced development on 1.6 million square feet in the Americas and Europe, with an estimated total investment of $132 million. At quarter end, AMB's development pipeline, which included investments held through unconsolidated joint ventures, totaled approximately 17.8 million square feet globally, with an estimated total investment of $1.5 billion.
The company's development business includes contributions of stabilized properties to affiliated private capital co-investment ventures or sale of projects to third parties. During the third quarter, AMB contributed or sold 2.2 million square feet in the Americas and Asia, including contributions to three of its co-investment ventures, for an aggregate value of approximately $192 million.
 
Also during the quarter, AMB acquired 1.6 million square feet of industrial distribution space for an aggregate acquisition cost of approximately $140 million. Property and land acquisitions during the quarter expanded AMB's presence in target markets in the Americas and Asia, including Beijing and Guangzhou, which were market entries for AMB.
"Given the current turbulence, lack of clarity on pricing and availability of capital we intend to be increasingly selective with our capital deployment decisions. We plan to start projects only where the market demand is sound and where profit expectations justify the risks. As such, we expect the pace of development starts to slow considerably from our previous outlook," Mr. Moghadam added.
Financing Activities
"The instability in the credit markets, which have become more volatile over the past few weeks, has made financing transactions increasingly difficult," said Thomas S. Olinger, AMB's chief financial officer. "While the timing, availability and pricing have become unpredictable, our balance sheet remains strong and we have the capacity to continue to support our business."
During the quarter, AMB closed a $230 million, two-year secured term loan priced at LIBOR plus 130 basis points. The loan includes a one-year extension, which can be exercised at the company's option. Additionally, AMB closed on $768 million in property level financings in the U.S., Europe and Japan.
2008 Guidance
Due to the change in the timing of certain transactions, caused primarily by the turmoil in financing markets, the company is lowering its full year 2008 FFO guidance to $3.05 to $3.10 per share. Full year EPS guidance has also been lowered to $1.58 to $1.63 per share. The company will provide details of its revised outlook for 2009 during their third quarter earnings conference call.
Organizational Update
As previously announced in the quarter, AMB acquired the remaining 42 percent equity interest in G. Accion, S.A. de C.V. ("G. Accion") that it had not previously owned. G. Accion is now a wholly owned subsidiary and has been renamed AMB Property Mexico. This newly unified platform will continue to develop, lease, acquire and operate industrial real estate in Mexico.
During the quarter, AMB and the City and County of San Francisco Employees' Retirement System contributed their interests in AMB Partners II, a co-investment venture comprising 10.3 million square feet of U.S. industrial property, to AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III in exchange for partnership interests in Fund III.

AMB CONTACTS
 
 
 
 
In connection with the formation of a co-investment venture, AMB may warehouse assets that are acquired with the intent to contribute these assets to the newly formed venture. Some of the properties held for contribution may, under certain circumstances, be required to be depreciated under U.S. GAAP. If this circumstance arises, AMB intends to include in its calculation of FFO gains or losses related to the contribution of previously depreciated real estate to joint ventures. Although such a change, if instituted, will be a departure from the current NAREIT definition, AMB believes such calculation of FFO will better reflect the value created as a result of the contributions. To date, AMB has not included gains or losses from the contribution of previously depreciated warehoused assets in FFO.
AMB believes that FFO and FFOPS are meaningful supplemental measures of its operating performance because historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with U.S. GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time, as reflected through depreciation and amortization expenses. However, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market and other conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient. Thus, FFO and FFOPS are supplemental measures of operating performance for real estate investment trusts that exclude historical cost depreciation and amortization, among other items, from net income, as defined by U.S. GAAP. AMB believes that the use of FFO and FFOPS, combined with the required U.S. GAAP presentations, has been beneficial in improving the understanding of operating results of real estate investment trusts among the investing public and making comparisons of operating results among such companies more meaningful. AMB considers FFO and FFOPS to be useful measures for reviewing comparative operating and financial performance because, by excluding gains or losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets and real estate depreciation and amortization, FFO and FFOPS can help the investing public compare the operating performance of a company's real estate between periods or as compared to other companies. While FFO and FFOPS are relevant and widely used measures of operating performance of real estate investment trusts, these measures do not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to those measures in evaluating AMB's liquidity or operating performance. FFO and FFOPS also do not consider the costs associated with capital expenditures related to AMB's real estate assets nor are FFO or FFOPS necessarily indicative of cash available to fund AMB's future cash requirements.
