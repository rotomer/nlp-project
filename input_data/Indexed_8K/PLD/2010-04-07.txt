On April 7, 2010, we entered into an underwriting agreement with Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, as representatives of the several underwriters named in Schedule I thereto, in connection with the offer and sale by us of 15,800,000 shares of our common stock, par value $0.01 per share, at a price of $27.50 per share. We have granted the underwriters an option to purchase up to 2,370,000 additional shares of our common stock to cover over-allotments. We expect to receive net proceeds from this offering of approximately $416.4 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated transaction expenses payable by us of approximately $18.1 million (or approximately $479.0 million if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment in full). The shares are being offered and sold under a prospectus supplement and related prospectus filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to our shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-153379).

The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party in writing to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by the second and third sentences of this paragraph, the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 60 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request and (ii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of each indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement (x) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (y) does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified person.

          (d) To the extent the indemnification provided for in Section 8(a) or 8(b) is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or
 
liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the REIT and the Operating Partnership on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Shares or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the REIT and the Operating Partnership on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the REIT and the Operating Partnership on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the offering of the Shares shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds from the offering of the Shares (before deducting expenses) received by the REIT and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate Public Offering Price of the Shares. The relative fault of the REIT and the Operating Partnership on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the REIT or the Operating Partnership or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 8 are several in proportion to the respective number of Shares they have purchased hereunder, and not joint.
          (e) The REIT, the Operating Partnership and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in Section 8(d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Shares underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The remedies provided for in this Section 8 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.
          (f) The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in this Section 8 and the representations, warranties and other statements of the REIT and the Operating Partnership contained in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of any
 
Underwriter or any person controlling any Underwriter or by or on behalf of the REIT, the Operating Partnership or the REIT's officers or directors or any person controlling the REIT or the Operating Partnership and (iii) acceptance of and payment for any of the Shares.
     9. . The obligations of the Underwriters under this Agreement may be terminated at any time on or prior to the Closing Date, by notice to the REIT and the Operating Partnership from the Underwriters, without liability on the part of the Underwriters to the REIT and the Operating Partnership, if, prior to delivery and payment for the Shares, in the sole judgment of the Underwriters, (i) trading in any of the securities of the REIT or the Operating Partnership shall have been suspended by the Commission, by any exchange that lists such securities or in any over-the-counter market, (ii) trading in securities generally on the NYSE shall have been suspended or limited or minimum or maximum prices shall have been generally established on such exchange, or additional material governmental restrictions, not in force on the date of this Agreement, shall have been imposed upon trading in securities generally by such exchange or by order of the Commission or any court or other governmental authority, (iii) a general banking moratorium shall have been declared by either Federal or New York State authorities or (iv) any material adverse change in the financial or securities markets within or outside the United States or in political, financial or economic conditions within or outside the United States or any material outbreak or material escalation of hostilities within or outside the United States or declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war or other material calamity or crisis within or outside the United States, including, without limitation, an act of terrorism, shall have occurred the effect of any of which is such as to make it, in the judgment of the Underwriters, impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offering, sale or delivery of the Shares on the terms and in the manner contemplated by the Prospectus, the General Disclosure Package and this Agreement.
Termination
     10. This Agreement shall become effective upon the execution and delivery hereof by the parties hereto. If, on the Closing Date or the Option Closing Date, as the case may be, any one or more of the Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Shares that it has or they have agreed to purchase hereunder on such date, and the aggregate number of Shares which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase is not more than one-tenth of the aggregate number of the Shares to be purchased on such date, the other Underwriters shall be obligated severally in the proportions that the number of Firm Shares set forth opposite their respective names in bears to the aggregate number of Firm Shares set forth opposite the names of all such non-defaulting Underwriters, or in such other proportions as you may specify, to purchase the Shares which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase on such date; that in no event shall the number of Shares that any Underwriter has agreed to purchase pursuant to this Agreement be increased pursuant to this Section 10 by an amount in excess of one-ninth of such number of Shares without the written consent of such Underwriter. If, on the Closing Date, any Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Firm Shares and the aggregate number of Firm Shares with respect to which such default occurs is more than one-tenth of the aggregate number of Firm Shares to be purchased and arrangements satisfactory to the Representatives and the REIT for the purchase of such Firm Shares are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the REIT. In any such case, either the Representatives or the REIT shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date, but in no event for longer than

seven (7) days, in order that the required changes, if any, in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus and the General Disclosure Package or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. If, on the Option Closing Date, any Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Additional Shares and the aggregate number of Additional Shares with respect to which such default occurs is more than one-tenth of the aggregate number of Additional Shares to be purchased, the non-defaulting Underwriters shall have the option to (i) terminate their obligation hereunder to purchase Additional Shares or (ii) purchase not less than the number of Additional Shares that such non-defaulting Underwriters would have been obligated to purchase in the absence of such default. Any action taken under this paragraph shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement.
     If this Agreement shall be terminated by the Underwriters, or any of them, because of any failure or refusal on the part of the REIT or the Operating Partnership to comply with the terms or to fulfill any of the conditions of this Agreement, or if for any reason the REIT or the Operating Partnership shall be unable to perform their obligations under this Agreement, the REIT and the Operating Partnership will, jointly and severally, reimburse the Underwriters or such Underwriters as have so terminated this Agreement with respect to themselves, severally, for all out-of-pocket expenses (including the fees and disbursements of their counsel) reasonably incurred by such Underwriters in connection with this Agreement or the offering contemplated hereunder.
     11. . All representations, warranties, agreements and covenants of the REIT and the Operating Partnership herein or in certificates delivered pursuant hereto and the agreements of the Underwriters in Section 8 herein shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling persons, or the REIT or the Operating Partnership or any of its officers, trustees, or any controlling persons, and shall survive (i) termination of this Agreement and (ii) delivery of and payment for the Shares hereunder.

The term "successors and assigns" as used in this Agreement shall not include a purchaser, as such purchaser, of Shares from the Underwriters.
