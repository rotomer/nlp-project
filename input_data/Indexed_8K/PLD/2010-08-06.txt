On August 4, 2010, AMB Property Corporation's operating partnership, AMB Property, L.P. (the "Operating Partnership"), offered $300 million aggregate principal amount of its new series of 4.500% notes due 2017 in an underwritten registered public offering. The offering was made pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on August 14, 2009. The offering is expected to close on August 9, 2010, subject to certain closing conditions. The notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Operating Partnership and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by AMB Property Corporation. The notes are governed by the terms of an Indenture dated as of June 30, 1998 among the Operating Partnership, AMB Property Corporation and U.S. Bank National Association (as successor-in-interest to State Street Bank and Trust Company of California, N.A.), and a Tenth Supplemental Indenture to be dated as of August 9, 2010 among the Operating Partnership, AMB Property Corporation and U.S. Bank National Association, filed as Exhibit 4.1 hereto.
The notes are subject to redemption at the Operating Partnership's option at any time in whole or, from time to time, in part, at a price equal to the greater of: (i) 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed and (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon (exclusive of interest accrued to such redemption date) discounted to such redemption date on a semiannual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Rate plus 37.5 basis points, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount being redeemed to such redemption date; provided that installments of interest on the notes which are due and payable on an interest payment date falling on or prior to the relevant redemption date shall be payable to the holders of such of the notes registered at the close of business on the relevant record date according to their terms and the provisions of the Indenture.
The estimated net proceeds to the Operating Partnership were approximately $294.2 million after deducting the underwriting discounts and estimated transaction expenses payable by the Operating Partnership of $2.6 million. The Operating Partnership intends to use approximately $205 million of the net proceeds to reduce U.S. dollar borrowings under its $425.0 million multi-currency senior unsecured term loan facility. The Operating Partnership intends to use approximately $65.8 million of the net proceeds to repay the outstanding amount under one of its secured mortgage instruments. The Operating Partnership intends to use approximately $10 million of the net proceeds to repay U.S. dollar borrowings under its $550 million unsecured revolving credit facility. The Operating Partnership intends to use any remaining net proceeds for general corporate purposes, which may include equity investments in co-investment funds, acquisitions of properties, portfolios of properties or interests in property-owning or real estate-related entities; development, redevelopment or value-added conversion activities; the repayment of indebtedness (which may include intercompany indebtedness); the redemption or other repurchase of outstanding securities; loans to affiliated entities; capital expenditures and increasing its working capital. Pending such use of the net proceeds, the Operating Partnership may use the net proceeds to invest in short-term securities.
In connection with the offering of the notes, AMB Property Corporation entered into an underwriting agreement dated August 4, 2010 with J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., Banc of America Securities LLC, Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, as representatives of the several underwriters, which is filed as Exhibit 1.1 hereto.
In connection with the filing of the underwriting agreement, we are filing as Exhibit 5.1 hereto an opinion of our counsel, Ballard Spahr LLP, regarding certain Maryland law issues. Additionally, in connection with the filing of the underwriting agreement, we are filing as Exhibit 5.2 hereto an opinion of our counsel, Latham & Watkins LLP, regarding the validity of the securities being registered.
Due to a typographical error, the CUSIP for the notes was incorrectly reported in the issuer free writing prospectus filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on August 4, 2010. The correct CUSIP for the notes is 00163M AL8.
The description in this current report of the notes and the supplemental indenture is not intended to be a complete description of those instruments, and the description is qualified in its entirety by the full text of the documents which are attached as exhibits to, and incorporated by reference in, this Current Report.

No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of each indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement (x) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (y) does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified person.
          (d) To the extent the indemnification provided for in Section 8(a) or 8(b) is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the REIT and the Operating Partnership on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the REIT and the Operating Partnership on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the REIT and the Operating Partnership on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the offering of the Securities shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds from the offering of the Securities (before deducting expenses) received by the REIT and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate Public Offering Price of the Securities. The relative fault of the REIT and the Operating Partnership on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the REIT or the Operating Partnership or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 8 are several in proportion to the respective principal amount of Notes (including Guarantees) they have purchased hereunder, and not joint.
          (e) The REIT, the Operating Partnership and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to
 
in Section 8(d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The remedies provided for in this Section 8 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.
          (f) The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in this Section 8 and the representations, warranties and other statements of the REIT and the Operating Partnership contained in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any person controlling any Underwriter or by or on behalf of the REIT, the Operating Partnership or the REIT's officers or directors or any person controlling the REIT or the Operating Partnership, and (iii) acceptance of and payment for any of the Securities.
     9. The obligations of the Underwriters under this Agreement may be terminated at any time on or prior to the Closing Date, by notice to the REIT and the Operating Partnership from the Underwriters, without liability on the part of the Underwriters to the REIT and the Operating Partnership, if, prior to delivery and payment for the Securities, in the sole judgment of the Underwriters, (i) trading in any of the securities of the REIT or the Operating Partnership shall have been suspended by the Commission, by any exchange that lists such securities or in any over-the-counter market, (ii) trading in securities generally on the NYSE shall have been suspended or limited or minimum or maximum prices shall have been generally established on such exchange, or additional material governmental restrictions, not in force on the date of this Agreement, shall have been imposed upon trading in securities generally by such exchange or by order of the Commission or any court or other governmental authority, (iii) a general banking moratorium shall have been declared by either Federal or New York State authorities, (iv) any major disruption of settlements of securities or clearance services in the United States shall have occurred, or (v) any material adverse change in the financial or securities markets within or outside the United States or in political, financial or economic conditions within or outside the United States or any material outbreak or material escalation of hostilities within or outside the United States or declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war or other material calamity or crisis within or outside the United States, including, without limitation, an act of terrorism, shall have occurred the effect of any of which is such as to make it, in the judgment of the Underwriters, impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offering, sale or delivery of the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated by the Prospectus, the General Disclosure Package and this Agreement.

If, on the Closing Date, any Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Notes (including Guarantees) and the aggregate principal amount of Notes (including Guarantees) with respect to which such default occurs is more than one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of Notes (including Guarantees) to be purchased and arrangements satisfactory to the Representatives and the Company for the purchase of such Notes (including Guarantees) are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company.

Any action taken under this paragraph shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement.

Any such interest which is payable, but is not punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date shall forthwith cease to be payable to the registered Holder hereof on the relevant Regular Record Date by virtue of having been such Holder,
 
and may be paid to the Person in whose name this Note (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the Trustee, notice whereof shall be given to the Holder of this Note not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date, or may be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Notes may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in such Indenture.

This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of Securities of the Operating Partnership (herein called the "Notes") issued and to be issued under an Indenture dated as of June 30, 1998 (herein called, together with all indentures supplemental thereto, the "Indenture") among, the Operating Partnership, AMB Property Corporation and U.S. Bank National Association, as successor-in-interest to State Street Bank and Trust Company of California, N.A., as trustee (herein called the "Trustee", which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Operating Partnership, the Trustee and the Holders of the Notes, and the terms upon which the Notes are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Note is one of the Securities of the series designated on the face hereof, limited in aggregate principal amount to $300,000,000.
The Notes are subject to redemption prior to the Stated Maturity of the principal thereof as provided in the Indenture.
If an Event of Default with respect to the Notes shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Notes may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Operating Partnership and the rights of the Holders of the Notes of each series issued under the Indenture at any time by the Operating Partnership and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes at the time Outstanding of each series affected thereby. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in aggregate principal amount of the Notes of any series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Notes of such series, to waive compliance by the Operating Partnership with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Note and of any Notes issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note.
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Operating Partnership, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Note, at the time, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein and in the Indenture prescribed.
 
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations set forth therein, the transfer of this Note may be registered on the Security Register upon surrender of this Note for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Operating Partnership maintained for the purpose in any place where the principal of and interest on this Note are payable, duly endorsed, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Operating Partnership and the Security Registrar duly executed by the Holder hereof or by his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Notes, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees. The Notes are issuable only in registered form without coupons in the denominations of $1,000 and integral multiples thereof. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations set forth therein, the Notes are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Notes of authorized denominations as requested by the Holders surrendering the same.
No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Operating Partnership may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith, other than in certain cases provided in the Indenture.
Prior to due presentment of this Note for registration of transfer, the Operating Partnership, the Trustee and any agent of the Operating Partnership or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Note is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Note be overdue, and neither the Operating Partnership, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
The Indenture contains provisions whereby (i) the Operating Partnership may be discharged from its obligations with respect to the Notes (subject to certain exceptions) or (ii) the Operating Partnership may be released from its obligations under specified covenants and agreements in the Indenture, in each case if the Operating Partnership irrevocably deposits with the Trustee money or Government Obligations sufficient to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on all Securities, and satisfies certain other conditions, all as more fully provided in the Indenture.
THIS NOTE SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INTERNAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.
Capitalized terms used in this Note which are not defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.
Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by or on behalf of the Trustee under the Indenture by the manual signature of one of its authorized signatories, this Note shall not be entitled to any benefits under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.

THIS PARENT GUARANTEE SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INTERNAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.
This Parent Guarantee shall not be valid or obligatory for any purpose until the certificate of authentication on the Note shall have been executed by the Trustee under the Indenture referred to above by the manual signature of one of its authorized officers. The validity and enforceability of this Parent Guarantee shall not be affected by the fact that it is not affixed to any particular Note.
An Event of Default under the Indenture or the Notes shall constitute an event of default under this Parent Guarantee, and shall entitle the Holders of Notes to accelerate the obligations of the undersigned hereunder in the same manner and to the same extent as the obligations of the Operating Partnership.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Parent Guarantee to the contrary, the undersigned hereby waives any claims or other rights which it may now have or hereafter acquire against the Operating Partnership that arise from the existence or performance of its obligations under this Parent Guarantee (all such claims and rights are referred to as "Guarantor's Conditional Rights"), including, without limitation, any right of subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration, contribution, or indemnification, any right to participate in any claim or remedy against the Operating Partnership, whether or not such claim, remedy or right arises in equity or under contract, statute or common law, by any payment made hereunder or otherwise, including without limitation, the right to take or receive from the Operating Partnership, directly or indirectly, in cash or other property or by setoff or in any other manner, payment or security on account of such claim or other rights. Guarantor hereby agrees not to exercise any rights which may be acquired by way of contribution under this Parent Guarantee or any other agreement, by any payment made hereunder or otherwise, including, without limitation, the right to take or receive from any other guarantor, directly or indirectly, in cash or other property or by setoff or in any other manner, payment or security on account of such contribution rights. If, notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, any amount shall be paid to the undersigned on account of the Guarantor's Conditional Rights and either (i) such amount is paid to such undersigned party at any time when the indebtedness shall not have been paid or performed in full, or (ii) regardless of when such amount is paid to such undersigned party, any payment made by the Operating Partnership to a Holder that is at any time determined to be a Preferential Payment (as defined below), then such amount paid to the undersigned shall be held in trust for the benefit of Holder and shall forthwith be paid such Holder to be credited and applied upon the indebtedness, whether matured or unmatured. Any such payment is herein referred to as a "Preferential Payment" to the extent the Operating Partnership makes any payment to Holder in connection with the Note, and any or all of such payment is subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required to be repaid or paid over to a trustee, receiver or any other entity, whether under any bankruptcy act or otherwise.
To the extent that any of the provisions of the immediately preceding paragraph shall not be enforceable, the undersigned agrees that until such time as the indebtedness has been paid and performed in full and the period of time has expired during which any payment made by the Operating Partnership or the undersigned to a Holder may be determined to be a Preferential Payment, Guarantor's Conditional Rights
 
to the extent not validly waived shall be subordinate to Holders' right to full payment and performance of the indebtedness and the undersigned shall not enforce any of Guarantor's Conditional Rights until such time as the indebtedness has been paid and performed in full and the period of time has expired during which any payment made by the Operating Partnership or the undersigned to Holders may be determined to be a Preferential Payment.
The obligations of the undersigned to the Holders of the Notes and to the Trustee pursuant to this Parent Guarantee and the Indenture are expressly set forth in Article 14 of the Indenture and reference is hereby made to the Indenture for the precise terms of this Parent Guarantee and all of the other provisions of the Indenture to which this Parent Guarantee relates.

require a proceeding first against the Operating Partnership, protest or notice with respect to such Notice or the indebtedness evidenced thereby and all demands whatsoever, and covenants that this Subsidiary Guarantee will not be discharged except by complete performance of the obligations contained in such Note and in this Subsidiary Guarantee. No reference herein to such Indenture and no provision of this Subsidiary Guarantee or of such Indenture shall alter or impair the guarantee of the undersigned, which is absolute and unconditional, of the full and prompt payment of the principal of and premium, if any, and interest on the Note.
THIS SUBSIDIARY GUARANTEE SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INTERNAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.
The validity and enforceability of this Subsidiary Guarantee shall not be affected by the fact that it is not affixed to any particular Note.
An Event of Default under the Indenture or the Notes shall constitute an event of default under this Subsidiary Guarantee, and shall entitle the Holders of Notes to accelerate the obligations of the undersigned hereunder in the same manner and to the same extent as the obligations of the Operating Partnership.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Subsidiary Guarantee to the contrary, the undersigned hereby waives any claims or other rights which it may now have or hereafter acquire against the Operating Partnership that arise from the existence or performance of its obligations under this Subsidiary Guarantee (all such claims and rights are referred to as "Guarantor's Conditional Rights"), including, without limitation, any right of subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration, contribution, or indemnification, any right to participate in any claim or remedy against the Operating Partnership, whether or not such claim, remedy or right arises in equity or under contract, statute or common law, by any payment made hereunder or otherwise, including without limitation, the right to take or receive from the Operating Partnership, directly or indirectly, in cash or other property or by setoff or in any other manner, payment or security on account of such claim or other rights. The Subsidiary Guarantor hereby agrees not to exercise any rights which may be acquired by way of contribution under this Subsidiary Guarantee or any other agreement, by any payment made hereunder or otherwise, including, without limitation, the right to take or receive from any other guarantor, directly or indirectly, in cash or other property or by setoff or in any other manner, payment or security on account of such contribution rights. If, notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, any amount shall be paid to the undersigned on account of any such Guarantor's Conditional Rights and either (i) such amount is paid to such undersigned party at any time when the indebtedness shall not have been paid or performed in full, or (ii) regardless of when such amount is paid to such undersigned party, any payment made by Operating Partnership to a Holder that is at any time determined to be a Preferential Payment (as defined below), then such amount paid to any of the undersigned shall be held in trust for the benefit of the Holders and shall forthwith be paid such Holder to be credited and applied upon the indebtedness, whether matured or unmatured. Any such payment is herein referred to as a "Preferential Payment" to the extent the Operating Partnership makes any payment to the Holders in connection with the Note, and any or all of such payment is subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required to be repaid or paid over to a trustee, receiver or any other entity, whether under any bankruptcy act or otherwise.
To the extent that any of the provisions of the immediately preceding paragraph shall not be enforceable, each of the undersigned agrees that until such time as the indebtedness has been paid and performed in full and the period of time has expired during which any payment made by the Operating Partnership or the undersigned to a Holder may be determined to be a Preferential Payment, Guarantor's Conditional Rights to the extent not validly waived shall be subordinate to Holders' right to full payment and performance of the indebtedness and each of the undersigned shall not enforce any of its respective
 
portion of the Guarantors' Conditional Rights until such time as the indebtedness has been paid and performed in full and the period of time has expired during which any payment made by the Operating Partnership or the undersigned to Holders may be determined to be a Preferential Payment.
The undersigned's liability shall be that amount from time to time equal to the aggregate liability of the undersigned hereunder, but shall be limited to the lesser of (A) the aggregate amount of the obligation as stated in the second sentence of Section 1401 of the Indenture, and (B) the amount, if any, which would not have (i) rendered the undersigned "insolvent" (as such term is defined in Section 101(29) of the Federal Bankruptcy Code and in Section 271 of the Debtor and Creditor Law of the State of New York, as each is in effect at the date of the Indenture) or (ii) left the undersigned with unreasonably small capital at the time its Guarantee was entered into, after giving effect to the incurrence of existing Debt (as defined in the Indenture) immediately prior to such time, provided that, it shall be a presumption in any lawsuit or other proceeding in which the undersigned is a party that the amount guaranteed is the amount set forth in (A) above unless a creditor, or representative of creditors of the undersigned or a trustee in bankruptcy of the undersigned, as debtor in possession, otherwise proves in such a lawsuit that the aggregate liability of the undersigned is limited to the amount set forth in (B). In making any determination as to the solvency or sufficiency of capital of the undersigned in accordance with the previous sentence, the right of the undersigned to contribution from other Guarantors, to subrogation and any other rights the undersigned may have, contractual or otherwise, shall be taken into account.
The obligations of the undersigned to the Holders of the Notes and to the Trustee pursuant to the Subsidiary Guarantee and the Indenture are expressly set forth in Article 14 of the Indenture and reference is hereby made to the Indenture for the precise terms of the Subsidiary Guarantee and all of the other provisions of the Indenture to which this Subsidiary Guarantee relates.

THIS SECURITY IS EXCHANGEABLE FOR SECURITIES REGISTERED IN THE NAME OF A PERSON OTHER THAN THE DEPOSITARY OR ITS NOMINEE ONLY IN THE LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES DESCRIBED IN THE INDENTURE AND, UNLESS AND UNTIL IT IS EXCHANGED IN WHOLE OR IN PART FOR SECURITIES IN DEFINITIVE FORM, THIS SECURITY MAY NOT BE TRANSFERRED EXCEPT AS A WHOLE BY THE DEPOSITARY TO A NOMINEE OF THE DEPOSITARY OR BY A NOMINEE OF THE DEPOSITARY TO THE DEPOSITARY OR ANOTHER NOMINEE OF THE DEPOSITARY OR BY THE DEPOSITARY OR ANY SUCH NOMINEE TO A SUCCESSOR DEPOSITARY OR A NOMINEE OF SUCH SUCCESSOR DEPOSITARY.
UNLESS THIS SECURITY IS PRESENTED BY AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DEPOSITORY TRUST COMPANY, A NEW YORK CORPORATION ("DTC"), TO THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP (AS DEFINED BELOW) OR ITS AGENT FOR REGISTRATION OF TRANSFER, EXCHANGE OR PAYMENT, AND ANY SECURITY ISSUED IS REGISTERED IN THE NAME OF CEDE & CO. OR IN SUCH OTHER NAME AS REQUESTED BY AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF DTC (AND ANY PAYMENT IS MADE TO CEDE & CO. OR TO SUCH OTHER ENTITY AS IS REQUESTED BY AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF DTC), ANY TRANSFER, PLEDGE OR OTHER USE HEREOF FOR VALUE OR OTHERWISE BY OR TO ANY PERSON IS WRONGFUL INASMUCH AS THE REGISTERED OWNER HEREOF, CEDE & CO., HAS AN INTEREST HEREIN.
AMB Property, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (hereinafter called the "Operating Partnership", which term includes any successor under the Indenture referred to below), for value received, hereby promises to pay to CEDE & CO., or registered assigns, the principal sum of THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ($300,000,000) on August 15, 2017, and to pay interest thereon from August 9, 2010 or from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, semiannually on February 15 and August 15 of each year (each, an "Interest Payment Date"), commencing February 15, 2011, and at Maturity, at the rate of 4.500% per annum, until the principal hereof is paid or duly made available for payment. Interest on this Note shall be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. The interest so payable and punctually paid or duly provided for on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in such Indenture, be paid to the Person in whose name this Note (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest, which shall be February 1 or August 1 (whether or not a Business Day), as the case may be, immediately preceding such Interest Payment Date. Any such interest which is payable, but is not punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date shall forthwith cease to be payable to the registered Holder hereof on the relevant Regular Record Date by virtue of having been such Holder, and may be paid to the Person in whose name this Note (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest to
 
be fixed by the Trustee, notice whereof shall be given to the Holder of this Note not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date, or may be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Notes may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in such Indenture.
Payment of the principal of and the interest on this Note will be made at the office or agency of the Operating Partnership maintained for that purpose in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts; provided, however, that, at the option of the Operating Partnership, interest may be paid by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address shall appear in the Security Register or by wire transfer to an account maintained by the payee located in the United States of America.
This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of Securities of the Operating Partnership (herein called the "Notes") issued and to be issued under an Indenture dated as of June 30, 1998 (herein called, together with all indentures supplemental thereto, the "Indenture") among, the Operating Partnership, AMB Property Corporation and U.S. Bank National Association, as successor-in-interest to State Street Bank and Trust Company of California, N.A., as trustee (herein called the "Trustee", which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Operating Partnership, the Trustee and the Holders of the Notes, and the terms upon which the Notes are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Note is one of the Securities of the series designated on the face hereof, limited in aggregate principal amount to $300,000,000.
The Notes are subject to redemption prior to the Stated Maturity of the principal thereof as provided in the Indenture.
If an Event of Default with respect to the Notes shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Notes may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Operating Partnership and the rights of the Holders of the Notes of each series issued under the Indenture at any time by the Operating Partnership and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes at the time Outstanding of each series affected thereby. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in aggregate principal amount of the Notes of any series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Notes of such series, to waive compliance by the Operating Partnership with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Note and of any Notes issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note.
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Operating Partnership, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Note, at the time, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein and in the Indenture prescribed.
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations set forth therein, the transfer of this Note may be registered on the Security Register upon surrender of this Note for registration of transfer at the
 
office or agency of the Operating Partnership maintained for the purpose in any place where the principal of and interest on this Note are payable, duly endorsed, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Operating Partnership and the Security Registrar duly executed by the Holder hereof or by his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Notes, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees. The Notes are issuable only in registered form without coupons in the denominations of $1,000 and integral multiples thereof. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations set forth therein, the Notes are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Notes of authorized denominations as requested by the Holders surrendering the same.
No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Operating Partnership may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith, other than in certain cases provided in the Indenture.
Prior to due presentment of this Note for registration of transfer, the Operating Partnership, the Trustee and any agent of the Operating Partnership or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Note is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Note be overdue, and neither the Operating Partnership, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
The Indenture contains provisions whereby (i) the Operating Partnership may be discharged from its obligations with respect to the Notes (subject to certain exceptions) or (ii) the Operating Partnership may be released from its obligations under specified covenants and agreements in the Indenture, in each case if the Operating Partnership irrevocably deposits with the Trustee money or Government Obligations sufficient to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on all Securities, and satisfies certain other conditions, all as more fully provided in the Indenture.
THIS NOTE SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INTERNAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.
Capitalized terms used in this Note which are not defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.
Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by or on behalf of the Trustee under the Indenture by the manual signature of one of its authorized signatories, this Note shall not be entitled to any benefits under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.

No reference herein to such Indenture and no provision of this Parent Guarantee or of such Indenture shall alter or impair the guarantee of the undersigned, which is absolute and unconditional, of the full and prompt payment of the principal of and premium, if any, and interest on the Note.
THIS PARENT GUARANTEE SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INTERNAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.
This Parent Guarantee shall not be valid or obligatory for any purpose until the certificate of authentication on the Note shall have been executed by the Trustee under the Indenture referred to above by the manual signature of one of its authorized officers. The validity and enforceability of this Parent Guarantee shall not be affected by the fact that it is not affixed to any particular Note.
An Event of Default under the Indenture or the Notes shall constitute an event of default under this Parent Guarantee, and shall entitle the Holders of Notes to accelerate the obligations of the undersigned hereunder in the same manner and to the same extent as the obligations of the Operating Partnership.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Parent Guarantee to the contrary, the undersigned hereby waives any claims or other rights which it may now have or hereafter acquire against the Operating Partnership that arise from the existence or performance of its obligations under this Parent Guarantee (all such claims and rights are referred to as "Guarantor's Conditional Rights"), including, without limitation, any right of subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration, contribution, or indemnification, any right to participate in any claim or remedy against the Operating Partnership, whether or not such claim, remedy or right arises in equity or under contract, statute or common law, by any payment made hereunder or otherwise, including without limitation, the right to take or receive from the Operating Partnership, directly or indirectly, in cash or other property or by setoff or in any other manner, payment or security on account of such claim or other rights. Guarantor hereby agrees not to exercise any rights which may be acquired by way of contribution under this Parent Guarantee or any other agreement, by any payment made hereunder or otherwise, including, without limitation, the right to take or receive from any other guarantor, directly or indirectly, in cash or other property or by setoff or in any other manner, payment or security on account of such contribution rights. If, notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, any amount shall be paid to the undersigned on account of the Guarantor's Conditional Rights and either (i) such amount is paid to such undersigned party at any time when the indebtedness shall not have been paid or performed in full, or (ii) regardless of when such amount is paid to such undersigned party, any payment made by the Operating Partnership to a Holder that is at any time determined to be a Preferential Payment (as defined below), then such amount paid to the undersigned shall be held in trust for the benefit of Holder and shall forthwith be paid such Holder to be credited and applied upon the indebtedness, whether matured or unmatured. Any such payment is herein referred to as a "Preferential Payment" to the extent the Operating Partnership makes any payment to Holder in connection with the Note, and any or all of such payment is subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required to be repaid or paid over to a trustee, receiver or any other entity, whether under any bankruptcy act or otherwise.
To the extent that any of the provisions of the immediately preceding paragraph shall not be enforceable, the undersigned agrees that until such time as the indebtedness has been paid and performed in full and the period of time has expired during which any payment made by the Operating Partnership or the undersigned to a Holder may be determined to be a Preferential Payment, Guarantor's Conditional Rights
 
to the extent not validly waived shall be subordinate to Holders' right to full payment and performance of the indebtedness and the undersigned shall not enforce any of Guarantor's Conditional Rights until such time as the indebtedness has been paid and performed in full and the period of time has expired during which any payment made by the Operating Partnership or the undersigned to Holders may be determined to be a Preferential Payment.
The obligations of the undersigned to the Holders of the Notes and to the Trustee pursuant to this Parent Guarantee and the Indenture are expressly set forth in Article 14 of the Indenture and reference is hereby made to the Indenture for the precise terms of this Parent Guarantee and all of the other provisions of the Indenture to which this Parent Guarantee relates.
Capitalized terms used in this Parent Guarantee which are not defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned has caused this Parent Guarantee to be duly executed.

DRULPA
     Subject to the foregoing and the other matters set forth herein, as of the date hereof:
          1. Assuming due authorization by the Guarantor on its own behalf and in its capacity as the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, when executed, issued and authenticated in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and the Prospectus, and delivered against payment therefor in the circumstances contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement, the Notes will be legally valid and binding obligations of the Operating Partnership, enforceable against the Operating Partnership in accordance with their terms.
          2. Assuming due authorization by the Guarantor on its own behalf and in its capacity as the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, when executed in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and the Prospectus, and delivered against payment therefor in the circumstances contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement, the Guarantees will be legally valid and binding obligations of the Guarantor, enforceable against the Guarantor in accordance with their terms.
     Our opinions are subject to: (i) the effect of bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, preference, fraudulent transfer, moratorium or other similar laws relating to or affecting the rights and remedies of creditors; (ii) the effect of general principles of equity, whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law (including the possible unavailability of specific performance or injunctive relief), concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing, and the discretion of the court before which a proceeding is brought; (iii) the invalidity under certain circumstances under law or court decisions of provisions providing for the indemnification of or contribution to a party with respect to a liability where such indemnification or contribution is contrary to public policy; and (iv) we express no opinion as to (a) any provision for liquidated damages, default interest, late charges, monetary penalties, make-whole premiums or other economic remedies to the extent such provisions are deemed to constitute a penalty, (b) consents to, or restrictions upon, governing law, jurisdiction, venue, arbitration, remedies or judicial relief, (c) the waiver of rights or defenses contained in Section
