     On November 29, 2010, AMB Property, L.P. ("we" or "us") entered into an unsecured term loan credit agreement for 153,711,023.28. AMB Property Corporation, our sole general partner, is a guarantor of our obligations under the credit facility. The new credit facility is with HSBC Bank USA, National Association, as administrative agent, Credit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, as syndication agent, HSBC Securities, Inc. and Credit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, as joint lead arrangers and joint bookrunners, Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., as documentation agent, and a syndicate of other banks. The credit facility allows us, and any other entity controlled, directly or indirectly, by us and which we have elected to add as a qualified borrower from time to time, to borrow loans.
     The credit facility matures on November 29, 2015. We have the ability to increase available borrowings up to 256,185,038.79 by adding additional banks to the facility or obtaining the agreement of existing banks to increase their commitments. The rate on the borrowings will generally be EURIBOR plus a margin which is based on the current credit rating of our long-term debt and is currently 200 basis points. The credit agreement contains customary and other affirmative covenants, including financial reporting requirements and maintenance of specified financial ratios by us, and negative covenants, including limitations on mergers or consolidations. In addition, the credit agreement includes customary events (including without limitation a non-payment under the loan, a breach of warranties and representations in any material respect, and non-compliance with covenants by us, any qualified borrower and AMB Property Corporation as guarantor), as well as certain other additional events (including without limitation a change in the majority of the board of directors of AMB Property Corporation during any 12-month period or the acquisition by a person or group of 30% or more of the common stock of AMB Property Corporation), each of which, if not cured within the time period, if any, specified in the credit agreement would constitute an event of default. Upon the occurrence and continuance of such events of default, the lenders may elect to accelerate the outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest under the credit facility. Further, outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest thereon automatically accelerate upon the occurrence of certain other events of default, including without limitation and as described more fully in the credit agreement, the commencement of any voluntary or involuntary proceeding seeking liquidation, reorganization or other relief of our debts or the debts of AMB Property Corporation under any bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law, or we or AMB Property Corporation seek at any time to repudiate our obligations under the credit agreement or any related document.
     A copy of the credit agreement, the guaranty by AMB Property Corporation and the qualified borrower guaranty by AMB Property, L.P. are attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1, 10.2 and 10.3, respectively, and are incorporated into this current report by reference.
     On December 1, 2010, AMB Japan Finance Y.K., a Japan tokurei yugen kaisha and our subsidiary, which is Yen functional, as the initial borrower, and we and our general partner, AMB Property Corporation, a Maryland corporation, as guarantors, entered into a second amended and restated revolving credit agreement for a JPY45 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that replaced our then existing JPY55 billion unsecured revolving credit facility executed on June 23, 2006 (as previously amended, the "existing credit agreement"). The second amended and restated credit facility is with Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, as administrative agent and sole lead arranger and bookrunner, and a syndicate of other banks. All outstanding loans under the existing credit agreement were continued under the second amended and restated credit agreement.
     The second amended and restated credit facility matures on March 1, 2014 and may be extended at our option for one year, subject to satisfaction of certain conditions and the payment of an extension fee equal to 0.35% of the outstanding commitments. We have the ability to increase available borrowings up to JPY65 billion by adding additional banks to the facility or obtaining the agreement of existing banks to increase their commitments. The rate on the borrowings will generally be Yen LIBOR plus a margin which is based on the current credit rating of our long-term debt and is currently 185 basis points. In addition, there is an annual facility fee, which is based on the credit rating of our long-term debt, and is currently 35 basis points. The second amended and restated credit facility also allows us, and any other entity controlled, directly or indirectly, by us and which we have elected to add as a qualified borrower from time to time, to borrow loans. The second amended and restated credit agreement contains customary and other affirmative covenants, including financial reporting requirements and maintenance of specified financial ratios by us and negative covenants, including limitations on mergers or consolidations. In addition, the second amended and restated credit agreement includes customary events (including without limitation a non-payment under the loan, a breach of warranties and representations in any material respect, and non-compliance with covenants by us, any qualified borrower and AMB Property Corporation as guarantor), as well as certain other additional events (including without limitation a change in the majority of the board of directors of AMB Property Corporation during any 12-month period or the acquisition by a person or group of 30% or more of the common stock of AMB Property Corporation), each of which, if not cured within the time period, if any, specified in the second amended and restated credit agreement would constitute an event of default. Upon the occurrence and continuance of such events of default, the lenders may elect to accelerate the outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest under the second amended and restated credit facility. Further, outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest thereon automatically accelerate upon the occurrence of certain other events of default, including without limitation and as described more fully in the second amended and restated credit agreement, the commencement of any voluntary or involuntary proceeding seeking liquidation, reorganization or other relief of our debts or the debts of AMB Property Corporation under any bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law, or we or AMB Property Corporation seek at any time to repudiate our obligations under the second amended and restated credit agreement or any related document.
     A copy of the credit agreement and the guaranty by AMB Property Corporation and AMB Property, L.P. are attached hereto as Exhibit 10.4 and 10.5, respectively, and are incorporated into this current report by reference.

(local time to the principal financial center) on the date when due, of funds immediately available in the principal financial center, to the Administrative Agent at its address referred to in Section 9.1, and the Borrower shall deliver a reference number evidencing such wire to Administrative Agent as soon as possible thereafter on the date when due. The Administrative Agent will promptly (and in any event within one (1) Euribor Business Day after receipt thereof) distribute to each Bank its ratable share of each such payment received by the Administrative Agent for the account of the Banks. If and to the extent that the Administrative Agent shall receive any such payment for the account of the Banks on or before 11:00 A.M. (local time to the principal financial center) on any Euribor Business Day, and Administrative Agent shall not have distributed to any Bank its applicable share of such payment on such day, Administrative Agent shall distribute such amount to such Bank together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount should have been distributed to such Bank until the date Administrative Agent distributes such amount to such Bank, at the Federal Funds Rate. Whenever any payment of principal of, or interest on the Base Rate Loans shall be due on a day which is not a Business Day, the date for payment thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day. Whenever any payment of principal of, or interest on, the Euribor Loans shall be due on a day which is not a Euribor Business Day, the date for payment thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Euribor Business Day unless such Euribor Business Day falls in another calendar month, in which case the date for payment thereof shall be the next preceding Euribor Business Day. If the date for any payment of principal is extended by operation of law or otherwise, interest thereon shall be payable for such extended time.
               (b) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Banks hereunder that the Borrower or Qualified Borrower, as the case may be, will not make such payment in full, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower or Qualified Borrower, as the case may be, has made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent on such date and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each Bank on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Bank. If and to the extent that the Borrower or Qualified Borrower, as the case may be, shall not have so made such payment, each Bank shall repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Bank together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such Bank until the date such Bank repays such amount to the Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate.
               (c) If any Bank shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.5, 2.13 or 9.3, then the Administrative Agent, notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, shall (i) apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Bank for the benefit of the Administrative Agent to satisfy such Bank's obligations to it under such Section until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid, and/or (ii) hold any such amounts in a segregated account as cash collateral for, and application to, any
 
future funding obligations of such Bank under any such Section, in the case of each of clauses (i) and (ii) above, in any order as determined by the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion.

If the Borrower or Qualified Borrower, as the case may be, makes any payment of principal with respect to any Euribor Loan (pursuant to Article II, VI or VIII or otherwise) on any day other than the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, or if the Borrower or Qualified Borrower, as the case may be, fails to borrow any Euribor Loans after notice has been given to any Bank in accordance with Section 2.5(a), or if Borrower or Qualified Borrower, as the case may be, shall deliver a Notice of Interest Rate Election specifying that a Euribor Loan shall be converted on a date other than the first (1st) day of the then current Interest Period applicable thereto, the Borrower shall reimburse each Bank within 15 days after certification of such Bank of such loss or expense (which shall be delivered by each such Bank to Administrative Agent for delivery to Borrower) for any resulting loss or expense incurred by it (or by an existing Participant in the related Loan), including, without limitation, any loss incurred in obtaining, liquidating or employing deposits from third parties, but excluding loss of margin for the period after any such payment or failure to borrow, provided that such Bank shall have delivered to Administrative Agent and Administrative Agent shall have delivered to the Borrower a certification as to the amount of such loss or expense, which certification shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis for and calculation of such loss or expense and shall be conclusive in the absence of demonstrable error.
Funding Losses

Basis for Determining Interest Rate Inadequate or Unfair
nd
          If, at any time, the obligations of the Banks to make Euribor Loans shall be suspended pursuant to the terms of this Section 8.1, with respect to any Bank that has previously notified the Administrative Agent and Borrower that it is unable to make a Base Rate Loan which notice has not been withdrawn, Borrower shall have the right, upon five (5) Business Day's notice to the Administrative Agent, to either (x) cause a bank, reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent, to offer to purchase the Commitments of such Bank for an amount equal to such Bank's outstanding Loans and to become a Bank hereunder, or to obtain the agreement of one or more existing Banks to offer to purchase the Commitments of such Bank for such amount, which offer such Bank is hereby required to accept, or (y) to repay in full all Loans then outstanding of such Bank, together with interest and all other amounts due thereon, upon which event, such Bank's Commitment shall be deemed to be canceled pursuant to Section 2.11(f).
          Section 8.2 .

Illegality
 
suspended. With respect to Euribor Loans, before giving any notice to the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section, such Bank shall designate a different Euribor Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for giving such notice and will not, in the judgment of such Bank, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank. If such Bank shall determine that it may not lawfully continue to maintain and fund any of its outstanding Euribor Loans to maturity and shall so specify in such notice, the Borrower shall be deemed to have delivered a Notice of Interest Rate Election and such Euribor Loan shall be converted as of such date to a Base Rate Loan (without payment of any amounts that Borrower would otherwise be obligated to pay pursuant to Section 2.14 hereof with respect to Loans converted pursuant to this Section 8.2) in an equal principal amount from such Bank (on which interest and principal shall be payable contemporaneously with the related Euribor Loans of the other Banks), and such Bank shall make such a Base Rate Loan (unless any Bank has previously advised the Administrative Agent and Borrower that it is unable to make a Base Rate Loan and such notice has not been withdrawn, in which event the Administrative Agent shall determine in good faith the appropriate rate of interest after consultation with the Borrower and the Banks).
          If at any time, it shall be unlawful for any Bank to make, maintain or fund its Euribor Loans, the Borrower shall have the right, upon five (5) Business Days' notice to the Administrative Agent, to either (x) cause a bank, reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent, to offer to purchase the Commitments of such Bank for an amount equal to such Bank's outstanding Loans, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon, and to become a Bank hereunder, or obtain the agreement of one or more existing Banks to offer to purchase the Commitments of such Bank for such amount, which offer such Bank is hereby required to accept, or (y) to repay in full all Loans then outstanding of such Bank, together with interest due thereon and any and all fees due hereunder, upon which event, such Bank's Commitments shall be deemed to be canceled pursuant to Section 2.11(c).

               (a) If, on or after the date hereof, the adoption or phase in of any applicable law, rule or regulation, or any change in any applicable law, rule, directive, guideline, decision, or regulation, or any change in the interpretation, re-interpretation, application, or administration thereof by any governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any Bank (or its Applicable Lending Office) with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) made at the Closing Date of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency shall impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve (including, without limitation, any such requirement imposed by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (but excluding with respect to any Euribor Loan any such requirement reflected in an applicable Euribor Reserve Percentage)), special deposit, insurance assessment or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Bank (or its Applicable Lending Office) or shall impose on any Bank (or its Applicable Lending Office) or on the interbank market any other condition materially more burdensome in nature, extent or consequence than those in existence as of the date hereof affecting such Bank's Euribor Loans, its Note, or its obligation to make Euribor Loans, and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Bank (or its Applicable Lending Office) of making or maintaining any Euribor Loan, or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Bank (or its Applicable Lending
 
Office) under this Agreement or under its Note with respect to such Euribor Loans, by an amount deemed by such Bank to be material, then, within 15 days after demand by such Bank (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), the Borrower shall pay to such Bank such additional amount or amounts (based upon a reasonable allocation thereof by such Bank to the Euribor Loans made by such Bank hereunder) as will compensate such Bank for such increased cost or reduction to the extent such Bank generally imposes such additional amounts on other borrowers of such Bank in similar circumstances.
               (b) If any Bank shall have reasonably determined that, after the date hereof, the adoption of any applicable law, rule or regulation regarding capital adequacy, or any change in any such law, rule or regulation, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any Bank with any request or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) made after the Closing Date of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on capital of such Bank (or its Parent) as a consequence of such Bank's obligations hereunder to a level below that which such Bank (or its Parent) could have achieved but for such adoption, change, request or directive (taking into consideration its policies with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount reasonably deemed by such Bank to be material, then from time to time, within 15 days after demand by such Bank (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), the Borrower shall pay to such Bank such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Bank (or its Parent) for such reduction to the extent such Bank generally imposes such additional amounts on other borrowers of such Bank in similar circumstances.
               (c) Each Bank will promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent of any event of which it has knowledge, occurring after the date hereof, which will entitle such Bank to compensation pursuant to this Section and will designate a different Applicable Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, such compensation and will not, in the reasonable judgment of such Bank, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank. If such Bank shall fail to notify Borrower of any such event within ninety (90) days following the end of the month during which such event occurred, then Borrower's liability for any amounts described in this Section incurred by such Bank as a result of such event shall be limited to those attributable to the period occurring subsequent to the ninetieth (90) day prior to, but excluding, the date upon which such Bank actually notified Borrower of the occurrence of such event. A certificate of any Bank claiming compensation under this Section and setting forth a reasonably detailed calculation of the additional amount or amounts to be paid to it hereunder shall be conclusive in the absence of demonstrable error. In determining such amount, such Bank may use any reasonable averaging and attribution methods.
th
               (d) If at any time, any Bank shall be owed amounts pursuant to this Section 8.3, the Borrower shall have the right, upon five (5) Business Days' notice to the Administrative Agent to either (x) cause a bank, reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent, to offer to purchase the Commitments of such Bank for an amount equal to such Bank's outstanding Loans, and to become a Bank hereunder, or to obtain the agreement of one or more existing Banks to offer to purchase the Commitments of such Bank for such amount, which offer such Bank is hereby required to accept, or (y) to repay in full all Loans then outstanding of such
 
Bank, together with interest and all other amounts due thereon, upon which event, such Bank's Commitment shall be deemed to be canceled pursuant to Section 2.11(c).

If such Bank shall fail to notify Borrower of any such event within ninety (90) days following the end of the month during which such event occurred, then Borrower's or Qualified Borrower's liability for such additional Non-Excluded Taxes incurred by such Bank as a result of such event (including payment of a make-whole amount under Section 8.4(a)(i)) shall be limited to those attributable to the period occurring subsequent to the ninetieth (90) day prior to, but excluding, the date upon which such Bank actually notified Borrower of the occurrence of such event.

This indemnification shall be made within 15 days from the date such Bank or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) makes demand therefor.
               (e) Each Bank organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside the United States, on or prior to the date of its execution and delivery of this Agreement in the case of each Bank listed on the signature pages hereof and on or prior to the date on which it becomes a Bank in the case of each other Bank, shall provide the Borrower with (A) two duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form 1001 or any successor form prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service, and (B) an Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI, as appropriate, or any successor form prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service, and shall provide Borrower with two further copies of any such form or certification on or before the date that any such form or certification expires or becomes obsolete and after the occurrence of any event requiring a change in the most recent form previously delivered by it to Borrower, certifying (i) in the case of a Form 1001, that such Bank is entitled to benefits under an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party which reduces the rate of withholding tax on payments of interest or certifying that the income receivable pursuant to this Agreement is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States, and (ii) in the case of a Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI, that it is entitled to an exemption from United States backup withholding tax. If the form provided by a Bank at the time such Bank first becomes a party to this Agreement indicates a United States interest withholding tax rate in excess of zero, withholding tax at such rate shall be considered excluded from "Non-Excluded Taxes" as defined in Section 8.4(a).
               (f) Upon reasonable demand by Borrower or any Qualified Borrower to the Administrative Agent or any Bank, the Administrative Agent or Bank, as the case may be, shall deliver to the Borrower or Qualified Borrower, or to such government or taxing authority as the Borrower or Qualified Borrower may reasonably direct, any form or document that may be required or reasonably requested in writing in order to allow the Borrower or Qualified Borrower to make a payment to or for the account of such Bank or the Administrative Agent hereunder or under any other Loan Document without any deduction or withholding for or on account of any Non-Excluded Taxes or with such deduction or withholding at a reduced rate (so long as the completion, execution or submission of such form or document would not materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of the party in receipt of such demand), with any such form or document to be accurate and completed in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower or Qualified Borrower making such demand and to be executed and to be delivered with any reasonably required certification.
               (g) For any period with respect to which a Bank has failed to provide the Borrower with the appropriate form pursuant to Section 8.4(e) or (f) (unless such failure is due to a change in treaty, law or regulation occurring subsequent to the date on which a form originally was required to be provided), such Bank shall not be entitled to indemnification under
 
Section 8.4(d); , , that should a Bank, which is otherwise exempt from or subject to a reduced rate of withholding tax, become subject to Non-Excluded Taxes because of its failure to deliver a form required hereunder, the Borrower shall take such steps as such Bank shall reasonably request to assist such Bank to recover such Taxes so long as Borrower shall incur no cost or liability as a result thereof.

          WHEREAS, as a condition to the execution and delivery of the Loan Documents, the Banks have required that Guarantor execute and deliver this Guaranty of Payment; and
          NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the benefits to be derived from the making of the Loans by the Banks to Borrower and Qualified Borrowers, and in order to induce the Administrative Agent, the Syndication Agent, the Documentation Agents, the Joint Lead Arrangers and Joint Bookmanagers, the Managing Agents and the Banks to enter into the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and for other good and valuable
 
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, Guarantor hereby agrees as follows:
          1. Guarantor, on behalf of itself and its successors and assigns, hereby irrevocably, absolutely and unconditionally guarantees the full and punctual payment when due, whether at stated maturity or otherwise, of all Obligations of Borrower now or hereafter existing under the Notes and the Credit Agreement, including in the event that the Borrower exercises its rights under the Credit Agreement to increase the Facility Amount and including those Obligations of Borrower under the Qualified Borrower Guaranty, for principal and/or interest as well as any and all other amounts due thereunder, including, without limitation, all indemnity obligations of Borrower thereunder, and any and all reasonable costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements) incurred by the Administrative Agent and/or the Banks in enforcing their rights under this Guaranty (all of the foregoing obligations being the "").
Guaranteed Obligations
          2. It is agreed that the Guaranteed Obligations of Guarantor hereunder are primary and this Guaranty shall be enforceable against Guarantor and its successors and assigns without the necessity for any suit or proceeding of any kind or nature whatsoever brought by the Administrative Agent or any of the Banks against Borrower or its respective successors or assigns or any other party or against any security for the payment and performance of the Guaranteed Obligations and without the necessity of any notice of non-payment or non-observance or of any notice of acceptance of this Guaranty or of any notice or demand to which Guarantor might otherwise be entitled (including, without limitation, diligence, presentment, notice of maturity, extension of time, change in nature or form of the Guaranteed Obligations, acceptance of further security, release of further security, imposition or agreement arrived at as to the amount of or the terms of the Guaranteed Obligations, notice of adverse change in Borrower's financial condition and any other fact which might materially increase the risk to Guarantor), all of which Guarantor hereby expressly waives; and Guarantor hereby expressly agrees that the validity of this Guaranty and the obligations of Guarantor hereunder shall in no way be terminated, affected, diminished, modified or impaired by reason of the assertion of or the failure to assert by the Administrative Agent or any of the Banks against Borrower or its respective successors or assigns, any of the rights or remedies reserved to the Administrative Agent or any of the Banks pursuant to the provisions of the Loan Documents. Guarantor agrees that any notice or directive given at any time to the Administrative Agent or any of the Banks which is inconsistent with the waiver in the immediately preceding sentence shall be void and may be ignored by the Administrative Agent and the Banks, and, in addition, may not be pleaded or introduced as evidence in any litigation relating to this Guaranty for the reason that such pleading or introduction would be at variance with the written terms of this Guaranty, unless the Administrative Agent has specifically agreed otherwise in a writing, signed by a duly authorized officer. Guarantor specifically acknowledges and agrees that the foregoing waivers are of the essence of this transaction and that, but for this Guaranty and such waivers, the Administrative Agent and the Banks would not make the requested Loan to the Borrower.
          3. Guarantor waives, and covenants and agrees that it will not at any time insist upon, plead or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any and all appraisal, valuation, stay, extension, marshaling-of-assets or redemption laws, or right of homestead or exemption, whether now or at any time hereafter in force, which may delay,
 
prevent or otherwise affect the performance by Guarantor of its obligations under, or the enforcement by the Administrative Agent or any of the Banks of, this Guaranty. Guarantor further covenants and agrees not to set up or claim any defense, counterclaim, offset, setoff or other objection of any kind to any action, suit or proceeding in law, equity or otherwise, or to any demand or claim that may be instituted or made by the Administrative Agent or any of the Banks other than the defense of the actual timely payment and performance by Borrower of the Guaranteed Obligations hereunder; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not be deemed a waiver of Guarantor's right to assert any compulsory counterclaim, if such counterclaim is compelled under local law or rule of procedure, nor shall the foregoing be deemed a waiver of Guarantor's right to assert any claim which would constitute a defense, setoff, counterclaim or crossclaim of any nature whatsoever against Administrative Agent or any Bank in any separate action or proceeding. Guarantor represents, warrants and agrees that, as of the date hereof, its obligations under this Guaranty are not subject to any counterclaims, offsets or defenses against the Administrative Agent or any Bank of any kind.
          4. The provisions of this Guaranty are for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Banks and their successors and permitted assigns, and nothing herein contained shall impair as between Borrower and the Administrative Agent and the Banks the obligations of Borrower under the Loan Documents.
          5. This Guaranty shall be a continuing, unconditional and absolute guaranty and the liability of Guarantor hereunder shall in no way be terminated, affected, modified, impaired or diminished by reason of the happening, from time to time, of any of the following, all without notice or the further consent of Guarantor:
     (a) any assignment, amendment, modification or waiver of or change in any of the terms, covenants, conditions or provisions of any of the Guaranteed Obligations or the Loan Documents or the invalidity or unenforceability of any of the foregoing; or
     (b) any extension of time that may be granted by the Administrative Agent to Borrower, any guarantor, or their respective successors or assigns, heirs, executors, administrators or personal representatives; or
     (c) any action which the Administrative Agent may take or fail to take under or in respect of any of the Loan Documents or by reason of any waiver of, or failure to enforce any of the rights, remedies, powers or privileges available to the Administrative Agent under this Guaranty or available to the Administrative Agent at law, equity or otherwise, or any action on the part of the Administrative Agent granting indulgence or extension in any form whatsoever; or
     (d) any sale, exchange, release, or other disposition of any property pledged, mortgaged or conveyed, or any property in which the Administrative Agent and/or the Banks have been granted a lien or security interest to secure any indebtedness of Borrower to the Administrative Agent and/or the Banks; or
 
     (e) any release of any person or entity who may be liable in any manner for the payment and collection of any amounts owed by Borrower to the Administrative Agent and/or the Banks; or
     (f) the application of any sums by whomsoever paid or however realized to any amounts owing by Borrower to the Administrative Agent and/or the Banks under the Loan Documents in such manner as the Administrative Agent shall determine in its sole discretion; or
     (g) Borrower's or Guarantor's voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution, sale of all or substantially all of their respective assets and liabilities, appointment of a trustee, receiver, liquidator, sequestrator or conservator for all or any part of Borrower's or Guarantor's assets, insolvency, bankruptcy, assignment for the benefit of creditors, reorganization, arrangement, composition or readjustment, or the commencement of other similar proceedings affecting Borrower or Guarantor or any of the assets of any of them, including, without limitation, (i) the release or discharge of Borrower or any guarantor from the payment and performance of their respective obligations under any of the Loan Documents by operation of law, or (ii) the impairment, limitation or modification of the liability of Borrower or any guarantor in bankruptcy, or of any remedy for the enforcement of the Guaranteed Obligations under any of the Loan Documents, or any guarantor's liability under this Guaranty, resulting from the operation of any present or future provisions of the Bankruptcy Code or other present or future federal, state or applicable statute or law or from the decision in any court; or
     (h) any improper disposition by Borrower of the proceeds of the Loans, it being acknowledged by Guarantor that the Administrative Agent or any Bank shall be entitled to honor any request made by Borrower for a disbursement of such proceeds and that neither the Administrative Agent nor any Bank shall have any obligation to see the proper disposition by Borrower of such proceeds.
          6. Guarantor agrees that if at any time all or any part of any payment at any time received by the Administrative Agent from Borrower or Guarantor under or with respect to this Guaranty is or must be rescinded or returned by the Administrative Agent or any Bank for any reason whatsoever (including, without limitation, the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of Borrower or Guarantor), then Guarantor's obligations hereunder shall, to the extent of the payment rescinded or returned, be deemed to have continued in existence notwithstanding such previous receipt by such party, and Guarantor's obligations hereunder shall continue to be effective or reinstated, as the case may be, as to such payment, as though such previous payment had never been made.
          7. Until this Guaranty is terminated pursuant to the terms hereof, Guarantor (i) shall have no right of subrogation against Borrower or any entity comprising same by reason of any payments or acts of performance by Guarantor in compliance with the obligations of Guarantor hereunder, (ii) waives any right to enforce any remedy which Guarantor now or hereafter shall have against Borrower or any entity comprising same by reason of any one or more payment or acts of performance in compliance with the obligations of Guarantor hereunder and (iii) from and after an Event of Default (as defined in the Credit Agreement), subordinates
 
any liability or indebtedness of Borrower or any entity comprising same now or hereafter held by Guarantor or any affiliate of Guarantor to the obligations of Borrower under the Loan Documents. The foregoing, however, shall not be deemed in any way to limit any rights that Guarantor may have pursuant to the Agreement of Limited Partnership of Borrower or which it may have at law or in equity with respect to any other partners of Borrower.
          8. Guarantor represents and warrants to the Administrative Agent and the Banks with the knowledge that the Administrative Agent and the Banks are relying upon the same, as follows:
     (a) as of the date hereof, Guarantor is the sole general partner of Borrower;
     (b) based upon such relationships, Guarantor has determined that it is in its best interests to enter into this Guaranty;

All of the Administrative Agent's rights and remedies under each of the Loan Documents or under this Guaranty are intended to be distinct, separate and cumulative and no such right or remedy therein or herein mentioned is intended to be in exclusion of or a waiver of any other right or remedy available to the Administrative Agent.
 
          23. The Guarantor shall not use any assets of an "employee benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA or a "plan" within the meaning of Section 4975(e)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code (the "") to repay or secure the Loan, the Note, the Obligations or this Guaranty. The Guarantor shall not assign, sell, pledge, encumber, transfer, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of any of its rights or interests (direct or indirect) in Borrower, or attempt to do any of the foregoing or suffer any of the foregoing, or permit any party with a direct or indirect interest or right in Borrower to do any of the foregoing, if such action would cause the Note, the Loan, the Obligations, this Guaranty, or any of the Loan Documents or the exercise of any of the Administrative Agent's or Bank's rights in connection therewith, to constitute a prohibited transaction under ERISA or the Code (unless the Guarantor furnishes to the Administrative Agent a legal opinion satisfactory to the Administrative Agent that the transaction is exempt from the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and the Code (and for this purpose, the Administrative Agent and the Banks, by accepting the benefits of this Guaranty, hereby agree to supply Guarantor all relevant non-confidential, factual information reasonably necessary to such legal opinion and reasonably requested by Guarantor) or would otherwise result in the Administrative Agent or any of the Banks being deemed in violation of Sections 404 or 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or would otherwise result in the Administrative Agent or any of the Banks being a fiduciary or party in interest under ERISA or a "disqualified person" as defined in Section 4975(e)(2) of the Code with respect to an "employee benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA or a "plan" within the meaning of Section 4975(e)(1) of the Code. The Guarantor shall indemnify and hold each of the Administrative Agent and the Banks free and harmless from and against all loss, costs (including attorneys' fees and expenses), expenses, taxes and damages (including consequential damages) that each of the Administrative Agent and the Banks may suffer by reason of the investigation, defense and settlement of claims and in obtaining any prohibited transaction exemption under ERISA necessary in Administrative Agent's reasonable judgment as a result of Guarantor's action or inaction or by reason of a breach of the foregoing provisions by Guarantor.

Qualified
Note
          WHEREAS, this Guaranty is the "Qualified Borrower Guaranty" referred to in the Credit Agreement;
          WHEREAS, in order to induce the Administrative Agent and the Banks to make one or more Loans to one or more Qualified Borrowers, and to satisfy one of the conditions contained in the Credit Agreement with respect thereto, the Guarantor has agreed to enter into this Guaranty.
          NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the direct and indirect benefits to be derived from the making of the Loans by the Banks to Qualified Borrowers, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, Guarantor hereby agrees as follows:
for
          1. Guarantor, on behalf of itself and its successors and assigns, hereby irrevocably, absolutely, and unconditionally guarantees the full and punctual payment when due, whether at stated maturity or otherwise, of all obligations of each and every Qualified Borrower now or hereafter existing under the Note (whether executed and delivered simultaneously herewith or subsequently), or under any of the other Loan Documents (such obligations, whenever arising, being the ""), and any and all reasonable costs and
Guaranteed Obligations
 
expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements) incurred by the Administrative Agent in enforcing its rights under this Guaranty.
          2. It is agreed that the obligations of Guarantor hereunder are primary and this Guaranty shall be enforceable against Guarantor and its successors and assigns without the necessity for any suit or proceeding of any kind or nature whatsoever brought by the Administrative Agent against the relevant Qualified Borrower or its respective successors or assigns or any other party or against any security for the payment and performance of the Guaranteed Obligations and without the necessity of any notice of non-payment or non-observance or of any notice of acceptance of this Guaranty or of any notice or demand to which Guarantor might otherwise be entitled (including, without limitation, diligence, presentment, notice of maturity, extension of time, change in nature or form of the Guaranteed Obligations, acceptance of further security, release of further security, imposition or agreement arrived at as to the amount of or the terms of the Guaranteed Obligations, notice of adverse change in such Qualified Borrower's financial condition and any other fact which might materially increase the risk to Guarantor), all of which Guarantor hereby expressly waives; and Guarantor hereby expressly agrees that the validity of this Guaranty and the obligations of the Guarantor hereunder shall in no way be terminated, affected, diminished, modified or impaired by reason of the assertion of or the failure to assert by the Administrative Agent against such Qualified Borrower or its respective successors or assigns, any of the rights or remedies reserved to the Administrative Agent pursuant to the provisions of the Loan Documents. Guarantor hereby agrees that any notice or directive given at any time to the Administrative Agent which is inconsistent with the waiver in the immediately preceding sentence shall be void and may be ignored by the Administrative Agent, and, in addition, may not be pleaded or introduced as evidence in any litigation relating to this Guaranty for the reason that such pleading or introduction would be at variance with the written terms of this Guaranty, unless the Administrative Agent has specifically agreed otherwise in a writing, signed by a duly authorized officer. Guarantor specifically acknowledges and agrees that the foregoing waivers are of the essence of this transaction and that, but for this Guaranty and such waivers, the Banks would not make Loans and the Fronting Bank would not issue Letters of Credit on behalf of any Qualified Borrower.
          3. Guarantor hereby waives, and covenants and agrees that it will not at any time insist upon, plead or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any and all appraisal, valuation, stay, extension, marshaling-of-assets or redemption laws, or right of homestead or exemption, whether now or at any time hereafter in force, which may delay, prevent or otherwise affect the performance by Guarantor of its obligations under, or the enforcement by the Administrative Agent of, this Guaranty. Guarantor further covenants and agrees not to set up or claim any defense, counterclaim, offset, set-off or other objection of any kind to any action, suit or proceeding in law, equity or otherwise, or to any demand or claim that may be instituted or made by the Administrative Agent other than the defense of the actual timely payment and performance by the relevant Qualified Borrower of the Guaranteed Obligations hereunder; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not be deemed a waiver of Guarantor's right to assert any compulsory counterclaim, if such counterclaim is compelled under local law or rule of procedure, nor shall the foregoing be deemed a waiver of Guarantor's right to assert any claim which would constitute a defense, setoff, counterclaim or crossclaim of any nature whatsoever against Administrative Agent or any Bank in any separate action or
 
proceeding. Guarantor represents, warrants and agrees that, as of the date hereof, its obligations under this Guaranty are not subject to any counterclaims, offsets or defenses of any kind against the Administrative Agent, the Banks or the Fronting Bank.
          4. The provisions of this Guaranty are for the benefit of the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Banks and their successors and permitted assigns, and nothing herein contained shall impair as between any Qualified Borrower and the Administrative Agent the obligations of such Qualified Borrower under the Loan Documents.
          5. This Guaranty shall be a continuing, unconditional and absolute guaranty and the liability of Guarantor hereunder shall in no way be terminated, affected, modified, impaired or diminished by reason of the happening, from time to time, of any of the following, all without notice or the further consent of Guarantor:
               (a) any assignment, amendment, modification or waiver of or change in any of the terms, covenants, conditions or provisions of any of the Guaranteed Obligations or the Loan Documents or the invalidity or unenforceability of any of the foregoing; or
               (b) any extension of time that may be granted by the Administrative Agent to any Qualified Borrower, any guarantor, or their respective successors or assigns, heirs, executors, administrators or personal representatives; or
               (c) any action which the Administrative Agent may take or fail to take under or in respect of any of the Loan Documents or by reason of any waiver of, or failure to enforce any of the rights, remedies, powers or privileges available to the Administrative Agent under this Guaranty or available to the Administrative Agent at law, equity or otherwise, or any action on the part of the Administrative Agent granting indulgence or extension in any form whatsoever; or
               (d) any sale, exchange, release, or other disposition of any property pledged, mortgaged or conveyed, or any property in which the Administrative Agent and/or the Banks have been granted a lien or security interest to secure any indebtedness of any Qualified Borrower to the Administrative Agent and/or the Banks; or
               (e) any release of any person or entity who may be liable in any manner for the payment and collection of any amounts owed by any Qualified Borrower to the Administrative Agent and/or the Banks; or
               (f) the application of any sums by whomsoever paid or however realized to any amounts owing by any Qualified Borrower to the Administrative Agent and/or the Banks under the Loan Documents in such manner as the Administrative Agent shall determine in its sole discretion; or
               (g) any Qualified Borrower's or the Guarantor's voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution, sale of all or substantially all of their respective assets and liabilities, appointment of a trustee, receiver, liquidator, sequestrator or conservator for all or any part of any Qualified Borrower's or Guarantor's assets, insolvency, bankruptcy, assignment for the benefit of creditors, reorganization, arrangement, composition or readjustment, or the
 
commencement of other similar proceedings affecting any Qualified Borrower or Guarantor or any of the assets of any of them, including, without limitation, (i) the release or discharge of any Qualified Borrower or Guarantor from the payment and performance of their respective obligations under any of the Loan Documents by operation of law, or (ii) the impairment, limitation or modification of the liability of any Qualified Borrower or Guarantor in bankruptcy, or of any remedy for the enforcement of the Guaranteed Obligations under any of the Loan Documents, or Guarantor's liability under this Guaranty, resulting from the operation of any present or future provisions of the Bankruptcy Code or other present or future federal, state or applicable statute or law or from the decision in any court; or
               (h) any improper disposition by any Qualified Borrower of the proceeds of the Loans, it being acknowledged by Guarantor that the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to honor any request made by any Qualified Borrower for a disbursement of such proceeds and that the Administrative Agent shall have no obligation to see the proper disposition by such Qualified Borrower of such proceeds.
               (i) Guarantor hereby agrees that if at any time all or any part of any payment at any time received by the Administrative Agent from any Qualified Borrower under any of the Notes or other Loan Documents or Guarantor under or with respect to this Guaranty is or must be rescinded or returned by the Administrative Agent for any reason whatsoever (including, without limitation, the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of any Qualified Borrower or Guarantor), then Guarantor's obligations hereunder shall, to the extent of the payment rescinded or returned, be deemed to have continued in existence notwithstanding such previous receipt by the Administrative Agent, and Guarantor's obligations hereunder shall continue to be effective or reinstated, as the case may be, as to such payment, as though such previous payment to the Administrative Agent had never been made.
               (j) Until this Guaranty is terminated pursuant to the terms hereof, the Guarantor (i) shall have no right of subrogation against any Qualified Borrower or any entity comprising same by reason of any payments or acts of performance by Guarantor in compliance with the obligations of Guarantor hereunder; (ii) hereby waives any right to enforce any remedy which Guarantor now or hereafter shall have against any Qualified Borrower or any entity comprising same by reason of any one or more payment or acts of performance in compliance with the obligations of Guarantor hereunder; and (iii) from and after an Event of Default (as defined in the Credit Agreement) subordinates any liability or indebtedness of any Qualified Borrower or any entity comprising same now or hereafter held by Guarantor to the obligations of each Qualified Borrower under the Loan Documents.
          6. Guarantor hereby represents, warrants and covenants on its own behalf to the Administrative Agent with the knowledge that the Administrative Agent is relying upon the same, as follows:
               (a) Guarantor will be familiar with the financial condition of each Qualified Borrower;
               (b) Guarantor has determined that it is in its best interest to enter into this Guaranty;
 
               (c) this Guaranty is necessary and convenient to the conduct, promotion and attainment of Guarantor's business, and is in furtherance of Guarantor's business purposes;
               (d) the benefits to be derived by Guarantor from each Qualified Borrower's access to funds made possible by the Loan Documents are at least equal to the obligations of Guarantor undertaken pursuant to this Guaranty;
               (e) the Guarantor is solvent and has full partnership power and legal right to enter into this Guaranty and to perform its obligations under the terms hereof and (i) Guarantor is organized and validly existing under the laws of its state of formation, (ii) Guarantor has complied with all provisions of applicable law in connection with all aspects of this Guaranty, and (iii) the person executing this Guaranty on behalf of Guarantor has all the requisite power and authority to execute and deliver this Guaranty; and
               (f) this Guaranty has been duly executed by Guarantor and constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of Guarantor, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms except as enforceability may be limited by applicable insolvency, bankruptcy or other laws affecting creditors' rights generally or general principles of equity whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law.
          The foregoing representations and warranties shall be deemed to be made as of the date hereof and as the date of the making any Loan or the issuance of any Letter of Credit to or for the account on any Qualified Borrower.
          7. Each of Guarantor and the Administrative Agent acknowledges and agrees that this Guaranty is a guaranty of payment and not of collection and enforcement in respect of any obligations which may accrue to the Administrative Agent and/or the Banks from each Qualified Borrower under the provisions of any Loan Document.
          8. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement, and in conjunction therewith, the Administrative Agent may assign any or all of its rights under this Guaranty.
          9. Guarantor agrees, upon the written request of the Administrative Agent, to execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent, from time to time, any modification or amendment hereto or any additional instruments or documents reasonably considered necessary by the Administrative Agent or its counsel to cause this Guaranty to be, become or remain valid and effective in accordance with its terms, provided, that, any such modification, amendment, additional instrument or document shall not increase Guarantor's obligations or diminish its rights hereunder and shall be reasonably satisfactory as to form to Guarantor and to Guarantor's counsel.
          10. The representations and warranties of the Guarantor set forth in this Guaranty shall survive until this Guaranty shall terminate in accordance with the terms hereof.
          11. This Guaranty together with the Credit Agreement, each Note now or hereafter executed and delivered by any Qualified Borrower, and the other Loan Documents
 
contain the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements relating to such subject matter and may not be modified, amended, supplemented or discharged except by a written agreement signed by Guarantor and the Administrative Agent.
          12. If all or any portion of any provision contained in this Guaranty shall be determined to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect for any reason, such provision or portion thereof shall be deemed stricken and severed from this Guaranty and the remaining provisions and portions thereof shall continue in full force and effect.
          13. This Guaranty may be executed in counterparts which together shall constitute the same instrument.
          14. All notices, requests and other communications to any party hereunder shall be in writing (including bank wire, telex, facsimile transmission followed by telephonic confirmation or similar writing) and shall be addressed to such party at the address set forth below or to such other address as may be identified by any party in a written notice to the others:

          15. This Guaranty shall be binding upon Guarantor and its successors and assigns and shall inure to the benefit of the Administrative Agent and its successors and assigns.
          16. The failure of the Administrative Agent to enforce any right or remedy hereunder, or promptly to enforce any such right or remedy, shall not constitute a waiver thereof, nor give rise to any estoppel against the Administrative Agent, nor excuse Guarantor from its obligations hereunder. Any waiver of any such right or remedy to be enforceable against the Administrative Agent must be expressly set forth in a writing signed by the Administrative Agent.
          17. (a) THIS GUARANTY AND THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES HEREUNDER SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH AND BE GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

Nothing herein shall affect the right of the Administrative Agent to serve process in any other manner permitted by law or to commence legal proceedings or otherwise proceed against Guarantor in any other jurisdiction.
               (c) EACH OF THE GUARANTOR AND THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT HEREBY WAIVES ITS RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL OF ANY AND ALL CLAIMS OR CAUSES OF ACTION BASED UPON OR ARISING OUT OF THIS GUARANTY. IT IS HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGED BY GUARANTOR THAT THE WAIVER OF A JURY TRIAL IS A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT FOR THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT TO ACCEPT THIS GUARANTY AND THAT THE LOANS MADE BY THE BANKS ARE MADE IN RELIANCE UPON SUCH WAIVER. GUARANTOR FURTHER WARRANTS AND
 
REPRESENTS THAT SUCH WAIVER HAS BEEN KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY MADE, FOLLOWING CONSULTATION WITH LEGAL COUNSEL. IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, THIS GUARANTY MAY BE FILED BY THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT IN COURT AS A WRITTEN CONSENT TO A NON-JURY TRIAL.

Notice to Banks; Funding of Loans
          (a) Upon receipt of a Notice of Borrowing from any Borrower in accordance with Section 2.2 hereof, the Administrative Agent shall, on the date such Notice of Borrowing is received by the Administrative Agent, notify each Bank of the contents thereof and of such Bank's share of such Borrowing, of the interest rate determined pursuant thereto and the Interest Period(s) (if different from those requested by such Borrower) and such Notice of Borrowing shall not thereafter be revocable by such Borrower, unless such Borrower shall pay any applicable expenses pursuant to Section 2.15.
 
          (b) Not later than 2:00 p.m. (New York time) on the date of each Committed Borrowing as indicated in the applicable Notice of Borrowing, each Bank shall (except as provided in subsection (d) of this Section) make available its share of such Committed Borrowing in Yen immediately available in Tokyo, Japan, to the Administrative Agent at its address referred to in Section 9.1. If any Borrower has requested the issuance of a Letter of Credit, no later than 1:00 p.m. (New York time) on the date of such issuance as indicated in the notice delivered pursuant to Section 2.2(b), the Fronting Bank shall issue such Letter of Credit in the amount so requested and deliver the same to the applicable Borrower, with a copy thereof to the Administrative Agent. Immediately upon the issuance of each Letter of Credit by the Fronting Bank, the Fronting Bank shall be deemed to have sold and transferred to each other Bank, and each such other Bank shall be deemed, and hereby agrees, to have irrevocably and unconditionally purchased and received from the Fronting Bank, without recourse or warranty, an undivided interest and a participation in such Letter of Credit, any drawing thereunder, and its obligation to pay its Pro Rata Share with respect thereto, and any security therefor or guaranty pertaining thereto, in an amount equal to such Bank's ratable share thereof. Upon any change in any of the Commitments in accordance herewith, there shall be an automatic adjustment to such participations to reflect such changed shares. The Fronting Bank shall have the primary obligation to fund any and all draws made with respect to such Letter of Credit notwithstanding any failure of a participating Bank to fund its ratable share of any such draw. The Administrative Agent will instruct the Fronting Bank to make such Letter of Credit available to the applicable Borrower, and the Fronting Bank shall make such Letter of Credit available to the applicable Borrower, at its aforesaid address or at such address in Japan as such Borrower shall request on the date of the Borrowing.
          (c) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Bank prior to the date of any Borrowing that such Bank will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Bank's share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Bank has made such share available to the Administrative Agent on the date of such Borrowing in accordance with this Section 2.5 and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, but shall not be obligated to, make available to the applicable Borrower on such date a corresponding amount on behalf of such Bank. If and to the extent that such Bank shall not have so made such share available to the Administrative Agent, such Bank agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is made available to the applicable Borrower until the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent, at the rate of interest applicable to such Borrowing hereunder. If such Bank shall repay to the Administrative Agent such corresponding amount, such amount so repaid shall constitute such Bank's Loan included in such Borrowing for purposes of this Agreement. If such Bank shall not pay to Administrative Agent such corresponding amount after reasonable attempts are made by Administrative
 
Agent to collect such amounts from such Bank, the applicable Borrower agrees to repay to Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amounts together with interest thereto, for each day from the date such amount is made available to such Borrower until the date such amount is repaid to Administrative Agent, at the interest rate applicable thereto one (1) Business Day after demand. Nothing contained in this Section 2.5(d) shall be deemed to reduce the Commitment of any Bank or in any way affect the rights of such Borrower with respect to any defaulting Bank or Administrative Agent. The failure of any Bank to make available to the Administrative Agent such Bank's share of any Borrowing in accordance with Section 2.5(b) hereof shall not relieve any other Bank of its obligations to fund its Commitment, in accordance with the provisions hereof.
          (d) Subject to the provisions hereof, the Administrative Agent shall make available each Borrowing to the applicable Borrower in Yen immediately available in accordance with, and on the date set forth in, the applicable Notice of Borrowing.
          SECTION 2.6. .
Notes
          (a) The Loans of each Borrower shall be evidenced by a single Note made by the applicable Borrower payable to the order of the Administrative Agent, on behalf of the Banks for the account of their respective Lending Offices.
          (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2.6(a) above, each Bank may, by notice to any Borrower and the Administrative Agent, request that its Loans to such Borrower be evidenced by a separate Note payable to the order of such Bank for the account of its Lending Office, in which event the Note made by such Borrower pursuant to Section 2.6(a) above shall not include or evidence the Loans made by such Bank to such Borrower. Each such Note shall be modified to reflect the fact that it evidences solely Loans made by the applicable Bank. Any additional costs incurred by the Administrative Agent, such Borrower or the Banks in connection with preparing such a Note shall be at the sole cost and expense of the Bank requesting such Note. In the event any Loans evidenced by such a Note are paid in full prior to the Maturity Date, any such Bank shall return such Note to the applicable Borrower.
          (c) Upon receipt of each Note pursuant to Section 3.1(a), the Administrative Agent shall forward a copy of such Note to each Bank. The Administrative Agent shall record the date, amount, type and maturity of each Loan made by each Bank and the date and amount of each payment of principal made by the applicable Borrower with respect thereto, and may, if the Administrative Agent so elects in connection with any transfer or enforcement of its Note, endorse on the appropriate schedule appropriate notations to evidence the foregoing information with respect to each such Loan then outstanding; provided that the failure of the Administrative Agent to make any such recordation or endorsement shall not affect the obligations of any Borrower hereunder or under the Notes. The Administrative
 
Agent is hereby irrevocably authorized by each Borrower so to endorse its Note and to attach to and make a part of its Note a continuation of any such schedule as and when required.
          (d) Upon receipt of each Bank's Note pursuant to Section 2.6(b) above, the Administrative Agent shall forward such Note to such Bank. Each Bank shall record the date, amount, type and maturity of each Loan made by it and the date and amount of each payment of principal made by the applicable Borrower with respect thereto, and may, if such Bank so elects in connection with any transfer or enforcement of its Note, endorse on the appropriate schedule appropriate notations to evidence the foregoing information with respect to each such Loan then outstanding; provided that the failure of any Bank to make any such recordation or endorsement shall not affect the obligations of any Borrower hereunder or under the Note. Each Bank is hereby irrevocably authorized by each Borrower so to endorse its Note and to attach to and make a part of its Note a continuation of any such schedule as and when required.
          (e) The Committed Loans shall mature, and the principal amount thereof shall be due and payable, on the Maturity Date.
          (f) There shall be no more than ten (10) Yen LIBOR Groups of Loans outstanding at any one time with respect to each Borrower.
          SECTION 2.7. . (a) The Loans included in each Committed Borrowing shall bear interest initially at the type of rate specified by the applicable Borrower in the applicable Notice of Borrowing. Thereafter, each Borrower may from time to time elect to change or continue the type of interest rate borne by each Group of Loans (subject in each case to the provisions of Article VIII) made to such Borrower, as follows:
Method of Electing Interest Rates
               (i) if such Loans are Base Rate Loans, the applicable Borrower may elect to convert all or any portion of such Loans to Yen LIBOR Loans as of any Business Day;
               (ii) if such Loans are Yen LIBOR Loans, the applicable Borrower may elect to convert all or any portion of such Loans to Base Rate Loans and/or elect to continue all or any portion of such Loans as Yen LIBOR Loans for an additional Interest Period or additional Interest Periods, in each case effective on the last day of the then current Interest Period applicable to such Loans, or on such other date designated by the applicable Borrower in the Notice of Interest Rate Election provided such Borrower shall pay any losses pursuant to Section 2.15.
Each such election shall be made by delivering a notice (a "Notice of Interest Rate Election") to the Administrative Agent at least four (4) Business Days prior to, but excluding, the effective date of the conversion or continuation selected in such notice.
 
A Notice of Interest Rate Election may, if it so specifies, apply to only a portion of the aggregate principal amount of the relevant Group of Loans; provided that (i) such portion is allocated ratably among the Loans comprising such Group of Loans, (ii) the portion to which such Notice of Interest Rate Election applies, and the remaining portion to which it does not apply, are JPY30,000,000 or any larger multiple of JPY1,000,000, (iii) there shall be no more than ten (10) Yen LIBOR Groups of Loans with respect to each Borrower outstanding at any time, (iv) no Committed Loan may be continued as, or converted into, a Yen LIBOR Loan when any Guarantor Event of Default has occurred and is continuing or, with respect to such Borrower delivering such Notice of Interest Rate Election, a Borrower Event of Default has occurred and is continuing; provided, further, that if any Bank has previously advised the Administrative Agent and Borrower that it is unable to make a Base Rate Loan and such notice has not been withdrawn, the applicable Borrower shall be deemed to have continued any Committed Loan that is a Yen LIBOR Loan as a Yen LIBOR Loan and, unless the applicable Borrower timely elects an Interest Period, shall be deemed to have elected an Interest Period of 7 days (provided if such Interest Period is not available from all Banks, such Borrower shall be deemed to have elected an Interest Period of 30 days), and (v) no Interest Period shall extend beyond the Maturity Date.
          (b) Each Notice of Interest Rate Election shall specify:
               (i) the Group of Loans (or portion thereof) to which such notice applies;
               (ii) the date on which the conversion or continuation selected in such notice is to be effective, which shall comply with the applicable clause of subsection (a) above;
               (iii) if the Loans comprising such Group of Loans are to be converted, the new type of Loans and, if such new Loans are Yen LIBOR Loans, the duration of the initial Interest Period applicable thereto; and
               (iv) if such Loans are to be continued as Yen LIBOR Loans for an additional Interest Period, the duration of such additional Interest Period.
Each Interest Period specified in a Notice of Interest Rate Election shall comply with the provisions of the definition of Interest Period.
          (c) Upon receipt of a Notice of Interest Rate Election from any Borrower pursuant to subsection (a) above, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Bank the same day as it receives such Notice of Interest Rate Election of the contents thereof, the interest rates determined pursuant thereto and the Interest Periods (if different from those requested by such Borrower) and such notice shall not thereafter be revocable by such Borrower. If the applicable Borrower fails to deliver a timely Notice of Interest Rate Election to the Administrative Agent for any Yen LIBOR
 
Group of Loans, such Loans shall be converted into Base Rate Loans, and such Borrower shall be deemed to have made a Base Rate Borrowing in the amount of such Yen LIBOR Group of Loans (for which such Borrower shall be deemed to have timely given a Notice of Borrowing pursuant to Section 2.2 and all other conditions to such Borrowing shall be deemed waived or satisfied) and the proceeds of such Borrowing shall be deemed to have been used to repay such Yen LIBOR Group of Loans on the last day of the then current Interest Period applicable thereto.
          (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if any Bank has previously advised the Administrative Agent and Borrower that it is unable to make a Base Rate Loan and until such notice is withdrawn, (i) the Base Rate Loan option shall not be available to Borrower and Borrower shall only have the option to make Yen LIBOR Borrowings, (ii) with respect to any Borrowing made (or deemed made) during such period, the Borrower shall be deemed to have elected the Yen LIBOR Borrowing option and, unless the Borrower makes a timely election otherwise, shall be deemed to have elected an Interest Period of 7 days (provided if such Interest Period is not available from all Banks, such Borrower shall be deemed to have elected an Interest Period of 30 days) and (iii) if the Interest Period with respect to any Yen LIBOR Loans shall end during such period, Borrower shall be deemed to have elected to continue such Yen LIBOR Loans as Yen LIBOR Loans and, unless the Borrower makes a timely election otherwise, such Borrower shall be deemed to have elected an Interest Period of 7 days (provided if such Interest Period is not available from all Banks, such Borrower shall be deemed to have elected an Interest Period of 30 days).
          SECTION 2.8. .
Interest Rates
          (a) Each Base Rate Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof, for each day from the date such Loan is made until the date it is repaid or converted into a Yen LIBOR Loan pursuant to Section 2.7, at a rate per annum equal to the sum of the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin for Base Rate Loans for such day.
          (b) Each Yen LIBOR Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof, for each day during the Interest Period applicable thereto, at a rate per annum equal to the sum of the Applicable Margin for Yen LIBOR Loans plus Yen LIBOR for such day.
          (c) In the event that, and for so long as, any Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the outstanding principal amount of the Loans, and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, overdue interest in respect of all Loans, shall bear interest at the annual rate equal to the sum of the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin for Base Rate Loans plus two percent (2%) (unless any Bank has previously advised the Administrative Agent and Borrower that it is unable to make a Base Rate Loan, in which event the "Default Rate" shall be Yen LIBOR with an Interest Period
 
of 7 days (provided if such Interest Period is not available from all Banks, such rate shall be calculated based upon an Interest Period of 30 days) plus the Applicable Margin for Yen LIBOR Loans plus 2%) (the "Default Rate"); provided, however, with respect to any Borrower Event of Default, the Default Rate shall apply only to those Loans made to the defaulting Borrower.
          (d) The Administrative Agent shall determine each interest rate applicable to the Loans hereunder. The Administrative Agent shall give prompt notice to the applicable Borrower and the Banks of each rate of interest so determined, and its determination thereof shall be conclusive in the absence of demonstrable error.
          (e) Interest on all Loans bearing interest at the Base Rate shall be payable in arrears on the first Business Day of each calendar month. Interest on all Yen LIBOR Loans shall be payable on the last Business Day of the applicable Interest Period, but no less frequently than every three months determined on the basis of the first (1st) day of the Interest Period applicable to the Loan in question.
          SECTION 2.9. .

          (a) . For the period beginning on the date hereof and ending on the date the Obligations are paid in full and this Agreement is terminated (the "Facility Fee Period"), the Credit Parties shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Banks a facility fee on the aggregate Commitments, irrespective of usage, at the Applicable Fee Percentage, provided that, with respect to the Borrowers, such obligation shall be divided ratably in proportion to such Borrower's respective Borrowings and no Borrower shall be liable for an amount greater than its prorata share of such fees, provided, further, that the Guarantors shall be liable for the full amount of such fees. The facility fee shall be payable in arrears on each January 1, April 1, July 1 and October 1 during the Facility Fee Period. The Facility Fee shall be payable in Yen.

The Letter of Credit Fee shall be payable in Yen.

          (e) AMB LP may at any time and from time to time cancel all or any part of the Commitments by the delivery to the Administrative Agent of a notice of cancellation within the applicable time periods set forth in Sections 2.11(a) and (b) if there are Loans then outstanding or, if there are no Loans outstanding at such time as to which the Commitments with respect thereto are being canceled, upon at least five

AMB LP shall be permitted to designate in its notice of cancellation which Loans, if any, are to be prepaid.
          (f) Any amounts so prepaid pursuant to Section 2.11(a) or (b) may be reborrowed. In the event AMB LP elects to cancel all or any portion of the Commitments pursuant to Section 2.11(e) hereof, such amounts may not be reborrowed.

The Administrative Agent will promptly (and in any event within one (1) Business Day after receipt thereof) distribute to each
 
Bank its ratable share of each such payment received by the Administrative Agent for the account of the Banks. If and to the extent that the Administrative Agent shall receive any such payment for the account of the Banks on or before 11:00 A.M. (New York time) on any Business Day, and Administrative Agent shall not have distributed to any Bank its applicable share of such payment on such day, Administrative Agent shall distribute such amount to such Bank together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount should have been distributed to such Bank until the date Administrative Agent distributes such amount to such Bank, at the Prime Rate. Whenever any payment of principal of, or interest on the Committed Loans or of fees shall be due on a day which is not a Business Day, the date for payment thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day unless such Business Day falls in another calendar month, in which case the date for payment thereof shall be the next preceding Business Day. If the date for any payment of principal is extended by operation of law or otherwise, interest thereon shall be payable for such extended time.
          (b) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the applicable Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Banks hereunder that such Borrower will not make such payment in full, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Borrower has made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent on such date and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each Bank on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Bank. If and to the extent that such Borrower shall not have so made such payment, each Bank shall repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Bank together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such Bank until the date such Bank repays such amount to the Administrative Agent, at the Prime Rate.
          (c) If any Bank shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.5, 2.14, 2.18 or 9.4, then the Administrative Agent, notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, shall (i) apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Bank for the benefit of the Administrative Agent or the Fronting Bank to satisfy such Bank's obligations to it under such Section until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid, and/or (ii) hold any such amounts in a segregated account as cash collateral for, and application to, any future funding obligations of such Bank under any such Section, in the case of each of clauses (i) and (ii) above, in any order as determined by the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion.

          (a) Subject to the terms contained in this Agreement (including Section 9.5(c)) and the other Loan Documents, upon the receipt of a notice in accordance with Section 2.2(b) requesting the issuance of a Letter of Credit, the Fronting Bank shall issue a Letter of Credit or Letters of Credit in such form as is reasonably acceptable to the applicable Borrower (subject to the provisions of Section 2.2(b)) in an amount or amounts equal to the amount or amounts requested by such Borrower; provided that the Fronting Bank shall issue the same only in Yen.
          (b) Each Letter of Credit shall be issued in the minimum amount of JPY10,000,000 or such lesser amount as may be agreed to by the Fronting Bank.
          (c) The Letter of Credit Usage shall be no more than the lesser of (i) JPY9,000,000,000 and (ii) twenty percent (20%) of the Facility Amount at any one time.
 
          (d) There shall be no more than twenty-five (25) Letters of Credit outstanding at any one time.
          (e) In the event of any request for a drawing under any Letter of Credit by the beneficiary thereunder, the Fronting Bank shall notify the applicable Borrower and the Administrative Agent (and the Administrative Agent shall notify each Bank thereof) on or before the date on which the Fronting Bank intends to honor such drawing, and, except as provided in this subsection (e), such Borrower shall reimburse the Fronting Bank, in immediately available funds in Yen, on the same day on which such drawing is honored in an amount equal to the amount of such drawing.
               (i) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, unless the applicable Borrower shall have notified the Administrative Agent and the Fronting Bank prior to 1:00 P.M. (New York time) on the Business Day immediately preceding the date of such drawing that such Borrower intends to reimburse the Fronting Bank for the amount of such drawing with funds other than the proceeds of the Loans, such Borrower shall be deemed to have timely given a Notice of Borrowing pursuant to Section 2.2 to the Administrative Agent, requesting a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans on the date on which such drawing is honored and in an amount equal to the amount of such drawing (in Yen). Each Bank (other than the Fronting Bank) shall, in accordance with Section 2.5(b), make available its pro rata share of such Borrowing to the Administrative Agent, the proceeds of which shall be applied directly by the Administrative Agent to reimburse the Fronting Bank for the amount of such draw. In the event that any Bank fails to make available to the Fronting Bank the amount of such Bank's participation on the date of a drawing, the Fronting Bank shall be entitled to recover such amount on demand from such Bank together with interest at the Prime Rate commencing on the date such drawing is honored, and the provisions of Section 9.16 shall otherwise apply to such failure.
               (ii) Notwithstanding the terms of Section 2.18(e)(i), (a) if any Bank has previously advised the Administrative Agent and Borrower that it is unable to make a Base Rate Loan and such notice has not been withdrawn and (b) if the applicable Borrower has not notified the Administrative Agent and the Fronting Bank prior to 1:00 P.M. (New York time) on the Business Day immediately preceding the date of such drawing that such Borrower intends to reimburse the Fronting Bank for the amount of such drawing with funds other than the proceeds of the Loans, then (x) the amount of such drawing shall be deemed to be a Borrowing of a Base Rate Loan from the Fronting Bank (to be funded solely by the Fronting Bank) on the date on which such drawing is honored and in an amount equal to the amount of such drawing (in Yen) and (y) such Borrower shall be deemed to have given a Notice of Borrowing pursuant to Section 2.2 to the Administrative Agent requesting a Borrowing of Yen LIBOR Loans with an Interest Period of 7 days (provided if such Interest Period is not available from all Banks, such Borrower shall be deemed to have elected an Interest Period of 30 days) on the date on which such drawing is honored
 
and in an amount equal to the amount of such drawing (in Yen). Each Bank shall, in accordance with Section 2.5(b), make available its Pro Rata Share of such Borrowing of Yen LIBOR Loans under clause (y) above to the Administrative Agent, the proceeds of which shall be applied directly by the Administrative Agent to repay the Base Rate Loan made by the Fronting Bank under clause (x) above. In the event that any Bank fails to fund its Pro Rata Share of such Yen LIBOR Loans in accordance with the terms of Section 2.5(b), the Fronting Bank shall be entitled to recover such amount on demand from such Bank together with interest at the Prime Rate commencing on the date such drawing is honored, and the provisions of Section 9.16 shall otherwise apply to such failure.
          (f) If, at the time a beneficiary under any Letter of Credit requests a drawing thereunder, a Guarantor Event of Default as described in Section 6.1(f) or Section 6.1(g) shall have occurred and is continuing or a Borrower Event of Default as described in Section 6.3(e) and 6.3(f) with respect to the Borrower for whose account such Letter of Credit was issued, then on the date on which the Fronting Bank shall have honored such drawing, the applicable Borrower shall have an unreimbursed obligation (the "Unreimbursed Obligation") to the Fronting Bank in an amount equal to the amount of such drawing, which amount shall bear interest at the annual rate of the sum of the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin for Base Rate Loans plus two percent (2%); provided if any Bank has previously advised the Administrative Agent and Borrower that it is unable to make a Base Rate Loan and until such notice is withdrawn, such amount shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the sum of the Applicable Margin for Yen LIBOR Loans plus Yen LIBOR with an Interest Period of 7 days (provided if such Interest Period is not available from all Banks, such rate shall be calculated based upon an Interest Period of 30 days) plus two percent (2%). Each Bank shall purchase an undivided participating interest in such drawing in an amount equal to its pro rata share of the Commitments, and upon receipt thereof the Fronting Bank shall deliver to such Bank an Unreimbursed Obligation participation certificate dated the date of the Fronting Bank's receipt of such funds and in the amount of such Bank's pro rata share.
          (g) If, after the date hereof, any change in any law or regulation or in the interpretation thereof by any court or administrative or governmental authority charged with the administration thereof shall either (i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar requirement against letters of credit issued by, or assets held by, or deposits in or for the account of, or participations in any letter of credit, upon any Bank (including the Fronting Bank) or (ii) impose on any Bank any other condition regarding this Agreement or such Bank (including the Fronting Bank) as it pertains to any Letter of Credit or any participation therein and the result of any event referred to in the preceding clause (i) or (ii) shall be to increase, by an amount deemed by the Fronting Bank or such Bank to be material, the cost to the Fronting Bank or any Bank of issuing or maintaining such Letter of Credit or participating therein, then the Borrower for whose account such Letter of Credit was
 
issued shall pay to the Fronting Bank or such Bank, within 15 days after written demand by such Bank (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), which demand shall be accompanied by a certificate showing, in reasonable detail, the calculation of such amount or amounts, such additional amounts as shall be required to compensate the Fronting Bank or such Bank for such increased costs or reduction in amounts received or receivable hereunder. Each Bank will promptly notify each affected Borrower and the Administrative Agent of any event of which it has knowledge, occurring after the date hereof, which will entitle such Bank to compensation pursuant to this Section 2.18 and will designate a different Applicable Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, such compensation and will not, in the reasonable judgment of such Bank be otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank. If such Bank shall fail to notify any affected Borrower of any such event within 90 days following the end of the month during which such event occurred, then such Borrower's liability for any amounts described in this Section incurred by such Bank as a result of such event shall be limited to those attributable to the period occurring subsequent to the ninetieth (90th) day prior to, but excluding, the date upon which such Bank actually notified such Borrower of the occurrence of such event. A certificate of any Bank claiming compensation under this Section 2.18 and setting forth a reasonably detailed calculation of the additional amount or amounts to be paid to it hereunder shall be conclusive in the absence of demonstrable error. In determining such amount, such Bank may use any reasonable averaging and attribution methods.
          (h) Each Borrower hereby agrees to protect, indemnify, pay and save the Fronting Bank harmless from and against any and all claims, demands, liabilities, damages, losses, costs, charges and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements) which the Fronting Bank may incur or be subject to as a result of (i) the issuance of Letters of Credit for the account of such Borrower, other than to the extent of the bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Fronting Bank or (ii) the failure of the Fronting Bank to honor a drawing under such Letter of Credit as a result of any act or omission, whether rightful or wrongful, of any present or future or government or governmental authority (collectively, "Governmental Acts"), other than to the extent of the bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Fronting Bank. As between the Borrower for whose account the Letter of Credit was issued and the Fronting Bank, such Borrower assumes all risks of the acts and omissions of any beneficiary with respect to its use, or misuses of, such Letter of Credit issued by the Fronting Bank. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the Fronting Bank shall not be responsible (i) for the form, validity, sufficiency, accuracy, genuineness or legal effect of any document submitted by any party in connection with the application for and issuance of such Letters of Credit, even if it should in fact prove to be in any or all respects invalid, insufficient, inaccurate, fraudulent or forged; (ii) for the validity or insufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign any such Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in
de
jure
de
facto
 
part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason; (iii) for failure of the beneficiary of any such Letter of Credit to comply fully with conditions required in order to draw upon such Letter of Credit, other than as a result of the bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Fronting Bank; (iv) for errors, omissions, interruptions or delays in transmission or delivery of any message, by mail, cable, telegraph, facsimile transmission, or otherwise; (v) for errors in interpretation of any technical terms; (vi) for any loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise of any documents required in order to make a drawing under any such Letter of Credit or of the proceeds thereof; (vii) for the misapplication by the beneficiary of any such Letter of Credit of the proceeds of such Letter of Credit; and (viii) for any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the Fronting Bank, including any Government Acts, in each case other than to the extent of the bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Fronting Bank. None of the above shall affect, impair or prevent the vesting of the Fronting Bank's rights and powers hereunder. In furtherance and extension and not in limitation of the specific provisions hereinabove set forth, any action taken or omitted by the Fronting Bank under or in connection with the Letters of Credit issued by it or the related certificates, if taken or omitted in good faith, shall not put the Fronting Bank under any resulting liability to any Borrower; provided that, notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, the Fronting Bank will be liable to the Borrower for whose account a Letter of Credit was issued for any damages suffered by such Borrower or its Subsidiaries as a result of the Fronting Bank's grossly negligent or willful failure to pay under such Letter of Credit after the presentation to it of a sight draft and certificates strictly in compliance with the terms and conditions of such Letter of Credit.
          (i) If the Fronting Bank or the Administrative Agent is required at any time, pursuant to any bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation or reorganization law or otherwise, to return to a Borrower any reimbursement by such Borrower of any drawing under any Letter of Credit, each Bank shall pay to the Fronting Bank or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, its pro rata share of such payment, but without interest thereon unless the Fronting Bank or the Administrative Agent is required to pay interest on such amounts to the person recovering such payment, in which case with interest thereon, computed at the same rate, and on the same basis, as the interest that the Fronting Bank or the Administrative Agent is required to pay.
          (j) It is hereby acknowledged and agreed by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and all of the Banks party hereto that on the Closing Date, the Letters of Credit previously issued by SMBC, as "Fronting Bank" under the Existing Revolving Credit Agreement, and more particularly set forth on Schedule 2.18 hereto, shall be transferred to this Agreement and shall be deemed to be Letters of Credit hereunder.

          SECTION 8.1. . If on or prior to the first day of any Interest Period for any Yen LIBOR Borrowing, the Administrative Agent determines in good faith that deposits in Yen (in the applicable amounts) are not being offered in the relevant market for such Interest Period, the Administrative Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof to AMB LP and the Banks, whereupon until the Administrative Agent notifies AMB LP and the Banks that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension no longer exist, the obligations of the Banks to make Yen LIBOR Loans shall be suspended. In such event, unless the applicable Borrower notifies the Administrative Agent on or before the second (2) Business Day before, but excluding, the date of any Yen LIBOR Borrowing for which a Notice of Borrowing has previously been given that it elects not to borrow on such date, such Borrowing shall instead be made as a Base Rate Borrowing (unless any Bank has previously advised the Administrative Agent and Borrower that it is unable to make a Base Rate Loan and such notice has not been withdrawn, in which event the Administrative Agent shall determine in good faith the appropriate rate of interest after consultation with the Borrower and the Banks).

nd
          If, at any time, the obligations of the Banks to make Yen LIBOR Loans shall be suspended pursuant to the terms of this Section 8.1, with respect to any Bank that has previously notified the Administrative Agent and Borrower that it is unable to make a Base Rate Loan which notice has not been withdrawn, AMB LP shall have the right, upon five (5) Business Day's notice to the Administrative Agent, to either (x) cause a bank, reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent, to offer to purchase the Commitments of such Bank for an amount equal to such Bank's outstanding Loans and to become a Bank hereunder, or to obtain the agreement of one or more existing Banks to offer to purchase the Commitments of such Bank for such amount, which offer such Bank is hereby required to accept, or (y) to repay in full all Loans then outstanding of such Bank, together with interest and all other amounts due thereon, upon which event, such Bank's Commitment shall be deemed to be canceled pursuant to Section 2.11(c).
          SECTION 8.2. . If, on or after the date of this Agreement, the adoption of any applicable law, rule or regulation, or any change in any applicable law, rule or regulation, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any Bank (or its Lending Office) with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) made after the Closing Date of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency shall make it unlawful for any Bank (or its Lending Office) (x) to make, maintain or fund its Yen LIBOR Loans, or (y) to participate in any Letter of Credit issued by the Fronting
Illegality
 
Bank, or, with respect to the Fronting Bank, to issue a Letter of Credit, the Administrative Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof to the other Banks and the Credit Parties, whereupon until such Bank notifies the Credit Parties and the Administrative Agent that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension no longer exist, the obligation of such Bank in the case of the event described in clause (x) above to make Yen LIBOR Loans, or in the case of the event described in clause (y) above, to participate in any Letter of Credit issued by the Fronting Bank or, with respect to the Fronting Bank, to issue any Letter of Credit, shall be suspended. With respect to Yen LIBOR Loans, before giving any notice to the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section, such Bank shall designate a different Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for giving such notice and will not, in the judgment of such Bank, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank. If such Bank shall determine that it may not lawfully continue to maintain and fund any of its outstanding Yen LIBOR Loans to maturity and shall so specify in such notice, the applicable Borrower shall be deemed to have delivered a Notice of Interest Rate Election and such Yen LIBOR Loan shall be converted as of such date to a Base Rate Loan (without payment of any amounts that such Borrower would otherwise be obligated to pay pursuant to Section 2.15 hereof with respect to Loans converted pursuant to this Section 8.2) in an equal principal amount from such Bank (on which interest and principal shall be payable contemporaneously with the related Yen LIBOR Loans of the other Banks), and such Bank shall make such a Base Rate Loan (unless such Bank has previously advised the Administrative Agent and Borrower that it is unable to make a Base Rate Loan, in which event the Administrative Agent shall determine in good faith the appropriate rate of interest for such Loans after consultation with the Borrower and such Bank).
          If at any time, it shall be unlawful for any Bank to make, maintain or fund its Yen LIBOR Loans, AMB LP shall have the right, upon five (5) Business Day's notice to the Administrative Agent, to either (x) cause a bank, reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent, to offer to purchase the Commitments of such Bank for an amount equal to such Bank's outstanding Loans, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon, and to become a Bank hereunder, or obtain the agreement of one or more existing Banks to offer to purchase the Commitments of such Bank for such amount, which offer such Bank is hereby required to accept, or (y) to repay in full all Loans then outstanding of such Bank, together with interest due thereon and any and all fees due hereunder, upon which event, such Bank's Commitments shall be deemed to be canceled pursuant to Section 2.11(c).
          SECTION 8.3. .
Increased Cost and Reduced Return
          (a) If, on or after the date hereof, the adoption or phase in of any applicable law, rule or regulation, or any change in any applicable law, rule, directive, guideline, decision, or regulation, or any change in the interpretation, re-interpretation, application or administration thereof by any governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or
 
compliance by any Bank (or its Lending Office) with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) made at the Closing Date of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency shall impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve (including, without limitation, any such requirement imposed by the Japanese Central Bank), special deposit, insurance assessment or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Bank (or its Lending Office) or shall impose on any Bank (or its Lending Office) or on the interbank market any other condition materially more burdensome in nature, extent or consequence than those in existence as of the Effective Date affecting such Bank's Yen LIBOR Loans, its Note, or its obligation to make Yen LIBOR Loans, and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Bank (or its Lending Office) of making or maintaining any Yen LIBOR Loan, or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Bank (or its Lending Office) under this Agreement or under its Note with respect to such Yen LIBOR Loans, by an amount deemed by such Bank to be material, then, within 15 days after demand by such Bank (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), each Borrower shall pay to such Bank such additional amount or amounts attributable to the Yen LIBOR Loans made to such Borrower (based upon a reasonable allocation thereof by such Bank to the Yen LIBOR Loans made by such Bank hereunder) as will compensate such Bank for such increased cost or reduction to the extent such Bank generally imposes such additional amounts on other borrowers of such Bank in similar circumstances.
          (b) If any Bank shall have reasonably determined that, after the date hereof, the adoption of any applicable law, rule or regulation regarding capital adequacy, or any change in any such law, rule or regulation, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any Bank with any request or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) made after the Closing Date of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on capital of such Bank (or its Parent) as a consequence of such Bank's obligations hereunder to a level below that which such Bank (or its Parent) could have achieved but for such adoption, change, request or directive (taking into consideration its policies with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount reasonably deemed by such Bank to be material, then from time to time, within 15 days after demand by such Bank (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), each Borrower shall pay to such Bank such additional amount or amounts attributable to the Yen LIBOR Loans made to such Borrower as will compensate such Bank (or its Parent) for such reduction to the extent such Bank generally imposes such additional amounts on other borrowers of such Bank in similar circumstances.
          (c) Each Bank will promptly notify AMB LP and the Administrative Agent of any event of which it has knowledge, occurring after the date hereof, which will entitle such Bank to compensation pursuant to this Section and will
 
designate a different Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, such compensation and will not, in the reasonable judgment of such Bank, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank. If such Bank shall fail to notify AMB LP of any such event within ninety (90) days following the end of the month during which such event occurred, then the applicable Borrower's and Guarantor's liability for any amounts described in this Section incurred by such Bank as a result of such event shall be limited to those attributable to the period occurring subsequent to the ninetieth (90th) day prior to, but excluding, the date upon which such Bank actually notified AMB LP of the occurrence of such event. A certificate of any Bank claiming compensation under this Section and setting forth a reasonably detailed calculation of the additional amount or amounts to be paid to it hereunder shall be conclusive in the absence of demonstrable error. In determining such amount, such Bank may use any reasonable averaging and attribution methods.
          (d) If at any time, any Bank shall be owed amounts pursuant to this Section 8.3, AMB LP shall have the right, upon five (5) Business Day's notice to the Administrative Agent to either (x) cause a bank, reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent, to offer to purchase the Commitments of such Bank for an amount equal to such Bank's outstanding Loans and to become a Bank hereunder, or to obtain the agreement of one or more existing Banks to offer to purchase the Commitments of such Bank for such amount, which offer such Bank is hereby required to accept, or (y) to repay in full all Loans then outstanding of such Bank, together with interest and all other amounts due thereon, upon which event, such Bank's Commitment shall be deemed to be canceled pursuant to Section 2.11(c).

If a Credit Party shall be required by law to deduct any Non-Excluded Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder or under any Note or Letter of Credit, (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that
Non-Excluded Taxes
 
after making all required deductions (including, without limitation, deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 8.4) such Bank, the Fronting Bank or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Credit Party shall make such deductions, (iii) the Credit Party shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance with applicable law and (iv) the Credit Party shall furnish to the Administrative Agent, at its address referred to in Section 9.1, the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof.
          (b) In addition, each Borrower agrees to pay any present or future stamp or documentary taxes and any other excise or property taxes, or charges or similar levies which arise from any payment made hereunder or under any Note made by such Borrower, any Security Documents of such Borrower or any Letter of Credit issued for the account of such Borrower or from the execution or delivery of, or otherwise with respect to, this Agreement, any Note made by such Borrower, any Security Documents of such Borrower or any Letter of Credit issued for the account of such Borrower (hereinafter referred to as "").

If such Bank shall fail to notify the Credit Parties of any such event within ninety (90) days following the end of the month during which such event occurred, then such Credit Partys' liability for such additional Non-Excluded Taxes incurred by such Bank as a result of such event (including payment of a make-whole amount under Section 8.4(a)(i)) shall be limited to those attributable to the period occurring subsequent to the ninetieth (90th) day prior to, but excluding, the date upon which such Bank actually notified the Credit Parties of the occurrence of such event.
          (d) Each Borrower agrees to indemnify each Bank, the Fronting Bank and the Administrative Agent for the full amount of Non-Excluded Taxes or Other Taxes for which such Borrower is liable under this Section 8.4 (including, without limitation, any Non-Excluded Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this Section 8.4) paid by such Bank, the Fronting Bank or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) and, so long as such Bank, the Fronting Bank or Administrative Agent has promptly paid any such Non-Excluded Taxes or Other Taxes, any liability for penalties and interest arising therefrom or with respect thereto. This indemnification shall be made within 15 days from the date such Bank, the Fronting Bank or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) makes demand therefor.
 
          (e) Each Bank confirms to the Administrative Agent and to each Credit Party (on the date hereof or, in the case of a Bank which becomes a party hereto pursuant to a transfer or assignment, on the date on which the relevant transfer or assignment becomes effective) that it is Qualified Institutional Investor and each Bank shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent and each Credit Party if there is any change in its status as a Qualified Institutional Investor.
          (f) Each Bank will promptly on request by any Borrower incorporated under the laws of Japan or borrowing through its registered branch in Japan take all reasonable steps (if any) required to be taken to establish entitlement to exemption for such Borrower from withholding under any applicable Japanese laws and any applicable double tax treaty, including satisfying any reasonable information, reporting or other requirement and completion and filing of relevant forms, claims, declarations and similar documents and shall provide such Borrower with copies of all forms, claims, declarations and similar documents filed for such purpose.
          (g) Each Bank which is established under the laws of a jurisdiction other than Japan and which is acting hereunder through a Lending Office in Japan agrees that it shall, if necessary, from time to time obtain from the relevant tax authorities a certificate certifying that such payment constitutes domestic source income (as provided for in Article 180 of the Income Tax Law (Law No. 33, 1965)) and deliver such certificate to each Borrower as required by Article 180, unless prevented from so doing as a result of the introduction of, or any change in, or any change in the interpretation or the application of, any law or regulation or as a result of compliance with any law or regulation made after the date of this Agreement. Upon reasonable demand by any Credit Party to the Administrative Agent or any Bank, the Administrative Agent or Bank, as the case may be, shall deliver to the Credit Party, or to such government or taxing authority as the Credit Party may reasonably direct, any form or document that may be required or reasonably requested in writing in order to allow the Credit Party to make a payment to or for the account of such Bank or the Administrative Agent hereunder or under any other Loan Document without any deduction or withholding for or on account of any Non-Excluded Taxes or with such deduction or withholding at a reduced rate (so long as the completion, execution or submission of such form or document would not materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of the party in receipt of such demand), with any such form or document to be accurate and completed in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the Credit Party making such demand and to be executed and to be delivered with any reasonably required certification.
          (h) For any period with respect to which a Bank has failed to provide any Borrower with the appropriate form pursuant to Section 8.4(g) (unless such failure is due to a change in treaty, law or regulation occurring subsequent to the date on which a form originally was required to be provided), such Bank shall not be entitled to indemnification under Section 8.4(d) with respect to Non-Excluded Taxes;
 
provided, however, that should a Bank, which is otherwise exempt from or subject to a reduced rate of withholding tax, become subject to Non-Excluded Taxes because of its failure to deliver a form required hereunder, such Borrower shall take such steps as such Bank shall reasonably request to assist such Bank to recover such Taxes so long as such Borrower shall incur no cost or liability as a result thereof.
          (i) If any Borrower is required to pay additional amounts to or for the account of any Bank pursuant to this Section 8.4, then such Bank will change the jurisdiction of its Lending Office so as to eliminate or reduce any such additional payment which may thereafter accrue if such change, in the judgment of such Bank, is not otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank.
          (j) If at any time, any Bank shall be owed amounts pursuant to this Section 8.4, AMB LP shall have the right, upon five (5) Business Day's notice to the Administrative Agent to either (x) cause a bank, reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent, to offer to purchase the Commitments of such Bank for an amount equal to such Bank's outstanding Loans, and to become a Bank hereunder, or to obtain the agreement of one or more existing Banks to offer to purchase the Commitments of such Bank for such amount, which offer such Bank is hereby required to accept, or (y) to repay in full all Loans then outstanding of such Bank, together with interest and all other amounts due thereon, upon which event, such Bank's Commitment shall be deemed to be canceled pursuant to Section 2.11(c).

          (b) after each of its Yen LIBOR Loans has been repaid, all payments of principal which would otherwise be applied to repay such Yen LIBOR Loans shall be applied to repay its Base Rate Loans instead (and after each of its Base

Each Bank, by its signature hereto or on the applicable Transfer Supplement, hereby agrees (a) that on the date any Loan is disbursed hereunder no portion of such Bank's Pro Rata Share of such Loan will constitute "assets" within the meaning of 29 C.F.R.  2510.3-101 of an "employee benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA or a "plan" within the meaning of Section 4975(e)(1) of the Code, and (b) that following such date such Bank shall not allocate such Bank's Pro Rata Share of any Loan to an account of such Bank if such allocation (i) by itself would cause such Pro Rata Share of such Loan to
Banks' ERISA Covenant
 
then constitute "assets" (within the meaning of 29 C.F.R.  2510.3-101) of an "employee benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA or a "plan" within the meaning of Section 4975(e)(1) of the Code and (ii) by itself would cause such Loan to constitute a prohibited transaction under ERISA or the Code (which is not exempt from the restrictions of Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code and the taxes and penalties imposed by Section 4975 of the Code and Section 502(i) of ERISA) or Administrative Agent or any Bank being deemed in violation of Section 404 of ERISA.
          SECTION 9.18. .
Bank Ceasing to be a Qualified Institutional Investor
          (a) Each Bank agrees that it shall immediately provide notice to the Administrative Agent and AMB LP upon its receipt of knowledge that it will cease to be a Qualified Institutional Investor pursuant to the applicable laws of Japan.
          (b) In the event that during the Term any Bank ceases to be a Qualified Institutional Investor (such Bank, the "Non-QII Bank"), (i) the Non-QII Bank shall immediately provide notice thereof to the Administrative Agent and AMB LP (to the extent the Non-QII Bank has not already provided such notice pursuant to 9.18(a) above) and (ii) regardless of whether the Non-QII Bank has actually delivered any such notice to the Administrative Agent and/or AMB LP, the Administrative Agent shall have the immediate right, and shall use best efforts, to cause the Non-QII Bank to assign to a Qualified Institution all of the Non-QII Bank's rights and obligations under this Agreement, the Notes and the other Loan Documents in accordance with Section 9.6(c), subject to the terms and conditions of Article 9.6, as applicable.
          (c) In the event the Administrative Agent is unable to cause the assignment of the Non-QII Bank's rights and obligations under this Agreement, the Notes and the other Loan Documents, and provided that the total amount of Commitments outstanding with respect all of the Banks other than the Non-QII Bank (such Banks, the "QII Banks") exceeds the total outstanding Loans of the Non-QII Bank as of such date, each of the Borrowers shall be deemed to have made a Base Rate Borrowing for the amount of such outstanding Commitments necessary to pay in full the total outstanding Loans of the Non-QII Bank (and each of the Borrowers shall be deemed to have timely given a Notice of Borrowing pursuant to Section 2.2 and all other conditions to such Borrowing shall be deemed waived or satisfied) (unless any Bank has previously advised the Administrative Agent and Borrower that it is unable to make a Base Rate Loan and such notice has not been withdrawn, in which event each of the Borrowers shall be deemed to have made a Yen LIBOR Borrowing with an Interest Period of 7 days (provided if such Interest Period is not available from all Banks, such Borrower shall be deemed to have elected an Interest Period of 30 days) for the amount of such outstanding Commitments necessary to pay in full the total outstanding Loans of the Non-QII Bank (and each of the Borrowers shall be deemed
 
to have timely given a Notice of Borrowing pursuant to Section 2.2 and all other conditions to such Borrowing shall be deemed waived or satisfied)). Such Borrowings shall be used to pay the Non-QII Bank's Loans in full. Upon payment in full of the Loans of the Non-QII Bank, the Non-QII Bank shall cease to be a Bank hereunder.
          (d) In the event the Administrative Agent is unable to cause the assignment of the Non-QII Bank's rights and obligations under this Agreement, the Notes and the other Loan Documents, and the total outstanding Loans of the Non-QII Bank exceed the total amount of Commitments outstanding with respect all of the QII Banks as of such date, each of the Borrowers shall be deemed to have made a Base Rate Borrowing for the total amount of such outstanding Commitments (and each of the Borrowers shall be deemed to have timely given a Notice of Borrowing pursuant to Section 2.2 and all other conditions to such Borrowing shall be deemed waived or satisfied) (unless any Bank has previously advised the Administrative Agent and Borrower that it is unable to make a Base Rate Loan and such notice has not been withdrawn, in which event each of the Borrowers shall be deemed to have made a Yen LIBOR Borrowing with an Interest Period of 7 days (provided if such Interest Period is not available from all Banks, such Borrower shall be deemed to have elected an Interest Period of 30 days) for the total amount of such outstanding Commitments (and each of the Borrowers shall be deemed to have timely given a Notice of Borrowing pursuant to Section 2.2 and all other conditions to such Borrowing shall be deemed waived or satisfied)). Such Borrowings shall be applied toward the payment of the Non-QII Bank's Loans and AMB LP shall pay the balance of the Non-QII Bank's Loans to the extent AMB LP has funds available. To the extent AMB LP does not have funds available to pay the balance of the Non-QII Bank's Loans, the Administrative Agent and the Banks shall use reasonable efforts in accordance with applicable laws to reallocate among the Borrowers the remaining outstanding Loans of the Non-QII Bank in such a manner as to minimize the tax liability to the Credit Parties. Upon payment in full of the Loans of the Non-QII Bank, the Non-QII Bank shall cease to be a Bank hereunder.
          (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, AMB LP shall have the right at any time to pay in full the Loans of any Non-QII Bank.

           NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the benefits to be derived from the making of the Loans by the Banks to the Borrowers, and in order to induce the Administrative Agent and the Banks to enter into the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Guarantors hereby agree as follows:
          1. Each Guarantor, on behalf of itself and its successors and assigns, hereby irrevocably, absolutely and unconditionally guarantees the full and punctual payment when due, whether at stated maturity or otherwise, of all Obligations of the Borrowers now or hereafter existing under the Notes and the Credit Agreement, including in the event that the Borrowers exercise the right under the Credit Agreement to increase the Facility Amount, for principal and/or interest as well as any and all other amounts due thereunder, including, without limitation, all indemnity obligations of the Borrowers thereunder, and any and all reasonable costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements) incurred by the Administrative Agent and/or the Banks in enforcing their rights under this Guaranty (all of the foregoing obligations being the "").
Guaranteed Obligations
          2. It is agreed that the Guaranteed Obligations of each Guarantor hereunder are primary, and this Guaranty shall be enforceable, jointly and severally, against each Guarantor and its respective successors and assigns without the necessity for any suit or proceeding of any kind or nature whatsoever brought by the Administrative Agent or any of the Banks against one or more of the Borrowers or their respective successors or assigns or any other party or against any security for the payment and performance of the Guaranteed Obligations and without the necessity of any notice of non-payment or non-observance or of any notice of acceptance of this Guaranty or of any notice or demand to which the Guarantors might otherwise be entitled (including, without limitation, diligence, presentment, notice of maturity, extension of time, change in nature or form of the Guaranteed Obligations, acceptance of further security, release of further security, imposition or agreement arrived at as to the amount of or the terms of the Guaranteed Obligations, notice of adverse change in any Borrower's financial condition and any other fact which might materially increase the risk to each Guarantor), all of which each Guarantor hereby expressly waives; and each Guarantor hereby expressly agrees that the validity of this Guaranty and the obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall in no way be terminated, affected, diminished, modified or impaired by reason of the assertion of or the failure to assert by the Administrative Agent or any of the Banks against one or more of the Borrowers or their respective successors or assigns, any of the rights or remedies reserved to the Administrative Agent or any of the Banks pursuant to the provisions of the Loan Documents. Each Guarantor agrees that any notice or directive given at any time to the Administrative Agent or any of the Banks which is inconsistent with the waiver in the immediately preceding sentence shall be void and may be ignored by the Administrative Agent and the Banks, and, in addition, may not be pleaded or introduced as evidence in any litigation relating to this Guaranty for the reason that such pleading or introduction would be at variance with the written terms of this Guaranty, unless the Administrative Agent has specifically agreed otherwise in a writing, signed by a duly authorized officer. Each Guarantor specifically acknowledges and agrees that the foregoing
 
waivers are of the essence of this transaction and that, but for this Guaranty and such waivers, the Administrative Agent and the Banks would not make the requested Loans to the Borrowers.
          3. Each Guarantor waives, and covenants and agrees that it will not at any time insist upon, plead or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any and all appraisal, valuation, stay, extension, marshaling-of-assets or redemption laws, or right of homestead or exemption, whether now or at any time hereafter in force, which may delay, prevent or otherwise affect the performance by each Guarantor of its obligations under, or the enforcement by the Administrative Agent or any of the Banks of, this Guaranty. Each Guarantor further covenants and agrees not to set up or claim any defense, counterclaim, offset, setoff or other objection of any kind to any action, suit or proceeding in law, equity or otherwise, or to any demand or claim that may be instituted or made by the Administrative Agent or any of the Banks other than the defense of the actual timely payment and performance by the Borrowers of the Guaranteed Obligations hereunder; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not be deemed a waiver of each Guarantor's right to assert any compulsory counterclaim, if such counterclaim is compelled under local law or rule of procedure, nor shall the foregoing be deemed a waiver of each Guarantor's right to assert any claim which would constitute a defense, setoff, counterclaim or crossclaim of any nature whatsoever against the Administrative Agent or any Bank in any separate action or proceeding. Each Guarantor represents, warrants and agrees that, as of the date hereof, its obligations under this Guaranty are not subject to any counterclaims, offsets or defenses against the Administrative Agent or any Bank of any kind.
          4. The provisions of this Guaranty are for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Banks and their successors and permitted assigns, and nothing herein contained shall impair as between any Borrower and the Administrative Agent and the Banks the obligations of any Borrower under the Loan Documents.
          5. This Guaranty shall be a continuing, unconditional and absolute guaranty and the liability of each Guarantor hereunder shall in no way be terminated, affected, modified, impaired or diminished by reason of the happening, from time to time, of any of the following, all without notice or the further consent of the Guarantors:
     (a) any assignment, amendment, modification or waiver of or change in any of the terms, covenants, conditions or provisions of any of the Guaranteed Obligations or the Loan Documents or the invalidity or unenforceability of any of the foregoing; or
     (b) any extension of time that may be granted by the Administrative Agent to any Borrower, any Guarantor, or their respective successors or assigns, heirs, executors, administrators or personal representatives; or
     (c) any action which the Administrative Agent may take or fail to take under or in respect of any of the Loan Documents or by reason of any waiver of, or failure to enforce any of the rights, remedies, powers or privileges available to the Administrative
 
Agent under this Guaranty or available to the Administrative Agent at law, equity or otherwise, or any action on the part of the Administrative Agent granting indulgence or extension in any form whatsoever; or
     (d) any sale, exchange, release, or other disposition of any property pledged, mortgaged or conveyed, or any property in which the Administrative Agent and/or the Banks have been granted a lien or security interest to secure any indebtedness of any Borrower to the Administrative Agent and/or the Banks; or
     (e) any release of any person or entity who may be liable in any manner for the payment and collection of any amounts owed by any Borrower to the Administrative Agent and/or the Banks; or
     (f) the application of any sums by whomsoever paid or however realized to any amounts owing by any Borrower to the Administrative Agent and/or the Banks under the Loan Documents in such manner as the Administrative Agent shall determine in its sole discretion; or
     (g) any Borrower's or any Guarantor's voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution, sale of all or substantially all of their respective assets and liabilities, appointment of a trustee, receiver, liquidator, sequestrator or conservator for all or any part of any Borrower's or any Guarantor's assets, insolvency, bankruptcy, assignment for the benefit of creditors, reorganization, arrangement, composition or readjustment, or the commencement of other similar proceedings affecting any Borrower or any Guarantor or any of the assets of any of them, including, without limitation, (i) the release or discharge of any Borrower or any Guarantor from the payment and performance of their respective obligations under any of the Loan Documents by operation of law, or (ii) the impairment, limitation or modification of the liability of any Borrower or any Guarantor in bankruptcy, or of any remedy for the enforcement of the Guaranteed Obligations under any of the Loan Documents, or any Guarantor's liability under this Guaranty, resulting from the operation of any present or future provisions of the Bankruptcy Code or other present or future federal, state or applicable statute or law or from the decision in any court; or
     (h) any improper disposition by any Borrower of the proceeds of the Loans, it being acknowledged by each Guarantor that the Administrative Agent or any Bank shall be entitled to honor any request made by any Borrower for a disbursement of such proceeds and that neither the Administrative Agent nor any Bank shall have any obligation to see the proper disposition by any Borrower of such proceeds.
          6. Each Guarantor agrees that if at any time all or any part of any payment at any time received by the Administrative Agent from any Borrower or any Guarantor under or with respect to this Guaranty is or must be rescinded or returned by the Administrative Agent or
 
any Bank for any reason whatsoever (including, without limitation, the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of any Borrower or any Guarantor), then such Guarantor's obligations hereunder shall, to the extent of the payment rescinded or returned, be deemed to have continued in existence notwithstanding such previous receipt by such party, and such Guarantor's obligations hereunder shall continue to be effective or reinstated, as the case may be, as to such payment, as though such previous payment had never been made.
          7. Until this Guaranty is terminated pursuant to the terms hereof, each Guarantor (i) shall have no right of subrogation against any Borrower or any entity comprising same by reason of any payments or acts of performance by such Guarantor in compliance with the obligations of such Guarantor hereunder, (ii) waives any right to enforce any remedy which such Guarantor now or hereafter shall have against any Borrower or any entity comprising same by reason of any one or more payment or acts of performance in compliance with the obligations of such Guarantor hereunder and (iii) from and after an Event of Default (as defined in the Credit Agreement), subordinates any liability or indebtedness of any Borrower or any entity comprising same now or hereafter held by such Guarantor or any affiliate of such Guarantor to the obligations of any Borrower under the Loan Documents. The foregoing, however, shall not be deemed in any way to limit any rights that any Guarantor may have at law or in equity with respect to any other partners, members or other interest holders of any Borrower.
          8. Each Guarantor represents and warrants to the Administrative Agent and the Banks with the knowledge that the Administrative Agent and the Banks are relying upon the same, as follows:
     (a) each of AMB LP and AMB Corporation is a direct or indirect owner of equity interests of the Initial Borrower and each Qualified Borrower;
     (b) based upon such relationships, each Guarantor has determined that it is in its best interests to enter into this Guaranty;
     (c) this Guaranty is necessary and convenient to the conduct, promotion and attainment of each Guarantor's business, and is in furtherance of each Guarantor's business purposes;
     (d) the benefits to be derived by each Guarantor from the Borrowers' access to funds made possible by the Loan Documents are at least equal to the obligations undertaken pursuant to this Guaranty;
     (e) each Guarantor is solvent and has full power and legal right to enter into this Guaranty and to perform its obligations under the terms hereof and (i) AMB LP is organized and validly existing under the laws of the State of Delaware and AMB Properties is organized and validly existing under the laws of the State of Maryland, (ii) each Guarantor has complied with all provisions of applicable law in connection with all
 
aspects of this Guaranty, and (iii) each person executing this Guaranty has all the requisite power and authority to execute and deliver this Guaranty;
     (f) to the best of each Guarantor's knowledge, there is no action, suit, proceeding, or investigation pending or threatened against or affecting such Guarantor at law, in equity, in admiralty or before any arbitrator or any governmental department, commission, board, bureau, agency or instrumentality (domestic or foreign) which is likely to materially and adversely impair the ability of such Guarantor to perform its obligations under this Guaranty;
     (g) the execution and delivery of, and the performance by each Guarantor of its obligations under this Guaranty, have been duly authorized by all necessary action on the part of each Guarantor and do not (i) violate any provision of any law, rule, regulation (including, without limitation, Regulation U or X of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System of the United States), order, writ, judgment, decree, determination or award presently in effect having applicability to such Guarantor or the organizational documents of such Guarantor the consequences of which violation is likely to materially and adversely impair the ability of such Guarantor to perform its obligations under this Guaranty or (ii) violate or conflict with, result in a breach of or constitute (with due notice or lapse of time or both) a default under any indenture, agreement or other instrument to which such Guarantor is a party, or by which such Guarantor or any of its property is bound, the consequences of which violation, conflict, breach or default is likely to materially and adversely impair the ability of such Guarantor to perform its obligations under this Guaranty;
     (h) this Guaranty has been duly executed by each Guarantor and constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of each Guarantor, enforceable against such Guarantor in accordance with its terms except as enforceability may be limited by applicable insolvency, bankruptcy or other laws affecting creditors' rights generally or general principles of equity, whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law;
     (i) no authorization, consent, approval, license or formal exemption from, nor any filing, declaration or registration with, any Federal, state, local or foreign court, governmental agency or regulatory authority is required in connection with the making and performance by each Guarantor of this Guaranty, except those which have already been obtained; and
     (j) neither Guarantor is an "investment company" as that term is defined in, nor is it otherwise subject to regulation under, the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
          9. Guarantor and Administrative Agent each acknowledge and agree that this
 
Guaranty is a guarantee of payment and performance and not of collection and enforcement in respect of any obligations which may accrue to the Administrative Agent and/or the Banks from any Borrower under the provisions of any Loan Document.
          10. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement, and in conjunction therewith, the Administrative Agent or any Bank may assign any or all of its rights under this Guaranty. In the event of any such assignment, the Administrative Agent shall give each Guarantor prompt notice of same. If the Administrative Agent elects to sell all the Loans or participations in the Loans and the Loan Documents, including this Guaranty, the Administrative Agent or any Bank may forward to each purchaser and prospective purchaser all documents and information relating to this Guaranty or to each Guarantor, whether furnished by any Borrower or any Guarantor or otherwise, subject to the terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement.
          11. Each Guarantor agrees, upon the written request of the Administrative Agent, to execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent, from time to time, any modification or amendment hereto or any additional instruments or documents reasonably considered necessary by the Administrative Agent or its counsel to cause this Guaranty to be, become or remain valid and effective in accordance with its terms, provided, that, any such modification, amendment, additional instrument or document shall not increase Guarantor's obligations or diminish its rights hereunder and shall be reasonably satisfactory as to form to each Guarantor and to such Guarantor's counsel.
          12. The representations and warranties of each Guarantor set forth in this Guaranty shall survive until this Guaranty shall terminate in accordance with the terms hereof.
          13. This Guaranty contains the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements relating to such subject matter and may not be modified, amended, supplemented or discharged except by a written agreement signed by each Guarantor and the Administrative Agent.
          14. If all or any portion of any provision contained in this Guaranty shall be determined to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect for any reason, such provision or portion thereof shall be deemed stricken and severed from this Guaranty and the remaining provisions and portions thereof shall continue in full force and effect.
          15. This Guaranty may be executed in counterparts which together shall constitute the same instrument.
 
          16. All notices, requests and other communications to any party hereunder shall be in writing (including bank wire, telex, facsimile transmission followed by telephonic confirmation or similar writing) and shall be addressed to such party at the address set forth below or to such other address as may be identified by any party in a written notice to the others:
 
          Each such notice, request or other communication shall be effective (i) if given by telex or facsimile transmission, when such telex or facsimile is transmitted to the telex number or facsimile number specified in this Section and the appropriate answerback or facsimile confirmation is received, (ii) if given by certified registered mail, return receipt requested, with first class postage prepaid, addressed as aforesaid, upon receipt or refusal to accept delivery, (iii) if given by a nationally recognized overnight carrier, 24 hours after such communication is deposited with such carrier with postage prepaid for next day delivery, or (iv) if given by any other means, when delivered at the address specified in this Section.
          17. Any acknowledgment or new promise, whether by payment of principal or interest or otherwise by any Borrower or any Guarantor, with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations shall, if the statute of limitations in favor of any Guarantor against the Administrative Agent shall have commenced to run, toll the running of such statute of limitations, and if the period of such statute of limitations shall have expired, prevent the operation of such statute of limitations.
          18. This Guaranty shall be binding upon each Guarantor and its successors and assigns and shall inure to the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Banks and their respective successors and permitted assigns.
          19. The failure of the Administrative Agent to enforce any right or remedy hereunder, or promptly to enforce any such right or remedy, shall not constitute a waiver thereof, nor give rise to any estoppel against the Administrative Agent, nor excuse any Guarantor from its obligations hereunder. Any waiver of any such right or remedy to be enforceable against the Administrative Agent must be expressly set forth in a writing signed by the Administrative Agent.
          20. (a)
THIS GUARANTY AND THE RIGHTS AND
 
OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES HEREUNDER SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH AND BE GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK PURSUANT TO SECTION 5-1401 OF THE GENERAL OBLIGATIONS LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK (WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO THE PRINCIPLES THEREOF RELATING TO CONFLICTS OF LAW).
               (b) Any legal action or proceeding with respect to this Guaranty and any action for enforcement of any judgment in respect thereof may be brought in the courts of the State of New York or of the United States of America for the Southern District of New York, and, by execution and delivery of this Guaranty, each Guarantor hereby accepts for itself and in respect of its property, generally and unconditionally, the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and appellate courts from any thereof. Each Guarantor irrevocably consents to the service of process out of any of the aforementioned courts in any such action or proceeding by the mailing of copies thereof by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, to such Guarantor at its address for notices set forth herein. Each Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any of the aforesaid actions or proceedings arising out of or in connection with this Guaranty brought in the courts referred to above and hereby further irrevocably waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court that any such action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Nothing herein shall affect the right of the Administrative Agent to serve process in any other manner permitted by law or to commence legal proceedings or otherwise proceed against any Guarantor in any other jurisdiction.
               (c) EACH GUARANTOR HEREBY WAIVES ITS RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL OF ANY AND ALL CLAIMS OR CAUSES OF ACTION BASED UPON OR ARISING OUT OF THIS GUARANTY. IT IS HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGED BY EACH GUARANTOR THAT THE WAIVER OF A JURY TRIAL IS A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT FOR THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT TO ACCEPT THIS GUARANTY AND THAT THE LOANS MADE BY THE BANKS ARE MADE IN RELIANCE UPON SUCH WAIVER. EACH GUARANTOR FURTHER WARRANTS AND REPRESENTS THAT SUCH WAIVER HAS BEEN KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY MADE, FOLLOWING CONSULTATION WITH LEGAL COUNSEL. IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, THIS GUARANTY MAY BE FILED BY THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT IN COURT AS A WRITTEN CONSENT TO A NON-JURY TRIAL.
               (d) Each Guarantor does hereby further covenant and agree to and with the Administrative Agent that each Guarantor may be joined in any action against any Borrower in connection with the Loan Documents and that recovery may be had against either or both Guarantors in such action or in any independent action against either or both Guarantors (with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations), without the Administrative Agent first pursuing or exhausting any remedy or claim against any Borrower or their successors or assigns. Each Guarantor also agrees that, in an action brought with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations in any jurisdiction, they each shall be conclusively bound by the judgment in any such action by the
 
Administrative Agent (wherever brought) against any Borrower or their successors or assigns, as if Guarantors were parties to such action, even though one or both of Guarantors were not joined as a party or parties in such action.
               (e) Each Guarantor agrees to pay all reasonable expenses (including, without limitation, attorneys' fees and disbursements) which may be incurred by the Administrative Agent or the Banks in connection with the enforcement of their rights under this Guaranty, whether or not suit is initiated.
          21. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, this Guaranty shall terminate and be of no further force or effect upon the full performance and payment of the Guaranteed Obligations hereunder. Upon termination of this Guaranty in accordance with the terms of this Guaranty, the Administrative Agent promptly shall deliver to each Guarantor such documents as such Guarantor or such Guarantor's counsel reasonably may request in order to evidence such termination.
          22. All of the Administrative Agent's rights and remedies under each of the Loan Documents or under this Guaranty are intended to be distinct, separate and cumulative and no such right or remedy therein or herein mentioned is intended to be in exclusion of or a waiver of any other right or remedy available to the Administrative Agent.
          23. Neither Guarantor shall use any assets of an "employee benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA or a "plan" within the meaning of Section 4975(e)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code (the "") to repay or secure the Loan, the Note, the Obligations or this Guaranty. Neither Guarantor shall assign, sell, pledge, encumber, transfer, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of any of its rights or interests (direct or indirect) in any Borrower, or attempt to do any of the foregoing or suffer any of the foregoing, or permit any party with a direct or indirect interest or right in any Borrower to do any of the foregoing, if such action would cause the Note, the Loan, the Obligations, this Guaranty, or any of the Loan Documents or the exercise of any of the Administrative Agent's or Bank's rights in connection therewith, to constitute a prohibited transaction under ERISA or the Code (unless such Guarantor furnishes to the Administrative Agent a legal opinion satisfactory to the Administrative Agent that the transaction is exempt from the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and the Code (and for this purpose, the Administrative Agent and the Banks, by accepting the benefits of this Guaranty, hereby agree to supply each Guarantor all relevant non-confidential, factual information reasonably necessary to such legal opinion and reasonably requested by such Guarantor) or would otherwise result in the Administrative Agent or any of the Banks being deemed in violation of Sections 404 or 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or would otherwise result in the Administrative Agent or any of the Banks being a fiduciary or party in interest under ERISA or a "disqualified person" as defined in Section 4975(e)(2) of the Code with respect to an "employee benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA or a "plan" within the meaning of Section 4975(e)(1) of the Code. The Guarantors shall jointly and severally indemnify and hold each of the Administrative Agent and the Banks free and harmless
