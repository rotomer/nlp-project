Each Guarantor waives, and covenants and agrees that it will not at any time insist upon, plead or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any and all appraisal, valuation, stay, extension, marshaling-of-assets or redemption laws, or right of homestead or exemption, whether now or at any time hereafter in force, which may delay, prevent or otherwise affect the performance by each Guarantor of its obligations under, or the enforcement by the Administrative Agent or any of the Banks of, this Guaranty. Each Guarantor further covenants and agrees not to set up or claim any defense, counterclaim, offset, setoff or other objection of any kind to any action, suit or proceeding in law, equity or otherwise, or to any demand or claim that may be instituted or made by the Administrative Agent or any of the Banks other than the defense of the actual timely payment and performance by the Borrowers of the Guaranteed Obligations hereunder; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not be deemed a waiver of each Guarantor's right to assert any compulsory counterclaim, if such counterclaim is compelled under local law or rule of procedure, nor shall the foregoing be deemed a waiver of each Guarantor's right to assert any claim which would constitute a defense, setoff, counterclaim or crossclaim of any nature whatsoever against the Administrative Agent or any Bank in any separate action or proceeding. Each Guarantor represents, warrants and agrees that, as of the date hereof, its obligations under this Guaranty are not subject to any counterclaims, offsets or defenses against the Administrative Agent or any Bank of any kind.
          4. The provisions of this Guaranty are for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Banks and their successors and permitted assigns, and nothing herein contained shall impair as between any Borrower and the Administrative Agent and the Banks the obligations of any Borrower under the Loan Documents.
          5. This Guaranty shall be a continuing, unconditional and absolute guaranty and the liability of each Guarantor hereunder shall in no way be terminated, affected, modified, impaired or diminished by reason of the happening, from time to time, of any of the following, all without notice or the further consent of the Guarantors:
     (a) any assignment, amendment, modification or waiver of or change in any of the terms, covenants, conditions or provisions of any of the Guaranteed Obligations or the Loan Documents or the invalidity or unenforceability of any of the foregoing; or
     (b) any extension of time that may be granted by the Administrative Agent to any Borrower, any Guarantor, or their respective successors or assigns, heirs, executors, administrators or personal representatives; or
     (c) any action which the Administrative Agent may take or fail to take under or in respect of any of the Loan Documents or by reason of any waiver of, or failure to enforce any of the rights, remedies, powers or privileges available to the Administrative Agent under this Guaranty or available to the Administrative Agent at law, equity or otherwise, or any action on the part of the Administrative Agent granting indulgence or
 
extension in any form whatsoever; or
     (d) any sale, exchange, release, or other disposition of any property pledged, mortgaged or conveyed, or any property in which the Administrative Agent and/or the Banks have been granted a lien or security interest to secure any indebtedness of any Borrower to the Administrative Agent and/or the Banks; or
     (e) any release of any person or entity who may be liable in any manner for the payment and collection of any amounts owed by any Borrower to the Administrative Agent and/or the Banks; or
     (f) the application of any sums by whomsoever paid or however realized to any amounts owing by any Borrower to the Administrative Agent and/or the Banks under the Loan Documents in such manner as the Administrative Agent shall determine in its sole discretion; or
     (g) any Borrower's or any Guarantor's voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution, sale of all or substantially all of their respective assets and liabilities, appointment of a trustee, receiver, liquidator, sequestrator or conservator for all or any part of any Borrower's or any Guarantor's assets, insolvency, bankruptcy, assignment for the benefit of creditors, reorganization, arrangement, composition or readjustment, or the commencement of other similar proceedings affecting any Borrower or any Guarantor or any of the assets of any of them, including, without limitation, (i) the release or discharge of any Borrower or any Guarantor from the payment and performance of their respective obligations under any of the Loan Documents by operation of law, or (ii) the impairment, limitation or modification of the liability of any Borrower or any Guarantor in bankruptcy, or of any remedy for the enforcement of the Guaranteed Obligations under any of the Loan Documents, or any Guarantor's liability under this Guaranty, resulting from the operation of any present or future provisions of the Bankruptcy Code or other present or future federal, state or applicable statute or law or from the decision in any court; or
     (h) any improper disposition by any Borrower of the proceeds of the Loans, it being acknowledged by each Guarantor that the Administrative Agent or any Bank shall be entitled to honor any request made by any Borrower for a disbursement of such proceeds and that neither the Administrative Agent nor any Bank shall have any obligation to see the proper disposition by any Borrower of such proceeds.
          6. Each Guarantor agrees that if at any time all or any part of any payment at any time received by the Administrative Agent from any Borrower or any Guarantor under or with respect to this Guaranty is or must be rescinded or returned by the Administrative Agent or any Bank for any reason whatsoever (including, without limitation, the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of any Borrower or any Guarantor), then such Guarantor's obligations hereunder shall, to the extent of the payment rescinded or returned, be deemed to have continued
 
in existence notwithstanding such previous receipt by such party, and such Guarantor's obligations hereunder shall continue to be effective or reinstated, as the case may be, as to such payment, as though such previous payment had never been made.
          7. Until this Guaranty is terminated pursuant to the terms hereof, each Guarantor (i) shall have no right of subrogation against any Borrower or any entity comprising same by reason of any payments or acts of performance by such Guarantor in compliance with the obligations of such Guarantor hereunder, (ii) waives any right to enforce any remedy which such Guarantor now or hereafter shall have against any Borrower or any entity comprising same by reason of any one or more payment or acts of performance in compliance with the obligations of such Guarantor hereunder and (iii) from and after an Event of Default (as defined in the Credit Agreement), subordinates any liability or indebtedness of any Borrower or any entity comprising same now or hereafter held by such Guarantor or any affiliate of such Guarantor to the obligations of any Borrower under the Loan Documents. The foregoing, however, shall not be deemed in any way to limit any rights that any Guarantor may have at law or in equity with respect to any other partners, members or other interest holders of any Borrower.
          8. Each Guarantor represents and warrants to the Administrative Agent and the Banks with the knowledge that the Administrative Agent and the Banks are relying upon the same, as follows:
     (a) each of Prologis LP and General Partner is a direct or indirect owner of equity interests of the Initial Borrower and each Qualified Borrower;
     (b) based upon such relationships, each Guarantor has determined that it is in its best interests to enter into this Guaranty;

     (f) to the best of each Guarantor's knowledge, there is no action, suit,
 
proceeding, or investigation pending or threatened against or affecting such Guarantor at law, in equity, in admiralty or before any arbitrator or any governmental department, commission, board, bureau, agency or instrumentality (domestic or foreign) which is likely to materially and adversely impair the ability of such Guarantor to perform its obligations under this Guaranty;
     (g) the execution and delivery of, and the performance by each Guarantor of its obligations under this Guaranty, have been duly authorized by all necessary action on the part of each Guarantor and do not (i) violate any provision of any law, rule, regulation (including, without limitation, Regulation U or X of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System of the United States), order, writ, judgment, decree, determination or award presently in effect having applicability to such Guarantor or the organizational documents of such Guarantor the consequences of which violation is likely to materially and adversely impair the ability of such Guarantor to perform its obligations under this Guaranty or (ii) violate or conflict with, result in a breach of or constitute (with due notice or lapse of time or both) a default under any indenture, agreement or other instrument to which such Guarantor is a party, or by which such Guarantor or any of its property is bound, the consequences of which violation, conflict, breach or default is likely to materially and adversely impair the ability of such Guarantor to perform its obligations under this Guaranty;
     (h) this Guaranty has been duly executed by each Guarantor and constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of each Guarantor, enforceable against such Guarantor in accordance with its terms except as enforceability may be limited by applicable insolvency, bankruptcy or other laws affecting creditors' rights generally or general principles of equity, whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law;
     (i) no authorization, consent, approval, license or formal exemption from, nor any filing, declaration or registration with, any Federal, state, local or foreign court, governmental agency or regulatory authority is required in connection with the making and performance by each Guarantor of this Guaranty, except those which have already been obtained; and
     (j) neither Guarantor is an "investment company" as that term is defined in, nor is it otherwise subject to regulation under, the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
          9. Guarantor and Administrative Agent each acknowledge and agree that this Guaranty is a guarantee of payment and performance and not of collection and enforcement in respect of any obligations which may accrue to the Administrative Agent and/or the Banks from any Borrower under the provisions of any Loan Document.
          10. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement, and in
 
conjunction therewith, the Administrative Agent or any Bank may assign any or all of its rights under this Guaranty. In the event of any such assignment, the Administrative Agent shall give each Guarantor prompt notice of same. If the Administrative Agent elects to sell all the Loans or participations in the Loans and the Loan Documents, including this Guaranty, the Administrative Agent or any Bank may forward to each purchaser and prospective purchaser all documents and information relating to this Guaranty or to each Guarantor, whether furnished by any Borrower or any Guarantor or otherwise, subject to the terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement.
          11. Each Guarantor agrees, upon the written request of the Administrative Agent, to execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent, from time to time, any modification or amendment hereto or any additional instruments or documents reasonably considered necessary by the Administrative Agent or its counsel to cause this Guaranty to be, become or remain valid and effective in accordance with its terms, provided, that, any such modification, amendment, additional instrument or document shall not increase Guarantor's obligations or diminish its rights hereunder and shall be reasonably satisfactory as to form to each Guarantor and to such Guarantor's counsel.
          12. The representations and warranties of each Guarantor set forth in this Guaranty shall survive until this Guaranty shall terminate in accordance with the terms hereof.
          13. This Guaranty contains the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements relating to such subject matter and may not be modified, amended, supplemented or discharged except by a written agreement signed by each Guarantor and the Administrative Agent.
          14. If all or any portion of any provision contained in this Guaranty shall be determined to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect for any reason, such provision or portion thereof shall be deemed stricken and severed from this Guaranty and the remaining provisions and portions thereof shall continue in full force and effect.
          15. This Guaranty may be executed in counterparts which together shall constitute the same instrument.
          16. All notices, requests and other communications to any party hereunder shall be in writing (including bank wire, telex, facsimile transmission followed by telephonic confirmation or similar writing) and shall be addressed to such party at the address set forth below or to such other address as may be identified by any party in a written notice to the others:
 
          Each such notice, request or other communication shall be effective (i) if given by telex or facsimile transmission, when such telex or facsimile is transmitted to the telex number or facsimile number specified in this Section and the appropriate answerback or facsimile confirmation is received, (ii) if given by certified registered mail, return receipt requested, with first class postage prepaid, addressed as aforesaid, upon receipt or refusal to accept delivery, (iii) if given by a nationally recognized overnight carrier, 24 hours after such communication is deposited with such carrier with postage prepaid for next day delivery, or (iv) if given by any other means, when delivered at the address specified in this Section.
          17. Any acknowledgment or new promise, whether by payment of principal or interest or otherwise by any Borrower or any Guarantor, with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations shall, if the statute of limitations in favor of any Guarantor against the Administrative Agent shall have commenced to run, toll the running of such statute of limitations,
 
and if the period of such statute of limitations shall have expired, prevent the operation of such statute of limitations.

          19. The failure of the Administrative Agent to enforce any right or remedy hereunder, or promptly to enforce any such right or remedy, shall not constitute a waiver thereof, nor give rise to any estoppel against the Administrative Agent, nor excuse any Guarantor from its obligations hereunder. Any waiver of any such right or remedy to be enforceable against the Administrative Agent must be expressly set forth in a writing signed by the Administrative Agent.
          20. (a)
THIS GUARANTY AND THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES HEREUNDER SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH AND BE GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK PURSUANT TO SECTION 5-1401 OF THE GENERAL OBLIGATIONS LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK (WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO THE PRINCIPLES THEREOF RELATING TO CONFLICTS OF LAW).
               (b) Any legal action or proceeding with respect to this Guaranty and any action for enforcement of any judgment in respect thereof may be brought in the courts of the State of New York or of the United States of America for the Southern District of New York, and, by execution and delivery of this Guaranty, each Guarantor hereby accepts for itself and in respect of its property, generally and unconditionally, the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and appellate courts from any thereof. Each Guarantor irrevocably consents to the service of process out of any of the aforementioned courts in any such action or proceeding by the mailing of copies thereof by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, to such Guarantor at its address for notices set forth herein. Each Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any of the aforesaid actions or proceedings arising out of or in connection with this Guaranty brought in the courts referred to above and hereby further irrevocably waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court that any such action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Nothing herein shall affect the right of the Administrative Agent to serve process in any other manner permitted by law or to commence legal proceedings or otherwise proceed against any Guarantor in any other jurisdiction.
               (c) EACH GUARANTOR HEREBY WAIVES ITS RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL OF ANY AND ALL CLAIMS OR CAUSES OF ACTION BASED UPON OR ARISING OUT OF THIS GUARANTY. IT IS HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGED BY EACH GUARANTOR THAT THE WAIVER OF A JURY TRIAL IS A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT FOR THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT TO ACCEPT THIS GUARANTY AND THAT THE LOANS MADE BY THE BANKS ARE MADE IN RELIANCE UPON SUCH WAIVER.
 
EACH GUARANTOR FURTHER WARRANTS AND REPRESENTS THAT SUCH WAIVER HAS BEEN KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY MADE, FOLLOWING CONSULTATION WITH LEGAL COUNSEL. IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, THIS GUARANTY MAY BE FILED BY THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT IN COURT AS A WRITTEN CONSENT TO A NON-JURY TRIAL.
               (d) Each Guarantor does hereby further covenant and agree to and with the Administrative Agent that each Guarantor may be joined in any action against any Borrower in connection with the Loan Documents and that recovery may be had against either or both Guarantors in such action or in any independent action against either or both Guarantors (with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations), without the Administrative Agent first pursuing or exhausting any remedy or claim against any Borrower or their successors or assigns. Each Guarantor also agrees that, in an action brought with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations in any jurisdiction, they each shall be conclusively bound by the judgment in any such action by the Administrative Agent (wherever brought) against any Borrower or their successors or assigns, as if Guarantors were parties to such action, even though one or both of Guarantors were not joined as a party or parties in such action.
               (e) Each Guarantor agrees to pay all reasonable and documented expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable and documented attorneys' fees and disbursements) which may be incurred by the Administrative Agent or the Banks in connection with the enforcement of their rights under this Guaranty, whether or not suit is initiated.
     21. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, this Guaranty shall terminate and be of no further force or effect upon the full performance and payment of the Guaranteed Obligations hereunder. Upon termination of this Guaranty in accordance with the terms of this Guaranty, the Administrative Agent promptly shall deliver to each Guarantor such documents as such Guarantor or such Guarantor's counsel reasonably may request in order to evidence such termination.
     22. All of the Administrative Agent's rights and remedies under each of the Loan Documents or under this Guaranty are intended to be distinct, separate and cumulative and no such right or remedy therein or herein mentioned is intended to be in exclusion of or a waiver of any other right or remedy available to the Administrative Agent.
     23. Neither Guarantor shall use any assets of an "employee benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA or a "plan" within the meaning of Section 4975(e)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code (the "") to repay or secure the Loan, the Note, the Obligations or this Guaranty. Neither Guarantor shall assign, sell, pledge, encumber, transfer, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of any of its rights or interests (direct or indirect) in any Borrower, or attempt to do any of the foregoing or suffer any of the foregoing, or permit any party with a direct or indirect interest or right in any Borrower to do any of the foregoing, if such action would cause the Note, the Loan, the Obligations, this Guaranty, or any of the Loan Documents or the exercise of any of the Administrative Agent's or Bank's rights in connection
Code
 
therewith, to constitute a prohibited transaction under ERISA or the Code (unless such Guarantor furnishes to the Administrative Agent a legal opinion satisfactory to the Administrative Agent that the transaction is exempt from the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and the Code (and for this purpose, the Administrative Agent and the Banks, by accepting the benefits of this Guaranty, hereby agree to supply each Guarantor all relevant non-confidential, factual information reasonably necessary to such legal opinion and reasonably requested by such Guarantor) or would otherwise result in the Administrative Agent or any of the Banks being deemed in violation of Sections 404 or 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or would otherwise result in the Administrative Agent or any of the Banks being a fiduciary or party in interest under ERISA or a "disqualified person" as defined in Section 4975(e)(2) of the Code with respect to an "employee benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA or a "plan" within the meaning of Section 4975(e)(1) of the Code. The Guarantors shall jointly and severally indemnify and hold each of the Administrative Agent and the Banks free and harmless from and against all loss, costs (including reasonable and documented attorneys' fees and expenses), expenses, taxes and damages (including consequential damages) that each of the Administrative Agent and the Banks may suffer by reason of the investigation, defense and settlement of claims and in obtaining any prohibited transaction exemption under ERISA necessary in Administrative Agent's reasonable judgment as a result of such Guarantor's action or inaction or by reason of a breach of the foregoing provisions by such Guarantor.

     NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, Guarantors agree as follows:

     (b) All costs, expenses and fees, including court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees, in each case arising in connection with the collection of any or all amounts, indebtedness, obligations and liabilities of Guarantors under this Guaranty.
     The Guaranteed Debt, and the liabilities and obligations of Guarantors hereunder, shall not be reduced, discharged or released because of any existing or future offset, claim or defense (other than the defense of indefeasible

payment and satisfaction in full in cash) of Borrower, either Guarantor or any other Person against any Credit Party or against payment of the Guaranteed Debt, whether such offset, claim or defense arises in connection with the Guaranteed Debt (or the transactions creating the Guaranteed Debt) or otherwise.
     Each Guarantor irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees (a) the due and punctual payment of the Guaranteed Debt and (b) the timely performance of all other obligations now or hereafter owed by Borrower to the Credit Parties under the Credit Facility. Each Guarantor irrevocably and unconditionally covenants and agrees that it is liable for the Guaranteed Debt as primary obligor.
1.3 Guaranty of Obligation.

The fact that at any time or from time to time the Guaranteed Debt may be increased, reduced or paid in full shall not release, discharge or reduce the obligation of either Guarantor with respect to indebtedness or obligations of Borrower to the Credit Parties thereafter incurred (or other Guaranteed Debt thereafter arising) under or in connection with the Credit Facility. This Guaranty may be enforced by the Credit Parties and shall not be discharged by the assignment or negotiation of all or part of the Guaranteed Debt.
1.4 Nature of Guaranty.
     If all or any part of the Guaranteed Debt shall not be paid when due, whether at maturity or earlier by acceleration or otherwise, then Guarantors shall, immediately upon demand by Administrative Agent, and without presentment, protest, notice of protest, notice of nonpayment, notice of intention to accelerate or acceleration, or any other notice whatsoever, pay, in the currency required by the Credit Facility, the amount due on the Guaranteed Debt to Administrative Agent at the account specified by Administrative Agent in accordance with Section 3.8.2 of the Credit Facility. Any such demand may be made at any time coincident with or after the time for payment of all or part of the Guaranteed Debt, and may be made from time to time with respect to the same or different items of Guaranteed Debt. Any such demand shall be deemed made, given and received in accordance with .
1.5 Payment by Guarantors.
Section 6.2
     If a Guarantor should breach or fail to timely perform any provision of this Guaranty, then such Guarantor shall, immediately upon demand by Administrative Agent, pay to Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Credit Parties, all costs and expenses (including court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by the Credit Parties in the enforcement hereof or the preservation of the Credit Parties' rights hereunder. The covenant contained in this shall survive the payment of the Guaranteed Debt.
1.6 Payment of Expenses.
Section 1.6
     It shall not be necessary for any Credit Party (and each Guarantor hereby waives any right that such Guarantor may have to require any Credit Party), in order to enforce payment by such Guarantor, first to (a) institute suit or exhaust its remedies against Borrower or any other Person liable on the Guaranteed Debt, (b) enforce the Credit Parties' rights against any security which shall ever have been given to secure the Guaranteed Debt, (c) join such Guarantor or any other Person liable on the Guaranteed Debt in any action seeking to enforce this Guaranty, (d) exhaust any remedies available to the Credit Parties against any security which shall ever have been given to secure the Guaranteed Debt or

The Credit Parties shall not be required to mitigate damages or take any other action to reduce, collect or enforce the Guaranteed Debt. Further, each Guarantor expressly waives each and every right to which it may be entitled by virtue of the suretyship law of New York and each other applicable jurisdiction.
     Each Guarantor agrees to the provisions of the Credit Facility and waives notice of (a) any loan or advance made by any Credit Party to Borrower, (b) acceptance of this Guaranty, (c) any amendment or extension of the Credit Facility or any other instrument or document pertaining to all or any part of the Guaranteed Debt, (d) the execution and delivery by Borrower and any Credit Party of any amendment or any other modification to the Credit Facility or any document related thereto, (e) the occurrence of any Event of Default, (f) any transfer of the Guaranteed Debt, or any part thereof, (g) sale or foreclosure (or posting or advertising for sale or foreclosure) of any collateral for the Guaranteed Debt, (h) protest, proof of nonpayment or default by Borrower or a Guarantor, (i) the release of any other guarantor of the Guaranteed Debt and (j) any other action at any time taken or omitted by any Credit Party and, generally, all demands and notices of every kind in connection with this Guaranty, the Credit Facility and any other document or agreement evidencing, securing or relating to any of the Guaranteed Debt.
1.8 Waiver of Notices, etc.
     If, pursuant to any insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization, receivership or other debtor relief law, or any judgment, order or decision thereunder, or for any other reason, (a) any Credit Party must rescind or restore any payment, or any part thereof, received in satisfaction of the Guaranteed Debt, any prior release or discharge from the terms of this Guaranty shall be without effect, and this Guaranty shall remain in full force and effect; or (b) Borrower shall cease to be liable to the Credit Parties for any of the Guaranteed Debt (other than by reason of the indefeasible payment in full thereof), then the obligations of each Guarantor under this Guaranty shall remain in full force and effect. The Credit Parties and Guarantors intend that Guarantors' obligations hereunder shall not be discharged except by Guarantors' performance of such obligations and then only to the extent of such performance. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Credit Parties and Guarantors intend that the filing of any bankruptcy or similar proceeding by or against Borrower or any other Person obligated on any portion of the Guaranteed Debt shall not affect the obligations of Guarantors under this Guaranty or the rights of the Credit Parties under this Guaranty, including the right or ability of the Credit Parties to pursue or institute suit against either Guarantor for the entire Guaranteed Debt.

upon any Guarantor Claim. Each Guarantor hereby assigns such dividends and payments to the Administrative Agent. If the Administrative Agent receives, for application upon the Guaranteed Debt, any such dividend or payment which is otherwise payable to a Guarantor, and which, as between Borrower and such Guarantor, shall constitute a credit upon the Guarantor Claims, then upon payment to the Credit Parties in full of the Guaranteed Debt, such Guarantor shall become subrogated to the rights of the Credit Parties to the extent that such dividends and payments on the Guarantor Claims have contributed toward the liquidation of the Guaranteed Debt, and such subrogation shall be with respect to that proportion of the Guaranteed Debt which would have been unpaid if the Administrative Agent had not received dividends or payments upon the Guarantor Claims.
     In the event that, notwithstanding and , a Guarantor should receive any funds, payment, claim or distribution which is prohibited by such Sections, such Guarantor agrees to hold in trust for the Administrative Agent, in kind, all funds, payments, claims or distributions so received, and agrees that it shall have absolutely no dominion over such funds, payments, claim or distributions so received except to pay them promptly to the Administrative Agent and such Guarantor covenants promptly to pay the same to the Administrative Agent (subject to any agreement between such Guarantor and any holder of indebtedness that ranks pari passu with the obligations of such Guarantor hereunder).
