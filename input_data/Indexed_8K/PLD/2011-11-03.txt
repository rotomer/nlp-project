Explanatory Note
This Amendment No. 1 to Form 8-K is being filed to amend the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by AMB Property Corporation, now known as Prologis, Inc. (the "Company"), on May 10, 2011 (the "Original 8-K"). The Original 8-K was filed to report the results of the matters submitted to a vote at the Company's 2011 Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on May 5, 2011 (the "Annual Meeting"). Except for the following, this Amendment No. 1 does not modify or update any other disclosure contained in the Original 8-K, and this Amendment No. 1 should be read in conjunction with the Original 8-K.
Item 5.07. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.
As previously reported, at the Annual Meeting the stockholders recommended, on a non-binding basis, that an advisory vote on the Company's executive compensation (referred to as "Say-on-Pay" votes) should be held annually.
In light of the merger of equals transaction completed on June 3, 2011 between the Company and ProLogis that resulted in the combined company named Prologis, Inc., and the resulting significant changes to the board of directors, stockholders and management of the Company, the Company will hold an advisory Say-on-Pay vote and an advisory vote on the frequency of future Say-on-Pay votes at the Company's Annual Meeting of Stockholders in 2012.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
