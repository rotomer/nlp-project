On February 2, 2012, Prologis, Inc., a Maryland corporation ("Prologis"), Prologis, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the "Operating Partnership"), and various affiliates of the Operating Partnership entered into a Senior Term Loan Agreement (the "Loan Agreement") with various lenders and Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent. Pursuant to the Loan Agreement, the Operating Partnership and various affiliates thereof (collectively the "Borrowers") may obtain loans in various currencies in an aggregate amount not to exceed 487,500,000 (subject to increase up to 987,500,000 pursuant to the accordion feature included in the Loan Agreement). The Loan Agreement permits the Borrowers to re-borrow, within a specified period of time, any amounts prepaid thereunder. The initial borrowing under the Loan Agreement occurred on February 7, 2012.
The Loan Agreement is scheduled to mature on February 2, 2014, but the Operating Partnership may, at its option and subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions and payment of an extension fee, extend the maturity date of the Loan Agreement three times, in each case for a period of up to one year. Pricing under the Loan Agreement, including the spread over LIBOR, varies based upon the public debt ratings of the Operating Partnership as in effect from time to time. The Loan Agreement contains representations, covenants (including certain financial tests applicable to Prologis) and defaults (including a cross-acceleration to other recourse indebtedness of more than $50,000,000) that are substantially the same as the corresponding provisions of the other major unsecured credit facilities of Prologis and the Operating Partnership. Prologis has unconditionally guaranteed all obligations of each borrower under the Loan Agreement, and the Operating Partnership has unconditionally guaranteed all obligations of each other borrower under the Loan Agreement.
The Loan Agreement has been included herewith as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
On February 2, 2012, Prologis, a Maryland real estate investment trust ("Old Prologis"), (i) revoked the classification of all indebtedness previously identified as designated senior debt under the Amended and Restated Security Agency Agreement dated as of October 6, 2005 (as amended, the "Security Agency Agreement") among various creditors of Old Prologis and Bank of America, N.A., as collateral agent, and (ii) terminated the Security Agency Agreement.

Each Lender shall promptly (i) notify Administrative Agent of any change in circumstances that would modify or render invalid any claimed exemption from or reduction of Taxes or Other Taxes, and (ii) take such steps as shall not be materially disadvantageous to it, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, and as may be reasonably necessary (including the re-designation of its Lending Office) to avoid any requirement of applicable Law that any Borrower make any deduction or withholding for taxes from amounts payable to such Lender.

.

Section 12.6 Reliance
. Any indebtedness of any Borrower relating to the Guaranteed Obligations now or hereafter owing to either Guarantor is hereby subordinated to the Guaranteed Obligations of such Borrower owing to the Credit Parties, and if Administrative Agent so requests at a time when an Event of Default exists, all such indebtedness relating to the Guaranteed Obligations of such Borrower to each Guarantor shall be collected, enforced and received by such Guarantor for the benefit of the Credit Parties and be paid over to Administrative Agent on behalf of the Credit Parties on account of the Guaranteed Obligations of such Borrower to the Credit Parties, but without affecting or impairing in any manner the liability of either Guarantor under the other provisions of this .

Section 12.8 Waivers
(a) Each Guarantor waives any right (except as shall be required by applicable statute and cannot be waived) to require any Credit Party to (i) proceed against any Borrower, any other guarantor or any other party, (ii) proceed against or exhaust any security held from any Borrower, any other guarantor or any other party or (iii) pursue any other remedy in any Credit Party's power whatsoever. Each Guarantor waives any defense based on or arising out of any defense of any Borrower, any other guarantor or any other party, other than payment in full of the Guaranteed Obligations, based on or arising out of the disability of any Borrower, any other guarantor or any other party, or the validity, legality or unenforceability of the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof from any cause, or the cessation from any cause of the liability of
 
any Borrower other than payment in full of the Guaranteed Obligations. The Credit Parties may, at their election, foreclose on any security, if any, held by Administrative Agent or any other Credit Party by one or more judicial or nonjudicial sales, whether or not every aspect of any such sale is commercially reasonable (to the extent such sale is permitted by applicable law), or exercise any other right or remedy the Credit Parties may have against any Borrower or any other party, or any security, without affecting or impairing in any way the liability of either Guarantor hereunder except to the extent the Guaranteed Obligations have been paid. Each Guarantor waives any defense arising out of any such election by the Credit Parties, even though such election operates to impair or extinguish any right of reimbursement or subrogation or other right or remedy of such Guarantor against any Borrower or any other party or any security.
(b) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, each Guarantor waives all presentments, demands for performance, protests and notices, including notices of any Event of Default, notices of nonperformance, notices of protest, notices of dishonor, notices of acceptance of the guaranty hereunder, notices of the existence, creation or incurring of new or additional Guaranteed Obligations, and notices of any Credit Party's transfer or disposition of the Guaranteed Obligations, or any part thereof. Each Guarantor assumes all responsibility for being and keeping itself informed of each Borrower's financial condition and assets, and of all other circumstances bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of the Guaranteed Obligations and the nature, scope and extent of the risks which it assumes and incurs hereunder, and agrees that neither Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall have any duty to advise it of information known to it regarding such circumstances or risks.
. It is the desire and intent of each Guarantor and the Credit Parties that this shall be enforced against each Guarantor to the fullest extent permissible under the laws and public policies applied in each jurisdiction in which enforcement is sought. If, however, and to the extent that, the obligations of a Guarantor under this shall be adjudicated to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason (including because of any applicable state or federal law relating to fraudulent conveyances or transfers), then the amount of the Guaranteed Obligations shall be deemed to be reduced and the applicable Guarantor shall pay the maximum amount of the Guaranteed Obligations which would be permissible under applicable law.
Section 12.9 Nature of Liability
Article XII
Article XII
 
Executed as of the date first written above.
 
The Mandatory Cost (to the extent applicable) is an addition to the interest rate to compensate Lenders for the cost of compliance with:
the requirements of the Bank of England and/or the Financial Services Authority (or, in either case, any other authority which replaces all or any of its functions); or
the requirements of the European Central Bank.
On the first day of each Interest Period (or as soon as practicable thereafter) Administrative Agent shall calculate, as a percentage rate, a rate (the "") for each Lender, in accordance with the paragraphs set out below. The Mandatory Cost will be calculated by Administrative Agent as a weighted average of the Lenders' Additional Cost Rates (weighted in proportion to the percentage participation of each Lender in the relevant Loan) and will be expressed as a percentage rate per annum. Administrative Agent will, at the request of Prologis or any Lender, deliver to Prologis or such Lender as the case may be, a statement setting forth the calculation of any Mandatory Cost.
Additional Cost Rate
The Additional Cost Rate for any Lender lending from a Lending Office in a Participating Member State will be the percentage notified by that Lender to Administrative Agent. This percentage will be certified by such Lender in its notice to Administrative Agent as the cost (expressed as a percentage of such Lender's participation in all Loans made from such Lending Office) of complying with the minimum reserve requirements of the European Central Bank in respect of Loans made from that Lending Office.
The Additional Cost Rate for any Lender lending from a Lending Office in the United Kingdom will be calculated by Administrative Agent as follows:
in relation to any Loan in Sterling:
 
in relation to any Loan in any currency other than Sterling:
 
Where:
"A" is the percentage of Eligible Liabilities (assuming these to be in excess of any stated minimum) which that Lender is from time to time required to maintain as an interest free cash ratio deposit with the Bank of England to comply with cash ratio requirements.
"B" is the percentage rate of interest (excluding the Applicable Rate, the Mandatory Cost and any interest charged on overdue amounts pursuant to the first sentence of and, in the case of interest (other than on overdue amounts) charged at the Default Rate, without counting any increase in interest rate effected by the charging of the Default Rate) payable for the relevant Interest Period of such Loan.
Section 3.4.2(a))
 
"C" is the percentage (if any) of Eligible Liabilities which that Lender is required from time to time to maintain as interest bearing Special Deposits with the Bank of England.
"D" is the percentage rate per annum payable by the Bank of England to Administrative Agent on interest bearing Special Deposits.
"E" is designed to compensate Lenders for amounts payable under the Fees Regulations and is calculated by Administrative Agent as being the average of the most recent rates of charge supplied by the Lenders to Administrative Agent pursuant to below and expressed in pounds per 1,000,000.
paragraph 7

"" and "" have the meanings given to them from time to time under or pursuant to the Bank of England Act 1998 or (as may be appropriate) by the Bank of England;

Fee Tariffs
"" has the meaning given to it in, and will be calculated in accordance with, the Fees Regulations.
Tariff Base
In application of the above formulae, A, B, C and D will be included in the formulae as percentages ( 5% will be included in the formula as 5 and not as 0.05). A negative result obtained by subtracting D from B shall be taken as zero. The resulting figures shall be rounded to four decimal places.
i.e.
If requested by Administrative Agent or Prologis, each Lender with a Lending Office in the United Kingdom or a Participating Member State shall, as soon as practicable after publication by the Financial Services Authority, supply to Administrative Agent and Prologis, the rate of charge payable by such Lender to the Financial Services Authority pursuant to the Fees Regulations in respect of the relevant financial year of the Financial Services Authority (calculated for this purpose by such Lender as being the average of the Fee Tariffs applicable to such Lender for that financial year) and expressed in pounds per 1,000,000 of the Tariff Base of such Lender.
Each Lender shall supply any information required by Administrative Agent for the purpose of calculating its Additional Cost Rate. In particular, but without limitation, each Lender shall supply the following information in writing on or prior to the date on which it becomes a Lender:
its jurisdiction of incorporation and the jurisdiction of the Lending Office out of which it is making available its participation in the relevant Loan; and
any other information that Administrative Agent may reasonably require for such purpose.
 
Each applicable Lender shall promptly notify Administrative Agent in writing of any change to the information provided by it pursuant to this paragraph.
The percentages or rates of charge of each Lender for the purpose of A, C and E above shall be determined by the applicable Agent based upon the information supplied to it pursuant to and above and on the assumption that, unless a Lender notifies Administrative Agent to the contrary, each Lender's obligations in relation to cash ratio deposits, Special Deposits and the Fees Regulations are the same as those of a typical bank from its jurisdiction of incorporation with a Lending Office in the same jurisdiction as such Lender's Lending Office.
paragraphs 7
8
Administrative Agent shall not have any liability to any Person if such determination results in an Additional Cost Rate which over- or under-compensates any Lender and shall be entitled to assume that the information provided by any Lender pursuant to , and above is true and correct in all respects.

8
Administrative Agent shall distribute the additional amounts received as a result of the Mandatory Cost to the Lenders on the basis of the Additional Cost Rate for each applicable Lender based on the information provided by each Lender pursuant to , and above.
paragraphs 3

8
Any determination by Administrative Agent pursuant to this Schedule in relation to a formula, the Mandatory Cost, an Additional Cost Rate or any amount payable to a Lender shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive and binding on all parties hereto.
Administrative Agent may from time to time, after consultation with the Prologis and the applicable Lenders, determine and notify to all parties any amendments which are required to be made to this Schedule in order to comply with any change in law, regulation or any requirements from time to time imposed by the Bank of England, the Financial Services Authority or the European Central Bank (or, in any case, any other authority which replaces all or any of its functions) and any such determination shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive and binding on all parties hereto.
