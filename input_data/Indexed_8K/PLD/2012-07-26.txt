(A) These funds are or will be actively investing in new properties through acquisition and/or development activities, whereas the remaining funds do not expect to be actively investing in new properties. (B) During the first quarter, this co-investment venture sold all but one of its operating buildings.
(C) We have a 50% ownership interest in and consolidate an entity that in turn owns 50% of an entity that is accounted for on the equity method ("Brazil Fund"). The Brazil Fund develops industrial properties in Brazil. During 2011, the Brazil Fund sold 90% of three operating properties to a third party and retained a 10% ownership interest in the properties ("Brazil JVs"). Therefore, we effectively own 25% of the Brazil Fund and 2.5% of the operating properties in the Brazil JVs, which are included in our Owned and Managed operating pool.
(D) Values represent Prologis' stepped up basis and may not be comparable to values reflected in the entities' stand alone financial statements calculated on a different basis.

Second Quarter 2012 Report
Please refer to our annual and quarterly financial statements filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission on Forms 10-K and 10-Q and other public reports for further information about us and our business. Certain amounts from previous periods presented in the Supplemental Information have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.
Our real estate operations segment represents the direct, long-term ownership of industrial properties. Our investment strategy in this segment focuses primarily on the ownership and leasing of industrial properties in global and regional markets. Our intent is to hold and use these properties; however, depending on market and other conditions, we may contribute or sell these properties to co-investment ventures or sell to third parties. When we contribute to an unconsolidated co-investment venture or sell properties we have developed, we recognize FFO to the extent the proceeds received exceed our original investment (i.e. prior to depreciation) and present the results as Gains (Losses) on Acquisition and Dispositions of Investments in Real Estate, Net. We have industrial properties that are currently under development and land available for development that are part of this segment as well. We may develop the land or sell to third parties, depending on market conditions, customer demand and other factors. The private capital segment represents the long-term management of unconsolidated co-investment ventures and other joint ventures.
In June 2011, AMB Property Corporation ("AMB") and ProLogis combined through a merger of equals (the "Merger"). As a result of the Merger, each outstanding ProLogis common share was converted into 0.4464 shares of AMB common stock. At the time of the Merger, AMB changed its name to Prologis, Inc. After consideration of all applicable factors pursuant to the business combination accounting rules, the Merger resulted in a reverse acquisition in which AMB was considered the "legal acquirer" and ProLogis was considered the "accounting acquirer". As such, the historical results of AMB have not been included in the 2011 results.
During the second quarter of 2011, we increased our ownership of ProLogis European Properties ("PEPR"), through open market purchases and a mandatory tender offer. Pursuant to the tender offer and open-market purchases made during the tender period, we acquired additional ordinary units and convertible preferred units of PEPR that were funded through borrowings under our existing credit facilities and a new 500 million bridge facility, which was subsequently repaid with proceeds received from our June 2011 equity offering. After completion of the tender offer, we began consolidating PEPR.
During the first quarter of 2012, we acquired our partner's 63% interest in and now own 100% of Prologis North American Industrial Fund II. We also acquired our share of the assets and liabilities in Prologis California. These two transactions increased our real estate by $2.1 billion and debt by $1.0 billion.
Acquisition cost represents economic cost and not necessarily what is capitalized. It includes the initial purchase price; the effects of marking assumed debt to market; if applicable, all due diligence and closing costs; lease intangibles; and estimated acquisition capital expenditures including leasing costs to achieve stabilization.
Assets Held For Sale and Discontinued Operations. As of June 30, 2012, we had land and five operating properties that met the criteria to be presented as held for sale. The amounts included in Assets Held for Sale include real estate investment balances and the related assets and liabilities for each property.
During the six months ended June 30, 2012, we disposed of 95 properties aggregating 11.9 million square feet to third parties. During all of 2011, we disposed of land subject to ground leases and 94 properties aggregating 10.7 million square feet to third parties.
The operations of the properties held for sale and properties that were disposed of to third parties during a period, including the aggregate net gains or losses recognized upon their disposition, are
presented as discontinued operations in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for all periods presented. The income attributable to these properties was as follows (in thousands):

We include the gains or losses from disposition and impairment charges of land parcels and development properties in the calculation of FFO, including those classified as discontinued operations.
Assets Under Management ("AUM") represents the estimated value of the real estate we own or manage through our consolidated entities and unconsolidated entities. We calculate AUM by adding the noncontrolling interests' share of the estimated fair value of the real estate investment to our share of total market capitalization.

(a) In periods with a net loss, the inclusion of any incremental shares is anti-dilutive, and therefore, both basic and diluted shares are the same.
Core EBITDA. We use Core EBITDA to measure both our operating performance and liquidity. We calculate Core EBITDA beginning with consolidated net earnings (loss) and removing the affect of interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, impairment charges, gains or losses from the acquisition or disposition of investments in real estate, gains or losses on early extinguishment of debt and derivative contracts (including cash charges), similar adjustments we make to our Core FFO (see definition below), and other non-cash charges or gains (such as stock based compensation amortization and unrealized gains or losses on foreign currency and derivative activity), including our share of these items from unconsolidated entities.
We consider Core EBITDA to provide investors relevant and useful information because it permits investors to view income from operations on an unleveraged basis before the effects of income tax, non-cash depreciation and amortization expense and other items (including stock-based compensation amortization and certain unrealized gains and losses), gains or losses from the acquisition or disposition of investments in real estate, items that affect comparability, and other significant non-cash items. We also adjusted Core EBITDA to include a pro forma adjustment to reflect a full period of NOI on the operating properties we acquire in a significant transaction, such as the Merger, PEPR acquisition, acquisition of our share of the assets from Prologis California and the acquisition of Prologis North American Industrial Fund II. In addition, we excluded Merger, Acquisition and Other Integration Expenses and costs associated with the natural disaster that occurred in first quarter 2011 in Japan. By excluding interest expense EBITDA allows investors to measure our operating performance independent of our capital structure and indebtedness and, therefore, allows for a more meaningful comparison of our operating performance to that of other companies, both in the real estate industry and in other industries. Gains and losses on the early extinguishment of debt generally included the costs of repurchasing debt securities. Although difficult to predict, these items may be recurring given the uncertainty of the current economic climate and its adverse effects on the real estate and financial markets. While not infrequent or unusual in nature, these items result from market fluctuations that can have inconsistent effects on our results of operations. The economics underlying these items reflect market and financing conditions in the short-term but can obscure our performance and the value of our long-term investment decisions and strategies.
As a liquidity measure, we believe that Core EBITDA helps investors to analyze our ability to meet interest payment obligations and to make quarterly preferred share dividends. We believe that investors should consider Core EBITDA in conjunction with net earnings (the primary measure of our performance) and the other required Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") measures of our performance and liquidity, to improve their understanding of our operating results and liquidity, and to make more meaningful comparisons of our performance against other companies. By using Core EBITDA an investor is assessing the earnings generated by our operations, but not taking into account the eliminated expenses or gains incurred in connection with such operations. As a result, Core EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool and should be used in conjunction with our required GAAP presentations. Core EBITDA does not reflect our historical cash expenditures or future cash requirements for working capital, capital expenditures distribution requirements or contractual commitments. Core EBITDA, also does not reflect the cash required to make interest and principal payments on our outstanding debt.
While EBITDA is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance and liquidity, it does not represent net income or cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP and it should not be considered as an alternative to those indicators in evaluating operating performance or liquidity. Further, our computation of Core EBITDA may not be comparable to EBITDA reported by other companies. We compensate for the limitations of Core EBITDA by providing investors with financial statements prepared according to GAAP, along with this detailed discussion of Core EBITDA and a reconciliation of Core EBITDA to consolidated net earnings (loss), a GAAP measurement.

Committed Equity/Investment is our estimate of the gross real estate, which could be acquired through the use of the equity commitments from our property fund or co-investment venture partners, plus our funding obligations and estimated debt capitalization.
FFO, as defined by Prologis; Core FFO; AFFO (collectively referred to as "FFO"). FFO is a non-GAAP measure that is commonly used in the real estate industry. The most directly comparable GAAP measure to FFO is net earnings. Although the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") has published a definition of FFO, modifications to the NAREIT calculation of FFO are common among REITs, as companies seek to provide financial measures that meaningfully reflect their business.
FFO is not meant to represent a comprehensive system of financial reporting and does not present, nor do we intend it to present, a complete picture of our financial condition and operating performance. We believe net earnings computed under GAAP remains the primary measure of performance and that FFO is only meaningful when it is used in conjunction with net earnings computed under GAAP. Further, we believe our consolidated financial statements, prepared in accordance with GAAP, provide the most meaningful picture of our financial condition and our operating performance.
NAREIT's FFO measure adjusts net earnings computed under GAAP to exclude historical cost depreciation and gains and losses from the sales, along with impairment charges, of previously depreciated properties. We agree that these NAREIT adjustments are useful to investors for the following reasons: (i) historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP assumes, through depreciation charges, that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time.
NAREIT stated in its White Paper on FFO "since real estate asset values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves." Consequently, NAREIT's definition of FFO reflects the fact that real estate, as an asset class, generally appreciates over time and depreciation charges required by GAAP do not reflect the underlying economic realities.
(ii) REITs were created as a legal form of organization in order to encourage public ownership of real estate as an asset class through investment in firms that were in the business of long-term ownership and management of real estate. The exclusion, in NAREIT's definition of FFO, of gains and losses from the sales, along with impairment charges, of previously depreciated operating real estate assets allows investors and analysts to readily identify the operating results of the long-term assets that form the core of a REIT's activity and assists in comparing those operating results between periods. We include the gains and losses from dispositions and impairment charges of land and development properties, as well as our proportionate share of the gains and losses from dispositions and impairment charges recognized by our unconsolidated entities, in our definition of FFO.
Our FFO Measures
At the same time that NAREIT created and defined its FFO measure for the REIT industry, it also recognized that "management of each of its member companies has the responsibility and authority to publish financial information that it regards as useful to the financial community." We believe stockholders, potential investors and financial analysts who review our operating results are best served by a defined FFO measure that includes other adjustments to net earnings computed under GAAP in addition to those included in the NAREIT defined measure of FFO. Our FFO measures are used by management in analyzing our business and the performance of our properties and we believe that it is important that stockholders, potential investors and financial analysts understand the measures management uses.
We use these FFO measures, including by segment and region, to: (i) evaluate our performance and the performance of our properties in comparison to expected results and results of previous periods, relative to resource allocation decisions; (ii) evaluate the performance of our management; (iii) budget and forecast future results to assist in the allocation of resources; (iv) assess our performance as compared to similar real estate companies and the industry in general; and (v) evaluate how a specific potential investment will impact our future results. Because we make decisions with regard to our performance with a long-term outlook, we believe it is appropriate to remove the effects of short-term items that we do not expect to affect the underlying long-term performance of the properties. The long-term performance of our properties is principally driven by rental income. While not infrequent or unusual, these additional items we exclude in calculating FFO, as defined by Prologis, are subject to significant fluctuations from period to period that cause both positive and negative short-term effects on our results of operations in inconsistent and unpredictable directions that are not relevant to our long-term outlook.

Notes and Definitions
Second Quarter 2012 Report
We use our FFO measures as supplemental financial measures of operating performance. We do not use our FFO measures as, nor should they be considered to be, alternatives to net earnings computed under GAAP, as indicators of our operating performance, as alternatives to cash from operating activities computed under GAAP or as indicators of our ability to fund our cash needs.
FFO, as defined by Prologis
To arrive at FFO, as defined by Prologis, we adjust the NAREIT defined FFO measure to exclude: (i) deferred income tax benefits and deferred income tax expenses recognized by our subsidiaries; (ii) current income tax expense related to acquired tax liabilities that were recorded as deferred tax liabilities in an acquisition, to the extent the expense is offset with a deferred income tax benefit in GAAP earnings that is excluded from our defined FFO measure; (iii) foreign currency exchange gains and losses resulting from debt transactions between us and our foreign consolidated subsidiaries and our foreign unconsolidated entities; (iv) foreign currency exchange gains and losses from the remeasurement (based on current foreign currency exchange rates) of certain third party debt of our foreign consolidated subsidiaries and our foreign unconsolidated entities; and (v) mark-to-market adjustments associated with derivative financial instruments.
We calculate FFO, as defined by Prologis for our unconsolidated entities on the same basis as we calculate our FFO, as defined by Prologis.
We believe investors are best served if the information that is made available to them allows them to align their analysis and evaluation of our operating results along the same lines that our management uses in planning and executing our business strategy.
Core FFO
In addition to FFO, as defined by Prologis, we also use Core FFO. To arrive at Core FFO, we adjust FFO, as defined by Prologis, to exclude the following recurring and non-recurring items that we recognized directly or our share recognized by our unconsolidated entities to the extent they are included in FFO, as defined by Prologis:
(i) gains or losses from acquisition, contribution or sale of land or development properties; (ii) income tax expense related to the sale of investments in real estate; (iii) impairment charges recognized related to our investments in real estate (either directly or through our investments in unconsolidated entities) generally as a result of our change in intent to contribute or sell these properties; (iv) impairment charges of goodwill and other assets; (v) gains or losses from the early extinguishment of debt; (vi) merger, acquisition and other integration expenses; and (vii) expenses related to natural disasters
We believe it is appropriate to further adjust our FFO, as defined by Prologis for certain recurring items as they were driven by transactional activity and factors relating to the financial and real estate markets, rather than factors specific to the on-going operating performance of our properties or investments. The impairment charges we recognized were primarily based on valuations of real estate, which had declined due to market conditions, that we no longer expected to hold for long-term investment. We currently have and have had over the past several years a stated priority to strengthen our financial position. We expect to accomplish this by reducing our debt, our investment in certain low yielding assets, such as land that we decide not to develop and our exposure to foreign currency exchange fluctuations. As a result, we have sold to third parties or contributed to unconsolidated entities real estate properties that, depending on market conditions, might result in a gain or loss. The impairment charges related to goodwill and other assets that we have recognized were similarly caused by the decline in the real estate markets. Also in connection with our stated priority to reduce debt and extend debt maturities, we have purchased portions of
our debt securities. As a result, we recognized net gains or losses on the early extinguishment of certain debt due to the financial market conditions at that time.
We have also adjusted for some non-recurring items. The merger, acquisition and other integration expenses include costs we incurred in 2011 and that we expect to incur in 2012 associated with the Merger and PEPR Acquisition and the integration of our systems and processes. We have not adjusted for the acquisition costs that we have incurred as a result of routine acquisitions but only the costs associated with significant business combinations that we would expect to be infrequent in nature. Similarly, the expenses related to the natural disaster in Japan that we recognized in 2011 are a rare occurrence but we may incur similar expenses again in the future.
We analyze our operating performance primarily by the rental income of our real estate and the revenue driven by our private capital business, net of operating, administrative and financing expenses. This income stream is not directly impacted by fluctuations in the market value of our investments in real estate or debt securities. As a result, although these items have had a material impact on our operations and are reflected in our financial statements, the removal of the effects of these items allows us to better understand the core operating performance of our properties over the long-term.
We use Core FFO, including by segment and region, to: (i) evaluate our performance and the performance of our properties in comparison to expected results and results of previous periods, relative to resource allocation decisions; (ii) evaluate the performance of our management; (iii) budget and forecast future results to assist in the allocation of resources; (iv) provide guidance to the financial markets to understand our expected operating performance; (v) assess our operating performance as compared to similar real estate companies and the industry in general; and (vi) evaluate how a specific potential investment will impact our future results. Because we make decisions with regard to our performance with a long-term outlook, we believe it is appropriate to remove the effects of items that we do not expect to affect the underlying long-term performance of the properties we own. As noted above, we believe the long-term performance of our properties is principally driven by rental income. We believe investors are best served if the information that is made available to them allows them to align their analysis and evaluation of our operating results along the same lines that our management uses in planning and executing our business strategy.
AFFO
To arrive at AFFO, we adjust Core FFO to further exclude; (i) straight-line rents; (ii) amortization of above- and below-market lease intangibles; (iii) recurring capital expenditures; (iv) amortization of management contracts; (v) amortization of debt premiums and discounts, net of amounts capitalized, and; (vi) stock compensation expense.
We believe AFFO provides a meaningful indicator of our ability to fund cash needs, including cash distributions to our stockholders.
Limitations on Use of our FFO Measures
While we believe our defined FFO measures are important supplemental measures, neither NAREIT's nor our measures of FFO should be used alone because they exclude significant economic components of net earnings computed under GAAP and are, therefore, limited as an analytical tool. Accordingly, they are two of many measures we use when analyzing our business. Some of these limitations are:
??The current income tax expenses that are excluded from our defined FFO measures represent the taxes that are payable.
? Depreciation and amortization of real estate assets are economic costs that are excluded from FFO. FFO is limited, as it does not reflect the cash requirements that may be necessary for future replacements of the real estate assets. Further, the amortization of capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of industrial properties are not reflected in FFO.

Notes and Definitions
Second Quarter 2012 Report
Gains or losses from property acquisitions and dispositions or impairment charges related to expected dispositions represent changes in the value of the properties. By excluding these gains and losses, FFO does not capture realized changes in the value of acquired or disposed properties arising from changes in market conditions.
The deferred income tax benefits and expenses that are excluded from our defined FFO measures result from the creation of a deferred income tax asset or liability that may have to be settled at some future point. Our defined FFO measures do not currently reflect any income or expense that may result from such settlement.
The foreign currency exchange gains and losses that are excluded from our defined FFO measures are generally recognized based on movements in foreign currency exchange rates through a specific point in time. The ultimate settlement of our foreign currency-denominated net assets is indefinite as to timing and amount. Our FFO measures are limited in that they do not reflect the current period changes in these net assets that result from periodic foreign currency exchange rate movements.
The impairment charges of goodwill and other assets that we exclude from Core FFO, have been or may be realized as a loss in the future upon the ultimate disposition of the related investments or other assets through the form of lower cash proceeds.
The gains and losses on extinguishment of debt that we exclude from our Core FFO, may provide a benefit or cost to us as we may be settling our debt at less or more than our future obligation.
The Merger, acquisition and other integration expenses and the natural disaster expenses that we exclude from Core FFO are costs that we have incurred.
We compensate for these limitations by using our FFO measures only in conjunction with net earnings computed under GAAP when making our decisions. To assist investors in compensating for these limitations, we reconcile our defined FFO measures to our net earnings computed under GAAP. This information should be read with our complete financial statements prepared under GAAP.
Fixed Charge Coverage is defined as Core EBITDA divided by total fixed charges. Fixed charges consist of net interest expense adjusted for amortization of finance costs and debt discount (premium), capitalized interest, and preferred stock dividends. Prologis uses fixed charge coverage to measure its liquidity. Prologis believes that the fixed charge coverage is relevant and useful to investors because it allows fixed income investors to measure Prologis' ability to meet its interest payments on outstanding debt, make distributions to its preferred unitholders and pay dividends to its preferred stockholders. Prologis' computation of fixed charge coverage is not calculated in accordance with applicable SEC rules and may not be comparable to fixed charge coverage reported by other companies.

Global Markets comprise the largest, most liquid markets benefiting from demand tied to global trade. These markets are defined by large population centers with high consumption per capita and typically feature major seaports, airports, and other transportation infrastructure tied to global trade. While initial returns might be lower, global markets tend to outperform overall markets in terms of growth and total return.

Market Equity is defined as the total number of outstanding shares of our common stock and common limited partnership units multiplied by the closing price per share of our common stock at period end.
Merger, Acquisition and Other Integration Expenses. In connection with the Merger, we have incurred significant transaction, integration, and transitional costs. These costs include investment banker advisory fees; legal, tax, accounting and valuation fees; termination and severance costs (both cash and stock based compensation awards) for terminated and transitional employees; system conversion; and other integration costs. Certain of these costs were obligations of AMB and were expensed prior to the closing of the Merger by AMB. The remainder of the costs are being expensed by us as incurred, which in some cases will be through the end of 2012. In addition, we have included costs associated with the acquisition of a controlling interest in PEPR and reduction in workforce charges associated with dispositions made in 2011. The following is a breakdown of the costs incurred:

Net Asset Value ("NAV"). We consider NAV to be a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance because it enables both management and investors to estimate the fair value of our business. The assessment of the fair value of a particular segment of our business is subjective in that it involves estimates and can be calculated using various methods. Therefore, in this supplemental report, we have presented the financial results and investments related to our business segments that we believe are important in calculating our NAV but have not presented any specific methodology nor provided any guidance on the assumptions or estimates that should be used in the calculation.
The components of NAV do not consider the potential changes in rental and fee income streams or the franchise value associated with our global operating platform, private capital platform, or development platform.
Net Gains on Acquisitions and Dispositions of Investments in Real Estate includes the gains we recognized from the acquisition of our share of the real estate properties in one of our unconsolidated co-investment ventures, Prologis California in the first quarter of 2012.
Net Operating Income ("NOI") represents rental income less rental expenses.

Notes and Definitions
Operating Portfolio includes stabilized operating industrial properties we own or that we manage and are owned by an unconsolidated investee accounted for by the equity method of accounting.
Operating Segments  Real Estate Operations represents the direct long-term ownership of industrial properties, including land and the development of properties.
Operating Segments  Private Capital represents the management of unconsolidated co-investment ventures and other joint ventures and the properties they own.
Pre-stabilized Development represents properties that are complete but have not yet reached Stabilization.
Pro forma NOI reflects the NOI for a full quarter of operating properties that were acquired, contributed or stabilized during the quarter. Pro forma NOI for the properties in our development portfolio is based on current total expected investment and an estimated stabilized yield.
A reconciliation of our rental income and rental expenses, computed under GAAP, to adjusted net operating income (NOI) for the operating portfolio for purposes of the Net Asset Value calculation is as follows:
(in thousands) Reconciliation of NOI Rental income ................................................................................................................................... $ 488,026 Rental expenses ................................................................................................................................

Stabilized cash NOI for operating portfolio owned at June 30, 2012 $ 350,952
(a) Net termination fees generally represent the gross fee negotiated at the time a customer is allowed to terminate its lease agreement offset by that customer's rent leveling asset or liability, if any, that has been previously recognized under GAAP. Removing the net termination fees from rental income allows for the calculation of pro forma NOI to include only rental income that is indicative of the property's recurring operating performance.
(b) The actual NOI for properties that were contributed and not part of discontinued operations during the three- month period is removed.
(c) Straight-lined rents, net of free rent amounts, and amortization of above and below market leases are removed from rental income computed under GAAP to allow for the calculation of a cash yield.
Regional Markets, similar to global markets, also benefit from large-population centers and demand. They are located at key crossroads in the supply chain and/or near economic centers for leading national or global industries. Our assets reflect the highest quality class-A product in that market and are often less supply- constrained and focus on delivering bulk goods to customers.

Same Store. We evaluate the operating performance of the industrial operating properties we own and manage using a "same store" analysis because the population of properties in this analysis is consistent from period to period, thereby eliminating the effects of changes in the composition of the portfolio on performance measures. We include all consolidated properties, and properties owned by property funds and joint ventures that are managed by us and in which we have an equity interest (referred to as "unconsolidated entities"), in our same store analysis. We have defined the same store portfolio, for the quarter ended June 30, 2012, as those operating properties in operation at January 1, 2011 that were in operation throughout the full periods in both 2011 and 2012 either by Prologis or AMB or their unconsolidated entities. We have removed all properties that were disposed of to a third party from the population for both periods. We believe the factors that impact rental income, rental expenses and net operating income in the same store portfolio are generally the same as for the total operating portfolio. In order to derive an appropriate measure of period-to-period operating performance, we remove the effects of foreign currency exchange rate movements by using the current exchange rate to translate from local currency into U.S. dollars, for both periods, to derive the same store results.
Same Store Average Occupancy represents the average occupied percentage for the period.
Same Store Rental Expense represents gross property operating expenses. In computing the percentage change in rental expenses for the same store analysis, rental expenses include property management expenses for our direct owned properties based on the property management fee that has been computed as provided in the individual agreements under which our wholly owned management companies provide property management services to each property (generally, the fee is based on a percentage of revenues).
Same Store Change in Rental Rate represents the change in effective rental rates (average rate over the lease term) on new leases signed during the period as compared with the previous effective rental rates in that same space.
Same Store Rental Income includes the amount of rental expenses that are recovered from customers under the terms of their respective lease agreements. In computing the percentage change in rental income for the same store analysis, rental income (as computed under GAAP) is adjusted to remove the net termination fees recognized for each period. Removing the net termination fees for the same store calculation allows us to evaluate the growth or decline in each property's rental income without regard to items that are not indicative of the property's recurring operating performance.
Stabilization is defined when a property that was developed has been completed for one year or is 90% occupied. Upon stabilization, a property is moved into our operating portfolio.
Tenant Retention is the square footage of all leases rented by existing tenants divided by the square footage of all expiring and rented leases during the reporting period, excluding the square footage of tenants that default or buy-out prior to expiration of their lease, short-term tenants and the square footage of month-to-month leases.

Notes and Definitions
Second Quarter 2012 Report
Total Estimated Investment ("TEI") represents total estimated cost of development or expansion, including land, development and leasing costs. TEI is based on current projections and is subject to change. Non-U.S. Dollar investments are translated to U.S. Dollars using the exchange rate at period end or the date of development start for purposes of calculating development starts in any period.
Total Market Capitalization is defined as market equity plus our share of total debt and preferred stock.
Turnover Costs represent the costs incurred in connection with the signing of a lease, including leasing commissions and tenant improvements. Tenant improvements include costs to prepare a space for a new tenant and for a lease renewal with the same tenant. It excludes costs to prepare a space that is being leased for the first time (i.e. in a new development property).
Value-Added Acquisitions ("VAA") are properties which Prologis acquires as part of management's current belief that the discount in pricing attributed to the operating challenges of the property could provide greater returns, once stabilized, than the returns of stabilized properties, which are not value added acquisitions. Value Added Acquisitions must have one or more of the following characteristics: (i) existing vacancy in excess of 20%; (ii) short-term lease roll-over, typically during the first two years of ownership; (iii) significant capital improvement requirements in excess of 10% of the purchase price and must be invested within the first two years of ownership
Value-Added Conversions ("VAC") represent the repurposing of industrial properties to a higher and better use, including office, residential, retail, research and development, data center, self storage or manufacturing with the intent to ultimately sell the property once repositioned. Activities required to prepare the property for conversion to a higher and better use may include such activities as re-zoning, re-designing, re-constructing, and re-tenanting. The economic gain on sales of value added conversions represents the amount by which the sales proceeds exceed our original cost in dollars and percentages.
Value Creation represents the value that will be created through our development and leasing activities at stabilization. We calculate value by estimating the NOI that the property will generate at Stabilization and applying an estimated stabilized cap rate applicable to that property. The value creation is calculated as the amount by which the estimated value exceeds our total expected investment and does not include any fees or promotes we may earn.
Weighted Average Estimated Stabilized Yield is calculated as NOI adjusted to reflect stabilized occupancy divided by Acquisition Cost or TEI, as applicable.
