Section 1.01
Offices.
The annual meeting of the shareholders for the election of directors (and the transaction of such other business as may properly come before it) shall be held on such date within six months after the end of each fiscal year of the corporation, and at such time and place within the State of New York, as are fixed by resolution of the board of directors and stated in the notice of meeting.
Section 2.01
Annual Meeting.
Special meetings of the shareholders for any purpose or purposes may be called by the president (or, in case of the absence or disability of the president, by any vice president) and must be called by him on the written request of a majority of the directors in office or of the holders of 50% of the shares then outstanding and entitled to vote. Such request shall state the date and hour, the place within the City of Glen Cove or the City of New York, and the purpose or purposes of the meeting, and must be delivered or mailed to the president or such vice president not later than fifteen days prior to the proposed date of the meeting.

Section 2.04
Quorum.
Each shareholder of record shall be entitled to one vote for each share of stock registered in the name of such shareholder on the books of the corporation, and such votes may be cast either in person or by proxy. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, proxies and voting shall be governed by the provisions of the New York Business Corporation Law to the extent not inconsistent with any provisions of federal law which preempt state law or the requirements of any national securities exchange on which the corporation's common stock is listed.
Section 2.05

Section 3.03
Regular Meetings.

director at his or her mailing address as it appears on the books of the corporation, such notice to be sent no less than ten days before the date of the meeting if sent by ordinary mail or no later than the third business day before the date of the meeting if sent by overnight mail or by a courier service (such as Federal Express) which guarantees next day delivery, or (c) by transmitting such notice to the director by telecopier or e-mail (to a telecopier number or e-mail address which has been furnished by him or her to the secretary of the corporation) no later than the second business day preceding the date of the meeting.
A majority of the entire board shall constitute a quorum of the board of directors for the transaction of any business but a lesser number may adjourn any meeting. As used in the preceding sentence, "entire board" means the total number of directors which the corporation would have if there were no vacancies. A quorum of any committee shall be a majority of the members thereof except that any committee may, by unanimous action, determine that a lesser number of members (not less than half) shall constitute a quorum. A majority of the members in attendance at any meeting shall, except where a larger number is required by law, by the certificate of incorporation or by these by-laws, decide any question brought before such meeting.

At each annual meeting after such initial classification and election in 1971, directors to replace those whose terms expire at such annual meeting shall be elected to hold office until the third succeeding annual meeting after their election. If after the initial classification of directors the number of directors is changed:
Section 3.06
Classification of Directors.
(a) Any newly created directorships or any decrease in directorships shall be so apportioned among the classes as to make all classes as nearly equal in number as possible; and
(b) When the number of directors is increased by the board and any newly created directorships are filled by the board, there shall be no classification of the additional directors until the next annual meeting of shareholders.
Any action required or permitted to be taken by the board or any committee thereof may be taken without a meeting if all members of the board or the committee consent in writing to the adoption of a resolution authorizing the action. The resolution and the written consents thereto by the members of the board or committee shall be filed with the minutes of the proceedings of the board or committee.
Section 3.07
Action by the Board Without a Meeting.
Any one or more members of the board or any committee thereof may participate in a meeting of such board or committee by means of a conference telephone or similar communications equipment allowing all persons participating in the meeting to hear each other at the same time. Participation by such means shall constitute presence in person at a meeting but the board may, by resolution, provide that directors participating in a meeting other than by being present in person shall receive lesser compensation than directors present at the meeting in person.
Section 3.08
Participation in Meetings by Telephone.
There may be an Audit Committee, a Compensation Committee, a Nominating/Governance Committee and an Executive Committee, each consisting of not less than three directors appointed by the board, each of which Committees may meet from time to time on notice to all members thereof by any member thereof.

Effective November 21, 1995, the Compensation Committee shall also have, with respect to each Stock Option Plan of the corporation, the powers and duties which, by the terms of such Plan, are delegated to and imposed upon the Committee administering such Plan, irrespective of whether the Plan denominates such Committee as the Stock Option Committee or the Compensation Committee. In addition, any Management Employee Benefit Plan (as hereinafter defined) which would otherwise require board of director approval ("otherwise" meaning by virtue of a legal requirement imposed by or arising from any source other than these by-laws) shall be within the jurisdiction of the Compensation Committee; the adoption, amendment or termination of any such plan shall require the approval of the Compensation Committee and, except as limited by Business Corporation Law  712 or any other statutory or regulatory provision, action by the Compensation Committee shall be deemed action by the board of directors for all purposes.

The corporation shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, indemnify any person made or threatened to be made a party to any action or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (and whether or not (i) by or in the right of the corporation to procure a judgment in its favor or (ii) by or in the right of any Other Entity (as defined below) which such person served in any capacity at the request of the corporation, to procure a judgment in its favor), by reason of the fact that such person, or his or her testator or intestate, is or was a director or officer of the corporation or served such Other Entity in any capacity at the request of the corporation, against all judgments, fines, amounts paid in settlement and all expenses, including attorneys' and other experts' fees, costs and disbursements, actually and reasonably incurred by such person as a result of such action or proceeding, or any appeal therein, or actually and reasonably incurred by such person (a) in making an application for payment of such expenses before any court or other governmental body, or (b) in otherwise seeking to enforce the provisions of this Section 7.01, or (c) in securing or enforcing such person's rights under any policy of director or officer liability insurance provided by the corporation, if such person acted in good faith, for a purpose which he or she reasonably believed to be in, or, in the case of services for any Other Entity, not opposed to, the best interests of the corporation and, in criminal
Section 7.01
Indemnification by the Corporation.
actions or proceedings, in addition, had no reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action or proceeding by judgment, settlement, conviction or upon a plea of nolo contendere, or its equivalent, shall not in itself create a presumption that such person did not act in good faith, for a purpose which he or she reasonably believed to be in, or, in the case of service for any Other Entity, not opposed to, the best interests of the corporation or that he or she had reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful.
However, (i) no indemnification may be made to or on behalf of any such person if a judgment or other final adjudication adverse to such person establishes that his or her acts were committed in bad faith or were the result of active and deliberate dishonesty and were material to the cause of action so adjudicated, or that he or she personally gained in fact a financial profit or other advantage to which he or she was not legally entitled; (ii) no indemnification may be made if there has been a settlement approved by the court and the indemnification would be inconsistent with any condition with respect to indemnification expressly imposed by the court in approving the settlement; (iii) except as provided in the immediately following paragraph hereof, the corporation shall not be obligated to indemnify any person by reason of the adoption of this Section 7.01 if and to the extent such person is entitled to be indemnified under a policy of insurance as such policy would apply in the absence of the adoption of this Section 7.01; and (iv) in the event of a proceeding by or in the right of the corporation to procure a judgment in its favor, no indemnification may be made if it is settled or otherwise disposed of or such person shall have been finally adjudged liable to the corporation, unless (and only to the extent that) the court in which the action was brought, or if no action was brought, any court of competent jurisdiction, determines upon application that, in view of all circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such portion of the settlement amount and expenses as the court deems proper.
Any expense described in the first paragraph of this Section 7.01 that is incurred by any person entitled to indemnification under this Section 7.01, or who would be entitled to indemnification under this Section 7.01 but for clause "(iii)" of the immediately preceding paragraph, shall be paid or reimbursed to such person by the
corporation in advance of the final disposition of any related action or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such person to repay such amount to the corporation to the extent, if any, that such person (i) is ultimately found not to be entitled to indemnification or (ii) receives reimbursement for such expenses under a policy of insurance paid for by the corporation. Such advances shall be paid by the corporation to such person within twenty days following delivery of a written request therefor by such person to the corporation. No payment made by the corporation pursuant to this paragraph shall be deemed or construed to relieve the issuer of any insurance policy of any obligation or liability which, but for such payment, such insurer would have to the corporation or to any director or officer of the corporation or other individual to whom or on whose behalf such payment is made by the corporation.
The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by this Section 7.01: (i) shall continue as to the person entitled to indemnification hereunder even though he or she may have ceased to serve in the capacity that entitles him or her to indemnification at the time of the action or proceeding and (ii) shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such person.
A person who has been successful, on the merits or otherwise, in the defense of a civil or criminal action or proceeding of the character described in this Section 7.01 shall be entitled to (i.e., has a legally binding right against the corporation to) the indemnification authorized by this Section 7.01. Except as provided in the immediately preceding sentence, any indemnification provided for in this Section 7.01 (unless ordered by a court under Section 724 of the Business Corporation Law), shall be made by the corporation only if authorized in the specific case:
(1) By the board of directors acting by a quorum consisting of directors who are not parties to such action or proceeding for which indemnification is sought, upon a finding that the person seeking indemnification has met the standard of conduct set forth in the first two paragraphs of this Section 7.01, or,
(2) If a quorum under the immediately preceding subparagraph is not obtainable or, even if obtainable, a quorum of disinterested directors so directs:
by the board upon the opinion in writing of independent legal counsel that indemnification is proper in the circumstances because the applicable
(A)
standard of conduct set forth in said first two paragraphs has been met by such person, or
by the shareholders upon a finding that the person has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in said first two paragraphs.
