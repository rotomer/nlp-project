Exhibit 99
East Hills, NY (December 6, 2005)  Pall Corporation (NYSE: PLL) today reported sales and earnings results for the first quarter ended October 31, 2005.
Sales increased 4% to $431.2 million compared to $414.7 million last year. Reported earnings were $25.1 million or 20 cents per share as compared to $21.7 million or 17 cents per share last year. On a pro forma basis, earnings were $25.3 million or 20 cents per share excluding restructuring and other (gains)/charges, net of related tax effect, as compared to $26.4 million or 21 cents per share last year. The impact of stock compensation and the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, "Share-Based Payment" reduced earnings per share in the quarter by 2 cents. The effect of foreign currency translation on sales and net earnings was not significant in the quarter.
Eric Krasnoff, Chairman and CEO, said, "In the quarter, we saw growth across all Industrial segments and in BioPharmaceuticals. Asia posted strong growth of 13%, and in Europe we see signs of an improving economy. SG&A improved 40 basis points and would have increased 80 basis points if not for the stock compensation expense in the quarter. This reflects the effectiveness of our CoRe cost reduction programs and integration of our business structure. Gross margins were atypically low in the quarter due to nonrecurring costs. They are now expected to be on par for the full year over last year."
The results reported in local currency by business are:
Overall, Industrial sales increased 6% and operating profit margin was 10.7%, on par with last year. Operating profit dollars increased 4 1/2% to $28 million, driven by improvements in Aerospace and Microelectronics. This was partly offset by product mix in General Industrial.
Sales in General Industrial increased 5% in the quarter. Within General Industrial, Machinery & Equipment sales increased 9% reflecting strong growth in Asia, where sales increased 32 1/2%. Fuels & Chemicals sales grew 5%. Power Generation sales increased 5 1/2% in the quarter driven by growth in Europe and Asia. Food and Beverage sales were up 2%. While Municipal Water sales were level with last year's first quarter, orders increased 56%.
Microelectronics sales were up 4% driven by growth in the display and data storage markets. Operating profit margin improved to 16.8% and operating profit dollars increased 5% to $9 million. Aerospace had a very good quarter with sales increasing 12 1/2%, driven by growth in both the Military and Commercial portions of the business. The overall Aerospace operating margin improved to 16.4%, while operating profit dollars increased 40% to $7.1 million.
Turning now to Life Sciences, sales increased by 2% in the quarter. The operating profit margin declined to 15.1%. In the quarter, we transferred remaining corporate R&D into the business units with the lion's share going into Life Sciences. BioPharmaceuticals sales in the quarter increased 5% driven by strong growth in consumables. Market trends continue to be strong in biotech.
Within Medical, sales in our BioSciences submarket increased 8%, with laboratory product sales up for the sixth consecutive quarter. Sales in our Blood Filtration submarket were down 3%. This is due primarily to long-term contracts with major blood banking customers which we announced last fiscal year.
The results by geography, with sales reported in local currency, are:
Sales in Asia were up 12 1/2% driven by double-digit growth in General Industrial and Microelectronics. We continue to invest broadly in Asia in sales and manufacturing and, to a lesser extent, in infrastructure. Operating profit margin was 14.2% on par with last year, while operating profit dollars increased 13 1/2% to $15.1 million.
European sales increased 3% after being essentially flat all of last year. Strong growth in Aerospace and BioPharmaceuticals stood out. Operating profit margins declined to 6.5%, while operating profit dollars decreased 38 1/2% to $12.9 million.
In the Western Hemisphere, sales increased 1% while orders were very strong. Double-digit growth in Aerospace and modest growth in General Industrial was offset by shortfalls in Medical and Microelectronics. BioPharmaceuticals sales were flat. Operating margins were 13.4%, on par with last year. Operating profit dollars increased 5% to $28.4 million.
Mr. Krasnoff concluded, "With the first quarter results falling within our expectations, we are on track to achieve guidance for the year".
