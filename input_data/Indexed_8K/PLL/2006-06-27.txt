Item 1.01 Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On June 21, 2006, Pall Corporation (the "Registrant") (and certain subsidiaries: Pall Europe Limited, Filtration and Separation Group SAS, Pall France S.A., Pall Deutschland Holdings GmbH & Co. KG, Pall Italia S.R.L. and Medsep Corporation (collectively, the "Wholly Owned Subsidiary Borrowers" and, together with the Registrant, the "Borrowers")), entered into a Credit Agreement (the "Agreement") with several financial institutions. Among them are JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Facility Agent, J. P. Morgan Europe Limited, as London Agent, J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., Banc of America Securities LLC and Banc of America Securities Limited, as Mandated Lead Arrangers and Joint Bookrunners and Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Trust Company, HSBC Bank USA, National Association, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, UBS Securities LLC and Wachovia Bank, N.A., as Arrangers under the Agreement. The obligations of the borrowers under the Agreement are guaranteed by the Registrant and all of its existing or subsequently acquired or organized active domestic subsidiaries.
The Agreement replaces a revolving credit facility entered into on July 29, 2005, by and among the Registrant, and a syndicate of banks thereto, which was due to expire on July 29, 2010 (the "Prior Agreement"). The Prior Agreement was terminated by the Registrant on June 21, 2006.
The Agreement provides for a $500 million five-year revolving credit facility (the "Facility") that may be drawn upon in US Dollars, Pounds Sterling, Euro and other readily available and freely exchangeable currencies and provides for letters of credit up to $50 million.
Simultaneous with entry into the Agreement, the Registrant and one of its subsidiaries borrowed approximately $445 million. These proceeds were used to (i) repay the existing balance under the Prior Agreement, totaling approximately $213 million, (ii) repay a 90-day term loan of $200 million and (iii) pay various fees and accrued interest of approximately $1.9 million. The balance of this borrowing is being used for general corporate purposes.
The Agreement includes customary representations and warranties and affirmative and negative covenants substantially similar to, and, in some cases, more favorable to the Borrowers than those in the Prior Agreement. The Agreement also contains financial covenants that require the Registrant to maintain a minimum Consolidated Net Interest Coverage Ratio of 3.5:1 and a maximum Consolidated Leverage Ratio of 3.5:1.
The Agreement also contains customary events of default. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the outstanding obligations under the Agreement may be accelerated and become due and payable immediately.
Certain of the Lenders party to the Agreement, and their respective affiliates, have performed, and may in the future perform for the Registrant and its subsidiaries, various commercial banking, investment banking, underwriting and other financial advisory services, for which they have received, and will receive, customary fees and expense reimbursement.
Item 1.02 Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement.
Effective June 21, 2006, the Prior Agreement, as defined in Item 1.01 above, was terminated by the Registrant.
Prior to the termination of the Prior Agreement, the Registrant had approximately $213 million of borrowings and approximately $14.4 million of letters of credit outstanding. The borrowings were repaid using proceeds of the loans under the Agreement and the letters of credit under the Prior Agreement were transferred to the Agreement, a description of which is contained under Item 1.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K. The Registrant did not incur any early termination fees or penalties in connection with the termination of the Prior Agreement.

(c) At the commencement of each Interest Period for any LIBOR Revolving Borrowing or EURIBOR Revolving Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be in an aggregate amount that is an integral multiple of the Borrowing Multiple and not less than the Borrowing Minimum. At the time that each ABR Revolving Borrowing is made, such Borrowing shall be in an aggregate amount that is an integral multiple of US$100,000 and not less than US$500,000;
provided
that an ABR Revolving Borrowing under any Tranche may be in an aggregate amount that is equal to the entire unused balance of the Commitments under such Tranche or that is required to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as contemplated by Section 2.05(e). Each Swingline Loan shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of US$100,000 and not less than US$100,000. Borrowings of more than one Type may be outstanding at the same time;
provided
that there shall not at any time be more than a total of (i) five US/European Tranche LIBOR Revolving Borrowings and US/European Tranche EURIBOR Revolving Borrowings outstanding, (ii) three French Tranche LIBOR Revolving Borrowings and French Tranche EURIBOR Revolving Borrowings outstanding or (iii) three Italian Tranche LIBOR Revolving Borrowings and Italian Tranche EURIBOR Revolving Borrowings outstanding.

SECTION 2.04.
Swingline Loans.
(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Swingline Lender agrees to make Swingline Loans denominated in US Dollars to the Company, from time to time during the Availability Period, in an aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding that will not result in (i) the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Swingline Loans exceeding US$10,000,000, (ii) the aggregate amount of the US/European Tranche Revolving Exposures exceeding the aggregate amount of the US/European Tranche Commitments or (iii) the US/European Tranche Revolving Exposure of any Lender exceeding its US/European Tranche Commitment;

Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the requested date (which shall be a Business Day) and amount of the requested Swingline Loan. The Facility Agent will promptly advise the Swingline Lender of any such notice received from the Company. The Swingline Lender shall make each Swingline Loan available to the Company by means of a credit to the Applicable Funding Account (or, in the case of a Swingline Loan made to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as provided in Section 2.05(e), by remittance to the Issuing Bank) by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the requested date of such Swingline Loan.

Such notice shall specify the aggregate amount of Swingline Loans in which the US/European Tranche Lenders will participate. Promptly upon receipt of such notice, the Facility Agent will give notice thereof to each US/European Tranche Lender, specifying in such notice such US/European Tranche Lender's US/European Tranche Percentage of such Swingline Loan or Loans. Each US/European Tranche Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees, upon receipt of notice as provided above, to pay to the Facility Agent, for the account of the Swingline Lender, such Lender's US/European Tranche Percentage of such Swingline Loan or Loans. Each US/European Tranche Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations in Swingline Loans pursuant to this paragraph is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the US/European Tranche Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. Each US/European Tranche Lender shall comply with its obligation under this paragraph by wire transfer of immediately available funds, in the same manner as provided in Section 2.06 with respect to Loans made by such US/European Tranche Lender (and Section 2.06 shall apply,
mutatis
mutandis
, to the payment obligations of the US/European Tranche Lenders), and the Facility Agent shall promptly pay to the Swingline Lender the amounts so received by it from the US/European Tranche Lenders. The Facility Agent shall notify the Company of any participations in any Swingline Loan acquired pursuant to this paragraph, and thereafter payments in respect of such Swingline Loan shall be made to the Facility Agent and not to the Swingline Lender. Any amounts received by the Swingline Lender from the Company (or other party on behalf of the Company) in respect of a Swingline Loan after receipt by the Swingline Lender of the proceeds of a sale of participations therein shall be promptly remitted to the Facility Agent; any such amounts received by the Facility Agent shall be promptly remitted by the Facility Agent to the US/European Tranche Lenders that shall have made their payments pursuant to this paragraph and to the Swingline Lender, as their interests may appear;
provided
that any such payment so remitted shall be repaid to the Swingline Lender or to the Facility Agent, as applicable, if and to the extent such payment is required to be refunded to a Loan Party for any reason. The purchase of participations in a Swingline Loan pursuant to this paragraph shall not relieve the Company of any default in the payment thereof.
37
SECTION 2.05.
Letters of Credit.
(a)  
General.
Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Company may request the issuance (or the amendment, renewal or extension of an outstanding Letter of Credit) of Letters of Credit denominated in US Dollars for its own account, in a form reasonably acceptable to the Facility Agent and the Issuing Bank, at any time and from time to time during the Availability Period. In the event of any inconsistency between the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the terms and conditions of any form of letter of credit application or other agreement submitted by the Company to, or entered into by the Company with, the Issuing Bank relating to any Letter of Credit, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall control. From and after the Effective Date, each Existing Letter of Credit, as set forth in
Schedule 2.05
, shall be deemed to be a Letter of Credit for all purposes hereof and shall be deemed to have been issued hereunder on the Effective Date. Any Lender that issued an Existing Letter of Credit shall have the rights of an Issuing Bank as to such Letter of Credit for purposes of this Section 2.05.
(b)
Notice of Issuance, Amendment, Renewal, Extension; Certain Conditions.
To request the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or the amendment, renewal or extension of an outstanding Letter of Credit), the Company shall hand deliver or telecopy (or transmit by electronic communication, if arrangements for doing so have been approved by the Issuing Bank) to the Issuing Bank and the Facility Agent (reasonably in advance of the requested date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension) a notice signed by a Responsible Officer of the Company requesting the issuance of a Letter of Credit, or identifying the Letter of Credit to be amended, renewed or extended, and specifying the date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension (which shall be a Business Day), the date on which such Letter of Credit is to expire (which shall comply with paragraph (c) of this Section), the amount of such Letter of Credit, the name and address of the beneficiary thereof and such other information as shall be necessary to prepare, amend, renew or extend such Letter of Credit. If requested by the Issuing Bank, the Company also shall submit a letter of credit application on the Issuing Bank's standard form in connection with any request for a Letter of Credit. A Letter of Credit shall be issued, amended, renewed or extended only if (and upon issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of each Letter of Credit the Company shall be deemed to represent and warrant that), after giving effect to such issuance, amendment, renewal or extension (i) the LC Exposure shall not exceed US$50,000,000, (ii) the aggregate amount of the US/European Tranche Revolving Exposures shall not exceed the aggregate amount of the US/European Tranche Commitments and (iii) the US/European Tranche Revolving Exposure of each Lender shall not exceed such Lender's US/European Tranche Commitment.
38
(c)
Expiration Date.
Each Letter of Credit shall expire at or prior to the close of business on the earlier of (i) the date one year after the date of the issuance of such Letter of Credit (or, in the case of any renewal or extension thereof, one year after such renewal or extension) and (ii) the date that is five Business Days prior to the Maturity Date;
provided
that at the request of the Company any Letter of Credit may contain customary "evergreen" provisions pursuant to which such Letter of Credit will, in the absence of a notice given by the Issuing Bank, be automatically renewed (but in no event beyond the date that is five Business Days prior to the Maturity Date) for successive one-year periods.
(d)
Participations.
By the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or an amendment to a Letter of Credit increasing the amount thereof) and without any further action on the part of the Issuing Bank or the US/European Tranche Lenders, the Issuing Bank hereby grants to each US/European Tranche Lender, and each US/European Tranche Lender hereby acquires from the Issuing Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit equal to such Lender's US/European Tranche Percentage of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit. In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each US/European Tranche Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to the Facility Agent, for the account of the Issuing Bank, such Lender's US/European Tranche Percentage of each LC Disbursement made by the Issuing Bank and not reimbursed by the Company on the date due as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section, or of any reimbursement payment required to be refunded to the Company for any reason. Each US/European Tranche Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations pursuant to this paragraph in respect of Letters of Credit is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. On the Effective Date and without any further action by any party hereto, each Issuing Bank that has issued an Existing Letter of Credit shall be deemed to have granted to each US/European Tranche Lender, and each US/European Tranche Lender shall be deemed to have acquired from such Issuing Bank, a participation in each such Existing Letter of Credit in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this paragraph (d).
(e)
Reimbursement.
If the Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit, the Company shall reimburse such LC Disbursement by paying to the Facility Agent an amount equal to such LC Disbursement not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the date that such LC Disbursement is made, if the Company shall have received notice of such LC Disbursement prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on such date, or, if such notice has not been received by the Company prior to such time on such date, then not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on (i) the Business Day that the Company receives such notice, if such notice is received prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the day of receipt or (ii) the Business Day immediately following the day that the Company receives such notice, if such notice is not received prior to such time on the day of receipt;
provided
that, if the Maturity Date shall not have occurred, the Company may, subject to the conditions to borrowing set forth herein, request in accordance with Section 2.03 or 2.04 that such payment be financed with a ABR Revolving Borrowing or Swingline Loan (in each case, if such LC Disbursement is not less than US$500,000) in an equivalent amount and, to the extent so financed, the Company's obligation to make such payment shall be discharged and replaced by the resulting ABR Revolving Borrowing or Swingline Loan. If the Company fails to make such payment when due, the Facility Agent shall notify each US/European Tranche Lender of the applicable LC Disbursement, the payment then due from the Company in respect thereof (the "
Unreimbursed Amount
") and such Lender's US/European Tranche Percentage thereof. Promptly following receipt of such notice, each US/European Tranche Lender shall pay to the Facility Agent its US/European Tranche Percentage of the Unreimbursed Amount, in the same manner as provided in Section 2.06 with respect to Loans made by such US/European Tranche Lender (and Section 2.06 shall apply,
mutatis
mutandis
, to the payment obligations of the US/European Tranche Lenders), and the Facility Agent shall promptly pay to the Issuing Bank the amounts so received by it from the US/European Tranche Lenders. Promptly following receipt by the Facility Agent of any payment from the Company pursuant to this paragraph, the Facility Agent shall distribute such payment to the Issuing Bank or, to the extent that US/European Tranche Lenders have made payments pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse the Issuing Bank, then to such US/European Tranche Lenders and the Issuing Bank as their interests may appear. Any payment made by a US/European Tranche Lender pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse the Issuing Bank for any LC Disbursement (other than the funding of ABR Revolving Loans or a Swingline Loan as contemplated above) shall not constitute a Loan and shall not relieve the Company of its obligation to reimburse such LC Disbursement.
39
(f)
Obligations Absolute.
The Company's obligation to reimburse LC Disbursements as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit, this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or any term or provision therein, (ii) any draft or other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment by the Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit or (iv) any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or provide a right of setoff against, the Company's obligations hereunder. None of the Facility Agent, the US/European Tranche Lenders or the Issuing Bank, or any of their Related Parties, shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the Issuing Bank;
provided
that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse the Issuing Bank from liability to the Company to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the Company to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by the Company that are caused by the Issuing Bank's failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof. The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of gross negligence or wilful misconduct on the part of the Issuing Bank (as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), the Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such determination. In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree that, with respect to documents presented which appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, the Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit.
40
(g)
Disbursement Procedures.
The Issuing Bank shall, promptly following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit. The Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the Facility Agent and the Company by telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of such demand for payment and whether the Issuing Bank has made or will make an LC Disbursement thereunder;
provided
that any failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the Company of its obligation to reimburse the Issuing Bank and the US/European Tranche Lenders with respect to any such LC Disbursement.
(h)
Interim Interest.
If the Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement, then, unless the Company shall reimburse such LC Disbursement in full, by 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and including the date such LC Disbursement is made to but excluding the date that the Company reimburses such LC Disbursement, at the rate per annum then applicable to ABR Revolving Loans denominated in US Dollars;
provided
that, if the Company fails to reimburse such LC Disbursement when due pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section, then Section 2.12(d) shall apply. Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for the account of the Issuing Bank, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any US/European Tranche Lender pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section to reimburse the Issuing Bank shall be for the account of such US/European Tranche Lender to the extent of such payment.
41
(i)
Replacement of the Issuing Bank.
The Issuing Bank may be replaced at any time by written agreement among the Company, the Facility Agent, the replaced Issuing Bank and the successor Issuing Bank. The Facility Agent shall notify the Lenders of any such replacement of the Issuing Bank. At the time any such replacement shall become effective, the Company shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for the account of the replaced Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.11(b). From and after the effective date of any such replacement, (i) the successor Issuing Bank shall have all the rights and obligations of the Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued thereafter and (ii) references herein to the term "
Issuing Bank
" shall be deemed to refer to such successor or to any previous Issuing Bank, or to such successor and all previous Issuing Banks, as the context shall require. After the replacement of an Issuing Bank hereunder, the replaced Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such replacement (including the right to receive fees under Section 2.11(b)), but shall not be required to issue additional Letters of Credit.
(j)
Cash Collateralization.
If any Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, on the Business Day that the Company receives notice from the Facility Agent or the Required Lenders (or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated, US/European Tranche Lenders with LC Exposures representing more than 50% of the aggregate amount of LC Exposure) demanding the deposit of cash collateral pursuant to this paragraph, the Company shall deposit ("
Cash Collateralize
") in an account with the Facility Agent, in the name of the Facility Agent and for the benefit of the US/European Tranche Lenders and the Issuing Bank, an amount in cash equal to the aggregate amount of LC Exposure as of such date plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon;
provided
that the obligation to Cash Collateralize shall become effective immediately, and such deposit shall become immediately due and payable, without demand or other notice of any kind, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default with respect to the Company described in clause (f) of Section 7.01. Each such deposit shall be held by the Facility Agent as collateral for the payment and performance of the obligations of the Company under this Agreement. The Facility Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over such account. Other than any interest earned on the investment of such deposits, which investments shall be made at the option and sole discretion of the Facility Agent and at the Company's risk and expense, such deposits shall not bear interest. Interest or profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in such account. Monies in such account shall be applied by the Facility Agent to reimburse the Issuing Bank for LC Disbursements for which it has not been reimbursed and, to the extent not so applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of the Company for the LC Exposure at such time or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated (but subject to the consent of US/European Tranche Lenders with LC Exposures representing more than 50% of the aggregate amount of LC Exposure), be applied to satisfy other obligations of the Company under this Agreement. If the Company is required to provide an amount of cash collateral hereunder as a result of the occurrence of an Event of Default, such amount (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to the Company within three Business Days after all Events of Default have been cured or waived.
42
SECTION 2.06.
Funding of Borrowings.
(a)  Each Lender shall make each Loan to be made by it hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of immediately available funds in the applicable currency by 12:00 noon, Local Time, to the account of the Applicable Agent most recently designated by it for such purpose by notice to the Lenders;
provided
that Swingline Loans shall be made as provided in Section 2.04. The Applicable Agent will make such Loans available to the applicable Borrower by promptly crediting the amounts so received, in like funds, to the Applicable Funding Account of such Borrower;
provided
that ABR Revolving Loans or Swingline Loans made to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as provided in Section 2.05(e) shall be remitted by the Facility Agent to the Issuing Bank.
(b) Unless the Applicable Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Applicable Agent such Lender's share of such Borrowing, the Applicable Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the applicable Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Applicable Agent, then the applicable Lender and such Borrower severally agree to pay to the Applicable Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to such Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Applicable Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender, the rate reasonably determined by the Applicable Agent to be the cost to it of funding such amount or (ii) in the case of such Borrower, the interest rate applicable to the subject Loan.
SECTION 2.07.
Interest Elections.
(a)  Each Revolving Borrowing initially shall be of the Type specified in the applicable Borrowing Request and, in the case of a LIBOR Borrowing or a EURIBOR Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period as specified in such Borrowing Request. Thereafter, the applicable Borrower may elect to convert such Borrowing to a different Type or to continue such Borrowing and, in the case of a LIBOR Borrowing or a EURIBOR Borrowing, may elect Interest Periods therefor, all as provided in this Section. A Borrower may elect different options with respect to different portions of an affected Revolving Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a separate Revolving Borrowing. This Section shall not apply to Swingline Borrowings, which may not be converted or continued.
(b) To make an election pursuant to this Section, a Borrower shall notify the Applicable Agent of such election by telecopy (or, in the case of the Facility Agent, by telephone) by the time that a Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 if such Borrower were requesting a Revolving Borrowing of the Type resulting from such election to be made on the effective date of such election. Each such Interest Election Request shall be irrevocable and, if telephonic, shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery or telecopy to the Facility Agent of a written Interest Election Request in a form approved by the Facility Agent and signed by a Responsible Officer of the Company, on behalf of the applicable Borrower. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section, the Borrower shall not be permitted to (i) change the currency of any Borrowing, (ii) elect an Interest Period for LIBOR Loans or EURIBOR Loans that does not comply with Section 2.02(d) or (iii) convert any Borrowing to a Borrowing of a Type not available to such Borrower under the Class of Commitments pursuant to which such Borrowing was made.
43
(c) Each telephonic and written Interest Election Request shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02 and paragraph (e) of this Section:
(i) the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request applies and, if different options are being elected with respect to different portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting Borrowing (in which case the information to be specified pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) below shall be specified for each resulting Borrowing);
(ii) the effective date of the election made pursuant to such Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;
(iii) the Type of the resulting Borrowing; and
(iv) if the resulting Borrowing is to be a LIBOR Borrowing or a EURIBOR Borrowing, the Interest Period to be applicable thereto after giving effect to such election, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term "Interest Period".
If any such Interest Election Request requests a LIBOR Borrowing or a EURIBOR Borrowing but does not specify an Interest Period, then the Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month's duration.
(d) Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the Applicable Agent shall advise each Lender holding a Loan to which such request relates of the details thereof and of such Lender's portion of each resulting Borrowing.
(e) If the applicable Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest Election Request with respect to a LIBOR Borrowing or EURIBOR Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period, such Borrowing shall (i) in the case of a LIBOR Borrowing made to a US Borrower denominated in US Dollars, be converted to an ABR Borrowing, (ii) in the case of any other LIBOR Borrowing or a EURIBOR Borrowing, become due and payable on the last day of such Interest Period. Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Facility Agent, at the request of the Required Lenders, so notifies the Company, then, so long as an Event of Default is continuing (i) no outstanding Revolving Borrowing made to a US Borrower denominated in US Dollars may be converted to or continued as a LIBOR Borrowing and (ii) unless repaid, each LIBOR Revolving Borrowing made to a US Borrower denominated in US Dollars shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto.
44
SECTION 2.08.
Termination and Reduction of Commitments.
(a) Unless previously terminated, the Commitments shall terminate on the Maturity Date.
(b) The Company may at any time terminate, or from time to time reduce, the Commitments of any Tranche;
provided
that (i) each reduction of the Commitments of any Tranche shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of the Borrowing Multiple and not less than the Borrowing Minimum, in each case for Borrowings denominated in US Dollars, (ii) the Company shall not terminate or reduce the US/European Tranche Commitments if, after giving effect to any concurrent prepayment of the US/European Tranche Revolving Loans or Swingline Loans in accordance with Section 2.10, the aggregate amount of US/European Revolving Exposures would exceed the aggregate amount of US/European Tranche Commitments, (iii) the Company shall not terminate or reduce the French Tranche Commitments if, after giving effect to any concurrent prepayment of the French Tranche Revolving Loans in accordance with Section 2.10, the aggregate amount of French Tranche Exposures would exceed the aggregate amount of French Tranche Commitments and (iv) the Company shall not terminate or reduce the Italian Tranche Commitments if, after giving effect to any concurrent prepayment of the Italian Tranche Revolving Loans in accordance with Section 2.10, the aggregate amount of Italian Tranche Exposures would exceed the aggregate amount of Italian Tranche Commitments.
(c) The Company shall notify the Facility Agent of any election to terminate or reduce the Commitments under any Tranche under paragraph (b) of this Section at least three Business Days prior to the effective date of such termination or reduction, specifying such election and the effective date thereof. Promptly following receipt of any such notice, the Facility Agent shall advise the other Agent and the applicable Lenders of the contents thereof. Each notice delivered by the Company pursuant to this Section shall be irrevocable;
provided
that a notice of termination of the Commitments delivered by a Responsible Officer of the Company may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities, in which case such notice may be revoked by the Company (by notice to the Facility Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied. Any termination or reduction of the Commitments under any Tranche shall be permanent. Each reduction of the Commitments under any Tranche shall be made ratably among the applicable Lenders in accordance with their Commitments under such Tranche.
(d) (i) The Company may, by written notice to the Facility Agent signed by a Responsible Officer of the Company, from time to time decrease the Commitments under any Tranche (a "
Commitment Decrease
"), ratably in accordance with the applicable Lenders' Tranche Percentages under such Tranche, and cause the Lenders under such Tranche to assume Commitments (or increase their existing Commitments) under another Tranche (a "
Commitment Increase
") in an amount for each such Lender equal to the amount by which its Commitment under such initial Tranche shall have been reduced;
provided
, that (A) each Commitment Increase under any Tranche will be subject to and conditioned upon simultaneous Commitment Decreases under one or more other Tranches in a like aggregate principal amount and (B) no Lender shall be required to assume a Commitment (or increase an existing Commitment) under the French Tranche or the Italian Tranche unless it shall, in its discretion, consent to such assumption or increase. Each such notice shall set forth the amount of the Commitment Increase or Commitment Decrease under each Tranche and the date (the "
Increase/Decrease Effective Date
") on which such adjustments are to become effective (which shall be not less than 30 days or more than 60 days after the date of such notice).
45
(ii) On the Increase/Decrease Effective Date, (A) the aggregate principal amount of the Revolving Loans outstanding under each Tranche under which a Commitment Increase will become effective (the "
Initial Loans
" under such Tranche) immediately prior to giving effect to the applicable Commitment Increase on the Increase/Decrease Effective Date shall be deemed to be repaid, (B) after the effectiveness of the Commitment Increase, the Borrowers permitted to borrow under such Tranche shall be deemed to have made new Borrowings (the "
Subsequent Borrowings
") in an aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Initial Loans under such Tranche and of the types and for the Interest Periods specified in a Borrowing Request delivered to the Applicable Agent in accordance with Section 2.03, (C) each Lender under such Tranche shall pay to the Applicable Agent in same day funds an amount equal to the difference, if positive, between (x) such Lender's Tranche Percentage (calculated after giving effect to the Commitment Increase) of the Subsequent Borrowings and (y) such Lender's Tranche Percentage (calculated without giving effect to the Commitment Increase) of the Initial Loans, (D) after the Applicable Agent receives the funds specified in clause (C) above, the Applicable Agent shall pay to each Lender under such Tranche the portion of such funds that is equal to the difference, if positive, between (1) such Lender's Tranche Percentage (calculated without giving effect to the Commitment Increase) of the Initial Loans and (2) such Lender's Tranche Percentage (calculated after giving effect to the Commitment Increase) of the amount of the Subsequent Borrowings, (E) each Lender with a Commitment under such Tranche after giving effect to the Commitment Increase shall be deemed to hold its Tranche Percentage of each Subsequent Borrowing (calculated after giving effect to the Commitment Increase) and (F) each applicable Borrower shall pay each applicable Lender any and all accrued but unpaid interest on the Initial Loans. The deemed payments made pursuant to clause (A) above in respect of each LIBOR Loan or EURIBOR Loan shall be subject to indemnification by the Borrowers pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.15 if the Increase/Decrease Effective Date occurs other than on the last day of the Interest Period relating thereto and breakage costs result.
(iii) On the Increase Effective Date, each Commitment Decrease specified in the notice by the Company pursuant to paragraph (d)(i) above shall be made ratably among the Lenders holding Commitments under the decreasing Tranche in accordance with their Commitments under such Tranche and any prepayments required in order that the aggregate Exposures under such Tranche will not exceed the aggregate Commitments thereunder shall be made.

SECTION 2.09.
Repayment of Loans; Evidence of Debt.
(a) Each Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to pay (i) to the Applicable Agent for the account of each Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Revolving Loan of such Borrower on the Maturity Date and (ii) to the Swingline Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Swingline Loan on the earlier of the Maturity Date and the first date after such Swingline Loan is made that is the 15th or last day of a calendar month and is at least three Business Days after such Swingline Loan is made;
provided
that on each date that a Revolving Borrowing denominated in US Dollars (including any ABR Borrowing) is made to the Company, the Company shall repay all outstanding Swingline Loans.
(b) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the Indebtedness of each Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder.
(c) The Facility Agent shall maintain accounts in which it shall record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Class and Type thereof and the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from each Borrower to each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by any Agent hereunder for the account of the Lenders and each Lender's share thereof. The London Agent shall furnish to the Facility Agent, promptly after the making of any Loan or Borrowing with respect to which it is the Applicable Agent or the receipt of any payment of principal or interest with respect to any such Loan or Borrowing, information with respect thereto that will enable the Facility Agent to maintain the accounts referred to in the preceding sentence.
(d) The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of this Section shall be
prima
facie
evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein;
provided
that the failure of any Lender or the Facility Agent to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of any Borrower to repay the Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
(e) Any Lender may request that Loans of any Class made by it to any Borrower be evidenced by a promissory note. In such event, the applicable Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note payable to the order of such Lender (or, if requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its registered assigns) and in a form reasonably acceptable to the Facility Agent. Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after assignment pursuant to Section 11.04) be represented by one or more promissory notes in such form payable to the order of the payee named therein (or, if such promissory note is a registered note, to such payee and its registered assigns).
47
SECTION 2.10.
Prepayment of Loans.
(a) Any Borrower shall have the right at any time and from time to time to prepay any Borrowing of such Borrower in whole or in part, subject to prior notice in accordance with paragraph (d) of this Section.
(b) If the aggregate Exposures under any Tranche shall exceed the aggregate Commitments under such Tranche, then (i) on the last day of any Interest Period for any LIBOR Revolving Borrowing or EURIBOR Revolving Borrowing under such Tranche and (ii) in the case of the US/European Tranche, on any other date in the event ABR Revolving Borrowings or Swingline Loans shall be outstanding under such Tranche, the applicable Borrowers shall prepay Loans under such Tranche in an aggregate amount equal to the lesser of (A) the amount necessary to eliminate such excess (after giving effect to any other prepayment of Loans on such day) and (B) the amount of the applicable Borrowings or Loans referred to in clause (i) or (ii), as applicable. If, on any date, the aggregate amount of the Exposures under any Tranche shall exceed 105% of the aggregate Commitments under such Tranche, then the applicable Borrowers shall, not later than the next Business Day, prepay one or more Borrowings under such Tranche in an aggregate principal amount sufficient to eliminate such excess.
(c) Prior to any optional or mandatory prepayment of Borrowings hereunder, the applicable Borrower shall select the Borrowing or Borrowings to be prepaid and shall specify such selection in the notice of such prepayment pursuant to paragraph (d) of this Section.
(d) The Company, on behalf of the applicable Borrower, shall notify the Applicable Agent (and, in the case of prepayment of a Swingline Loan, the Swingline Lender) by a telecopy notice signed by a Responsible Officer of the Company of any prepayment of a Borrowing hereunder (i) in the case of a LIBOR Borrowing denominated in US Dollars, not later than 11:00 a.m., Local Time, three Business Days before the date of such prepayment (or, in the case of a prepayment under paragraph (b) above, as soon thereafter as practicable), (ii) in the case of a LIBOR Borrowing denominated in an Alternative Currency or a EURIBOR Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., Local Time, four Business days before the date of such prepayment (or, in the case of a prepayment under paragraph (b) above, as soon thereafter as practicable) and (iii) in the case of an ABR Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., Local Time, on the date of such prepayment. Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the prepayment date and the principal amount of each Borrowing or portion thereof to be prepaid;
provided
that, if a notice of optional prepayment is given in connection with a conditional notice of termination of the Commitments as contemplated by Section 2.08, then such notice of prepayment may be revoked if such notice of termination is revoked in accordance with Section 2.08. Promptly following receipt of any such notice, the Applicable Agent shall advise the applicable Lenders of the contents thereof. Each partial prepayment of any Borrowing shall be in an amount that would be permitted in the case of an advance of a Borrowing of the same Type as provided in Section 2.02. Each prepayment of a Borrowing shall be applied ratably to the Loans included in the prepaid Borrowing. Prepayments shall be accompanied by (i) accrued interest to the extent required by Section 2.12 and (ii) any break funding payments pursuant to Section 2.15.

Accrued commitment fees shall be payable in arrears on the last day of March, June, September and December of each year and on the date on which all the Commitments shall have terminated, commencing on the first such date to occur after the Closing Date. All commitment fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). For purposes of computing commitment fees with respect to the Commitments, a Commitment of a Lender shall be deemed to be used to the extent of the outstanding Revolving Loans and the LC Exposure of such Lender (and the Swingline Exposure of such Lender shall be disregarded for such purpose).
(b) The Company agrees to pay (i) to the Facility Agent for the account of each US/European Tranche Lender a participation fee with respect to its participations in Letters of Credit, which shall accrue at the same Applicable Rate used to determine the interest rate applicable to US/European Tranche LIBOR Revolving Loans, on the daily amount of such Lender's LC Exposure (excluding any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements) during the period from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the later of the date on which such Lender's Commitment terminates and the date on which such Lender ceases to have any LC Exposure and (ii) to the Issuing Bank a one-time fronting fee with respect to the issuance of each Letter of Credit (other than the Existing Letters of Credit) equal to 0.125% of the initial amount of such Letter of Credit, as well as the Issuing Bank's standard fees with respect to the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or processing of drawings thereunder. Participation fees and fronting fees accrued or becoming payable in respect of Letters of Credit issued through and including the last day of March, June, September and December of each year shall be payable on the third Business Day following such last day, commencing on the first such date to occur after the Effective Date;
provided
that all such fees shall be payable on the date on which the Commitments terminate and any such fees accruing after the date on which the Commitments terminate shall be payable on demand. Any other fees payable to the Issuing Bank pursuant to this paragraph shall be payable within 10 days after demand. All participation fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day).
49
(c) The Company agrees to pay to the Agents, for their own account, fees payable in the amounts and at the times separately agreed upon between the Company and the Agents.
(d) All fees payable hereunder shall be paid on the dates due, in immediately available funds, to the Facility Agent (or to the Issuing Bank, in the case of fees payable to it) for distribution (i) in the case of commitment fees, to the Lenders and (ii) in the case of the participation fees, to the US/European Tranche Lenders. Fees paid shall not be refundable under any circumstances.
SECTION 2.12.
Interest.
(a)  The Loans comprising each ABR Borrowing (including each Swingline Loan) shall bear interest at the Alternate Base Rate.
(b) The Revolving Loans comprising each LIBOR Revolving Borrowing shall bear interest at the Adjusted LIBO Rate for the Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing
plus
the Applicable Rate.
(c) The Revolving Loans comprising each EURIBOR Revolving Borrowing shall bear interest at the Adjusted EURIBO Rate for the Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing
plus
the Applicable Rate.
(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any principal of or interest on any Loan or any fee or other amount payable by any Borrower hereunder is not paid when due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise, such overdue amount shall bear interest, after as well as before judgment, at a rate per annum equal to (i) in the case of overdue principal of any Loan, 2% plus the rate otherwise applicable to such Loan as provided in the preceding paragraphs of this Section or (ii) in the case of any other amount, 2% plus the rate applicable to ABR Loans as provided in paragraph (a) of this Section.
(e) Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date for such Loan and upon the termination of the Commitments;
provided
that (i) interest accrued pursuant to paragraph (d) of this Section shall be payable on demand, (ii) in the event of any repayment or prepayment of any Loan (other than a prepayment of an ABR Revolving Loan or a Swingline Loan prior to the end of the Availability Period), accrued interest on the principal amount repaid or prepaid shall be payable on the date of such repayment or prepayment and (iii) in the event of any conversion of any LIBOR Revolving Loan or EURIBOR Revolving Loan prior to the end of the current Interest Period therefor, accrued interest on such Loan shall be payable on the effective date of such conversion. All interest shall be payable in the currency in which the applicable Loan is denominated.
(f) All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days, except that (i) interest on Borrowings denominated in Sterling and (ii) interest computed by reference to the Alternate Base Rate at times when the Alternate Base Rate is based on the Prime Rate shall each be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or, except in the case of Borrowings denominated in Sterling, 366 days in a leap year), and in each case shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). The applicable Adjusted LIBO Rate, Adjusted EURIBO Rate or Alternate Base Rate shall be determined by the Facility Agent, and such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
50
(g) For the purposes of Articles L313-1 et seq, R 313-1 and R313-2 of the French
Code de la Consommation
, the parties acknowledge that, due to certain terms of this Agreement (including the variable interest rate applicable to Loans made to French Borrowers and the French Borrowers' right to select the currency and the duration of the Interest Period of each Loan), the
taux effectif global
applicable to the Loans made to any French Borrower cannot be calculated as of the Closing Date. However, the London Agent shall deliver to any French Subsidiary, on of the date on which such French Subsidiary becomes a French Borrower, a letter substantially in the form of
Exhibit J
. The terms of any such letter delivered to a French Borrower are hereby incorporated herein by this reference.
SECTION 2.13.
Alternate Rate of Interest.
If prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a LIBOR Borrowing denominated in any currency or a EURIBOR Borrowing denominated in Euros:
(i) the Applicable Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the Adjusted EURIBO Rate, as the case may be, for such Interest Period; or
(ii) the Applicable Agent is advised by a majority in interest of the Lenders that would participate in such Borrowing that the LIBO Rate or EURIBO Rate, as the case may be, for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining the Loans included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period;
then the Applicable Agent shall give notice thereof to the applicable Borrower and the applicable Lenders by telephone or telecopy as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until the Applicable Agent notifies the applicable Borrower and the applicable Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of any affected Revolving Borrowing to, or continuation of any affected Revolving Borrowing as, a LIBOR Borrowing or a EURIBOR Borrowing, as the case may be, shall be ineffective, (ii) any affected LIBOR Borrowing or EURIBOR Borrowing that is requested to be continued shall be repaid on the last day of the then current Interest Period applicable thereto and (iii) any Borrowing Request for an affected LIBOR Borrowing or a EURIBOR Borrowing shall be ineffective.
51
SECTION 2.14.
Increased Costs.
(a) If any Change in Law shall:
(i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of or credit extended by, any Lender (except any such reserve requirement reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the Adjusted EURIBO Rate) or the Issuing Bank; or
(ii) impose on any Lender, the Issuing Bank or the London or European interbank market any other condition affecting this Agreement or LIBOR Loans or EURIBOR Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participations therein;
and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining any LIBOR Loan or EURIBOR Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan) or to increase the cost to such Lender or the Issuing Bank of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or the Issuing Bank hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then the applicable Borrower will pay to such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.
(b) If any Lender or the Issuing Bank determines that any Change in Law regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's capital or on the capital of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by the Issuing Bank, to a level below that which such Lender or the Issuing Bank or such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's policies and the policies of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the applicable Borrower will pay to such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank or such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company for any such reduction suffered.
(c) A certificate of a Lender or the Issuing Bank setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section shall be delivered to the Company and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Company shall pay such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.
(d) Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or the Issuing Bank to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's right to demand such compensation;
provided
that the applicable Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender or the Issuing Bank pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than 180 days prior to the date that such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, notifies the Company of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's intention to claim compensation therefor;
provided
further
that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 180-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.
52
SECTION 2.15.
Break Funding Payments.
In the event of (a) the payment of any principal of any LIBOR Loan or any EURIBOR Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of Default), (b) the conversion of any LIBOR Loan or any EURIBOR Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (c) the failure to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any LIBOR Loan or any EURIBOR Loan on the date specified in any notice delivered pursuant hereto (regardless of whether such notice may be revoked under Section 2.10(d) and is revoked in accordance therewith) or (d) the assignment of any LIBOR Loan or any EURIBOR Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto as a result of a request by the applicable Borrower pursuant to Section 2.18 or the CAM Exchange, then, in any such event, the applicable Borrower shall compensate each Lender for the loss, cost and expense attributable to such event. In the case of a LIBOR Loan or a EURIBOR Loan, such loss, cost or expense to any Lender shall be deemed to include an amount determined by such Lender to be the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest which would have accrued on the principal amount of such Loan had such event not occurred, at the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the Adjusted EURIBO Rate, as the case may be, that would have been applicable to such Loan, for the period from the date of such event to the last day of the then current Interest Period therefor (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, for the period that would have been the Interest Period for such Loan) over (ii) the amount of interest that would accrue on such principal amount for such period at the interest rate which such Lender would bid were it to bid, at the commencement of such period, for deposits in the applicable currency of a comparable amount and period from other banks in the London or European interbank market. A certificate of any Lender setting forth in reasonable detail any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section shall be delivered to the Company and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Company shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.
SECTION 2.16.
Taxes.
(a)  Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of a Loan Party hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes;
provided
that if any Loan Party shall be required to deduct any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes from such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) each Agent, each Lender and Issuing Bank (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) such Loan Party shall make such deductions and (iii) such Loan Party shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
53
(b) In addition, the Loan Parties shall pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
(c) Each relevant Loan Party shall indemnify each Agent, each Lender and the Issuing Bank, within 10 days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes paid by such Agent, such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, on or with respect to any payment by or on account of any obligation of such Loan Party hereunder or under any other Loan Document (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate setting forth the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Company by a Lender or the Issuing Bank, or by the Facility Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender or the Issuing Bank, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
(d) As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by a Loan Party to a Governmental Authority, such Loan Party shall deliver to the Facility Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Facility Agent.
(e) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which a Borrower is located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments under this Agreement shall deliver to the Company (with a copy to the Facility Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Company as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate;
provided
that such Lender has received written notice from the Company advising it of the availability of such exemption or reduction and containing all applicable documentation. Each Lender shall promptly notify the Company at any time it determines that it is no longer in a position to provide any such previously delivered documentation to the Company.
(f)
Austrian Tax Matters.
Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, the exclusive place of performance (
Leistungsort
) in respect of all rights and obligations of the parties to this Agreement and the other Loan Parties shall be at all times a location outside the Republic of Austria.
(g)
German Tax Matters.
(i) Upon the written request of the Company, and additionally as provided in clause (vi) below, the Lenders shall, within 50 Business Days after the Closing Date and each anniversary of the Closing Date, issue confirmations (each a "
Tax Confirmation
"), but not more than once a year unless the Company demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Facility Agent that more than one Tax Confirmation is required in a particular year, in order to enable any Borrower which falls within the personal scope of obligation of section 8a German corporate income tax law to provide sufficient proof to the German tax authorities about absence of any back-to-back financing within the meaning of the public decrees of the tax authorities (the "
Decrees
") to Section 8a of the German Corporate Income Tax Act (
Krperschaftsteuergesetz
) dated 15 July 2004 and 22 July 2005.
54
(ii) Each European Borrower organized under the laws of Germany will forward to the Lenders such information which may be reasonably required by the Lenders (based on the then applicable practice of the German tax authorities) to enable the Lenders to issue a Tax Confirmation.
(iii) No Tax Confirmation shall contain any statements by any Lender that such Lender is not permitted to issue by law, administrative rule or regulation of any jurisdiction that such Lender or any of its Affiliates is subject to.
(iv) The Company, on behalf of itself and each other Loan Party, and each Borrower confirms to each Lender and to the Facility Agent that the Tax Confirmations will be issued by the Lenders exclusively at the written request of a European Borrower organized under the laws of Germany and solely for providing proof to the German tax authorities of the absence of any back-to-back-financing pursuant to the Decrees with respect to the Loan Documents and that neither the Lenders nor the Facility Agent are responsible for examining the Loan Parties' tax position or for achieving any certain tax treatment of the Loan Parties. Furthermore, the Company, on behalf of itself and each other Loan Party, and each Borrower confirms to each Lender and to the Facility Agent that a Tax Confirmation is not given for any Loan Party to rely on, but only for delivery to the competent tax authorities and that, therefore, no Loan Party will raise any claims against a Lender or the Facility Agent based on, or in connection with, a (correct or incorrect) Tax Confirmation. No Lender will be, and the Facility Agent will not be, liable for any loss, expense or any other cost whatsoever incurred or suffered by any Loan Party as a consequence of any Tax Confirmation made by a Lender (or by the Facility Agent on behalf of a Lender).
(v) The Lenders agree to issue the Tax Confirmations in each case substantially in the form of
Exhibit I
. Any costs and expenses reasonably incurred by any Lender in connection with the provision of the Tax Confirmations will be borne by the Company.
(vi) The Lenders will issue upon written request of the Company an amended form of Tax Confirmation to be reasonably agreed upon in the event that the tax laws (or the official interpretation of them by the German tax administration) applicable as of the Closing Date are amended. Each Lender is permitted to issue an adjusted Tax Confirmation at any time, and, in particular, in respect of any amendment to the Loan Documents and the Lenders are not bound by any confidentiality or secrecy requirement under any applicable laws, regulations or practice in respect of any information in that respect requested by, and provided by them to, any competent tax authority.
55
(vii) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Lender from any claims raised against it on the grounds of having issued a Tax Confirmation.
(viii) Each Borrower acknowledges that the Facility Agent or any Lender may only deliver a Tax Confirmation if and to the extent the Company, on behalf of itself and the other Borrowers, has released the Facility Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, from its general obligation to maintain confidentiality in respect of any information contained in a Tax Confirmation.
(h)
Value Added Tax.
All amounts payable by any Loan Party to the Agents, the Lenders or the Issuing Bank shall be deemed to be exclusive of any VAT. If VAT is payable on any amount paid to the Agents, the Lenders or the Issuing Bank by any Loan Party, the Borrower or such Loan Party shall pay to the Agents, the Lenders or the Issuing Bank an amount equal to the amount of the VAT.
SECTION 2.17.
Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Set-offs.
(a)  Each Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder or under any other Loan Document (whether of principal, interest, fees or reimbursement of LC Disbursements, or of amounts payable under Section 2.14, 2.15, 2.16 or 2.19, or otherwise) prior to the time expressly required hereunder or under such other Loan Document for such payment or, if no such time is expressly required, prior to 12:00 noon, Local Time, on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without set-off or counterclaim. Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Applicable Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall be made to the Applicable Agent for the account of the Lenders to such account as the Applicable Agent shall from time to time specify in one or more notices delivered to the Company, except that payments to be made directly to the Issuing Bank or Swingline Lender as expressly provided herein shall be made directly to such parties and payments pursuant to Sections 2.14, 2.15, 2.16, 2.19 and 11.03 shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto. The Applicable Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment under any Loan Document shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. All payments hereunder of principal or interest in respect of any Loan or LC Disbursement shall, except as otherwise expressly provided herein, be made in the currency of such Loan or LC Disbursement; all other payments hereunder and under each other Loan Document shall be made in US Dollars. Any payment required to be made by any Agent hereunder shall be deemed to have been made by the time required if such Agent shall, at or before such time, have taken the necessary steps to make such payment in accordance with the regulations or operating procedures of the clearing or settlement system used by such Agent to make such payment.
56
(b) If at any time insufficient funds are received by the Agents from any Borrower (or from the Company as guarantor of the Obligations of such Borrower pursuant to Article X) and available to pay fully all amounts of principal, unreimbursed LC Disbursements, interest and fees then due from such Borrower hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) 
first
, towards payment of interest and fees then due from such Borrower hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) 
second
, towards payment of principal of the Loans and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due from such Borrower hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due to such parties.
(c) If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on its US/European Tranche Revolving Loans, French Tranche Revolving Loans, Italian Tranche Revolving Loans or participations in LC Disbursements or Swingline Loans resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its US/European Tranche Revolving Loans, French Tranche Revolving Loans, Italian Tranche Revolving Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the US/European Tranche Revolving Loans, French Tranche Revolving Loans, Italian Tranche Revolving Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amounts of their respective US/European Tranche Revolving Loans, French Tranche Revolving Loans, Italian Tranche Revolving Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans;
provided
that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by any Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements to any assignee or participant, other than to the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply). Each Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Company and each Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Company or such Borrower in the amount of such participation.
(d) Unless an Agent shall have received notice from a Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to such Agent for the account of the Lenders or the Issuing Bank hereunder that the such Borrower will not make such payment, such Agent may assume that such Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the applicable Lenders or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if such Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the applicable Lenders or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to such Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Agent, at a rate determined by the Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.
57
(e) If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.04(c), 2.05(d) or (e), 2.06(b), 2.17(d) or 11.03(c) then the Facility Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by any Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender's obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.
SECTION 2.18.
Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.
(a) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.14 or 2.19, or if any Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.16, or if any Borrower is required to pay any additional interest to any Lender pursuant to Section 2.19, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.14, 2.16 or 2.19, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrowers hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.
(b) If (i) any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.14 or 2.19, (ii) any Loan Party is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.16, (iii) any Loan Party is required to pay any additional interest to any Lender pursuant to Section 2.19 or (iv) any Lender defaults in its obligation to fund Loans hereunder, then the applicable Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Facility Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 11.04), all its interests, rights and obligations under the Loan Documents to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment);
provided
that (x) such Borrower shall have received the prior written consent of the Facility Agent (and, if a US/European Tranche Commitment is being assigned, the Issuing Bank), which consent, in each case, shall not unreasonably be withheld, (y) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and funded participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal, funded participations and accrued interest and fees) or such Borrower (in the case of all other amounts) and (z) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.14 or 2.19 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.16 or additional interest required pursuant to Section 2.19, such assignment will result in a material reduction in such compensation or payments. A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the applicable Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.
58
SECTION 2.19.
Foreign Subsidiary Costs.
(a) If the cost to any Lender of making or maintaining any Loan to any Borrower is increased (or the amount of any sum received or receivable by any Lender (or its applicable lending office) is reduced) by an amount deemed in good faith by such Lender to be material, by reason of the fact that such Borrower is incorporated in, or conducts business in, a jurisdiction outside the United States of America, such Borrower shall indemnify such Lender for such increased cost or reduction within 15 days after demand by such Lender (with a copy to the Facility Agent). A certificate of such Lender claiming compensation under this paragraph and setting forth the additional amount or amounts to be paid to it hereunder (and the basis for the calculation of such amount or amounts) shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.
(b) Each Lender will promptly notify the Company and the Facility Agent of any event of which it has knowledge that will entitle such Lender to additional interest or payments pursuant to paragraph (a) above, but in any event within 45 days after such Lender obtains actual knowledge thereof;
provided
that (i) if any Lender fails to give such notice within 45 days after it obtains actual knowledge of such an event, such Lender shall, with respect to compensation payable pursuant to this Section in respect of any costs resulting from such event, only be entitled to payment under this Section for costs incurred from and after the date 45 days prior to the date that such Lender does give such notice and (ii) each Lender will designate a different applicable lending office, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, such compensation and will not be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender.
SECTION 2.20.
Redenomination of Certain Alternative Currencies.
(a) Each obligation of any party to this Agreement to make a payment denominated in the national currency unit of any member state of the European Union that adopts the Euro as its lawful currency after the Closing Date shall be redenominated into Euro at the time of such adoption (in accordance with the EMU Legislation). If, in relation to the currency of any such member state, the basis of accrual of interest expressed in this Agreement in respect of that currency shall be inconsistent with any convention or practice in the London interbank market for the basis of accrual of interest in respect of the Euro, such expressed basis shall be replaced by such convention or practice with effect from the date on which such member state adopts the Euro as its lawful currency;
provided
that if any Borrowing in the currency of such member state is outstanding immediately prior to such date, such replacement shall take effect, with respect to such Borrowing, at the end of the then current Interest Period.
59
(b) Each provision of this Agreement shall be subject to such reasonable changes of construction as the London Agent (in consultation with the Company) may from time to time specify to be appropriate to reflect the adoption of the Euro by any member state of the European Union and any relevant market conventions or practices relating to the Euro.
SECTION 2.21.
Designation of US Subsidiary Borrowers, European Borrowers, French Borrowers and Italian Borrowers.
The Company may at any time and from time to time designate (a) any US Subsidiary as a US Subsidiary Borrower, (b) any European Subsidiary as a European Borrower, (c) any French Subsidiary as a French Borrower or (d) any Italian Subsidiary as an Italian Borrower, in each case by delivery to the Facility Agent of a Borrower Joinder Agreement executed by such Subsidiary and the Company, and upon such delivery such Subsidiary shall for all purposes of this Agreement be a US Subsidiary Borrower, a European Borrower, a French Borrower or an Italian Borrower, as the case may be, and a party to this Agreement. Any US Subsidiary Borrower, European Borrower, French Borrower and Italian Borrower shall continue to be a Borrower and a party hereunder until the Company shall have executed and delivered to the Facility Agent a Borrower Termination Agreement with respect to such Borrower, whereupon such Borrower shall cease to be a Borrower and a party hereunder. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, (a) no Borrower Joinder Agreement shall become effective as to any US Subsidiary Borrower, any European Borrower, any French Borrower or any Italian Borrower if it shall be unlawful for such Subsidiary to become a Borrower hereunder or for any Lender participating in a Tranche under which such Subsidiary may borrow to make Loans to such Subsidiary as provided herein and (b) no Borrower Termination Agreement will become effective as to any US Subsidiary Borrower, any European Borrower, any French Borrower or any Italian Borrower until all Loans made to such Subsidiary shall have been repaid and all amounts payable by such Subsidiary in respect of interest and/or fees (and, to the extent notified by the Facility Agent or any Lender, any other amounts payable under the Credit Agreement by such Subsidiary) shall have been paid in full;
provided
that such Borrower Termination Agreement shall be effective to terminate the right of such Subsidiary to request or receive further Borrowings under this Agreement. As soon as practicable upon receipt of a Borrower Joinder Agreement, the Facility Agent shall send a copy thereof to each US/European Tranche Lender, French Tranche Lender or Italian Tranche Lender, as the case may be.

Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is in default in the performance, observance or fulfillment of any of the obligations, covenants or conditions contained in any agreement or instrument to which it is a party, which default could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.
SECTION 3.08.
Ownership of Property; Liens.

62

Schedule 3.09
hereto, the Company and each Subsidiary are in compliance with all applicable Environmental Laws and neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has used Hazardous Materials on, from, or affecting any property now owned or occupied or hereafter owned or occupied by the Company or any such Subsidiary in any manner which violates any applicable Environmental Law, except to the extent any such noncompliance or violation could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. To the best actual knowledge of any officer of the Company, no prior owner of any such property or any tenant, subtenant, prior tenant or prior subtenant have used Hazardous Materials on, from, or affecting such property in any manner which violates any applicable Environmental Law, except to the extent any such violation could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.
SECTION 3.10.
Insurance.

The excess of the present value of all projected benefit obligations under each Plan (based on the assumptions used for purposes of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87), as of the date of the most recent financial statements reflecting such amounts, over the fair market value of the assets of such Plan, if any, could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

ARTICLE VIII
 
The Agents
Each of the Lenders and the Issuing Bank hereby irrevocably appoints the Agents as its agents and authorizes the Agents to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Agents by the terms of the Loan Documents, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.
Any Person serving as an Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not an Agent, and such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage in any kind of business with the Company or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if it were not an Agent hereunder.
The Agents shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth in the Loan Documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a) the Agents shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing, (b) the Agents shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated by the Loan Documents that the Agents are required to exercise in writing as directed by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided in Section 11.02) and (c) except as expressly set forth in the Loan Documents, the Agents shall not have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Company or any of the Subsidiaries that is communicated to or obtained by them or any of their Affiliates in any capacity. The Agents shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by them with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided in Section 11.02) or in the absence of their own gross negligence or wilful misconduct. Each Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until written notice thereof is given to such Agent by the Company or a Lender, and the Agents shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with any Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered thereunder or in connection therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth in any Loan Document, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of any Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere in any Loan Document, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to such Agent.
Each Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or sent by the proper Person. Each Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to be made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. Each Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Company), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.
83
Each Agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by it. Each Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers through its respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of the preceding paragraphs and the provisions of Section 11.03 shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of each Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Agent.
Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Agent as provided in this paragraph, each Agent may resign at any time by notifying the other Agents, the Lenders, the Issuing Bank and the Company. Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders (in the case of a resignation by the Facility Agent) or the Facility Agent (in the case of a resignation by any other Agent) shall have the right, in consultation with the Company, to appoint a successor. If no successor Agent shall have been so appointed and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders and the Issuing Bank, appoint a successor Agent which shall be a bank with an office in New York, New York, or an Affiliate of any such bank. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Agent hereunder by a successor, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Agent, and the retiring Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder. The fees payable by the Company to a successor Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Company and such successor. After an Agent's resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article and Section 11.03 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while it was acting as Agent.
Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon any Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon any Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.
The parties agree that none of the Mandated Lead Arrangers and Joint Bookrunners or the Arrangers referred to on the cover page shall have any powers, duties or responsibilities under this Agreement or any other Loan Document, except in its capacity, as applicable, as an Agent, a Lender, the Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender hereunder.

ARTICLE IX
Collection Allocation Mechanism
On the CAM Exchange Date, (a) the Commitments shall automatically and without further act be terminated as provided in Article VII and (b) the Lenders shall automatically and without further act be deemed to have made reciprocal purchases of interests in the Specified Obligations such that, in lieu of the interests of each Lender in the particular Specified Obligations that it shall own as of such date and prior to the CAM Exchange, such Lender shall own an interest equal to such Lender's CAM Percentage in each Specified Obligation. Each Lender, each person acquiring a participation from any Lender as contemplated by Section 11.04 and each Borrower hereby consents and agrees to the CAM Exchange. Each Borrower and each Lender agrees from time to time to execute and deliver to the Agents all such promissory notes and other instruments and documents as the Facility Agent shall reasonably request to evidence and confirm the respective interests and obligations of the Lenders after giving effect to the CAM Exchange, and each Lender agrees to surrender any promissory notes originally received by it hereunder to the Facility Agent against delivery of any promissory notes so executed and delivered;
provided
that the failure of or any Borrower to execute or deliver or of any Lender to accept any such promissory note, instrument or document shall not affect the validity or effectiveness of the CAM Exchange.
As a result of the CAM Exchange, on and after the CAM Exchange Date, each payment received by an Agent pursuant to any Loan Document in respect of the Specified Obligations shall be distributed to the Lenders pro rata in accordance with their respective CAM Percentages (to be redetermined as of each such date of payment or distribution to the extent required by the next paragraph).
In the event that, on or after the CAM Exchange Date, the aggregate amount of the Specified Obligations shall change as a result of the making of an LC Disbursement by an Issuing Bank that is not reimbursed by the applicable Borrower, then (a) each US/European Tranche Lender, shall, in accordance with Section 2.05(d), promptly purchase from the applicable Issuing Bank a participation in such LC Disbursement in the amount of such Lender's US/European Tranche Percentage of such LC Disbursement (without giving effect to the CAM Exchange), (b) the Facility Agent shall redetermine the CAM Percentages after giving effect to such LC Disbursement and the purchase of participations therein by the applicable Lenders, and the Lenders shall automatically and without further act be deemed to have made reciprocal purchases of interests in the Specified Obligations such that each Lender shall own an interest equal to such Lender's CAM Percentage in each of the Specified Obligations and (c) in the event distributions shall have been made in accordance with the preceding paragraph, the Lenders shall make such payments to one another as shall be necessary in order that the amounts received by them shall be equal to the amounts they would have received had each LC Disbursement been outstanding on the CAM Exchange Date. Each such redetermination shall be binding on each of the Lenders and their successors and assigns and shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.
85
ARTICLE X
Guarantee
In order to induce the Lenders to extend credit to the other Borrowers hereunder, the Company hereby irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees, as a primary obligor and not merely as a surety, the payment when and as due of the Obligations of such other Borrowers. The Company further agrees that the due and punctual payment of such Obligations may be extended or renewed, in whole or in part, without notice to or further assent from it, and that it will remain bound upon its guarantee hereunder notwithstanding any such extension or renewal of any such Obligation.
The Company waives presentment to, demand of payment from and protest to any Borrower of any of the Obligations, and also waives notice of acceptance of its obligations and notice of protest for nonpayment. The obligations of the Company hereunder shall not be affected by (a) the failure of any Agent or Lender to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy against any Loan Party under the provisions of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or otherwise, (b) any extension or renewal of any of the Obligations, (c) any rescission, waiver, amendment or modification of, or release from, any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement, or any other Loan Document or agreement, (d) any default, failure or delay, wilful or otherwise, in the performance of any of the Obligations or (e) any other act, omission or delay to do any other act which may or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of the Company or otherwise operate as a discharge of a guarantor as a matter of law or equity or which would impair or eliminate any right of the Company to subrogation.
The Company further agrees that its agreement hereunder constitutes a guarantee of payment when due (whether or not any bankruptcy or similar proceeding shall have stayed the accrual or collection of any of the Obligations or operated as a discharge thereof) and not merely of collection, and waives any right to require that any resort be had by any Agent or Lender to any balance of any deposit account or credit on the books of any Agent or Lender in favor of any Borrower or any other Person.
The obligations of the Company hereunder shall not be subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination for any reason (other than the indefeasible payment in full of all the Obligations owned by the Company to the Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders), and shall not be subject to any defense or set-off, counterclaim, recoupment or termination whatsoever, by reason of the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of any of the Obligations, any impossibility in the performance of any of the Obligations or otherwise (other than for the indefeasible payment in full of all the Obligations owed by the Company to the Agents, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders).
86
The Company further agrees that its obligations hereunder shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of any Obligation is rescinded or must otherwise be restored by any Agent or Lender upon the bankruptcy or reorganization of any Borrower or otherwise.
In furtherance of the foregoing and not in limitation of any other right which any Agent or Lender may have at law or in equity against the Company by virtue hereof, upon the failure of any other Borrower to pay any Obligation when and as the same shall become due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, after notice of prepayment or otherwise, the Company hereby promises to and will, upon receipt of written demand by any Agent or Lender, forthwith pay, or cause to be paid, to the applicable Agent or Lender in cash an amount equal to the unpaid principal amount of such Obligations then due, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon. The Company further agrees that if payment in respect of any Obligation shall be due in a currency other than US Dollars and/or at a place of payment other than New York and if, by reason of any Change in Law, disruption of currency or foreign exchange markets, war or civil disturbance or other event, payment of such Obligation in such currency or at such place of payment shall be impossible or, in the reasonable judgment of any Agent or Lender, not consistent with the protection of its rights or interests, then, at the election of the Facility Agent, the Company shall make payment of such Obligation in US Dollars (based upon the applicable Exchange Rate in effect on the date of payment) and/or in New York, and shall indemnify each Agent and Lender against any losses or reasonable out-of-pocket expenses that it shall sustain as a result of such alternative payment.
Upon payment by the Company of any sums as provided above, all rights of the Company against any Borrower arising as a result thereof by way of right of subrogation or otherwise shall in all respects be subordinated and junior in right of payment to the prior indefeasible payment in full of all the Obligations owed by such Borrower to the Agents, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders.
Nothing shall discharge or satisfy the liability of the Company hereunder except the full performance and payment of the Obligations.

provided
that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence or wilful misconduct of such Indemnitee.
(c) To the extent that the Company fails to pay any amount required to be paid by it to any Agent, the Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section, each Lender severally agrees to pay to such Agent, the Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender, as the case may be, such Lender's pro rata share (determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such unpaid amount;

(D) the assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver to the Facility Agent an Administrative Questionnaire in which the assignee designates one or more credit contacts to whom all syndicate-level information (which may contain material non-public information about the Company and the Subsidiaries and its and their Related Parties or securities) will be made available and who may receive such information in accordance with the assignee's compliance procedures and applicable laws, including Federal and State securities laws.

Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this Section 11.04 shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph (c) of this Section.

provided
that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described in the first proviso to Section 11.02(b) that affects such Participant. Subject to paragraph (c)(ii) of this Section, the Company agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.14,
2.15, 2.16 and 2.19 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 11.08 as though it were a Lender;
provided
such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.17(c) as though it were a Lender.
93
(ii) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 2.14, 2.16 or 2.19 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Company's prior written consent. A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.16 unless such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Company, to comply with Section 2.16(e) as though it were a Lender.
(d) Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest;
provided
that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.

Environmental Compliance
Ann Arbor Groundwater Remediation
In February 1988, an action was filed in the Circuit Court for Washtenaw County, Michigan ("
Court
") by the State of Michigan ("
State
") against Gelman Sciences Inc. ("
Gelman
"), a subsidiary acquired by Pall Corporation (the "
Company
" or "
Pall
") in February 1997. The action sought to compel Gelman to investigate and remediate contamination near Gelman's Ann Arbor facility and requested reimbursement of costs the State had expended in investigating the contamination, which the State alleged was caused by Gelman's disposal of waste water from its manufacturing process. Pursuant to a consent judgment entered into by Gelman and the State in October 1992 (amended September 1996 and October 1999), which resolved that litigation, Gelman is remediating the contamination without admitting wrongdoing. In February 2000, the State Assistant Attorney General filed a Motion to Enforce Consent Judgment in the Court seeking approximately $4,900,000 in stipulated penalties for the alleged violations of the consent judgment and additional injunctive relief. Gelman disputed these assertions. Following an evidentiary hearing in July 2000, the Court took the matter of penalties "under advisement." The Court issued a Remediation Enforcement Order (the "
REO
") requiring Gelman to submit and implement a detailed plan that will reduce the contamination to acceptable levels within five years. Gelman's plan has been approved by both the Court and the State. Although Gelman has met monthly milestones established under the plan and although contaminant concentrations have been significantly reduced, groundwater concentrations remain above acceptable levels in much of the affected area. The Court, however, concluded that Gelman was in compliance with the terms the REO in a subsequent order issued in December 2004 (see below) and has expressed its satisfaction with Gelman's progress during hearings both before and after the five year period expired. Neither the State nor the Court has sought or suggested that Gelman should be penalized based on the continued presence of groundwater contamination at the site.
In February 2004, the Court instructed Gelman to submit its Final Feasibility Study describing how it intends to address an area of groundwater contamination not addressed by the previously approved plan. Gelman has submitted its Feasibility Study as instructed. The State also submitted its plan for remediating this area of contamination to the Court. On December 17, 2004, the Court issued its Order and Opinion Regarding Remediation and Contamination of the Unit E Aquifer (the "
Unit E Order
"). The Court adopted, with limited modifications, Gelman's remediation plan for this area of contamination. The Court also noted that Gelman was in compliance with the Court's previous REO. The State has not appealed the Unit E Order. Gelman is now in the process of implementing the requirements of the Order.
In correspondence dated June 5, 2001, the State asserted that additional stipulated penalties in the amount of $142,000 were owed for a separate alleged violation of the consent judgment. The Court found that a "substantial basis" for Gelman's position existed and again took the State's request "under advisement", pending the results of certain groundwater monitoring data. Those data have been submitted to the Court, but
no ruling has been issued. On August 9,2001, the State made a written demand for reimbursement of $227,000 it has allegedly incurred for groundwater monitoring. Gelman considers this claim barred by the consent judgment.
 
2
On May 12, 2004, the City of Ann Arbor (the "
City
") filed a lawsuit against Gelman in Washtenaw County Circuit Court. The City's suit seeks damages, including the cost of replacing a municipal water supply well allegedly affected by the 1,4-dioxane groundwater contamination, as well as injunctive relief in the form of an order requiring Gelman to remediate the soil and groundwater beneath the City. The contaminant levels allegedly detected in the municipal well at issue, however, are well below applicable cleanup standards and Gelman will vigorously defend against the claim.
By Order dated July 19, 2005, the Court granted Gentian's motion for partial summary disposition, in part, dismissing two of the City's three common law claims. In December 2005, Gelman filed two motions for partial summary disposition seeking dismissal of the City's claims for injunctive relief and the majority of its monetary claims. The City filed a motion for summary disposition with regard to Gelman's liability under state statute. Rather than hear the motions, the Court ordered the parties into settlement facilitation. The facilitation period was recently extended to allow the parties to continue these settlement negotiations. To accommodate the facilitation, the trial in this matter has been rescheduled to late November, 2006.
On June 25, 2004, the Company was sued in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan by a private plaintiff in connection with the groundwater contamination. The complaint seeks both money damages and injunctive relief requiring remediation of the contamination. The plaintiff also seeks to represent a larger class of property owners and residents who plaintiff claims are affected by the groundwater contamination. On August 25, 2004, the Company filed a motion for summary judgment seeking to dismiss the plaintiffs claims. In response, plaintiffs counsel sought and was granted permission to amend the complaint. An amended complaint was filed on November 17, 2004, which added seven plaintiffs. The Company renewed its motion for summary judgment on December 27, 2004, asserting various grounds for dismissing the complaint as to each plaintiff. As ordered by the Court, the Company withdrew its motion to allow plaintiffs an opportunity to further amend its complaint and conduct limited discovery. Plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint on March 9, 2005, adding two claims under the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ("
RCRA
"). Discovery on specific issues related to the seven plaintiffs has been completed, and on October 17, 2005, the Company renewed for a third time its motion for summary judgment, asserting that none of the plaintiffs have established claims under any of the counts alleged, including RCRA. By order dated January 30, 2006, the Court granted the Company's motion and dismissed the entire case. The period for filing an appeal by right has expired.
On August 10, 2005, the City filed a lawsuit against Gelman under the Federal Superfund Statute ("CERCLA") for recovery of the City's alleged response costs, including well replacement costs. The City is seeking in this matter essentially the same relief it is seeking in the above-described state court action. In October, 2005, Gelman
filed a Motion for Stay, seeking to stay these federal proceedings pending resolution of the parallel state court action. The City subsequently filed a motion for summary judgment regarding Gelman's liability under CERCLA. The parties have agreed to include this matter in the settlement facilitation ordered by the state court and to stay this matter pending the outcome of the facilitation process. The parties have been informed that the Court will place this action on "administrative leave" without prejudice to the City's right to restart the litigation if the matter is not resolved through the facilitation process.
 
3
A local resident and the City of Ann Arbor filed petitions for a contested case on November 26, 2005 and November 30, 2005, respectively. The petitions challenge various aspects of the discharge permit issued to Gelman by the State on September 30, 2005. The petitions commence an administrative adjudicative hearing, which can result in changes to the discharge permit. The Company does not believe there is substantive merit to the claims made in either petition. The Administrative Law Judge has consolidated both petitions into one proceeding. The Administrative Law Judge has also stayed this proceeding to allow the City and Gelman to attempt to resolve this matter through the facilitative process described above. No damages are being sought in this proceeding.
Hauppauge, New York
On December 3, 2004, a third-party action was commenced against the Company in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York in connection with ground water contamination. Plaintiff Anwar Chitayat ("
Chitayat
") seeks recovery against defendants Vanderbilt Associates and Walter Gross for environmental costs allegedly incurred, and to be incurred, in connection with the disposal of hazardous substances from property located in Hauppauge, New York (the "
Site
"). The Site is a property located in the same industrial park as a Company facility. Walter Gross claims that the Company is responsible for releasing hazardous substances into the soil and groundwater at its property which then migrated to the Site. Walter Gross seeks indemnification and contribution under Section 113 CERCLA from third-party defendants in the event he is found liable to Chitayat. The plaintiff has moved to amend his complaint to add a claim for contribution under Section 113 of CERCLA against the Company, and the Company is opposing this proposed amendment.
This action is in the fact discovery phase. Written interrogatories and responses, and documents, have been exchanged by the parties and some depositions have been held. Additional depositions have been noticed and others are expected. Recently, third party plaintiff Walter Gross died, and the court has ordered a stay of all proceedings until his estate is substituted as a party.
Pinellas Park
In 1995, as part of facility closure, an environmental site assessment was conducted to evaluate any soil and groundwater impacts from chemicals that may have been used at the Pinellas Park facility during the previous 24-year period of
manufacturing and testing operations conducted at the facility. MIBK (methyl isobutyl ketone) concentrations in groundwater were found to be higher than regulatory levels. Soil excavation was conducted in 1998 and subsequent groundwater sampling in the bubble point area showed MIBK concentrations below the regulatory level.
 
4
In October 2000, environmental consultants for a prospective buyer of the property found groundwater contamination in excess of regulatory levels outside the building, but on Pall's property. The contamination in the groundwater consisted of chlorinated solvents (perchloroethylene, trichloroethylene) and their breakdown products (cis-l,2-dichloroethene, trans-1,2-dichloroethene, vinyl chloride) in excess of regulatory levels. In October 2001, a Site Assessment Report (SAR) was submitted to the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP), which showed details of contamination locations and concentrations.
In July, 2002 a Supplemental Contamination Assessment Plan (SCAP) and an Interim Remedial Action Plan (IRAP) were prepared by Pall's consultants/contractors and submitted to FDEP. A revised IRAP was submitted by Pall in December, 2003, and it was accepted by the FDEP in January, 2004. A Remedial Action Plan (RAP) was submitted in June, 2004, and it was approved by the FDEP in August 2004. Work pursuant to this RAP began in September 2004 and is continuing. The Company has completed all of the on-site injections relative the clean-up and is currently engaged in on-site monitoring. The Company continues to keep the FDEP updated on its progress in implementing the RAP. FDEP has asked the company to investigate the off-site contamination. A consultant has been hired to delineate the vertical and horizontal extend of contamination migrated to the off-site property. An off-site investigation Work Plan has been prepared and submitted to FDEP.
30 Sea Cliff
In 1994, the Nassau County Department of Public Works submitted to the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) a Preliminary Site Assessment (PSA) for the Sea Cliff Industrial Area. This PSA evaluated several properties, including Pall's 30 Sea Cliff Avenue site. The PSA indicated groundwater contamination consisting of chlorinated solvents at a site operated by Photocircuits Corporation located across Sea Cliff Avenue and upgradient to the Pall facility, and later reports found both shallow and intermediate zone contamination at that site. In 1999, Pall entered into an Order on Consent with NYSDEC pursuant to which it completed a Phase II Remedial Investigation at the 30 Sea Cliff Avenue site.
NYSDEC finalized the Record of Decision (ROD) for the shallow and intermediate groundwater zone on the Pall site termed Operable Unit 1 ("") in March 2004. Pall signed an Order on Consent for OU-1 effective July 5, 2004. This Order, among other things, requires Pall to submit a Remedial Design/Remedial Action Work Plan after it has completed the ongoing Phase II Pilot Test using injections of Fenton's Reagent to the groundwater.
OU-1
 
5
The remedial investigation of the deeper groundwater zone (more than 60 feet below ground surface) ("
OU-2
") at the Pall site has not yet commenced. Issuance of the ROD for OU-2 will not occur until after a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study ("
RI/FS
") of the deep groundwater has been completed. Pall initiated discussions with Photocircuits regarding entering into a joint OU-2 Order on Consent for a deep groundwater investigation on both the Photocircuits and Pall sites; however, since then, Photocircuits has filed for bankruptcy. NYSDEC has indicated that it intends to undertake the OU-2 investigation at the Photocircuits site using State funds. NYSDEC has requested Pall to enter into an RI/FS Order for the Pall site, but Pall has not taken any action relative to OU-2 at this time.
Rosen Site
Rosen is a USEPA Superfund Site. The USEPA named several Potentially Responsible Parties ("
PRP
") to clean up the site and the PRP's in turn brought a civil action against Pall Trinity Micro Corp. and others to participate in the site clean up
(Cooper vs Agway).
In conjunction with settling the
Cooper v. Asway
private-party litigation, Pall and the nine other defendants entered into a Consent Decree with the USEPA to complete the site remedial tasks required by USEPA in its Record of Decision. At the time of the Consent Decree, the settling defendant group's consultants estimated future site costs at approximately $2,000,000. That Group determined to allocate those costs per capita among the 10 parties, which came to an estimated $200,000 per party, exclusive of legal fees. In August 2001, Pall was able to finalize a settlement of its insurance claims against Aetna/Travelers for $200,000. Work under the Consent Decree was largely completed in late 2002. Pall has paid in more than was estimated at the time of the Consent Decree, due to EPA-mandated cost increases and the bankruptcy filing of one of the settling defendants (Agway). Remaining Group costs to Pall are not currently expected to exceed $50,000 (including net recovery from non-participants).

Mandatory Costs Rate
1. The Mandatory Costs Rate is an addition to the interest rate to compensate Lenders for the cost of compliance with (a) the requirements of the Bank of England and/or the Financial Services Authority (or, in either case, any other authority which replaces all or any of its functions) or (b) the requirements of the European Central Bank.
2. On the first day of each Interest Period
6
(or as soon as possible thereafter) the London Agent shall calculate a rate (the "
Additional Costs Rate
"), expressed as a percentage, for each Lender, in accordance with the paragraphs set out below. The Mandatory Costs Rate will be calculated by the London Agent as a weighted average of the Lenders' Additional Costs Rates (weighted in proportion to the percentage participation of each Lender in the applicable Borrowing) and will be expressed as a percentage rate per annum.
3. The Additional Costs Rate for any Lender lending from a Lending Office located in a Participating Member State will be the percentage notified by that Lender to the London Agent. This percentage will be certified by that Lender in its notice to the London Agent to be its reasonable determination of the cost (expressed as a percentage of that Lender's participation in all Loans made from such Lending Office) of complying with the minimum reserve requirements of the European Central Bank in respect of Loans made from such Lending Office.
4. The Additional Costs Rate for any Lender lending from a Lending Office in the United Kingdom will be calculated by the London Agent as follows:
(a) with respect to any Loan denominated in Sterling:
 
(b) with respect to any Loan denominated in any currency (other than Sterling):
 
Where:
"
A
" means the percentage of Eligible Liabilities (assuming these to be in excess of any stated minimum) which that Lender is from time to time required to maintain as an interest free cash ratio deposit with the Bank of England to comply with cash ratio requirements.
 
______________

Clifford Chance: Please advise as to what is the convention as to when Additional Costs Rate is calculated for ABR loans made by UK or European Lender (taking into account that ABR loans do not have an Interest Period).

"
B
" means the percentage rate of interest (excluding the Applicable Margin and the Mandatory Costs Rate and, if the Loan was not paid when due, the additional rate of interest specified in Section 2.12(d)) payable for the applicable Interest Period on the Loan.
"
C
" means the percentage (if any) of Eligible Liabilities which that Lender is required from time to time to maintain as interest bearing Special Deposits with the Bank of England.
"
D
" means the percentage rate per annum payable by the Bank of England to the London Agent on interest bearing Special Deposits.
"
E
" is designed to compensate Lenders for amounts payable under the Fees Rules and is calculated by the London Agent as being the average of the most recent rates of charge supplied by the Reference Banks to the London Agent pursuant to paragraph 7 below and expressed in Sterling per 1,000,000.
5. For the purposes of this Schedule:
(a) "
Eligible Liabilities
" and "
Special Deposits
" have the meanings given to them from time to time under or pursuant to the Bank of England Act 1998 or (as may be appropriate) by the Bank of England.
(b) "
Fees Rules
" means the rules on periodic fees contained in the Financial Services Authority Supervision Manual or such other law or regulation as may be in force from time to time in respect of the payment of fees for the acceptance of deposits.
(c) "
Fee Tariffs
" means the fee tariffs specified in the Fees Rules under the activity group A.1 Deposit acceptors (ignoring any minimum fee or zero rated fee required pursuant to the Fees Rules but taking into account any applicable discount rate).
(d) "
Participating Member State
" means any member state of the European Communities that adopts or has adopted the Euro as its lawful currency in accordance with legislation of the European Community relating to Economic and Monetary Union.
(e) "
Tariff Base
" has the meaning given to it in, and will be calculated in accordance with, the Fees Rules.
6. In application of the above formulae, A, B, C and D will be included in the formulae as percentages (
i.e.
5% will be included in the formula as 5 and not as 0.05). A negative result obtained by subtracting D from B shall be taken as zero. The resulting figures shall be rounded to four decimal places.
3
7. If requested by the London Agent, each Reference Bank shall, as soon as practicable after publication by the Financial Services Authority, supply to the London Agent, the rate of charge payable by that Reference Bank to the Financial Services Authority pursuant to the Fees Rules in respect of the relevant financial year of the Financial Services Authority (calculated for this purpose by that Reference Bank as being the average of the Fee Tariffs applicable to that Reference Bank for that financial year) and expressed in Sterling per 1,000,000 of the Tariff Base of that Reference Bank.
8. Each Lender shall supply any information required by the London Agent for the purpose of calculating its Additional Costs Rate. In particular, but without limitation, each Lender shall supply the following information on or prior to the date on which it becomes a Lender:
(a) the jurisdiction of its applicable Lending Office; and
(b) any other information that the London Agent may reasonably require for such purpose.
Each Lender shall promptly notify the London Agent of any change to the information provided by it pursuant to this paragraph.
9. The percentages of each Lender for the purpose of A and C above and the rates of charge of each Reference Bank for the purpose of E above shall be determined by the London Agent based upon the information supplied to it pursuant to paragraphs 7 and 8 above and on the assumption that, unless a Lender notifies the London Agent to the contrary, each Lender's obligations in relation to cash ratio deposits and Special Deposits are the same as those of a typical bank from its jurisdiction of incorporation with a Lending Office in the same jurisdiction as its applicable Lending Office.
10. The London Agent shall have no liability to any person if such determination results in an Additional Costs Rate which over or under compensates any Lender and shall be entitled to assume that the information provided by any Lender or Reference Bank pursuant to paragraphs 3, 7 and 8 above is true and correct in all respects.
11. The London Agent shall distribute the additional amounts received as a result of the Mandatory Costs Rate to the Lenders on the basis of the Additional Costs Rate for each Lender based on the information provided by each Lender and each Reference Bank pursuant to paragraphs 3, 7 and 8 above.
12. Any determination by the London Agent pursuant to this Schedule in relation to a formula, the Mandatory Costs Rate, an Additional Costs Rate or any amount payable to a Lender shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive and binding.
4
13.      The London Agent may from time to time, after consultation with the Borrower and the Lenders, determine and notify to all parties any amendments which are required to be made to this Schedule in order to comply with any change in law, regulation or any requirements from time to time imposed by the Bank of England, the Financial Services Authority or the European Central Bank (or, in any case, any other authority which replaces all or any of its functions) and any such determination shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive and binding.

Form of Effective Global Rate Letter

[Date]
[French Borrowers]
For the attention of [authorised representative]
Dear Sir,
We refer to the Credit Agreement dated as of June [ - ], 2006 (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified in writing from time to time, the "
Credit Agreement
") among the Company, certain Subsidiaries of the Company party thereto, the Lenders party thereto, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as the Facility Agent and J. P. Morgan Europe Limited, as London Agent. Terms defined in the Credit Agreement shall have the same meaning in this notice.
This is the letter referred to in Section 11.18 of the Credit Agreement.
The variable nature of the interest rate applicable to the Loans makes it impossible to specify a taux effectif global applicable for the duration of the Credit Agreement.
However, in order to meet the requirements of of Articles L313-1 et seq, R 313-1 and R313-2 of the French Code de la Consommation and in accordance with the provisions of Section 11.18 of the Credit Agreement, we set out below an indicative calculation of the taux effectif global, based on the assumptions set out in this letter.
Assumed Applicable Rate:
 
Based on the assumptions set out above (and including all fees and expenses relating to the Loans), the interest rate (taux de priode) for an Interest Period (dure de priode) of [to be completed by the London Agent] months would be [to be completed by the London Agent] % per annum and the effective global rate (taux effectif global annuel) would be [to be completed by the London Agent] % per annum.
The calculations set out in this letter are for illustrative purposes only and shall not bind the parties to the Credit Agreement. Nothing expressed or implied in this letter constitutes any commitment on the part of any of the London Agent.
Yours sincerely

J. P. MORGAN EUROPE LIMITED
