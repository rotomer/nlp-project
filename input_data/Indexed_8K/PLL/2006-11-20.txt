(b) SPECIAL MEETINGS OF SHAREHOLDERS. Only such business shall be conducted at a special meeting of shareholders as shall have been brought before the meeting pursuant to the corporation's notice of meeting. Nominations of persons for election to the board of directors may be made at a special meeting of shareholders at which directors are to be elected pursuant to the corporation's notice of meeting (i) by or at the direction of the board of directors; or (ii) provided that the board of directors has determined that directors shall be elected at such meeting, by any shareholder who (A) is a shareholder of record at the time of giving of notice provided for in this Section and at the time of the special meeting; (B) is entitled to vote at the meeting; and (C) complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section. If the corporation calls a special meeting of shareholders for the purpose of electing one or more directors to the board of directors, any shareholder may nominate a person or persons for election to such position(s) as may be specified in the corporation's notice of such special meeting, if the shareholder's notice required by this Section shall be received by the secretary of the corporation at the principal executive offices of the corporation not later than the close of business on the later of the 90th day prior to such special meeting and the 10th day following the day on which public announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting. (c) GENERAL. (i) Only persons nominated in accordance with these by-laws shall be eligible to serve as directors and only such business shall be conducted at a meeting of shareholders as shall have been brought before the meeting in accordance with this Section.

(ii) If the shareholder (or a qualified representative of the shareholder) does not appear at the applicable annual or special meeting to present an item of business or nomination, such item of business shall not be transacted at such meeting, and such nomination shall be disregarded, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote may have been received by the corporation. To be considered a qualified representative of the shareholder, a person must be authorized by a writing executed by such shareholder or an electronic transmission delivered by such shareholder to act for such shareholder as proxy at the meeting and such person must produce such writing or electronic transmission, or a reliable reproduction thereof, at the meeting. -5-

(iv) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of these by-laws, a shareholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set forth in this by-law. Nothing herein shall be deemed to affect any right of shareholders to request inclusion of proposals in the corporation's proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act. ARTICLE III BOARD OF DIRECTORS SECTION 3.01 NUMBER AND QUALIFICATIONS. Effective November 14, 2006, and until further action by the board of directors as hereinafter in this paragraph authorized, the number of directors of the corporation shall be eleven. The board of directors is hereby authorized to increase or decrease the number of directors at any time and from time to time by amendment of these by-laws, subject to the maximum and minimum number of directors specified in the certificate of incorporation. Each director shall be at least 18 years of age; directors need not be shareholders. An amendment of the by-laws to change the number of directors requires the vote of a majority of the entire board. As used in this paragraph, "entire board" means the total number of directors the corporation would have if there were no vacancies. No decrease in the number of directors shall shorten the term of any incumbent director. If the number of directors is increased, the additional directors may be elected by a majority of the directors in office at the time of the increase, or if not so elected prior to the next annual meeting of the shareholders, they shall be elected thereat by the shareholders. So long as the board of directors is classified, any increase or decrease in the number of directors and any election of directors by the board pursuant to this paragraph shall comply with the provisions of Section 3.06 hereof. -6-
SECTION 3.02 POWERS. The business of the corporation shall be managed under the direction of the board of directors, which shall have and may exercise all of the powers of the corporation except such as are expressly conferred upon the shareholders by law, by the certificate of incorporation or by these by-laws. SECTION 3.03 REGULAR MEETINGS. Regular meetings of the board of directors may be held without call or formal notice at such places either within or without the State of New York and at such times as the board may from time to time by vote determine. A regular meeting of the board of directors for the election of officers and for such other business as may come before the meeting may be held without call or formal notice immediately after, and at the same place as, the annual meeting of shareholders or any special meeting of shareholders at which a board of directors is elected. SECTION 3.04 SPECIAL MEETINGS. Special meetings of the board of directors may be held at any place either within or without the State of New York at any time when called by the chief executive officer or secretary or a majority of the directors, written notice of the time and place thereof having been given to each director as follows: (a) by delivering a copy of such notice to the director personally no later than the second day preceding the date of the meeting, or (b) by sending a copy of such notice addressed to the director at his or her mailing address as it appears on the books of the corporation, such notice to be sent no less than ten days before the date of the meeting if sent by ordinary mail or no later than the third business day before the date of the meeting if sent by overnight mail or by a courier service (such as Federal Express) which guarantees next day delivery, or (c) by transmitting such notice to the director by telecopier or e-mail (to a telecopier number or e-mail address which has been furnished by him or her to the secretary of the corporation) no later than the second business day preceding the date of the meeting. SECTION 3.05 QUORUM. A majority of the entire board shall constitute a quorum of the board of directors for the transaction of any business but a lesser number may adjourn any meeting. As used in the preceding sentence, "entire board" means the total number of directors which the corporation would have if there were no vacancies. A quorum of any committee shall be a majority of the members thereof except that any committee may, by unanimous action, determine that a lesser number of members (not less than half) shall constitute a quorum. A majority of the members in attendance at any meeting shall, except where a larger number is required by law, by the certificate of incorporation or by these by-laws, decide any question brought before such meeting. -7-
SECTION 3.06 CLASSIFICATION OF DIRECTORS. Upon election of directors at the annual meeting of shareholders in 1971, the board of directors shall be divided into three classes, as nearly equal in number as possible, and no class shall include less than three directors. The terms of office of the directors initially classified shall be as follows: that of the first class shall expire at the next annual meeting of shareholders in 1972, the second class at the annual meeting next following July 31, 1973 and the third class at the annual meeting next following July 31, 1974. At each annual meeting after such initial classification and election in 1971, directors to replace those whose terms expire at such annual meeting shall be elected to hold office until the third succeeding annual meeting after their election. If after the initial classification of directors the number of directors is changed: (a) Any newly created directorships or any decrease in directorships shall be so apportioned among the classes as to make all classes as nearly equal in number as possible; and (b) When the number of directors is increased by the board and any newly created directorships are filled by the board, there shall be no classification of the additional directors until the next annual meeting of shareholders. SECTION 3.07 ACTION BY THE BOARD WITHOUT A MEETING. Any action required or permitted to be taken by the board or any committee thereof may be taken without a meeting if all members of the board or the committee consent in writing to the adoption of a resolution authorizing the action. The resolution and the written consents thereto by the members of the board or committee shall be filed with the minutes of the proceedings of the board or committee. SECTION 3.08 PARTICIPATION IN MEETINGS BY TELEPHONE. Any one or more members of the board or any committee thereof may participate in a meeting of such board or committee by means of a conference telephone or similar communications equipment allowing all persons participating in the meeting to hear each other at the same time. Participation by such means shall constitute presence in person at a meeting but the board may, by resolution, provide that directors participating in a meeting other than by being present in person shall receive lesser compensation than directors present at the meeting in person. -8-
SECTION 3.09 BOARD COMMITTEES. There may be an Audit Committee, a Compensation Committee, a Nominating/Governance Committee and an Executive Committee, each consisting of not less than three directors appointed by the board, each of which Committees may meet from time to time on notice to all members thereof by any member thereof.

The Compensation Committee shall have the power and duty to fix the compensation of the Elected Officers (as defined in Section 4.01(a) (i) hereof) and to authorize and approve the making of employment contracts between the corporation and its Elected Officers and shall have such other powers and duties as may be assigned to it by resolution of the board of directors. Effective November 21, 1995, the Compensation Committee shall also have, with respect to each Stock Option Plan of the corporation, the powers and duties which, by the terms of such Plan, are delegated to and imposed upon the Committee administering such Plan, irrespective of whether the Plan denominates such Committee as the Stock Option Committee or the Compensation Committee. In addition, any Management Employee Benefit Plan (as hereinafter defined) which would otherwise require board of director approval ("otherwise" meaning by virtue of a legal requirement imposed by or arising from any source other than these by-laws) shall be within the jurisdiction of the Compensation Committee; the adoption, amendment or termination of any such plan shall require the approval of the Compensation Committee and, except as limited by Business Corporation Law ss. 712 or any other statutory or regulatory provision, action by the Compensation Committee shall be deemed action by the board of directors for all purposes. As used herein, the term "Management Employee Benefit Plan" shall mean any employee benefit plan or arrangement as to which Elected Officers and Operating Committee Members (as those terms are defined in Section 4.01 (a)(i) and (ii)) collectively constitute 15% or more of those eligible to participate in or under such plan or arrangement. -9-

The Committee shall also have the power and duty to study and make recommendations to the board and/or management with respect to corporate governance issues, including (i) the organization, practices and performance of the board and its committees, including the board meeting schedule, its agenda and the information furnished to the board, and (ii) the performance of directors in both their board and any executive capacity with the company, as well as the corporation's executive resources and management development and succession plans. The Committee shall also have the authority to identify, evaluate and monitor significant public policy issues, to review the corporation's policies and practices with respect to such issues to ensure that they are consistent with its social responsibility and to recommend to the full board policies and strategies concerning such issues. The Committee shall report to the board periodically on its work and its recommendations to the board and management arising therefrom. The Committee shall also have such other powers and duties as shall be assigned to it by resolution of the board from time to time. (d) EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE. The executive committee may consult with and advise the officers of the corporation in the management of its business and, when the board of directors is not in session, shall have all the authority of the board, except with respect to those matters as to which Section 712 of the Business Corporation Law withholds authority from any committee of the board. It may meet from time to time on notice to all by any one of their own number. -10-

ARTICLE VII INDEMNIFICATION SECTION 7.01 INDEMNIFICATION BY THE CORPORATION. The corporation shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, indemnify any person made or threatened to be made a party to any action or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (and whether or not (i) by or in the right of the corporation to procure a judgment in its favor or (ii) by or in the right of any Other Entity (as defined below) which such person served in any capacity at the request of the corporation, to procure a judgment in its favor), -16-
by reason of the fact that such person, or his or her testator or intestate, is or was a director or officer of the corporation or served such Other Entity in any capacity at the request of the corporation, against all judgments, fines, amounts paid in settlement and all expenses, including attorneys' and other experts' fees, costs and disbursements, actually and reasonably incurred by such person as a result of such action or proceeding, or any appeal therein, or actually and reasonably incurred by such person (a) in making an application for payment of such expenses before any court or other governmental body, or (b) in otherwise seeking to enforce the provisions of this Section 7.01, or (c) in securing or enforcing such person's rights under any policy of director or officer liability insurance provided by the corporation, if such person acted in good faith, for a purpose which he or she reasonably believed to be in, or, in the case of services for any Other Entity, not opposed to, the best interests of the corporation and, in criminal actions or proceedings, in addition, had no reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action or proceeding by judgment, settlement, conviction or upon a plea of nolo contendere, or its equivalent, shall not in itself create a presumption that such person did not act in good faith, for a purpose which he or she reasonably believed to be in, or, in the case of service for any Other Entity, not opposed to, the best interests of the corporation or that he or she had reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful. However, (i) no indemnification may be made to or on behalf of any such person if a judgment or other final adjudication adverse to such person establishes that his or her acts were committed in bad faith or were the result of active and deliberate dishonesty and were material to the cause of action so adjudicated, or that he or she personally gained in fact a financial profit or other advantage to which he or she was not legally entitled; (ii) no indemnification may be made if there has been a settlement approved by the court and the indemnification would be inconsistent with any condition with respect to indemnification expressly imposed by the court in approving the settlement; and (iii) in the event of a proceeding by or in the right of the corporation to procure a judgment in its favor, no indemnification may be made if it is settled or otherwise disposed of or such person shall have been finally adjudged liable to the corporation, unless (and only to the extent that) the court in which the action was brought, or if no action was brought, any court of competent jurisdiction, determines upon application that, in view of all circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such portion of the settlement amount and expenses as the court deems proper. -17-
Any expense described in the first paragraph of this Section 7.01 that is incurred by any person entitled to indemnification under this Section 7.01 shall be paid or reimbursed to such person by the corporation in advance of the final disposition of any related action or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such person to repay such amount to the corporation to the extent, if any, that such person (i) is ultimately found not to be entitled to indemnification or (ii) receives reimbursement for such expenses under a policy of insurance paid for by the corporation. Such advances shall be paid by the corporation to such person within twenty days following delivery of a written request therefor by such person to the corporation. No payment made by the corporation pursuant to this paragraph shall be deemed or construed to relieve the issuer of any insurance policy of any obligation or liability which, but for such payment, such insurer would have to the corporation or to any director or officer of the corporation or other individual to whom or on whose behalf such payment is made by the corporation. The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by this Section 7.01: (i) shall continue as to the person entitled to indemnification hereunder even though he or she may have ceased to serve in the capacity that entitles him or her to indemnification at the time of the action or proceeding and (ii) shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such person. A person who has been successful, on the merits or otherwise, in the defense of a civil or criminal action or proceeding of the character described in this Section 7.01 shall be entitled to (i.e., has a legally binding right against the corporation to) the indemnification authorized by this Section 7.01. Except as provided in the immediately preceding sentence, any indemnification provided for in this Section 7.01 (unless ordered by a court under Section 724 of the Business Corporation Law), shall be made by the corporation only if authorized in the specific case: (1) By the board of directors acting by a quorum consisting of directors who are not parties to such action or proceeding for which indemnification is sought, upon a finding that the person seeking indemnification has met the standard of conduct set forth in the first two paragraphs of this Section 7.01, or, -18-
(2) If a quorum under the immediately preceding subparagraph is not obtainable or, even if obtainable, a quorum of disinterested directors so directs: (A) by the board upon the opinion in writing of independent legal counsel that indemnification is proper in the circumstances because the applicable standard of conduct set forth in said first two paragraphs has been met by such person, or (B) by the shareholders upon a finding that the person has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in said first two paragraphs. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, no amendment or repeal of this Section 7.01, or any other corporate action or agreement which prohibits or otherwise limits the right of any person to indemnification or advancement or reimbursement of reasonable expenses hereunder, shall be effective as to any person until the 60th day following notice to such person of such action, and no such amendment or repeal or other corporate action or agreement shall deprive any person of any right hereunder arising out of any alleged or actual act or omission occurring prior to such 60th day. The corporation is hereby authorized, but shall not be required, to enter into agreements with any of its directors, officers or employees providing for rights to indemnification and advancement and reimbursement of reasonable expenses, including attorneys' fees, to the extent permitted by law, but the corporation's failure to do so shall not in any manner affect or limit the rights provided for by this Section 7.01 or otherwise. For purposes of this Section 7.01, the term "the corporation" shall include any legal successor to the corporation, including any corporation which acquires all or substantially all of the assets of the corporation in one or more transactions, and the term "Other Entity" shall mean a corporation (other than the corporation) of any type or kind, domestic or foreign, or any partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise. For purposes of this Section 7.01, the corporation shall be deemed to have requested a person to serve an employee benefit plan where the performance by such person of his or her duties to the corporation or any subsidiary thereof also imposes duties on, or otherwise involves services by, such person to the plan or participants or beneficiaries of the plan; excise taxes assessed on a person with respect to an employee benefit plan pursuant to applicable law shall be considered fines; and action taken or omitted by a person with respect to any employee benefit plan in the performance of such person's duties for a purpose reasonably believed by such person to be in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of the plan shall be deemed to be for a purpose which is not opposed to the best interests of the corporation. -19-
SECTION 7.02 NON-EXCLUSIVITY. The rights granted pursuant to or provided by the provisions of Section 7.01 to any person shall be in addition to and shall not be exclusive of any other rights to indemnification and expenses to which any such person may otherwise be entitled by law, contract or otherwise. ARTICLE VIII AMENDMENTS SECTION 8.01 BY SHAREHOLDERS. The shareholders may make, amend and repeal the by-laws of the corporation at any annual meeting or at any special meeting called for the purpose. SECTION 8.02 BY DIRECTORS. Subject to the provisions of Section 8.03 hereof, the board of directors shall have power to make, amend and repeal the by-laws of the corporation, by the vote of a majority of the entire board (as the term "entire board" is defined in Section 3.01 hereof and in Business Corporation Law Section 702), at any regular or special meeting of the board. SECTION 8.03 BY SHAREHOLDERS ONLY. The board of directors shall have no power to amend or repeal any of the provisions of Sections 2.02, 2.03, 2.04, or this Section 8.03, and any such provisions may be amended or repealed only in the manner provided in Section 8.01. Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, the board of directors may amend this Section 8.03 if the sole effect of such amendment is to add to the list of the provisions which may only be amended in the manner set forth in Section 8.01. -20-
