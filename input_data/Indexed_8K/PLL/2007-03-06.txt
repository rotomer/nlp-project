March 1, 2007 (EAST HILLS, NY)  Pall Corporation (NYSE: PLL) today reported sales and earnings results for the second quarter ended January 31, 2007.
Sales for the quarter were $544.9 million, up 13.9% compared with the second quarter last year. Diluted earnings per share ("EPS") were $0.45, up from $0.26 a year ago. Net earnings were $55.8 million compared to $32.4 million a year ago. EPS on a pro forma basis, excluding items principally related to the Company's cost reduction initiatives, were $0.43 per share as compared to $0.28 per share in the same quarter last year.
For the six months ended January 31, 2007, sales were $1.04 billion, an increase of 14.8% over the prior year. Net earnings were $80.2 million, or $0.64 per share compared to $0.46 last year. Earnings on a pro forma basis, excluding charges principally related to the Company's cost reduction initiatives, were $0.71 per share as compared to $0.48 per share in the same period last year.
"Sales growth was strong in Industrial and Life Sciences driven by our Total Fluid Management' strategy and leading position in fast-growing markets. Improvements in productivity and our well-established cost reduction initiatives were the real stars of the quarter. Our six month operating profit growth of 33% demonstrates that Pall is successfully executing its profit improvement efforts," said Eric Krasnoff, Chairman and CEO.

Income Statement Discussion
At constant exchange rates, sales increased $43.9 million, or 9.2%, in the quarter and $103.2 million, or 11.3%, during the six months. The impact of foreign currency translation increased the reported sales growth to $66.5 million, or 13.9%, for the quarter, and $134.6 million, or 14.8%, for the first six months. The impact of foreign currency translation increased EPS by $0.01 in the quarter and for the six months.
Mr. Krasnoff added, "Results for the second quarter indicate that gross margins are now beginning to stabilize, reflecting top-line leverage and our cost reduction initiatives. System sales were up 36% in the quarter. Profitability of systems is improving as our cost reduction and rationalization initiatives gain traction. We are on track to see significant gross margin expansion in fiscal 2008.
Selling, general and administrative ("S,G&A") expenses again decreased as a percentage of sales, falling to 30.9% in the quarter. This continues a long-term improving trend."

Life Sciences  Second Quarter Summary
Highlights of the Quarter:
BioPharmaceuticals sales reflect the continued adoption of Pall technologies throughout the fast-growing biotechnology and vaccine industries.
Medical sales increased driven by new blood center customers and new products and applications for the blood business; and growth in the Hospital and BioSciences markets. Laboratory products posted growth of over 11% on top of strong performance in the same quarter last year.
Gross margin improved to 50% compared with 49.3% last year. S,G&A improved to 28.8% as a percentage of sales. Operating profit increased 34% to $37 million and operating margin improved to 17.5% from 14.7% last year.
The backlog in Life Sciences increased 14% compared to a year ago, with strong growth in the BioSciences and BioPharmaceuticals markets.
Industrial  Second Quarter Summary
 
EXHIBIT 99
Highlights of the Quarter:
General Industrial systems sales growth in the Municipal Water and energy markets was particularly strong.
Microelectronics sales continue to benefit from our strategic diversification into the consumer side of the electronics market. Sales in Asia were robust while the U.S. market started to slow in the quarter.
Gross margins were on par with last year. S,G&A improved by 3.1% as a percentage of sales to 29.1% reflecting top-line leverage and cost reduction initiatives. Operating profit increased almost 42% to $48.4 million and operating margin improved to 14.5% from 11.8% last year.
The backlog in Industrial was up 21% compared to a year ago. The systems backlog increased 24%, with particularly strong growth in the Municipal Water market.
Outlook
Life Sciences: We continue to expect mid single-digit sales growth in fiscal 2007 with Medical sales growth abating in the second half of the year and BioPharmaceuticals achieving low double-digit growth for the year.
Industrial: We expect sales in Pall Industrial to modestly surpass the 5-7% growth range provided at the beginning of the fiscal year reflecting a slowdown in Microelectronics and the consistent vitality of the systems business.
We expect gross margins for the Corporation to stabilize as the impact of our cost reduction initiatives grows. S,G&A is expected to be about 31% of sales for the full year and our underlying tax rate to be about 24% for the full year. Free cash flow (net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures) is expected to exceed our earlier estimate of $135 to $180 million.
With these six month results and assuming a steady macroeconomic environment, we now expect to post full year earnings per share on a pro forma basis above our original guidance of $1.45 to $1.60.
