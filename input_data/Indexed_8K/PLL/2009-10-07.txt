(e) On October 1, 2009, Pall Corporation (the "
Registrant
") entered into a new employment agreement with Lisa McDermott, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer of the Registrant (the "
McDermott Agreement
"), superseding the Amended and Restated Employment Agreement between the Registrant and Ms. McDermott, dated June 1, 2004, and entered into an employment agreement with Sandra Marino, Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary of the Registrant (the "
Marino Agreement
," and together with the McDermott Agreement, the "
Employment
Agreements
"). The Employment Agreements were approved by the Compensation Committee (the "") of the Board of Directors of the Registrant on September 21, 2009.
Committee
     
The Employment Agreements provide for annual base salaries of $371,400 and $345,646 for Ms. McDermott and Ms. Marino, respectively, which amounts may be increased with the approval of the Committee, and for target bonus percentages equal to 105% of base salary for each of Ms. McDermott and Ms. Marino.
     
Pursuant to the Employment Agreements, upon a separation from service (as defined under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended) due to termination by the Registrant without cause or by the executive for good reason, the executive will receive monthly, for 24 months, a payment equal to 1/12 of the sum of base salary and 70% of target bonus percentage, and her unvested restricted stock units, units under the Pall Corporation Management Stock Purchase Plan (the "
Management Plan
") and options will continue to vest and settle in the usual manner until the second anniversary of the separation from service. The Employment Agreements define good reason as (a) a material diminution in base salary, (b) a material diminution in authority, duties or responsibilities of the executive or of the person to whom the executive is required to report, (c) a material change in geographic location, or (d) any action or inaction that constitutes a material breach by the Registrant of the agreement. Upon a change in control, unvested restricted stock units, Management Plan units and stock options will immediately vest.
     
The Employment Agreements also provide for termination upon death or disability, upon the executive reaching age 65, by executive without good reason, and for cause by the Registrant. Upon separation from service on her death or disability, each of Ms. McDermott and Ms. Marino (or her estate, as applicable), will be entitled to an amount equal to her base salary and prorated bonus compensation to the end of the month in which death or disability occurs, and for 12 months after the month in which death or disability occurs, monthly payments equal to 1/12 of the sum of 50% of her base salary and 50% of her target bonus percentage multiplied by base salary. Upon separation from service due to termination by the Registrant for cause or by the executive without good reason, Ms. McDermott and Ms. Marino would not be entitled to any compensation (other than as accrued to the date of the separation from service).
     
Each Employment Agreement also provides that during employment (including any period following notice of termination whether or not services are being performed) and for 12 to 24 months after termination of employment (depending upon the circumstances of the termination), Ms. McDermott and Ms. Marino may not engage in any activity that is competitive to any material extent with the business of the Registrant, may not disparage the Registrant, and may not solicit customers or employees of the Registrant. The Employment Agreements also contain trade secret, confidentiality and invention and patent covenants that apply during and subsequent to employment.
The forgoing description of the terms of the Employment Agreements is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Employment Agreements which are attached hereto as exhibits and are incorporated herein by reference.

Any employment agreement between the parties hereto which is in effect on the date hereof is hereby terminated and replaced and superseded by this Agreement, effective on the Effective Date.

Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code
     
(a)
Compliance
. This Agreement is intended to comply with the requirements of Section 409A, or an exemption and shall in all respects be administered and interpreted in accordance with Section 409A. Notwithstanding anything in the Agreement to the contrary, distributions upon termination of employment may only be made upon a separation from service (as determined under Section 409A). Each installment of any payments and benefits provided to Executive under this Agreement that would be considered to be deferred compensation (within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(1)) will be treated as a separate "payment" for purposes of Section 409A. In no event may Executive, directly or indirectly, designate the calendar year of any payment to be made under this Agreement if such designation would violate Section 409A. All reimbursements and in-kind benefits provided under this Agreement shall be made or provided in accordance with the requirements of Section 409A. In the event the parties determine that the terms of this Agreement do not comply with Section 409A, they will negotiate reasonably and in good faith to amend the terms of this Agreement such that it complies (in a manner that attempts to minimize the economic impact of such amendment on Executive and the Company) within the time period permitted by Section 409A. In no event shall the Company be required to pay Executive any gross-up or other payment with respect to any taxes or penalties imposed under Section 409A with respect to any benefit paid to Executive hereunder.

Delay in Payment

th
Delayed Payment Date
On the Delayed Payment Date, there shall be paid to Executive
(or if Executive has died, to Executive's Successor defined below), in a single cash lump sum, an amount equal to the aggregate amount of all payments delayed pursuant to the preceding sentence, plus interest thereon at the Delayed Payment Interest Rate (as defined below) computed from the date on which each such delayed payment otherwise would have been made to Executive until the Delayed Payment Date. For purposes of the foregoing:
(i) "
Executive's Successor
" shall mean such payee or payees as Executive shall at any time designate by written notice to the Company or in Executive's last will and testament or, if no such designation is made, then to the legal representatives of Executive's estate, and (ii) the "
Delayed Payment Interest Rate
" shall mean the national average annual rate of interest payable on jumbo six-month bank certificates of deposit, as quoted in the business section of the most recently published Sunday edition of the New York Times preceding the date as of which Executive is treated as having incurred a "separation from service" for purposes of Section 409A.

In that event, payments that would have been made within such 30-day period shall be paid at the expiration of such 30-day period; provided that any payments or benefits payable by reason of the death of Executive shall not be subject to the condition set forth in this Section 18.

Employment Agreement
") dated October [_
_
_], 2009, as it may have been amended to the date hereof, between me and Pall Corporation (the "
Company
"), those payments and benefits being good and valuable consideration, the adequacy and sufficiency of which are acknowledged by me (the "
Payments
"), I, Sandra Marino, hereby release, remise and acquit Company, its present and past parents, subsidiaries and affiliates, their successors, assigns, benefit plans and/or committees, and their respective present or past officers, directors, managers, supervisors, employees, shareholders, attorneys, advisors, agents and representatives in their individual and corporate capacity, and their successors and assigns (the "
Releasees
"), from, and hold them harmless against, any and all claims, obligations, or liabilities (including attorneys, fees and expenses), asserted or unasserted, known or unknown, that I, my heirs, successors or assigns have or might have, which have arisen by reason of any matter, cause or thing whatsoever on or prior to the date on which this General Release is signed.
     
(b) The terms "claims, obligations, or liabilities" (whether denominated claims, demands, causes of action, obligations, damages or liabilities) include, but are not limited to, any and all claims under any contract with the Company, claims of age, disability, race, religion, national origin, sex, retaliation, and/or other forms of employment discrimination, breach of express or implied contract, breach of employee handbook, practices or procedures, libel, slander, intentional tort or wrongful dismissal, claims for reinstatement or reemployment, arising under any federal, state, or local common or statutory law; claims for unpaid salary, commission or fringe benefits; or any other statutory claim before any state or federal court, tribunal or administrative agency, arising out of or in any way related to my employment relationship with the Company and its affiliates and the termination of that relationship. I will not file or permit to be filed on my behalf any such claim.
     
(c) This General Release constitutes, among other things, a waiver of all rights and claims I may have under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (29 U.S.C. 621, et seq.) ("
ADEA
"), the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, Title VII of the United States Civil Rights Act of 1964, all as amended including the amendment set forth in 42 U.S.C.  1981 concerning damages in cases of intentional discrimination in employment, the New York State Human Rights Law, including N.Y. Exec. Law  296, the New York City Human Rights Law, including  8-107 of the Administration Code and Charter of New York City, and the New York Labor Law, and any other comparable national or state laws, all as amended.

(d) Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph (c) or any other provision of this Agreement, this General Release is not intended to interfere with my right to file a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (the "
EEOC
") in connection with any claim I believe I may have against the Company or its affiliates. However, by executing this General Release, I hereby waive the right to recover in any proceeding I may bring before the EEOC or any state human rights commission or in any proceeding brought by the EEOC or any state human rights commission on my behalf. In addition, this General Release is not intended to interfere with my right to challenge that my waiver of any and all ADEA claims pursuant to this General Release is a knowing and voluntary waiver, notwithstanding my specific representation that I have entered into this General Release knowingly and voluntarily.
     
(e) This General Release is for any relief, no matter how denominated, including, but not limited to, injunctive relief, wages, back pay, front pay, compensatory damages, or punitive damages.
     
(f) This General Release shall not apply to any rights in the nature of indemnification which I may have with respect to claims against me relating to or arising out of my employment with the Company and its affiliates or my service on their respective boards of directors, or any vested benefit to which I am entitled under any tax qualified pension plan of the Company or its affiliates, COBRA continuation coverage benefits or any other similar benefits required to be provided by statute. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 1, I do not release any of the Releasees from the Company's obligation to timely provide me with all payments and benefits to which I am entitled pursuant to the terms of the Employment Agreement, or any other obligations of the Company under the Employment Agreement.
     
2.
Continued Cooperation
.
In consideration of the Payments, I also agree to fully cooperate with the Company with respect to any reasonable assistance the Company may request from me upon reasonable notice to me, including but not limited to in connection with any legal claims, demands, or causes of action against the Company which relate to or are based on events that arose during the period of my employment with the Company. The Company shall pay me for such cooperation, at an hourly rate, calculated on the basis of my regular salary (not including bonus or any benefits) immediately prior to the termination of my employment with the Company, for each hour of assistance that I provide to the Company at its request, and shall reimburse me for all expenses I reasonably incur in connection with such cooperation, provided I deliver to the Company an invoice(s) in respect of such amounts, which invoice details with reasonable sufficiency the assistance provided and the number of hours spent providing such assistance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no case shall the Company require me to provide such assistance on more than twenty (20) days in any year, nor shall the Company require me to travel outside the United States to provide such assistance. A condition for me providing any such assistance is that the Company shall agree to indemnify me for any and all liability I may incur in connection with providing such assistance to the same extent as if I was still an executive officer of the Company.
