Item 1.01 Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
On July 13, 2010, Pall Corporation (the Registrant) entered into a Five-Year Credit Agreement (the Agreement) with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Facility Agent, J. P. Morgan Europe Limited, as London Agent, and the other lenders from time to time party thereto (the Lenders). A copy of the press release announcing the Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 99 and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
The Agreement replaces a revolving credit facility entered into on June 21, 2006, by and among the Registrant, JPMorgan Chase Bank, J. P. Morgan Europe Limited and a syndicate of banks thereto, which was due to expire on June 21, 2011 (the Terminated Agreement). The Terminated Agreement was terminated by the Registrant effective July 13, 2010.
 
The Agreement provides for the terms under which Lenders will make available to Registrant a $500 million five-year revolving credit facility (the Facility) that may be drawn upon in US Dollars, Pounds Sterling, Euro, Swiss Francs, Japanese Yen and other readily available and freely exchangeable currencies and provides for letters of credit up to $50 million.
 
Registrants obligations under the Agreement are unsecured and are not guaranteed by any of its subsidiaries.
 
Three business days following the entry into the Agreement, the Registrant borrowed $295 million under the Facility. These proceeds will be used to redeem $280 million aggregate principal amount of the Registrants 6% Senior Notes due 2012 and pay a portion of the approximately $28 million redemption premium (other funds will be used to pay the balance of the $28 million premium). The Registrant announced the notes redemption in a Form 8-K filed on June 18, 2010.
 
The Registrant must repay all borrowings under the Facility by, and the Lenders commitments under the Agreement will terminate on, July 13, 2015, unless commitments are terminated earlier by the Registrant or, upon an event of default, by the Facility Agent. The Registrant will pay (a) a commitment fee on the average daily undrawn amount of each Lenders commitment, and (b) a participation fee on the average daily undrawn amount of all outstanding letters of credit and unreimbursed disbursements made by the issuing bank pursuant to letters of credit. The applicable commitment fee and participant fee will accrue at rates dependent upon the Registrants senior, unsecured long-term debt credit ratings (the Applicable Rate). Based on the Registrants current ratings, the applicable commitment fee and participation fee are .30% per year and 2% per year, respectively.
 
Loans under the Agreement will bear interest per year, at the Registrants election, equal to:
the Alternate Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate for such loans. The Alternate Base Rate is the greater of (a) the Facility Agents announced prime rate, (b) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.5%, and (c) the adjusted London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBO Rate) for a one-month interest period
plus
1%; or  
the LIBO Rate for the selected interest period
plus
the Applicable Rate for such loans; or  
the European Union Banking Federation Rate for the selected interest period
plus
.
 the Mandatory Costs Rate (as defined in the Agreement) for such loans
The Agreement includes customary representations and warranties and affirmative and negative covenants substantially similar to those in the Terminated Agreement. The Agreement requires the Registrant to maintain a minimum Consolidated Net Interest Coverage Ratio of 3.5:1 and a maximum Consolidated Leverage Ratio of 3.5:1.
 
The Agreement also contains customary events of default. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the outstanding obligations under the Agreement may be accelerated and become due and payable immediately.
 
Certain of the Lenders party to the Agreement, and their respective affiliates, have performed, and may in the future perform for the Registrant and its subsidiaries, various commercial banking, investment banking, underwriting and other financial advisory services, for which they have received, and will receive, customary fees and expense reimbursement.
 
The foregoing description of the material terms of the Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Agreement, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 4(ii) and incorporated herein by reference.
 
 
Item 1.02 Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
Effective July 13, 2010, the Terminated Agreement, as defined in Item 1.01 above, was terminated by the Registrant.
 
The Registrant repaid the balance of its borrowings under the Terminated Agreement, approximately $295 million, before the termination of the Terminated Agreement using the net proceeds from the sale of its 5.00% Senior Notes due 2020. Prior to the termination of the Terminated Agreement, the Registrant had approximately $13 million of letters of credit outstanding. The letters of credit under the Terminated Agreement were transferred to the
Agreement, a description of which is contained under Item 1.01 above. The Registrants obligations under the Terminated Agreement were guaranteed by certain of the Registrants subsidiaries. In connection with the termination of the Terminated Agreement, all guarantors were released. The Registrant did not incur any early termination fees or penalties in connection with the termination of the Terminated Agreement.

(b)
Notice of Issuance, Amendment, Renewal, Extension; Certain
Conditions.
To request the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or the amendment, renewal or extension of an outstanding Letter of Credit), the Company shall hand deliver or facsimile (or transmit by electronic communication, if arrangements for doing so have been approved by the Issuing Bank) to the Issuing Bank and the Facility Agent (reasonably in advance of the requested date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension) a notice signed by a Responsible Officer of the Company requesting the issuance of a Letter of Credit, or identifying the Letter of Credit to be amended, renewed or extended, and specifying the date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension (which shall be a Business Day), the date on which such Letter of Credit is to expire (which shall comply with paragraph (c) of this Section), the currency and amount of such Letter of Credit, the name and address of the beneficiary thereof and such other information as shall be necessary to prepare, amend, renew or extend such Letter of Credit.

provided
that at the request of the Company any Letter of Credit may contain customary evergreen provisions pursuant to which such Letter of Credit will, in the absence of a notice given by the Issuing Bank, be automatically renewed (but in no event beyond the date that is five Business Days prior to the Maturity Date) for successive one-year periods. 
 
               
(d)
Participations.
By the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or an amendment to a Letter of Credit increasing the amount thereof) and without any further action on the part of the Issuing Bank or the Lenders, the Issuing Bank hereby grants to each Lender, and each Lender hereby acquires from the Issuing Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit equal to such Lenders Applicable Percentage of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit. In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to the Facility Agent, for the account of the Issuing Bank, such Lenders Applicable Percentage of each LC Disbursement made by the Issuing Bank and not reimbursed by the Company on the date due as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section, or of any reimbursement payment required to be refunded to the Company for any reason, each such payment to be made in the currency of such LC Disbursement. Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations pursuant to this paragraph in respect of Letters of Credit is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever.

(e)
Reimbursement.
prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the day of receipt or (ii) the Business Day immediately following the day that the Company receives such notice, if such notice is not received prior to such time on the day of receipt;
If the Issuing Bank shall make any LC
Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit, the Company shall reimburse such LC Disbursement by paying to the Facility Agent an amount equal to such LC
Disbursement in the currency of such LC Disbursement not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the date that such LC Disbursement is made, if the Company shall have received notice of such LC Disbursement prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on such date, or, if such notice has not been received by the Company prior to such time on such date, then not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on (i) the Business Day that the Company receives such notice, if such notice is received
provided
that if the Maturity Date shall not have occurred, the Company may, subject to the conditions to borrowing set forth herein, request in accordance with Section 2.03 or 2.04 that any LC Disbursement be financed with an ABR Revolving Borrowing or Swingline Loan (in each case, if such LC Disbursement is not less than US$500,000) in an equivalent amount if such LC Disbursement is denominated in US Dollars and otherwise in an amount determined by the Issuing Bank that will be sufficient, when converted to the currency of such LC Disbursement, to reimburse the Issuing Bank for such LC Disbursement, and to the extent so financed, the Companys obligation to make such payment shall be discharged and replaced by the resulting ABR Revolving Borrowing or Swingline Loan. If the Company fails to make such payment when due, the Facility Agent shall notify each Lender of the applicable LC Disbursement, the amount and currency of the payment then due from the Company in respect thereof (the 
Unreimbursed Amount
) and such Lenders Applicable Percentage thereof. Promptly following receipt of such notice, each Lender shall pay to the Facility Agent its Applicable Percentage of the Unreimbursed Amount, in the currency of such LC Disbursement and in the same manner as provided in Section 2.06 with respect to Loans made by such Lender (and Section 2.06 shall apply,
mutatis
mutandis
, to the payment obligations of the Lenders), and the Facility Agent shall promptly pay to the Issuing Bank the amounts so received by it from the Lenders. Promptly following receipt by the Facility Agent of any payment from the Company pursuant to this paragraph, the Facility Agent shall distribute such payment to the Issuing Bank or, to the extent that Lenders have made payments pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse the Issuing Bank, then to such Lenders and the Issuing Bank as their interests may appear. Any payment made by a Lender pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse the Issuing Bank for any LC Disbursement (other than the funding of ABR Revolving Loans or a Swingline Loan as contemplated above) shall not constitute a Loan and shall not relieve the Company of its obligation to reimburse such LC Disbursement.
 
               
(f)
Obligations Absolute.
The Companys obligation to reimburse LC Disbursements as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit, this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or any term or provision therein, (ii) any draft or other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment by the Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit or (iv) any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or provide a right of setoff against, the Companys obligations hereunder. None of the Facility Agent, the Lenders or the Issuing Bank, or any of their Related Parties, shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or
any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the Issuing Bank;
provided
that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse the Issuing Bank from liability to the Company to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the Company to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by the Company that are caused by the Issuing Banks failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof. The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of gross negligence or wilful misconduct on the part of the Issuing Bank (as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), the Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such determination. In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree that, with respect to documents presented which appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, the Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit.
 
36
 
               
(g)
Disbursement Procedures.
The Issuing Bank shall, promptly following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit. The Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the Facility Agent and the Company by telephone (confirmed by facsimile) of such demand for payment and whether the Issuing Bank has made or will make an LC Disbursement thereunder;
provided
that any failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the Company of its obligation to reimburse the Issuing Bank and the Lenders with respect to any such LC Disbursement. 
 
               
(h)
Interim Interest.
If the Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement, then, unless the Company shall reimburse such LC Disbursement in full by 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and including the date such LC Disbursement is made to but excluding the date that the Company reimburses such LC Disbursement, (i) in the case of an LC Disbursement in US Dollars, at the rate per annum then applicable to ABR Revolving Loans and (ii) in the case of an LC Disbursement in any other currency, at the rate per annum determined by the Issuing Bank (which determination will be conclusive absent manifest error) to represent its cost of funds plus the Applicable Rate that would at the time be added to the Adjusted LIBO Rate to determine interest applicable to Revolving LIBOR Loans;
provided
that, if the Company fails to reimburse such LC Disbursement when due pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section, then Section 2.12(d) shall apply. Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for the account of the Issuing Bank,
except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any Lender pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section to reimburse the Issuing Bank shall be for the account of such Lender to the extent of such payment.
 
37
 
               
(i)
Replacement of the Issuing Bank.
The Issuing Bank may be replaced at any time by written agreement among the Company, the Facility Agent, the replaced Issuing Bank and the successor Issuing Bank. The Facility Agent shall notify the Lenders of any such replacement of the Issuing Bank. At the time any such replacement shall become effective, the Company shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for the account of the replaced Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.11(b). From and after the effective date of any such replacement, (i) the successor Issuing Bank shall have all the rights and obligations of the Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued thereafter and (ii) references herein to the term 
Issuing Bank
 shall be deemed to refer to such successor or to any previous Issuing Bank, or to such successor and all previous Issuing Banks, as the context shall require. After the replacement of an Issuing Bank hereunder, the replaced Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such replacement (including the right to receive fees under Section 2.11(b)), but shall not be required to issue additional Letters of Credit. 
 
               
(j)
Cash Collateralization.
If any Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, on the Business Day that the Company receives notice from the Facility Agent or the Required Lenders (or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated, Lenders with LC Exposures representing more than 50% of the aggregate amount of LC Exposure) demanding the deposit of cash collateral pursuant to this paragraph, the Company shall deposit (
Cash Collateralize
) in an account with the Facility Agent, in the name of the Facility Agent and for the benefit of the Lenders and the Issuing Bank (the 
LC Collateral Account
), an amount in cash in US Dollars equal to the aggregate amount of LC Exposure as of such date (determined, in the case of Letters of Credit denominated in Alternative Currencies, on the basis of Exchange Rates prevailing on such date) plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon;
provided
that the obligation to Cash Collateralize shall become effective immediately, and such deposit shall become immediately due and payable, without demand or other notice of any kind, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default with respect to the Company described in clause (f) of Section 7.01. Each such deposit in the LC Collateral Account shall be held by the Facility Agent as collateral for the payment and performance of the obligations of the Company under this Agreement, and the Company shall from time to time, at the request of the Facility Agent, deposit additional amounts into the LC Collateral Account as necessary in order that the amount in such account shall not be less than the aggregate amount of LC Exposure. The Facility Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over the LC Collateral Account. Other than any interest earned on the investment of such deposits, which investments shall be made at the option and sole discretion of the Facility Agent and at the Companys risk and expense, such deposits shall not bear interest. Interest or profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in the LC Collateral Account.
be applied by the Facility Agent to reimburse the Issuing Bank for LC Disbursements for which it has not been reimbursed and, to the extent not so applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of the Company for the LC Exposure at such time or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated (but subject to the consent of Lenders with LC Exposures representing more than 50% of the aggregate amount of LC Exposure), be applied to satisfy other obligations of the Company under this Agreement. Deposits made in the LC Collateral Account in compliance with the preceding provisions of this Section as a result of the occurrence of an Event of Default shall (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) be returned to the Company within three Business Days after all Events of Default have been cured or waived. Deposits made in the LC Collateral Account pursuant to Section 2.10(b) shall (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) be returned to the Company as, and to the extent that, after giving effect to such return, (i) the aggregate Revolving Exposures would not exceed the aggregate Commitments, (ii) the aggregate Foreign Currency Exposures would not exceed the Foreign Currency Sublimit, (iii) the LC Exposure would not exceed the LC Sublimit and (iv) no Default shall have occurred and be continuing.

(a) Each Lender shall make each Loan to be made by it hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of immediately available funds in the applicable currency by 12:00 noon, Local Time, to the account of the Applicable Agent most recently designated by it for such purpose by notice to the Lenders;
provided
that Swingline Loans shall be made as provided in Section 2.04. The Applicable Agent will make such Loans available to the Company by promptly crediting the amounts so received, in like funds, to the Applicable Funding Account of the Company;

(b) Unless the Applicable Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Applicable Agent such Lenders share of such Borrowing, the Applicable Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Company a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Applicable Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Company severally agree to pay to the Applicable Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Company to but excluding the date of payment to the Applicable Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender, the rate reasonably determined by the Applicable Agent to be the cost to it of funding such amount or (ii) in the case of the Company, the interest rate applicable to the subject Loan.
 
               
SECTION 2.07.
Interest Elections.
(a) Each Revolving Borrowing initially shall be of the Type specified in the applicable Borrowing Request and, in the case of a LIBOR Borrowing or a EURIBOR Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest

The Company may elect different options with respect to different portions of an affected Revolving Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a separate Revolving Borrowing. This Section shall not apply to Swingline Borrowings, which may not be converted or continued.
 
39
 
               
(b) To make an election pursuant to this Section, the Company shall notify the Applicable Agent of such election by facsimile (or, in the case of the Facility Agent, by telephone) by the time that a Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 if the Company were requesting a Revolving Borrowing of the Type resulting from such election to be made on the effective date of such election. Each such Interest Election Request shall be irrevocable and, if telephonic, shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery or facsimile to the Facility Agent of a written Interest Election Request in a form approved by the Facility Agent and signed by a Responsible Officer of the Company.

If any such Interest Election Request requests a LIBOR Borrowing or a EURIBOR Borrowing but does not specify an Interest Period, then the Company shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one months duration.
 
40
 
               
(d) Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the Applicable Agent shall advise each Lender holding a Loan to which such request relates of the details thereof and of such Lenders portion of each resulting Borrowing. 
 
               
(e) If the Company fails to deliver a timely Interest Election Request with respect to a LIBOR Borrowing or EURIBOR Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period, such Borrowing shall (i) in the case of a LIBOR Borrowing denominated in US Dollars, be converted to an ABR Borrowing and (ii) in the case of any other LIBOR Borrowing or a EURIBOR Borrowing, become due and payable on the last day of such Interest Period. Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Facility Agent, at the request of the Required Lenders, so notifies the Company, then, so long as an Event of Default is continuing (i) no outstanding Revolving Borrowing denominated in US Dollars may be converted to or continued as a LIBOR Borrowing, (ii) unless repaid, each LIBOR Revolving Borrowing denominated in US Dollars shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto and (iii) unless repaid, each LIBOR Borrowing or EURIBOR Borrowing denominated in an Alternative Currency shall be continued as a LIBOR Borrowing or EURIBOR Borrowing, as applicable, with an Interest Period of one months duration.
 
               
SECTION 2.08.
Termination, Reduction and Increase of Commitments.
(a) Unless previously terminated, the Commitments shall terminate on the Maturity Date.
 
               
(b) The Company may at any time terminate, or from time to time reduce, the Commitments;
provided
that (i) each reduction of the Commitments shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of the Borrowing Multiple and not less than the Borrowing Minimum, in each case for Borrowings denominated in US Dollars and (ii) the Company shall not terminate or reduce the Commitments if, after giving effect to any concurrent prepayment of the Revolving Loans or Swingline Loans in accordance with Section 2.10, the aggregate amount of Revolving Exposures would exceed the aggregate amount of Commitments. 
 
               
(c) The Company shall notify the Facility Agent of any election to terminate or reduce the Commitments under paragraph (b) of this Section at least three Business Days prior to the effective date of such termination or reduction, specifying such election and the effective date thereof. Promptly following receipt of any such notice, the Facility Agent shall advise the other Agent and the applicable Lenders of the contents thereof. Each notice delivered by the Company pursuant to this Section shall be irrevocable;
provided
that a notice of termination of the Commitments delivered by a Responsible Officer of the Company may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities, in which case such notice may be revoked by the Company (by notice to the Facility Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied. Any termination or reduction of the Commitments shall be permanent. Subject to Section
2.20(d), each reduction of the Commitments shall be made ratably among the applicable Lenders in accordance with their Commitments.
 
41
 
               
(d) (i) The Company may on one or more occasions, by written notice to the Facility Agent signed by a Responsible Officer of the Company and one or more financial institutions (any such financial institution referred to in this paragraph (d) being called an 
Increasing Lender
), which may include any consenting Lender, cause Commitments to be extended by the Increasing Lenders (or cause the Commitments of the Increasing Lenders to be increased, as the case may be);
provided
that (A) at no time shall the aggregate amount of all extensions of new Commitments and increases in existing Commitments effected pursuant to this paragraph (d) exceed $100,000,000, (B) each Increasing Lender, if not already a Lender hereunder, shall be subject to the approval of the Facility Agent (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld), (C) each Increasing Lender, if not already a Lender hereunder, shall execute all such documentation as the Facility Agent shall reasonably specify to evidence the Commitment of such Increasing Lender and/or its status as a Lender hereunder and (D) the election of any Lender to become an Increasing Lender shall be in the sole discretion of such Lender, and no Lender shall have any obligation to agree to increase its Commitment hereunder.
 
(ii)
               
Extensions of new Commitments and increases in existing
Commitments pursuant to this paragraph (d) shall become effective on the date specified in the applicable notice delivered by the Company pursuant to subparagraph (i) above (the 
Increase Effective Date
) (which shall be not less than five Business Days after the date of such notice). Upon the effectiveness of such extension of new Commitments and/or increases in existing Commitments, (A) each Increasing Lender not already a Lender hereunder shall be deemed to be a party to this Agreement and shall thereafter be entitled to all rights, benefits and privileges accorded a Lender hereunder and subject to all obligations of a Lender hereunder and (B)
Schedule 2.01
shall be deemed to have been amended to reflect the new Commitment or increase in Commitment, as applicable, of each Increasing Lender as set forth in the applicable notice delivered by the Company.
 
               
(iii)
On the Increase Effective Date, (A) the aggregate principal amount of the Revolving Borrowings outstanding (the 
Initial Borrowings
) immediately prior to giving effect to the extensions of new Commitments and increases in existing Commitments shall be deemed to be repaid, (B) after the effectiveness of such extension or increase, the Company shall be deemed to have made new Borrowings (the 
Subsequent Borrowings
) in the aggregate principal amounts and currencies of the Initial Borrowings and of the Types and for the Interest Periods specified in a Borrowing Request delivered to the Agent in accordance with Section 2.03, (C) each Lender shall pay to the Applicable Agent in same day funds an amount equal to the difference, if positive, between (x) such Lenders Applicable Percentage (calculated after giving effect to any such extension or increase) of each Subsequent Borrowing and (y) such Lenders Applicable Percentage (calculated without giving effect to any such extension or increase) of the related Initial Borrowing, (D) after the Applicable Agent receives the funds specified in clause (C) above, the Applicable Agent shall pay to each Lender the portion of such funds that is equal to the difference, if positive, between (1) such
Lenders Applicable Percentage (calculated without giving effect to any such extension or increase) of each Initial Borrowing and (2) such Lenders Applicable Percentage (calculated after giving effect to any such extension or increase) of the amount of the related Subsequent Borrowing, (E) each Lender shall be deemed to hold its Applicable Percentage of each Subsequent Borrowing (each calculated after giving effect to any such extension or increase) and (F) the Company shall pay each applicable Lender any and all accrued but unpaid interest on the Initial Borrowings. The deemed payments made pursuant to clause (A) above in respect of each LIBOR Loan or EURIBOR Loan shall be subject to indemnification by the Company pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.15 if the Increase Effective Date occurs other than on the last day of the Interest Period relating thereto and breakage costs result.
 
42
 
               
(iv)
The terms and conditions of any Commitment increases or new Commitments created pursuant to this Section, and the Loans made pursuant thereto, shall be identical to those of the existing Commitments and Loans except with respect to upfront fees payable to the Increasing Lenders (it being understood and agreed that the Company may such pay upfront fees to the Increasing Lenders as agreed between the Company, the Facility Agent and Increasing Lenders).
 
               
(v)
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no increase in the Commitments (or in any Commitment of any Lender) or extension of new Commitments hereunder shall become effective under this Section unless, (A) on the date of such increase or extension, the conditions set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of Section 4.02 shall be satisfied (with all references therein to the making of Loans being deemed to be references to such increase or extension) and the Facility Agent shall have received a certificate to that effect dated such date and executed by a Financial Officer of the Company and (B) the Facility Agent shall have received (with sufficient copies for each of the Lenders) (x) documents consistent with those delivered on the Effective Date under clause (c) of Section 4.01 as to the corporate power and authority of the Company to borrow hereunder after giving effect to such increase or extension and (y) an opinion of counsel as to such corporate power and authority, the enforceability of the Loan Documents after giving effect to such increase or extension and such other matters as the Facility Agent may reasonably request.
 
               
SECTION 2.09.
Repayment of Loans; Evidence of Debt.
(a) The Company hereby unconditionally promises to pay (i) to the Applicable Agent for the account of each Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Revolving Loan of the Company on the Maturity Date and (ii) to the Swingline Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Swingline Loan on the earlier of the Maturity Date and the first date after such Swingline Loan is made that is the 15th or last day of a calendar month and is at least three Business Days after such Swingline Loan is made;
provided
that on each date that a Revolving Borrowing denominated in US Dollars (including any ABR Borrowing) is made to the Company, the Company shall repay all outstanding Swingline Loans.
 
               
(b) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the Indebtedness of the Company to such Lender
resulting from each Loan made by such Lender, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder.
 
43
 
               
(c) The Facility Agent shall maintain accounts in which it shall record (i) the amount and currency of each Loan made hereunder, the Class and Type thereof and the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Company to each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by any Agent hereunder for the account of the Lenders and each Lenders share thereof. The London Agent shall furnish to the Facility Agent, promptly after the making of any Loan or Borrowing with respect to which it is the Applicable Agent or the receipt of any payment of principal or interest with respect to any such Loan or Borrowing, information with respect thereto that will enable the Facility Agent to maintain the accounts referred to in the preceding sentence. 
 
               
(d) The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of this Section shall be
prima
facie
evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein;
provided
that the failure of any Lender or the Facility Agent to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Company to repay the Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. 
 
               
(e) Any Lender may request that Loans of any Class made by it to the Company be evidenced by a promissory note. In such event, the Company shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note payable to the order of such Lender (or, if requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its registered assigns) and in a form reasonably acceptable to the Facility Agent. Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after assignment pursuant to Section 9.04) be represented by one or more promissory notes in such form payable to the order of the payee named therein (or, if such promissory note is a registered note, to such payee and its registered assigns).
 
               
SECTION 2.10.
Prepayment of Loans.
(a) The Company shall have the right at any time and from time to time to prepay any Borrowing in whole or in part, subject to prior notice in accordance with paragraph (d) of this Section.
 
               
(b) If, on any date, (i) the aggregate Foreign Currency Exposures shall exceed the Foreign Currency Sublimit or (ii) the aggregate Revolving Exposures shall exceed the aggregate Commitments, the Company shall prepay Loans (A) on the last day of the Interest Period for any LIBOR Revolving Borrowing or EURIBOR Revolving Borrowing and (B) in the case of clause (ii) above, on any other day in the event ABR Revolving Borrowings or Swingline Loans are outstanding (or, if no Loans are outstanding, Cash Collateralize Letters of Credit by depositing in the LC Collateral Account subject to the provisions of Section 2.05(j)) an aggregate amount equal to the lesser of (1) the amount necessary to eliminate such excess (after giving effect to any previous prepayment of Loans and cash collateralization of Letters or Credit) and (2) the amount of the applicable Borrowing or Loans referred to in clause
(A) or (B) above. If, on any date, the aggregate amount of the Revolving Exposures shall exceed 105% of the aggregate Commitments, then the Company shall, not later than the next Business Day, prepay one or more Borrowings in an aggregate principal amount sufficient to eliminate such excess.
 
44
 
               
(c) Prior to any optional or mandatory prepayment of Borrowings hereunder, the Company shall select the Borrowing or Borrowings to be prepaid and shall specify such selection in the notice of such prepayment pursuant to paragraph (d) of this Section. 
 
               
(d) The Company shall notify the Applicable Agent (and, in the case of prepayment of a Swingline Loan, the Swingline Lender) by a facsimile notice signed by a Responsible Officer of the Company of any prepayment of a Borrowing hereunder (i) in the case of a LIBOR Borrowing denominated in US Dollars, not later than 11:00 a.m., Local Time, three Business Days before the date of such prepayment (or, in the case of a prepayment under paragraph (b) above, as soon thereafter as practicable), (ii) in the case of a LIBOR Borrowing denominated in an Alternative Currency or a EURIBOR Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., Local Time, four Business days before the date of such prepayment (or, in the case of a prepayment under paragraph (b) above, as soon thereafter as practicable) and (iii) in the case of an ABR Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., Local Time, on the date of such prepayment. Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the prepayment date and the principal amount of each Borrowing or portion thereof to be prepaid;
provided
that, if a notice of optional prepayment is given in connection with a conditional notice of termination of the Commitments as contemplated by Section 2.08, then such notice of prepayment may be revoked if such notice of termination is revoked in accordance with Section 2.08. Promptly following receipt of any such notice, the Applicable Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each partial prepayment of any Borrowing shall be in an amount that would be permitted in the case of an advance of a Borrowing of the same Type as provided in Section 2.02. Each prepayment of a Borrowing shall be applied ratably to the Loans included in the prepaid Borrowing. Prepayments shall be accompanied by (i) accrued interest to the extent required by Section 2.12 and (ii) any break funding payments pursuant to Section 2.15.
 
               
SECTION 2.11.
Fees.
(a) The Company agrees to pay to the Facility Agent, in US Dollars, for the account of each Lender, a commitment fee, which shall accrue at the Applicable Rate on the average daily unused amount of each of the Commitments of such Lender during the period from and including the date hereof to but excluding the date on which such Commitment terminates. Accrued commitment fees shall be payable in arrears on the last day of March, June, September and December of each year and on the date on which all the Commitments shall have terminated, commencing on the first such date to occur after the date hereof. All commitment fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). For purposes of computing commitment fees with respect to the Commitments, a Commitment of a Lender shall be deemed to be used to the extent of the outstanding Revolving Loans and
the LC Exposure of such Lender (and the Swingline Exposure of such Lender shall be disregarded for such purpose).
 
45
 
               
(b) The Company agrees to pay (i) to the Facility Agent for the account of each Lender a participation fee with respect to its participations in Letters of Credit, which shall accrue at the Applicable Rate for Revolving LIBOR Loans, on the average daily amount of such Lenders LC Exposure (excluding any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements) during the period from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the later of the date on which such Lenders Commitment terminates and the date on which such Lender ceases to have any LC Exposure and (ii) to the Issuing Bank a one-time fronting fee with respect to the issuance of each Letter of Credit (other than the Existing Letters of Credit) equal to 0.125 % of the initial amount of such Letter of Credit, as well as the Issuing Banks standard fees with respect to the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or processing of drawings thereunder. Participation fees and fronting fees accrued or becoming payable in respect of Letters of Credit issued through and including the last day of March, June, September and December of each year shall be payable on the third Business Day following such last day, commencing on the first such date to occur after the Effective Date;
provided
that all such fees shall be payable on the date on which the Commitments terminate and any such fees accruing after the date on which the Commitments terminate shall be payable on demand. Any other fees payable to the Issuing Bank pursuant to this paragraph shall be payable within 10 days after demand. All participation fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). 
 
               
(c) The Company agrees to pay to the Agents, for their own account, fees payable in the amounts and at the times separately agreed upon between the Company and the Agents. 
 
               
(d) All fees payable hereunder shall be paid on the dates due, in immediately available funds, to the Facility Agent (or to the Issuing Bank, in the case of fees payable to it) for distribution, in the case of commitment fees and participation fees, to the Lenders. Fees paid shall not be refundable under any circumstances.
 
SECTION 2.12.
               
Interest.
(a) The Loans comprising each
ABR Borrowing (including each Swingline Loan) shall bear interest at the Alternate Base Rate
plus
the Applicable Rate.
 
               
(b) The Revolving Loans comprising each LIBOR Revolving Borrowing shall bear interest at the Adjusted LIBO Rate for the Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing
plus
the Applicable Rate. 
 
               
(c) The Revolving Loans comprising each EURIBOR Revolving Borrowing shall bear interest at the Adjusted EURIBO Rate for the Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing
plus
the Applicable Rate.
 
46
 
               
(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any principal of or interest on any Loan or any fee or other amount payable by the Company hereunder is not paid when due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise, such overdue amount shall bear interest, after as well as before judgment, at a rate per annum equal to (i) in the case of overdue principal of any Loan, 2% plus the rate otherwise applicable to such Loan as provided in the preceding paragraphs of this Section or (ii) in the case of any other amount, 2% plus the rate applicable to ABR Loans as provided in paragraph (a) of this Section. 
 
               
(e) Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date for such Loan and upon the termination of the Commitments;
provided
that (i) interest accrued pursuant to paragraph (d) of this Section shall be payable on demand, (ii) in the event of any repayment or prepayment of any Loan (other than a prepayment of an ABR Revolving Loan or a Swingline Loan prior to the end of the Availability Period), accrued interest on the principal amount repaid or prepaid shall be payable on the date of such repayment or prepayment and (iii) in the event of any conversion of any LIBOR Revolving Loan or EURIBOR Revolving Loan prior to the end of the current Interest Period therefor, accrued interest on such Loan shall be payable on the effective date of such conversion. All interest shall be payable in the currency in which the applicable Loan is denominated. 
 
               
(f) All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days, except that (i) interest on Borrowings denominated in Sterling and (ii) interest computed by reference to the Alternate Base Rate at times when the Alternate Base Rate is based on the Prime Rate shall each be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or, except in the case of Borrowings denominated in Sterling, 366 days in a leap year), and in each case shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). The applicable Adjusted LIBO Rate, Adjusted EURIBO Rate or Alternate Base Rate shall be determined by the Facility Agent, and such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
 
               
SECTION 2.13.
Alternate Rate of Interest.
If prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a LIBOR Borrowing denominated in any currency or a EURIBOR Borrowing denominated in Euros:
 
     
(i)
the Applicable Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the Adjusted EURIBO Rate, as the case may be, for such Interest Period; or 
 
     
(ii)
the Applicable Agent is advised by a majority in interest of the Lenders that would participate in such Borrowing that the LIBO Rate or EURIBO Rate, as the case may be, for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining the Loans included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period;
 
47
 
then the Applicable Agent shall give notice thereof to the Company and the applicable Lenders by telephone or facsimile as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until the Applicable Agent notifies the Company and the applicable Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of any affected Revolving Borrowing to, or continuation of any affected Revolving Borrowing as, a LIBOR Borrowing or a EURIBOR Borrowing, as the case may be, shall be ineffective, (ii) any affected LIBOR Borrowing or EURIBOR Borrowing that is requested to be continued shall be repaid on the last day of the then current Interest Period applicable thereto and (iii) any Borrowing Request for an affected LIBOR Borrowing or a EURIBOR Borrowing shall be ineffective.
 
SECTION 2.14.
               
Increased Costs.
(a) If any Change in Law shall: 
 
     
(i)
impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of or credit extended by, any Lender (except any such reserve requirement reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the Adjusted EURIBO Rate) or the Issuing Bank; 
 
     
(ii)
impose on any Lender, the Issuing Bank or the London or European interbank market any other condition affecting this Agreement or LIBOR Loans or EURIBOR Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participations therein; or 
 
     
(iii)
subject any Recipient to any Tax on its capital reserves (or any similar Tax) with respect to this Agreement or any Loan or Commitment made by such Recipient (except for Indemnified Taxes and Excluded Taxes and changes in the rate of Tax on the overall net income or profits of such Lender);
 
and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender or such other Recipient of making or maintaining any LIBOR Loan or EURIBOR Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan) or to increase the cost to such Lender, the Issuing Bank or such other Recipient of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender, the Issuing Bank or such other Recipient hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then the Company will pay to such Lender, the Issuing Bank or such other Recipient, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender, the Issuing Bank or such other Recipient, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.
 
               
(b) If any Lender or the Issuing Bank determines that any Change in Law regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lenders or the Issuing Banks capital or on the capital of such Lenders or the Issuing Banks holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by the Issuing Bank, to a level below that which such Lender or the Issuing Bank or such Lenders or the Issuing Banks holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into
consideration such Lenders or the Issuing Banks policies and the policies of such Lenders or the Issuing Banks holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Company will pay to such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank or such Lenders or the Issuing Banks holding company for any such reduction suffered.
 
48
 
               
(c) A certificate of a Lender or the Issuing Bank setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section shall be delivered to the Company and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Company shall pay such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof. 
 
               
(d) Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or the Issuing Bank to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lenders or the Issuing Banks right to demand such compensation;
provided
that the Company shall not be required to compensate a Lender or the Issuing Bank pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than 180 days prior to the date that such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, notifies the Company of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lenders or the Issuing Banks intention to claim compensation therefor;
provided
further
that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 180-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.
 
               
SECTION 2.15.
Break Funding Payments.
In the event of (a) the payment of any principal of any LIBOR Loan or any EURIBOR Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of Default), (b) the conversion of any LIBOR Loan or any EURIBOR Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (c) the failure to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any LIBOR Loan or any EURIBOR Loan on the date specified in any notice delivered pursuant hereto (regardless of whether such notice may be revoked under Section 2.10(d) and is revoked in accordance therewith) or (d) the assignment of any LIBOR Loan or any EURIBOR Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto as a result of a request by the Company pursuant to Section 2.18, then, in any such event, the Company shall compensate each Lender for the loss, cost and expense attributable to such event. In the case of a LIBOR Loan or a EURIBOR Loan, such loss, cost or expense to any Lender shall be deemed to include an amount determined by such Lender to be the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest which would have accrued on the principal amount of such Loan had such event not occurred, at the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the Adjusted EURIBO Rate, as the case may be, that would have been applicable to such Loan, for the period from the date of such event to the last day of the then current Interest Period therefor (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, for the period that would have been the Interest Period for such Loan) over (ii) the amount of interest that would accrue on such principal amount for such period at the interest rate which such Lender would bid were it to bid, at the commencement of such period, for
deposits in the applicable currency of a comparable amount and period from other banks in the London or European interbank market. A certificate of any Lender setting forth in reasonable detail any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section shall be delivered to the Company and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Company shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.
 
49
 
SECTION 2.16.
               
Taxes
.
 
               
(a)
Withholding of Taxes; Gross-Up.
Each payment by the Company under this Agreement shall be made without withholding for any Taxes, unless such withholding is required by any law. If any Withholding Agent determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it is so required to withhold Taxes, then such Withholding Agent may so withhold and shall timely pay the full amount of withheld Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law. If such Taxes are Indemnified Taxes, then the amount payable by the Company shall be increased as necessary so that, net of such withholding (including such withholding applicable to additional amounts payable under this Section), the applicable Recipient receives the amount it would have received had no such withholding been made. 
 
               
(b)
Payment of Other Taxes by the Company.
The Company shall timely pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law. 
 
               
(c)
Evidence of Payments.
As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes by the Company to a Governmental Authority, the Company shall deliver to the Facility Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Facility Agent. 
 
               
(d)
Indemnification by the Company.
The Company shall indemnify each Recipient for any Indemnified Taxes that are paid or payable by such Recipient (including Indemnified Taxes that are paid or payable by a Non-U.S. Lender that is classified as a partnership for U.S. Federal income tax purposes on behalf of one or more of its Beneficial Owners) in connection with this Agreement (including amounts payable under this Section 2.16(d)) and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. The indemnity under this Section 2.16(d) shall be paid within 10 days after the Recipient delivers to the Company a certificate stating the amount of any Indemnified Taxes so payable by such Recipient. Such certificate shall be conclusive of the amount so payable absent manifest error. Such Recipient shall deliver a copy of such certificate to the Facility Agent.

(e) Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Agents for any Taxes (but in the case of Indemnified Taxes, only to the extent that the Company has not already indemnified the Agents for any such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Company to do so) and the Company for any Excluded Taxes, in each case attributable to such Lender that are paid or payable by the Agents or the Company in connection with this Agreement and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes or Excluded Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. The indemnity under this Section 2.16(e) shall be paid within 10 days after the Agents or the Company delivers to the applicable Lender a certificate stating the amount of Taxes or Excluded Taxes so paid or payable by the Agents or the Company. Such certificate shall be conclusive of the amount so paid or payable absent manifest error.

(f)
Status of Lenders.
(i) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from, or reduction of, any applicable withholding Tax with respect to any payments under this Agreement shall deliver to the Company and to any applicable Withholding Agent, at the time or times prescribed by law or reasonably requested by the Company or any applicable Withholding Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by law or reasonably requested by the Company or any applicable Withholding Agent as will permit such payments to be made without, or at a reduced rate of, withholding. In addition, any Lender, if requested by the Company or any applicable Withholding Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by law or reasonably requested by the Company or any applicable Withholding Agent as will enable the Company or any applicable Withholding to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section 2.16(f)(ii) and (iii) below) shall not be required if in the Lenders reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender. Upon the reasonable request of the Company or any applicable Withholding Agent, any Lender shall update any form or certification previously delivered pursuant to this Section 2.16(f). If any form or certification previously delivered pursuant to this Section expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect with respect to a Lender, such Lender shall promptly (and in any event within 10 days after such expiration, obsolescence or inaccuracy) notify the Company and any applicable Withholding Agent in writing of such expiration, obsolescence or inaccuracy and update the form or certification if it is legally eligible to do so.
 
51
 
     
(i) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, so long as the Company is a U.S. Person, any Lender with respect to such Company shall, if it is legally eligible to do so, deliver to such Company and to any applicable Withholding Agent (in such number of copies reasonably requested by such Company and any applicable Withholding Agent) on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a party hereto, duly completed and executed copies of whichever of the following is applicable:
 
     
(A) in the case of a Lender that is a U.S. Person, IRS Form W-9;
 
     
(B)

(C)
in the case of a Non-U.S. Lender for whom payments under this Agreement constitute income that is effectively connected with such Lenders conduct of a trade or business in the United States, IRS Form W-8ECI;
 
     
(D)
in the case of a Non-U.S. Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code both (1) IRS Form W-8BEN and (2) a certificate substantially in the form of (a U.S. Tax Certificate) to the effect that such Lender is not (a) a bank within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (b) a 10 percent shareholder of the Company within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code (c) a controlled foreign corporation described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code and (d) conducting a trade or business in the United States with which the relevant interest payments are effectively connected;
Exhibit E
 
     
(E)
in the case of a Non-U.S. Lender that is not the beneficial owner of payments made under this Agreement (including a partnership or a participating Lender) (1) an IRS Form W-8IMY on behalf of itself and (2) the relevant forms prescribed in clauses (A), (B), (C), (D) and (F) of this paragraph (f)(ii) that would be required of each such beneficial owner or partner of such partnership if such beneficial owner or partner were a Lender; provided, however, that if the Lender is a partnership and one or more of its partners are claiming the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, such Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Certificate on behalf of such partners; or
 
     
(F)
any other form prescribed by law as a basis for claiming exemption from, or a reduction of, U.S. Federal withholding Tax together with such supplementary documentation necessary to enable the Company or any applicable Withholding Agent to determine the amount of Tax (if any) required by law to be withheld.
 
52
 
     
(ii)
If a payment made to a Lender under this Agreement would be subject to U.S. Federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender fails to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Withholding Agent, at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Withholding Agent, such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Withholding Agent as may be necessary for the Withholding Agent to comply with its obligations under FATCA, to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lenders obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment.
 
          
(g)
Treatment of Certain Refunds.
If any party determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this Section 2.16 (including additional amounts paid pursuant to this Section 2.16), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under this Section with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including any Taxes) of such indemnified party and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund). Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid to such indemnified party pursuant to the previous sentence (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the event such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 2.16(g), in no event will any indemnified party be required to pay any amount to any indemnifying party pursuant to this Section 2.16(g) if such payment would place such indemnified party in a less favorable position (on a net after-Tax basis) than such indemnified party would have been in if the indemnification payments or additional amounts giving rise to such refund had never been paid. In order to invoke the protection of the preceding sentence, an indemnified party must provide to the indemnifying party whatever information and documentation the indemnifying party reasonably requests to establish that the indemnified party would be in a less favorable position (on a net after-Tax basis) than such indemnified party would have been in if the indemnification payments or additional amounts giving rise to such refund had never been paid, and the amount of such detriment. This Section 2.16(g) shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes which it deems confidential) to the indemnifying or any other Person.
 
               
(h)
Survival.
Each partys obligations under this Section 2.16 shall survive termination of this Agreement and payment of any obligations thereunder.

SECTION 2.17.
Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of
Set-offs.
(a) The Company shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder or under any other Loan Document (whether of principal, interest, fees or reimbursement of LC Disbursements, or of amounts payable under Section 2.14, 2.15 or
2.16, or otherwise) prior to the time expressly required hereunder or under such other Loan Document for such payment or, if no such time is expressly required, prior to 12:00 noon, Local Time, on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without set-off or counterclaim. Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Applicable Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall be made to the Applicable Agent for the account of the Lenders to such account as the Applicable Agent shall from time to time specify in one or more notices delivered to the Company, except that payments to be made directly to the Issuing Bank or Swingline Lender as expressly provided herein shall be made directly to such parties and payments pursuant to Sections 2.14, 2.15, 2.16, and 9.03 shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto. The Applicable Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment under any Loan Document shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. All payments hereunder of principal or interest in respect of any Loan or LC Disbursement shall, except as otherwise expressly provided herein, be made in the currency of such Loan or LC Disbursement; all other payments hereunder and under each other Loan Document shall be made in US Dollars. Any payment required to be made by any Agent hereunder shall be deemed to have been made by the time required if such Agent shall, at or before such time, have taken the necessary steps to make such payment in accordance with the regulations or operating procedures of the clearing or settlement system used by such Agent to make such payment.
 
               
(b) If at any time insufficient funds are received by the Agents from the Company and available to pay fully all amounts of principal, unreimbursed LC Disbursements, interest and fees then due from the Company hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i)
first
, towards payment of interest and fees then due from the Company hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii)
second
, towards payment of principal of the Loans and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due from the Company hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due to such parties. 
 
               
(c) If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on its Revolving Loans or participations in LC Disbursements or Swingline Loans resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Revolving Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Revolving Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amounts of their respective Revolving Loans and participations in
LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans;
provided
that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by the Company pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements to any assignee or participant, other than to the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply).
The Company consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Company rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Company in the amount of such participation.
 
54
 
               
(d) Unless an Agent shall have received notice from the Company prior to the date on which any payment is due to such Agent for the account of the Lenders or the Issuing Bank hereunder that the Company will not make such payment, such Agent may assume that the Company has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if the Company has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to such Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or the Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Agent, at a rate determined by the Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.
 
               
(e) If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.04(c), 2.05(d), 2.05(e), 2.06(b), 2.16(d)
or 9.03(c), then the Facility Agent may, in its discretion and notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, (i) apply any amounts thereafter received by the Facility Agent for the account of such Lender for the benefit of the Facility Agent, the Swingline Lender or the Issuing Bank to satisfy such Lenders obligations to it under such Section until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid, and/or (ii) hold any such amounts in a segregated account as cash collateral for, and application to, any future funding obligations of such Lender under any such Section, in the case of each of clauses (i) and (ii) above, in any order as determined by the Facility Agent in its discretion.
 
               
SECTION 2.18.
Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.
(a) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.14, or if the Company is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.16, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or
reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.14 or 2.16, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Company hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.
 
55
 
               
(b) If (i) any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.14, (ii) the Company is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.16 or (iii) any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, then the Company may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Facility Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 9.04), all its interests, rights and obligations under the Loan Documents to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment);
provided
that (x) the Company shall have received the prior written consent of the Facility Agent and the Issuing Bank, which consent, in each case, shall not unreasonably be withheld, (y) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and funded participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal, funded participations and accrued interest and fees) or the Company (in the case of all other amounts) and (z) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.14 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.16, such assignment will result in a material reduction in such compensation or payments. A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Company to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.
 
               
SECTION 2.19.
Redenomination of Certain Alternative Currencies.
(a) Each obligation of any party to this Agreement to make a payment denominated in the national currency unit of any member state of the European Union that adopts the Euro as its lawful currency after the date hereof shall be redenominated into Euro at the time of such adoption (in accordance with the EMU Legislation). If, in relation to the currency of any such member state, the basis of accrual of interest expressed in this Agreement in respect of that currency shall be inconsistent with any convention or practice in the London interbank market for the basis of accrual of interest in respect of the Euro, such expressed basis shall be replaced by such convention or practice with effect from the date on which such member state adopts the Euro as its lawful currency;
provided
that if any Borrowing in the currency of such member state is outstanding immediately prior to such date, such replacement shall take effect, with respect to such Borrowing, at the end of the then current Interest Period.
 
               
(b) Each provision of this Agreement shall be subject to such reasonable changes of construction as the London Agent (in consultation with the Company) may from time to time specify to be appropriate to reflect the adoption of
the Euro by any member state of the European Union and any relevant market conventions or practices relating to the Euro.
 
56
 
               
SECTION 2.20.
Defaulting Lenders.
Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the following provisions shall apply for so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender:
 
               
(a) fees shall cease to accrue on the unfunded portion of the Commitment of such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.11(a);
 
               
(b) the Commitment and Revolving Exposure of such Defaulting Lender shall not be included in determining whether the Required Lenders have taken or may take any action hereunder (including any consent to any amendment, waiver or other modification pursuant to Section 9.02);
provided
that this clause (b) shall not apply to the vote of a Defaulting Lender in the case of an amendment, waiver or other modification requiring the consent of such Lender, all Lenders or each affected Lender;
 
               
(c) if any Swingline Exposure or LC Exposure exists at the time such Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender then:
 
     
(i)
all or any part of the Swingline Exposure and LC Exposure of such Defaulting Lender shall be reallocated among the non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Applicable Percentages but only to the extent the sum of all non-Defaulting Lenders Revolving Exposures plus such Defaulting Lenders Swingline Exposure and LC Exposure does not exceed the total of all non-Defaulting Lenders Commitments;
 
     
(ii)
if the reallocation described in clause (i) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Company shall within three Business Days following notice by the Facility Agent (x)
first
, prepay Swingline Loans in an amount equal to such Defaulting Lenders Swingline Exposure (or such portion thereof as shall remain after giving effect to any partial reallocation pursuant to clause (i) above) and (y)
second
, Cash Collateralize for the benefit of the Issuing Bank only the Companys obligations corresponding to such Defaulting Lenders LC Exposure (after giving effect to any partial reallocation pursuant to clause (i) above) in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.05(j) for so long as such LC Exposure is outstanding;
 
     
(iii)
if the Company cash collateralizes any portion of such Defaulting Lenders LC Exposure pursuant to clause (ii) above, the Company shall not be required to pay any fees to such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.11(b) with respect to such Defaulting Lenders LC Exposure during the period such Defaulting Lenders LC Exposure is Cash Collateralized;
 
     
(iv)
if the LC Exposure of the non-Defaulting Lenders is reallocated pursuant to clause (i) above, then the fees payable to the Lenders pursuant to
Sections 2.11(a) and 2.11(b) shall be adjusted in accordance with such non-Defaulting Lenders Applicable Percentages; and
 
57
 
     
(v)
if all or any portion of such Defaulting Lenders LC Exposure is neither reallocated nor Cash Collateralized pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) above, then, without prejudice to any rights or remedies of the Issuing Bank or any other Lender hereunder, all participation fees payable under Section 2.11(b) with respect to such Defaulting Lenders LC Exposure shall be payable to the Issuing Bank until and to the extent that such LC Exposure is reallocated and/or cash collateralized;
 
               
(d) the Company may, upon at least three Business Days notice to such Defaulting Lender (with a copy to the Facility Agent), elect from time to time to irrevocably terminate, in whole or in part, the unused portion of the Commitment of such Defaulting Lender. Such termination shall be effective, with respect to the applicable portion of such Defaulting Lenders then existing unused Commitment, on the date set forth in such notice (
provided
,
however
, that such date shall be no earlier than three Business Days after such notice) and with respect to the applicable portion of any unused Commitment thereafter arising, on the later of the date set forth in such notice and the date on which such unused Commitment first arises (and no commitment fee will be payable in respect of such portion of such unused Commitment terminated on the date it arises). Upon termination of any portion of the Defaulting Lenders unused Commitments under this paragraph, the Company shall pay or cause to be paid all accrued commitment fees payable to such Defaulting Lender and all other amounts due and payable to such Defaulting Lender hereunder in respect of such portion of the Defaulting Lenders unused Commitment. Upon such payments, the obligations of such Defaulting Lender hereunder with respect to such portion of such unused Commitment which has been terminated shall, by the provisions hereof, be released and discharged;
provided
,
however
, that such Defaulting Lenders rights and obligations provided in Section 9.03 with respect to such portion of such unused Commitment which has been terminated shall survive such release and discharge as to matters occurring prior to such date;
 
               
(e) so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender, the Swingline Lender shall not be required to fund any Swingline Loan and the Issuing Bank shall not be required to issue, amend or increase any Letter of Credit, unless it is satisfied that the related exposure and the Defaulting Lenders then outstanding LC Exposure will be 100% covered by the Commitments of the non-Defaulting Lenders and/or cash collateral will be provided by the Company in accordance with paragraph (c) of this Section, and participating interests in any newly made Swingline Loan or any newly issued or increased Letter of Credit shall be allocated among non-Defaulting Lenders in a manner consistent with paragraph (c)(i) of this Section (and such Defaulting Lender shall not participate therein).
 
58
 
               
If (a) (i) a Bankruptcy Event with respect to a parent entity of any Lender shall occur following the date hereof and for so long as such event shall continue or (ii) the Swingline Lender or the Issuing Bank has a good faith belief that any Lender has
defaulted in fulfilling its obligations under one or more other agreements in which such Lender commits to extend credit and (b) the Swingline Lender or the Issuing Bank notifies the Company that in its judgment there is a material risk that such Lender will not perform its obligation to fund its participation in any Swingline Exposure or LC
Exposure, the Swingline Lender shall not be required to fund any Swingline Loan or the Issuing Bank shall not be required to issue, amend or increase any Letter of Credit, unless the Swingline Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, shall have entered into arrangements with the Company or such Lender, satisfactory to the Swingline Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, to defease any risk to it in respect of such Lender hereunder.
 
               
In the event that the Agents, the Company, the Swingline Lender and the Issuing Bank all agree that a Defaulting Lender has adequately remedied all matters that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, then the Swingline Exposures and LC Exposures of the Lenders shall be readjusted to reflect the inclusion of such Lenders Commitment (to the extent such Commitment shall not have been terminated as provided in clause (d) above) and on such date such Lender shall purchase at par such of the Loans of the other Lenders (other than Swingline Loans) as the Facility Agent shall determine may be necessary in order for such Lender to hold such Loans in accordance with its Applicable Percentage.

The Agents shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by them with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as the Agents shall believe in good faith to be necessary, under the circumstances as provided in Section 9.02) or in the absence of their own gross negligence or wilful misconduct.

Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders (in the case of a resignation by the Facility Agent) or the Facility Agent (in the case of a resignation by any other Agent) shall have the right, in consultation with the Company, to appoint a successor. If no successor Agent shall have

(b) None of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any provision hereof or thereof may be waived, amended or modified except, in the case of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Company and the Required Lenders;
provided
that no such agreement shall (i) increase the Commitment of any Lender without the written consent of such Lender, (ii) reduce the principal amount of any Loan or LC Disbursement or reduce the rate of interest thereon, or reduce any fees payable hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby, (iii) postpone the maturity of any Loan, or the required date of reimbursement of any LC Disbursement, or any date for the payment of any interest or fees payable hereunder, or reduce the amount of, waive or excuse any such payment, or postpone the scheduled date of expiration of any Commitment, without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby, (iv) change Sections 2.16(b), 2.16(c) or 7.03 in a manner that would alter the pro rata sharing of payments required thereby, without the written consent of each Lender, and (v) change any of the provisions of this Section or the percentage voting requirements set forth in the definitions of 
Required
Lenders
 or 
Alternative Currency
 or any other provision of any Loan Document specifying the number or percentage of Lenders required to waive, amend or modify any rights thereunder or make any determination or grant any consent thereunder, without the written consent of each Lender;
provided further
that no such agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise affect the rights or duties of any Agent, the Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender without the prior written consent of such Agent, the Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender, as the case may be.

(a) The

(b) The Company shall indemnify the Agents, the Arrangers, the Issuing Bank and each Lender, and each Related Party of any of the foregoing Persons (each such Person being called an 
Indemnitee
) against, and hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses, including the documented fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for any Indemnitee, incurred by or asserted against any Indemnitee arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of (i) the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein, the preparation, execution, delivery or administration of the Loan Documents or any agreement or instrument contemplated thereby, the performance
by the parties thereto of their respective obligations thereunder or the consummation of the Transactions or any other transactions contemplated thereby, (ii) any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds therefrom (including any refusal by the Issuing Bank to honor a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit if the documents presented in connection with such demand do not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit), (iii) any actual or alleged presence or Release of Hazardous Materials on or from any property currently or formerly owned or operated by the Company or any of the Subsidiaries, or any Environmental Liability related in any way to the Company or any of the Subsidiaries or (iv) any actual or prospective claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other theory and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto and regardless of whether such matter is initiated by a third party or by the Company or any Affiliate thereof;
provided
that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence or wilful misconduct of such Indemnitee.
 
84
 
               
(c) To the extent that the Company fails to pay any amount required to be paid by it to any Agent, the Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section, each Lender severally agrees to pay to such Agent, the Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender, as the case may be, such Lenders pro rata share (determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such unpaid amount;
provided
that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted against such Agent, the Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender in its capacity as such. For purposes hereof, a Lenders 
pro rata
share
 shall be determined based upon its share of the aggregate amount of Revolving Exposures and unused Commitments at the time (or, if there shall be no Revolving Exposures or unused Commitments, based upon its share of the unused Commitments most recently in effect at the time). 
 
               
(d) To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Company shall not assert, and hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnitee, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with or as a result of this Agreement or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the Transactions, any Loan or any Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds thereof. 
 
               
(e) All amounts due under this Section shall be payable not later than 10 days after written demand therefor.

(A)
the Company;
provided
that no consent of the Company shall be required for an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender, an Approved Fund or, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, any other assignee; and
 
(B)
          
the Facility Agent; and
 
(C)
          
the Issuing Bank; and
 
(D)
          
the Swingline Lender.
 
(ii)
     
Assignments shall be subject to the following additional conditions: 
 
          
(A)
except in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund or an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lenders Commitment, the amount of the Commitment of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Facility Agent) shall not be less than US$5,000,000 unless each of the Company and the Facility Agent otherwise consents;
provided
that no such consent of the Company shall be required if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing; 
 
          
(B)
each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement;

(iii)
Subject to acceptance and recording thereof pursuant to paragraph (b)(iv) of this Section, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.14, 2.15, 2.16 and 9.03). Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this Section 9.04 shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph (c) of this Section. 
 
     
(iv)
The Facility Agent, acting for this purpose as an agent of the Company, shall maintain at one of its offices a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitment of, and principal amount of the Loans and LC Disbursements owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the 
Register
). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, and the Company, the Facility Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available for
inspection by the Company, the Issuing Bank and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.
 
87
 
     
(v)
Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Assumption executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, the assignees completed Administrative Questionnaire (unless the assignee shall already be a Lender hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section and any consent to such assignment required by paragraph (b) of this Section, the Facility Agent shall record the information contained in such Assignment and Assumption in the Register. No assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this paragraph. 
 
               
(c) (i) Any Lender may, without the consent of, or notice to, the Company, the Facility Agent, the Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender, sell participations to one or more banks or other entities (a 
Participant
) in all or a portion of such Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans owing to it);
provided
that (A) such Lenders obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (B) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (C) the Company, the Facility Agent, the Issuing Bank and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lenders rights and obligations under the Loan Documents. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce the Loan Documents and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of the Loan Documents;
provided
that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described in the first proviso to Section 9.02(b) that affects such Participant. Subject to paragraph (c)(ii) of this Section, the Company agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.14, 2.15 and 2.16 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 9.08 as though it were a Lender;
provided
such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.17(c) as though it were a Lender. 
 
     
(ii)
A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 2.14 or 2.16 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Companys prior written consent. A Participant shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.16 unless the Company is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Company, to comply with Section 2.16(f) as if it were a Lender.
 
88
 
               
(d) Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank or any central bank having jurisdiction over such Lender, and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest;
provided
that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto. 
 
               
(e) Any taxes that would be Other Taxes if not for being imposed with respect to an assignment or participation (other than an assignment pursuant to Section 2.18(b)) shall be the responsibility of either the assigning Lender or the assignee in the case of an assignment or the Lender or the Participant in the case of a participation, but for the avoidance of doubt shall not be the responsibility of the Company.
 
               
SECTION 9.05.

The provisions of Sections 2.14, 2.15, 2.16 and 9.03 and Article VIII shall survive and remain in full force and effect regardless of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of the Loans, the expiration or termination of the Letters of Credit and the Commitments or the termination of this Agreement or any provision hereof.
 
               
SECTION 9.06.
Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness.
This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto on different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement, the other Loan Documents and any separate letter agreements with respect to fees payable to the Agents or the Issuing Bank constitute the entire contract among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof.

by facsimile or other electronic transmission shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.
 
89
 
               
SECTION 9.07.
Severability.

SECTION 9.08.

The rights of each Lender under this Section are in addition to and shall not limit other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) which such Lender may have.

Charges
), shall exceed the maximum lawful rate (the 
Maximum Rate
) which may be contracted for, charged, taken, received or reserved by the Lender holding such Loan in accordance with applicable law, the rate of interest payable in respect of such Loan hereunder, together with all Charges payable in respect thereof, shall be limited to the Maximum Rate and, to the extent lawful, the interest and Charges that would have been payable in respect of such Loan but were not payable as a result of the operation of this Section shall be cumulated and the interest and Charges payable to such Lender in respect of other Loans or periods shall be increased (but not above the Maximum Rate therefor) until such cumulated amount, together with interest thereon at the Federal Funds Effective Rate to the date of repayment, shall have been received by such Lender.

92
 
               
(b) The obligations of each party hereto in respect of any sum due to any other party hereto or any holder of the obligations owing hereunder (the 
Applicable Creditor
) shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency (the 
Judgment Currency
) other than the currency in which such sum is stated to be due hereunder (the 
Agreement Currency
), be discharged only to the extent that, on the Business Day following receipt by the Applicable Creditor of any sum adjudged to be so due in the Judgment Currency, the Applicable Creditor may in accordance with normal banking procedures in the relevant jurisdiction purchase the Agreement Currency with the Judgment Currency; if the amount of the Agreement Currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to the Applicable Creditor in the Agreement Currency, the Company agrees, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify the Applicable Creditor against such loss. The obligations of each party hereto contained in this Section 9.14 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of all other amounts owing hereunder.
 
               
SECTION 9.15.

Each Lender and the Facility Agent (for itself and not on behalf of any Lender) hereby notifies the Company that pursuant to the requirements of the Patriot Act, it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies the Company, which information includes the name and address of the Company and other information that will allow such Lender or the Facility Agent, as applicable, to identify the Company in accordance with the Patriot Act.

EXHIBIT C
 
 
1. The Mandatory Costs Rate is an addition to the interest rate to compensate Lenders for the cost of compliance with (a) the requirements of the Bank of England and/or the Financial Services Authority (or, in either case, any other authority which replaces all or any of its functions) or (b) the requirements of the European Central Bank.
 
2. On the first day of each Interest Period (or as soon as possible thereafter) the London
Agent shall calculate a rate (the 
Additional Costs Rate
), expressed as a percentage, for each Lender, in accordance with the paragraphs set out below. The Mandatory Costs Rate will be calculated by the London Agent as a weighted average of the Lenders Additional Costs Rates (weighted in proportion to the percentage participation of each Lender in the applicable Borrowing) and will be expressed as a percentage rate per annum.
 
3. The Additional Costs Rate for any Lender lending from a Lending Office located in a
Participating Member State will be the percentage notified by that Lender to the London Agent. This percentage will be certified by that Lender in its notice to the London Agent to be its reasonable determination of the cost (expressed as a percentage of that Lenders participation in all Loans made from such Lending Office) of complying with the minimum reserve requirements of the European Central Bank in respect of Loans made from such Lending Office.
 
4. The Additional Costs Rate for any Lender lending from a Lending Office in the
United Kingdom will be calculated by the London Agent as follows:
 
(a) with respect to any Loan denominated in Sterling:
 
(b) with respect to any Loan denominated in any currency (other than Sterling):
 
Where:
 
A
 means the percentage of Eligible Liabilities (assuming these to be in excess of any stated minimum) which that Lender is from time to time required to maintain as an interest free cash ratio deposit with the Bank of England to comply with cash ratio requirements.
 
B
 means the percentage rate of interest (excluding the Applicable Rate and the Mandatory Costs Rate and, if the Loan was not paid when due, the additional rate of interest specified in Section 2.12(d)) payable for the applicable Interest Period on the Loan.
 
 
C
 means the percentage (if any) of Eligible Liabilities which that Lender is required from time to time to maintain as interest bearing Special Deposits with the Bank of England.
 
D
 means the percentage rate per annum payable by the Bank of England to the London Agent on interest bearing Special Deposits.
 
E
 is designed to compensate Lenders for amounts payable under the Fees Rules and is calculated by the London Agent as being the average of the most recent rates of charge supplied by the Reference Banks to the London Agent pursuant to paragraph 7 below and expressed in Sterling per 1,000,000.
 
5. For the purposes of this Schedule:
 
(a) 
Eligible Liabilities
 and 
Special Deposits
 have the meanings given to them from time to time under or pursuant to the Bank of England Act 1998 or (as may be appropriate) by the Bank of England.
 
(b) 
Fees Rules
 means the rules on periodic fees contained in the Financial Services Authority Supervision Manual or such other law or regulation as may be in force from time to time in respect of the payment of fees for the acceptance of deposits.
 
(c) 
Fee Tariffs
 means the fee tariffs specified in the Fees Rules under the activity group A.1 Deposit acceptors (ignoring any minimum fee or zero rated fee required pursuant to the Fees Rules but taking into account any applicable discount rate).
 
(d) 
Participating Member State
 means any member state of the European Communities that adopts or has adopted the Euro as its lawful currency in accordance with legislation of the European Community relating to Economic and Monetary Union.
 
(e) 
Tariff Base
 has the meaning given to it in, and will be calculated in accordance with, the Fees Rules.
 
6. In application of the above formulae, A, B, C and D will be included in the formulae as percentages (
i.e.
5% will be included in the formula as 5 and not as 0.05). A negative result obtained by subtracting D from B shall be taken as zero. The resulting figures shall be rounded to four decimal places.
 
7. If requested by the London Agent, each Reference Bank shall, as soon as practicable after publication by the Financial Services Authority, supply to the London Agent, the rate of charge payable by that Reference Bank to the Financial Services Authority pursuant to the Fees Rules in respect of the relevant financial year of the Financial Services Authority (calculated for this purpose by that Reference Bank as being the average of the Fee Tariffs applicable to that Reference Bank for that financial year) and expressed in Sterling per 1,000,000 of the Tariff Base of that Reference Bank.
 
 
8. Each Lender shall supply any information required by the London Agent for the purpose of calculating its Additional Costs Rate. In particular, but without limitation, each Lender shall supply the following information on or prior to the date on which it becomes a Lender:
 
(a) the jurisdiction of its applicable Lending Office; and
 
(b) any other information that the London Agent may reasonably require for such purpose.
 
Each Lender shall promptly notify the London Agent of any change to the information provided by it pursuant to this paragraph.
 
9. The percentages of each Lender for the purpose of A and C above and the rates of charge of each Reference Bank for the purpose of E above shall be determined by the London Agent based upon the information supplied to it pursuant to paragraphs 7 and 8 above and on the assumption that, unless a Lender notifies the London Agent to the contrary, each Lenders obligations in relation to cash ratio deposits and Special Deposits are the same as those of a typical bank from its jurisdiction of incorporation with a Lending Office in the same jurisdiction as its applicable Lending Office.
 
10. The London Agent shall have no liability to any person if such determination results in an Additional Costs Rate which over or under compensates any Lender and shall be entitled to assume that the information provided by any Lender or Reference Bank pursuant to paragraphs 3, 7 and 8 above is true and correct in all respects.
 
11. The London Agent shall distribute the additional amounts received as a result of the Mandatory Costs Rate to the Lenders on the basis of the Additional Costs Rate for each Lender based on the information provided by each Lender and each Reference Bank pursuant to paragraphs 3, 7 and 8 above.
 
12. Any determination by the London Agent pursuant to this Schedule in relation to a formula, the Mandatory Costs Rate, an Additional Costs Rate or any amount payable to a Lender shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive and binding.
 
13. The London Agent may from time to time, after consultation with the Company and the Lenders, determine and notify to all parties any amendments which are required to be made to this Schedule in order to comply with any change in law, regulation or any requirements from time to time imposed by the Bank of England, the Financial Services Authority or the European Central Bank (or, in any case, any other authority which replaces all or any of its functions) and any such determination shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive and binding.

EXHIBIT F
 
 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., in its capacity as Facility Agent, and the Lenders party on the date hereof to the Credit Agreement referred to below
 
Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
     
We have acted as special counsel to Pall Corporation, a New York corporation (the Borrower), in connection with the credit agreement dated as of the date hereof (the Credit Agreement) among the Borrower, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as facility agent, J. P. Morgan Europe Limited, as London agent, and the lenders party thereto. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Credit Agreement. This opinion letter is furnished pursuant to Section 4.01(b) of the Credit Agreement.
 
     
In arriving at the opinions expressed below, we have reviewed the following documents:
 
 
In addition, we have reviewed the originals or copies certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction of all such corporate records of the Borrower and such other documents, and we have made such investigations of law, as we have deemed appropriate as a basis for the opinions expressed below.
 
     
In rendering the opinions expressed below, we have assumed the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals and the conformity to the originals of all documents submitted to us as copies. In addition, we have assumed and have not verified the accuracy as to factual matters of each document we have reviewed (including, without limitation, the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Borrower in the Credit Agreement).
 
     
Based on the foregoing, and subject to the further assumptions and qualifications set forth below, it is our opinion that:
 
     
1. The Borrower is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation.
 
 
2. The Borrower has corporate power to own its properties and conduct its
     
business as currently conducted, to enter into the Credit Agreement and to perform its obligations thereunder.
 
     
3. The execution and delivery by the Borrower of the Credit Agreement have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action of the Borrower. The Credit Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Borrower and is a valid, binding and enforceable agreement of the Borrower.
 
     
4. The execution and delivery of the Credit Agreement by the Borrower do not, and the performance by the Borrower of its obligations in the Credit Agreement will not, (a) require any consent, approval, authorization, registration or qualification of or with any governmental authority of the United States of America or the State of New York that in our experience normally would be applicable to general business entities with respect to such execution, delivery and performance
(but we express no opinion relating to the United States federal securities laws or any state securities or Blue Sky laws except as set forth in numbered paragraph 5 below), (b) result in a breach of any of the terms and provisions of, or constitute a default under, any of the agreements of the Borrower identified in Exhibit A hereto, or a violation of the Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws of the Borrower or (c) result in a violation of any United States federal or New York State law or published rule or regulation that in our experience normally would be applicable to general business entities with respect to such execution, delivery and performance (but we express no opinion relating to the United States federal securities laws or any state securities or Blue Sky laws except as set forth in numbered paragraph 5 below).
 
     
5. The Borrower is not required to be registered as an investment company under the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
 
     
Insofar as the foregoing opinions relate to the valid existence and good standing of the Borrower, they are based solely on confirmation from public officials. Insofar as the foregoing opinions relate to the validity, binding effect or enforceability of any agreement or obligation of the Borrower, (a) we have assumed that the Borrower and each other party to such agreement or obligation has satisfied those legal requirements that are applicable to it to the extent necessary to make such agreement or obligation enforceable against it (except that no such assumption is made as to the Borrower regarding matters of the federal law of the United States of America or the law of the State of New York that in our experience normally would be applicable to general business entities with respect to such agreement or obligation), and (b) such opinions are subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws affecting creditors rights generally and to general principles of equity.
 
     
We note that by statute New York provides that a judgment or decree rendered in a currency other than the currency of the United States shall be converted into U.S. dollars at the rate of exchange prevailing on the date of entry of the judgment or decree. There is no corresponding Federal statute and no controlling Federal court decision on this issue.
Accordingly, we express no opinion as to whether a Federal court would award a judgment in a currency other than U.S. dollars or, if it did so, whether it would order conversion of the judgment into U.S. dollars.
 
 
     
We express no opinion as to the enforceability of Section 9.14 of the Credit Agreement relating to currency indemnity.
 
     
With respect to Section 9.09(b) of the Credit Agreement in which the parties submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, we express no opinion as to the subject matter jurisdiction of any United States federal court to adjudicate any action relating to the Credit Agreement where jurisdiction based on diversity of citizenship under 28 U.S.C. 1332 does not exist. We also note that the designation in Section 9.09(b) of the Credit Agreement of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York as the venue for actions or proceedings relating to the Credit Agreement is (notwithstanding the waiver in Section 9.09(c)) subject to the power of such court to transfer actions pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1404(a) or to dismiss such actions or proceedings on the grounds that such a federal court is an inconvenient forum for such an action or proceeding.
 
     
The foregoing opinions are limited to the federal law of the United States of America and the law of the State of New York.
 
 
     
We are furnishing this opinion letter to you solely for your benefit in connection with the Credit Agreement. This opinion letter is not to be relied on by or furnished to any other person or used, circulated, quoted or otherwise referred to for any other purpose.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a copy of this opinion letter may be furnished to, and relied upon by, any of your permitted assignees of the Loans under the Credit Agreement that becomes a Lender on or prior to the 30th day after the date of this opinion letter. The opinions expressed herein are, however, rendered on and as of the date hereof, and we assume no obligation to advise you or any such assignee or any other person, or to make any investigations, as to any legal developments or factual matters arising subsequent to the date hereof that might affect the opinions expressed herein.
