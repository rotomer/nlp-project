Pall Corporation Announces Preliminary Fourth Quarter and Full-Year Results
 
Port Washington, NY (September 7, 2011) -- Pall Corporation (NYSE:PLL) today reported preliminary financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended July 31, 2011.
 
Fourth quarter sales were $780.4 million, a 15.0% gain over last year. Sales in local currency ("LC") increased 6.2%. Foreign currency translation increased reported sales by 8.8%.
 
Diluted earnings per share (EPS) for the quarter were $0.82, compared to $0.46 last year. Pro forma EPS were $0.76 (excluding restructuring and other charges and items impacting interest and provision for income taxes: Discrete Items), compared to $0.72 last year, for an increase of 6%. The estimated impact of foreign currency translation increased both measures of fiscal year 2011 EPS by $0.08 in the quarter.
 
Sales for the full year were $2.74 billion, a 14.1% increase over fiscal year 2010. Sales in LC increased 10.9%. Foreign currency translation increased reported sales in the year by 3.2%.
 
Diluted EPS were $2.67 for the fiscal year 2011, compared to $2.03 for the same period last year. Pro forma EPS, excluding Discrete Items, were $2.77, a 31% increase compared to $2.12 a year earlier. The estimated impact of foreign currency translation increased both measures of fiscal year 2011 EPS by $0.13.
 
Commenting on the quarter, Eric Krasnoff, CEO and President, said, Against a backdrop of global macroeconomic challenges, sales in both businesses met our expectations. Life Sciences' overall performance was solid while profitability in Pall Industrial fell short of what we anticipated. The end result is that the fourth quarter is a disappointing finish to an otherwise good year.
 
Life Sciences sales increased over 17% (8% in LC) in the quarter. Fourth quarter gross margin improved 150 basis points from last year and SG&A held steady at 26% of sales. Life Sciences operating profit increased 24% to $92 million. This business has steadily improved operating margin and ended the year at 24.0%, achieving 34% incremental margin year over year.
 
Pall Industrial sales grew almost 13% (5% in LC) in the quarter. Gross margin, at 43.2%, was pulled down by higher than forecast demand for capital goods later in the quarter. Operational performance was also a headwind to margin in the quarter. Industrial operating profit came in at $52 million, or operating margin of 13.4%, down $18 million from the prior year. We understand the challenges encountered during the quarter and are taking steps to address them.
 
We are pleased that the IRS concluded its audits of fiscal years 1999 through 2005. The quarter reflects the benefits of reversing approximately $27 million of previously recorded tax-related liabilities. Moreover, this settlement substantially eliminates the uncertainty of penalties to which the Company may be subject.
 
We look forward to providing additional perspective with our regular earnings release on September 14 and call on September 15, 2011.
