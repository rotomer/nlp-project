(b) On September 26, 2011, Eric Krasnoff, Director, President and Chief Executive Officer of Pall Corporation (the Registrant) tendered his resignation to the Board of Directors (the Board) as Director, President and Chief Executive Officer, effective October 3, 2011. Mr. Krasnoff had previously announced his intention to retire earlier this year and his resignation was coincident with the termination of his term of employment under the Amended and Restated Employment Agreement, dated March 4, 2011, between the Registrant and Mr. Krasnoff, under which Mr. Krasnoffs term of employment would end upon the earlier of (a) March 9, 2012, or (b) the appointment of a successor Chief Executive Officer. As announced earlier by the Registrant, Lawrence D. Kingsley was elected to succeed Mr. Krasnoff as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Registrant, effective October 3, 2011.
 
(d) At its meeting on September 26, 2011, the Board elected Lawrence D. Kingsley, 48, as a Director of the Registrant, effective October 3, 2011. Mr. Kingsley currently serves as Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of IDEX Corporation, and as stated above, effective October 3, 2011, will succeed Mr. Krasnoff as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Registrant. Mr. Kingsleys election to the Board was pursuant to the Employment Agreement, dated August 3, 2011, between Mr. Kingsley and the Registrant in which the Registrant agreed to elect Mr. Kingsley to the Board within five days after his start date with the Registrant. As Mr. Kingsley will be an executive officer of the Registrant, the Board determined that he does not meet the independence requirements under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange and the Registrants independence standards. In addition, there are no transactions between Mr. Kingsley and the Registrant that would require disclosure under Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K. The Board has not yet appointed Mr. Kingsley to any committee. Mr. Kingsley will not receive compensation as a Director of the Registrant.
