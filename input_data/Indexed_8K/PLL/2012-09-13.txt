Pall Corporation Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year Results
Reports Record Quarterly Sales and Operating Margin
PORT WASHINGTON, N.Y., September 12, 2012 -- Pall Corporation (
NYSE:PLL)
today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended July 31, 2012.
Fourth Quarter Sales and Earnings Overview
Total Company:
Fourth quarter sales were $783.7 million compared to $780.4 million last year, an increase of 0.4% (+6.1% in local currency (LC)). Diluted earnings per share (EPS) were $0.73 in the quarter, compared to $0.82 last year. Pro forma diluted EPS
(1)
were $0.99 compared to $0.76 last year, an increase of 30%. Foreign currency translation negatively impacted fourth quarter EPS by $0.05.
Continuing Operations:
 
(2)
Sales in the quarter were $722.4 million, an increase of about 1% (+6.4% LC). Diluted EPS were $0.64 in the quarter, compared to $0.76 last year. Pro forma EPS were $0.86 compared to $0.65 last year, an increase of 32%.
Larry Kingsley, President and CEO, said, We executed a solid fourth quarter. We focused almost exclusively on restoring customer service levels and we have recovered from the ERP implementation challenges in the third quarter of FY12. We also closed the transaction with Haemonetics on August 1
st
as planned. We have taken action to insure that we can achieve reasonable shareholder return in a choppy economic environment.
Our BioPharmaceuticals, Machinery & Equipment, and Aerospace markets all performed very well in the quarter. On a regional basis, the Americas had strong growth while Europe and Asia were flat. System sales were negative in the quarter as a function of a very large comparison quarter in FY11, our decision to pare certain unprofitable system sales, and lower capital commitment in some markets.
Consumable orders were strong globally with the exception of our Industrial markets in Europe where orders declined 7% year-on-year.
Our performance reflected slightly better than expected supply chain recovery assumptions as stated in the prior quarter call.
Full Year Sales and Earnings Overview
Total Company:
For the full year, sales increased 5.9% over last year (+6.9% LC). Diluted EPS were $2.71, compared to $2.67 for the same period last year. Pro forma EPS were $3.19, a 15% increase compared to $2.77 a year earlier. Foreign currency translation had an immaterial impact on full year EPS.
Continuing Operations:
 
(2)
Sales from continuing operations for the full year increased 6.1% (+7.2% LC) over last year. Diluted EPS were $2.39 compared to $2.36. Pro forma EPS were $2.80, a 16% increase compared to $2.42 a year earlier.
Life Sciences  Fourth Quarter Highlights
(2)
BioPharmaceuticals
:
Within BioPharmaceuticals, our
Pharmaceuticals sales increased 16%. Consumables sales to Pharmaceuticals customers grew 21%, with contributions from all regions, while systems sales declined 22%. Continued strength in the biotech market, as well as ForteBios BLItz
TM
and Octet instrumentation platforms, which added about 4%, drove consumables sales growth. Laboratory sales grew in all regions and increased about 15% overall.
Food and Beverage
:
Sales were down overall reflecting a divestiture in Italy which reduced sales by almost 5%. Consumables sales grew about 12%, excluding the divestiture. This growth reflects new products and growth in emerging markets. Systems sales were down reflecting decreased capital investment in Europe related to weak economic conditions in parts of the region.
Medical
:
Medical OEM sales grew 10% driven by the Americas and Europe. Hospital sales were up slightly. Other Medical markets were negatively impacted by channel changes.
Industrial  Fourth Quarter Highlights
(2)
Process Technologies
:
Machinery & Equipment sales increased 9%. Consumables sales grew in all regions reflecting growth in the mining, automotive in-plant and mobile OEM sectors.
Sales in Fuels & Chemicals decreased approximately 4% overall on weakness in Europe as well as tough comparables to a strong quarter in fiscal year 2011.
Power Generation sales increased 18%. Systems sales more than doubled, while consumables sales grew about 2%. Key growth drivers in the quarter include the recovery of the turbine OEM sector in Europe.
Municipal Water sales increased about 5%, driven by growth in the Americas.
Aerospace
:
Military Aerospace grew 28% in the quarter, with all regions contributing. Sales in the Americas were particularly strong. Commercial Aerospace sales increased 12%, with both Americas and Europe strong.
Microelectronics
:
The result year over year
reflects continuing weakness in our customer end markets in Asia. Overall, orders were up 5%.
Conclusion/Outlook
Kingsley concluded, Im pleased with our execution in the quarter in that we were able to restore customer confidence. However, we have much to do to demonstrate that we can execute in a manner that is industry-leading and that we can be proud of. Our team is working hard to enable our strategy and build the necessary business processes to deliver consistent performance.
As we look forward, the market environment is mixed. We anticipate challenges within our European industrial markets, slower than previously expected global semiconductor end markets, and moderating growth in some emerging markets. Other markets, though, will continue to grow in the current economic environment. Our current assumptions are generally consistent with our third quarter characterization which assumes low to mid-single digit local currency sales growth. On that basis in 2013, we expect pro forma EPS in the $3.05 to $3.25 range, reflecting 9% to 16% earnings per share growth. Included within our guidance is the assumption of 22 - 24 cents of adverse currency associated impact.
We will provide further details regarding our expectations for fiscal year 2013 on our Q4 call.

On Thursday, September 13, 2012, at 8:30 am ET, Pall Corporation will host a conference call to review these results. The call can be accessed at www.pall.com/investor. The webcast will be archived for 30 days.
