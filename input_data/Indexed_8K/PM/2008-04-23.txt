Dividends and Share Repurchase Program
PMI reaffirms its previously announced intention to pay a dividend at the initial rate of $0.46 per share per quarter, or $1.84 per common share on an annualized basis. PMI has established a dividend policy that anticipates a payout ratio of approximately 65%.
As previously announced, the $13.0 billion two-year share repurchase program for PMI is expected to begin in early May.
 
2008 Full-Year Forecast
PMI increases its forecast for diluted earnings per share, reflecting favorable currency, business momentum and increased reinvestment in the business, to a range of $3.18 to $3.24 for the full-year 2008, representing a growth rate of approximately 14% to 16%, from a revised pro-forma adjusted base of $2.79 per share in 2007. This compares to a previously disclosed range of $3.11 to $3.17 for the full-year 2008.
Following the completion of the spin-off, historical basic and diluted earnings per share amounts have been recalculated based on the actual number of shares issued by Altria Group, Inc. on the Distribution Date. Consequently, the previously disclosed 2007 pro-forma adjusted base per share of $2.78 has been revised to $2.79. A reconciliation of 2007 reported results to 2007 pro forma adjusted results, by quarter and for the full-year, is provided on Schedules 5 through 9.
This forecast includes the announced acquisition of and other OTP trademarks, but excludes the impact of any potential additional future acquisitions and a number of other factors. The factors described in the Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements section of this release represent continuing risks to these projections.

Acquisition of

and other OTP trademarks
PMI announces it has reached an agreement to acquire the fine cut trademark and certain other trademarks in the Other Tobacco Products (OTP) category from Imperial Tobacco Group PLC.
Interval
The transaction has a value of 254 million euros and, on a full-year basis, would be expected to increase PMI's net earnings per share by approximately $0.01. In 2007, the acquired trademarks generated an estimated operating companies income of 25 million euros and accounted for an approximate 2% share of the total fine cut category in PMI's EU region with the leading fine cut brand in France, holding a 14.8% share of the fine cut category in France.
Interval,
This acquisition complements PMI's fine cut portfolio and will bring the company's total share of this profitable and growing category in PMI's EU region to over 10%.
The agreement is subject to approval by the European Commission and certain local regulatory agencies and is expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter of 2008.
 
Management reviews operating companies income, which is defined as operating income before corporate expenses and amortization of intangibles, to evaluate segment performance and to allocate resources. Management believes it is appropriate to disclose this measure to help investors analyze business performance and trends.

Adjusted for the items shown in the table below, operating companies income grew 29.1%.

(a) This adjustment reflects the reversal of $62 million of pre-tax asset impairment and exit costs ($45 million after-tax) relating to the streamlining of various administrative functions.
(b) A subsidiary of Altria had provided us with certain services at cost plus a management fee. This adjustment reflects incremental costs of $23 million, partially offset by the related tax benefit of $7 million. These incremental costs reflect the expansion of services that were previously provided by Altria to reflect our status as a stand-alone public company.
(c) As part of the Spin-off, we paid to Altria $4.0 billion in special dividends, of which $3.1 billion were paid in 2007 and the remaining $900 million were paid in the first quarter of 2008. The pro forma adjusted statement of earnings has been adjusted to reflect the incremental interest expense we would have incurred if borrowings to finance the special dividends had been made on January 1, 2007. The incremental interest adjustment of $53 million, partially offset by the related tax benefit of $15 million, was computed by applying a rate of 5.24% (the average rate of our December 2007 borrowings that were incurred to pay Altria the dividend) to the total special dividends that were paid to Altria. An increase or (decrease) of one-eighth of 1% (12.5 basis points) in the interest rate associated with these variable rate borrowings would have increased or (decreased) our pro forma adjusted interest expense by $1.3 million.
(d) Basic and diluted earnings per share are calculated based on the number of our shares distributed by Altria on the Distribution Date.
