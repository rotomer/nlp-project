2008 Full-Year Forecast

This compares to a previously disclosed range of $3.18 to $3.24 for the full-year 2008.
This forecast excludes the impact of any potential future acquisitions and a number of other factors. The factors described in the Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements section of this release represent continuing risks to these projections.

2008 Second-Quarter Results
In the EU, net revenues, excluding excise taxes, increased by 15.0% to reach $2.6 billion, due to favorable currency of $384 million.

This impact is temporary as new price levels are expected to be effective during the third quarter.
Operating companies income grew by 19.7% to $1.3 billion, due to favorable currency of $210 million and higher pricing. These were partially offset by unfavorable volume/mix due to total market declines, in addition to the factors mentioned above.
