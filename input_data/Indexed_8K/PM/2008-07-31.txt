Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On July 31, 2008, Philip Morris International Inc. (the "Company") entered into a Support Agreement (as it may be amended from time to time, the "Agreement") with Rothmans Inc., a corporation existing under the federal laws of Canada ("Rothmans"), and Latin America and Canada Holdings Limited, a Nova Scotia limited liability company that is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company ("Offeror"). Rothmans' sole holding is a 60% interest in Rothmans, Benson & Hedges Inc. ("RBH"). The remaining 40% interest in RBH is currently owned by a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.
Subject to the terms and conditions of the Agreement, the Offeror will commence a takeover bid pursuant to Canadian securities laws (the "Offer") to purchase all of the outstanding common shares of Rothmans, including the associated common share purchase rights issued pursuant to the shareholder rights plan agreement, dated as of July 25, 2006, between Rothmans and CIBC Mellon Trust Company (collectively, the "Common Shares") at a price of CDN $30.00 per share in cash (the "Offer Price").
If more than 66

%, but fewer than 90%, of the outstanding Common Shares, on a fully diluted basis, are validly tendered (and not withdrawn) in the Offer, the Offeror may elect to take up and pay for such Common Shares and simultaneously extend the Offer period in order to acquire additional outstanding Common Shares. If the Offeror acquires more than 90% of the outstanding Common Shares, it intends to acquire the Common Shares which were not tendered by shareholders in the Offer by means of a compulsory acquisition or an amalgamation, statutory arrangement or other subsequent acquisition transaction under Canadian laws, as a result of which each outstanding Common Share will be converted into the right to receive the Offer Price in cash.
The Offeror's obligation to accept for payment and pay for Common Shares tendered in the Offer is subject to customary conditions, including, among other things: (1) the tender of at least 66

% of the total number of outstanding Common Shares, on a fully diluted basis, (2) receipt of approvals required under the Competition Act (Canada) and Investment Canada Act, (3) compliance by Rothmans and RBH with the terms of the settlement with the Government of Canada announced by Rothmans on July 31, 2008, (4) the absence of injunctions or orders permanently restraining or enjoining the Offer or a Subsequent Transaction, (5) the absence of a material adverse effect (as defined in the Agreement), (6) the accuracy of Rothmans' representations in the Agreement (subject to certain materiality qualifications), and (7) compliance in all material respects by Rothmans with its covenants in the Agreement.
Rothmans has made customary representations, warranties and covenants in the Agreement, including, among others, covenants not to solicit proposals relating to alternative business combination transactions or, subject to certain exceptions, not to enter into discussions concerning, or provide information in connection with, alternative business combination transactions. Subject to certain exceptions, Rothmans has also agreed not to withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to the Company, the recommendation of Rothmans' board that shareholders accept the Offer and tender their Common Shares in the Offer.
The Agreement contains certain termination rights for both the Company and Rothmans and provides that, if the Agreement is terminated under specified circumstances, Rothmans may be required to pay the Company a termination fee of approximately 2% of the consideration payable to shareholders in the Offer and, under other specified circumstances, the Company may be required to pay Rothmans a termination fee of approximately 4% of the consideration payable to shareholders in the Offer. Under certain circumstances, the Company and Rothmans may also be required to make expense reimbursement payments of up to approximately 1% of the consideration payable to shareholders in the Offer.
The foregoing description of the Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Agreement, which is attached as Exhibit 10.1 to this report and is hereby incorporated by reference to this Item 1.01. The Agreement has been attached to provide investors with information regarding its terms. The terms and information in the Agreement should not be relied on as disclosure about the Company without consideration of the periodic and current reports and statements that the Company files with the SEC. The terms of the Agreement (such as the representations and warranties) govern the contractual rights and relationships, and allocate risks, among the parties in relation to the Offer. In particular, the representations and warranties made by the parties to each other in the Agreement have been negotiated among the parties with the principal purpose of setting forth their respective rights with respect to their obligation pertaining to the Offer should events or circumstances change or be different from those stated in the representations and warranties. There may be changes from the state of affairs contemplated by the representations and warranties. None of the parties to the Agreement undertakes any obligation to publicly release any revisions to these representations and warranties, except as required under U.S. federal or other applicable securities laws.
Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On July 31, 2008, the Company issued a press release announcing that it entered into an agreement with Rothmans to purchase all of the outstanding Common Shares of Rothmans. The description of the Agreement is set forth in Item 1.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K.
Also, as described in the press release, on July 31, 2008, Rothmans announced the finalization of a CAD $550 million settlement between itself, RBH and the Government of Canada and all ten provinces. The settlement resolves the Royal Canadian Mounted Police's investigation relating to products exported from Canada by RBH during the 1989-1996 period.
As a result of the finalization of the settlement described above, PMI has revised its second quarter 2008 results that were set forth in PMI's earnings press release issued and furnished to the SEC on Form 8-K (Item 2.02) on July 23, 2008. The revision will record an after-tax, non-cash charge of $124 million. The charge, which will be included in the operating results of the Latin America segment, represents the present value of PMI's 40% equity interest in RBH's portion of the settlement (CAD $350 million) and will reduce PMI's reported second quarter net earnings by $124 million to $1.7 billion. Diluted and basic earnings per share will be revised from $0.86 to $0.80 and from $0.87 to $0.81, respectively, as per the schedules attached to the press release.
PMI anticipates that the transaction will not affect 2008 full-year results and will be modestly accretive to earnings per share in 2009.
Consequently, PMI reaffirms its forecast for 2008 adjusted full-year diluted earnings per share, previously announced on July 23, 2008, projecting growth of approximately 19% to 21% to a range of $3.32 to $3.38 from a 2007 pro-forma adjusted base of $2.79.
The press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 hereto, and the information provided under the captions "Revision of 2008 Second Quarter Results" and "Reaffirms 2008 Annual Guidance" is incorporated by reference to this Item 2.02.
In accordance with General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the information in Item 2.02 of the Current Report on Form 8-K, including Exhibit 99.1, shall not be deemed "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section and shall not be incorporated by reference into any filing or other document pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing or document.
Item 8.01. Other Events.
On July 31, 2008, the Company issued a press release which is attached as Exhibit 99.1. This press release shall not be deemed "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section and shall not be incorporated by reference into any filing or other document pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing or document.
This press release contains projections of future results and other forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties (including the risks relating to the expected timing of the completion and realization of financial benefits of the Offer and Subsequent Transactions) and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor Provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
PMI is subject to other risks detailed from time to time in its publicly filed documents, including the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2008. PMI cautions that the list of important factors is not complete and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements that it may make.

(i) provide information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the person making such Acquisition Proposal (and its Representatives) pursuant to a confidentiality agreement (no less favourable to the Company than the Confidentiality and Standstill Agreement); that all such information has previously been provided to Offeror or is provided to Offeror prior to or substantially concurrent with the time it is provided to such person; and
provided
(ii) participate in discussions or negotiations with the person making such Acquisition Proposal (and its Representatives) regarding such Acquisition Proposal.
(d) Neither the Board of Directors nor any committee thereof shall (i) (x) withdraw, modify or qualify in any manner adverse to Parent or Offeror the Recommendation, or (y) take any other action or make any public statement in connection with the Recommendation or Offer with the intent and effect of being adverse in any material respect to the Recommendation or Offer or adopt or recommend, or fail to publicly reaffirm its recommendation of the Offer within seven calendar days of receipt of a written request by Offeror to provide such reaffirmation following any Acquisition Proposal, or propose publicly to adopt or recommend to the Shareholders, any Acquisition Proposal (any action described in this clause (i) being referred to as an "") or (ii) approve, adopt or recommend, or publicly propose to approve, adopt or recommend, or allow the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement, or other similar contract (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in Section 6.2(c)(i)) or any tender offer constituting or related to, or that is intended to or could reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal.
Adverse Recommendation Change
(e) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 6.2(d), at any time prior to the Effective Time and subject to Section 6.2(f), (i) the Board of Directors may make an Adverse Recommendation Change if the Board of Directors has concluded in good faith, after receiving the advice of its outside legal counsel, that the failure of the Board of Directors to take such action would be reasonably likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law and/or (ii) the Company may execute or enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal in accordance with Section 7.1(d)(ii). Any such Adverse Recommendation Change shall not change the approval of this Agreement or any other approval of the Board of Directors, and other than following a termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(ii) or 7.1(d)(ii) to accept a Superior Proposal, the Company shall not take any actions to suspend or delay the separation or exercise of the Rights with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or a Superior Proposal.

Offeror and its counsel and other advisors shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment in advance on the form and content of any such press release. Such press release shall state that the Board of Directors has determined that the Acquisition Proposal is not a Superior Proposal.
(h) Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the Board of Directors from responding through a directors' circular or otherwise as required by Applicable Securities Laws to an Acquisition Proposal that it determines is not a Superior Proposal. Offeror and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the form and content of any such directors' circular prior to its printing, recognizing that whether or not such comments are appropriate will be determined by the Company, acting reasonably.
 
Each party shall give prompt notice to the other of:
(a) the discovery of any fact or circumstance that, or the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event the occurrence or non-occurrence of which, would be reasonably likely to cause or result in any of the conditions of the Offer set forth in Schedule A hereto not being satisfied or satisfaction of those conditions being materially delayed in violation of any provision of this Agreement;

Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable Law, the Company agrees to provide Parent and Offeror and their representatives with reasonable access (without unreasonable disruption to the conduct of the Company's and its Subsidiaries' businesses) during normal business hours to all books, records, information, corporate charts, documents relating to Taxes, filings, memoranda, working papers and files and all other materials in its possession and control, including contracts, and access to the personnel of the Company and its Subsidiaries on an as reasonably requested basis as well as reasonable access to the properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries in order to allow Parent and Offeror to conduct such investigations as Offeror may consider necessary or advisable for strategic planning and integration, and for any other reasons reasonably relating to any Contemplated Transactions, and further agrees to assist Offeror in all reasonable ways in any such investigations that Offeror may wish to conduct. Any such investigation by Offeror and its advisors shall not mitigate, diminish or affect the representations and warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement or any document or certificate given pursuant hereto.
The Offeror and Parent acknowledge that the information provided to them under this Section 6.4 may be non-public and/or proprietary in nature and will be subject to the Confidentiality and Standstill Agreement.
 
(a) Parent and Offeror will, or will cause the Company to, maintain in effect without any reduction in amount or scope for six years from the Effective Time policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance providing protection comparable to the protection provided by the policies maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries that are in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time and providing protection in respect of claims arising from facts or events which occurred on or prior to the Effective Time; , , that Parent, Offeror and the Company will not be required, in order to maintain or cause to be maintained such directors' and officers' liability insurance policy, to pay an annual premium in excess of 200% of the cost of the policies existing on the date hereof; and , , that if equivalent coverage cannot be obtained or can only be obtained by paying an annual premium in excess of 200% of such amount, Parent, Offeror and the Company shall only be required to obtain or cause to be obtained as much coverage as can be obtained by paying an annual premium equal to 200% of such amount. Furthermore, prior to the Effective Time, the Company may, in the alternative, purchase run off directors' and officers' liability insurance for a period of up to six years from the Effective Time, that the premium is not required to exceed 200% of the premium currently charged to the Company for directors' and officers' liability insurance, and in such event none of Parent, Offeror, the Company or any of the Company's Subsidiaries will have any further obligation under this Section 6.5(a).

(b) The Offeror agrees that it shall directly honour all rights to indemnification or exculpation by the Company or its Subsidiaries now existing in favour of present and former officers and directors of the Company and its Subsidiaries (including those rights to indemnification specified in indemnity agreements entered into by the Company and its Subsidiaries with their directors and officers), which shall survive the completion of the Offer and the provisions of this Section 6.5 shall be binding, jointly and severally, on all successors of the Offeror.
(c) (i) Parent hereby irrevocably guarantees the performance and satisfaction of the Offeror's obligations pursuant to Section 6.5(b) to present and former officers and to persons who are directors as of the Effective Time, in each case of the Company and its Subsidiaries (collectively, the "").

For greater certainty, it shall not be necessary for the Parent Indemnitee to pay such Defense Expenses and then seek reimbursement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Parent Indemnitee shall be obligated to reimburse and refund any payments made by Parent pursuant to this Section 6.5(c)(ii) to the same extent and on the same terms that any such payments would be required to be reimbursed and refunded by such Parent Indemnitee to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, under the terms of the indemnification agreements and obligations existing as of the date hereof. The foregoing provisions of this Section 6.5(c)(ii) shall not require Parent to indemnify, advance, reimburse or hold harmless any Parent Indemnitee with respect to any costs and expenses for which the Company and its Subsidiaries are not required, as a result of the final disposition of any action or proceeding, to provide indemnification.

The Company, Parent and Offeror confirm that the rights of indemnified persons under this Section 6.5 shall not be prejudiced or limited in any way by the Settlement and the Company, Parent and Offeror will not raise any objection to indemnification based in any way upon the Settlement.
(e) Each of Parent and Offeror agrees that it will cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to honour and comply with the terms of all employment, severance, change of control and indemnification agreements, arrangements or policies of the Company and its Subsidiaries in existence at the Effective Time, that nothing shall prevent the termination or amendment of any agreement that is terminable or amendable in accordance with its terms.
provided
(f) For a period of at least eighteen months following the Effective Time, each of Parent and Offeror agrees that it will cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to:
(i) provide Affected Employees who remain employed with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with base salary and Employee Plans (other than bonus, deferred compensation, incentive compensation and any other payments based on performance) at least as favourable in the aggregate for each Affected Employee as the base salary and such Employee Plans provided to Affected Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time;
(ii) provide bonus, deferred compensation, incentive compensation and similar plans based on business performance (x) as provided immediately prior to the Effective Time, or (y) if amended to be consistent with Parent's global incentive compensation plans, the terms of which shall provide opportunities for incentive compensation substantially comparable in the aggregate to the terms of the incentive compensation programs provided to Affected Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time; and
(iii) follow any material Affected Employee severance policies that were followed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time, subject to applicable Laws, with respect to the termination without cause of the employment of any Affected Employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.
(g) Neither Parent nor Offeror shall prohibit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries from providing Affected Employees with credit for service with the Company and its Subsidiaries and/or their respective predecessors under Employee Plans as recognized and for the purposes recognized immediately prior to the Effective Time (but not for benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension plan), that such crediting of service shall not operate to duplicate any benefit or the funding of any such benefit.
provided
 
(h) The benefits to be provided under this Section 6.5 shall in any case only be provided on the basis that such benefits do not constitute a collateral agreement, commitment or understanding with any shareholder of the Company that has the effect of providing to such shareholder, as a consequence of the Offer, a consideration of greater value than that offered pursuant to the Offer, except for benefits to be received solely in connection with services as an employee, director or consultant of the Company or its affiliates or of a successor to the business of the Company.
 
The Company shall promptly notify Offeror forthwith of any claim brought by (or threatened to be brought by) any present, former or purported holder of any securities of the Company in connection with the Contemplated Transactions prior to the Effective Time. The Company shall consult with Offeror prior to settling any such claim and shall not settle or compromise, or agree to settle or compromise any such claim without the prior written consent of Offeror.
 
Offeror will use commercially reasonable best efforts to promptly take such action, including obtaining any exemption orders, consents or approvals or filing any such documents, as may be required under Applicable Securities Laws to permit Offeror to make the Offer and perform Offeror's other obligations hereunder, and the Company shall co-operate in good faith in connection with any such action by Offeror.
 
(a) Offeror and the Company agree to co-operate in good faith and to take all reasonable steps and actions after the date hereof, as are not adverse to the party requested to take any such step or action, to complete the Contemplated Transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable.
(b) In addition, in the event that:
(i) Offeror concludes, acting reasonably, that it is necessary or desirable to proceed with another form of transaction (such as a plan of arrangement or amalgamation) whereby Offeror or any of its affiliates would effectively acquire all of the Common Shares within approximately the same time periods and on economic terms and other terms and conditions (including, without limitation, tax treatment) and having consequences to the Company and the Shareholders that are equivalent to or better than those contemplated by this Agreement (an ""), and
Alternative Transaction
(ii) the Company concludes, acting reasonably, that no action or actions required to be taken by it or by the Company's Subsidiaries in connection with such Alternative Transaction (and not required to be taken in connection with the Offer) prior to the consummation thereof would result in a Material Adverse Effect,
 
the Company agrees to support the completion of such Alternative Transaction in the same manner as the Offer and shall otherwise fulfill its covenants contained in this Agreement in respect of such Alternative Transaction.
 
Parent and Offeror further agree that, following the Effective Time, they shall and shall cause the Company and RBH to continue to implement and comply in all material respects with the terms of the Settlement to the extent required by the terms thereof.

(a) For greater certainty, the parties agree that:
(i) the Termination Payment to be received pursuant to Section 7.2(a) and the Expense Reimbursement Payment to be received pursuant to Section 7.2(b) are the sole remedies in compensation or damages of Parent, Offeror and any Parent Assignee with respect to the event or events giving rise to the termination of this Agreement and the resulting Termination Payment Event or the resulting Expense Reimbursement Payment Event, as applicable; and

This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument signed by each of the parties hereto.
 
At any time prior to the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1: (a) the Company may extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of Offeror or Parent or waive compliance with any of the agreements of Offeror or Parent or with any conditions to the Company's own obligations, in each case only to the extent such obligations, agreements and conditions are intended for the Company's benefit, and (b) Parent or
 
Offeror may extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the Company or waive compliance with any of the agreements of the Company or with any conditions to their own obligations, in each case only to the extent such obligations, agreements and conditions are intended for Parent or Offeror's benefit.
 
 
Subject to Section 7.2, the parties agree that all costs and expenses of the parties relating to the Offer and the Contemplated Transactions, including legal fees, accounting fees, financial advisory fees, regulatory filing fees, stock exchange fees, all disbursements of advisors and printing and mailing costs, shall be paid by the party incurring such expenses.
 
Parent, Offeror and the Company represent and warrant to each other that, with the exception of JPMorgan and its affiliates, for whose fees and expenses Offeror and Parent shall be solely liable, and the Financial Advisor and its affiliates, for whose fees and expenses the Company shall be solely liable, no securityholder, director, officer, employee, consultant, broker, finder or investment banker is entitled to any brokerage, finder's or other fee or commission, or to the reimbursement of any of its expenses, in connection with the Offer or any similar transaction based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent, Offeror or the Company, as the case may be.
 
Except as required by applicable Law or applicable stock exchange requirements, none of Parent, Offeror and the Company shall make any public announcement or statement with respect to this Agreement, the Offer or the other Contemplated Transactions without the approval of the other parties, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Moreover, in any event, each party agrees to give prior notice to the others of any public announcement relating to the Offer or this Agreement and agrees to consult with each other prior to issuing each such public announcement, to the extent practicable. Each of Offeror and the Company agrees that, promptly after the entering into of this Agreement, the parties shall issue one or more press releases announcing the entering into of this Agreement, which press release(s) shall be satisfactory in form and substance to each of the parties, acting reasonably.
 
The parties agree that all information of a confidential nature relating to a party or its business that is disclosed to the other party in accordance with this Agreement or in connection with the Offer and the Contemplated Transactions shall be subject to the Confidentiality and Standstill Agreement and shall be held in strictest confidence.
 
The parties acknowledge and agree that an award of money damages would be inadequate for any breach of this Agreement by any party or its representatives and any such breach would cause the non-breaching party irreparable harm. For greater certainty, (i) the acceptance of the Parent Termination Payment by the Company shall not preclude the entitlement of the Company to equitable relief, including injunctive relief and specific performance, as contemplated below, and (ii) the acceptance of the Termination Payment by Parent or the Parent Assignee shall not preclude the entitlement of Parent or Offeror to equitable relief, including injunctive relief and specific performance, as contemplated below.
Accordingly, the parties agree that, in the event of any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement by one of the parties, the non-breaching party will also be entitled, without the requirement of posting a bond or other security, to equitable relief, including injunctive relief and specific performance. Such remedies will not be the exclusive remedies for any breach of this Agreement but will be in addition to all other remedies available at law or equity to each of the parties.
 
Any notice, consent, waiver, direction or other communication required or permitted to be given under this Agreement by a party shall be in writing and may be given by sending the same by facsimile transmission or by delivery addressed to the party to which the notice is to be given at its address for service in this Agreement. Any notice, consent, waiver, direction or other communication aforesaid shall, if delivered, be deemed to have been given and received on the date on which it was delivered to the address provided in this Agreement (if a business day, and if not, the next succeeding business day) and if sent by facsimile transmission be deemed to have been given and received at the time of receipt (if a business day, if not the next succeeding business day) unless actually received after 4:30 p.m. (Toronto time) at the point of delivery in which case it shall be deemed to have been given and received on the next business day.

Material Contracts
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
 
 
NEW YORK, July 31, 2008  Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE/Euronext Paris: PM) announced today that the company has entered into an agreement with Rothmans Inc. (Rothmans) to purchase, by way of a tender offer, all of the outstanding common shares of Rothmans. The agreement and related offer have the unanimous support of the Board of Directors of Rothmans.
Rothmans' sole holding is a 60% interest in Rothmans, Benson & Hedges Inc. (RBH). The remaining 40% interest in RBH is currently owned by PMI and, as a result of this transaction, RBH will become wholly owned by PMI. PMI and Rothmans have been joint shareholders of RBH since 1986.
PMI agreed to make the offer following Rothmans' and RBH's finalization of the CAD $550 million settlement, announced today in a separate release issued by Rothmans, with the Government of Canada and all ten provinces. The settlement resolves the Royal Canadian Mounted Police's investigation relating to products exported from Canada by RBH during the 1989-1996 period.
 
"This proposed acquisition is a win-win for both Rothmans and PMI shareholders," said Louis C. Camilleri, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of PMI. "Rothmans shareholders will receive a significant cash premium and PMI consolidates its presence in a market that we deem financially attractive and of strategic importance going forward. The transaction is projected to be modestly accretive to PMI's earnings per share in 2009. We look forward to welcoming the talented management team and employees of RBH into the PMI family and building upon their solid track record of growth," said Mr. Camilleri.
Revision of 2008 Second Quarter Results
As a result of the finalization of the settlement by Rothmans and RBH described above, PMI has revised its second quarter 2008 results to record an after-tax, non-cash charge of $124 million. The charge, which will be included in the operating results of the Latin America segment, represents the present value of PMI's 40% equity interest in RBH's portion of the settlement (CAD $350 million) and will reduce PMI's reported second quarter net earnings by $124 million to $1.7 billion. Diluted and basic earnings per share will be revised from $0.86 to $0.80 and from $0.87 to $0.81, respectively, as per the attached schedules.
Reaffirms 2008 Annual Guidance
PMI anticipates that the transaction will not affect 2008 full-year results and will be modestly accretive to earnings per share in 2009.
Consequently, PMI reaffirms its forecast for 2008 adjusted full-year diluted earnings per share, previously announced on July 23, projecting growth of approximately 19% to 21% to a range of $3.32 to $3.38 from a 2007 pro-forma adjusted base of $2.79.
Transaction
Under the terms of the agreement, PMI will launch a public tender offer to purchase all of the outstanding common stock of Rothmans for CAD $30.00 per share in cash, for an aggregate transaction value of approximately CAD $2.0 billion on a fully-diluted basis. The all-cash offer represents a premium of approximately 16.9% over Rothmans' twenty-day volume-weighted average trading price on the Toronto Stock Exchange through July 30, 2008, prior to the public disclosure of the CAD $550 million settlement reached by Rothmans and RBH with the Government of Canada and all provinces.
The Board of Directors of Rothmans, based on the recommendation of a special committee of independent directors and upon consultation with its financial and legal advisors, has determined that the offer is fair to Rothmans shareholders from a financial point of view, is in the best interests of Rothmans and that Rothmans shareholders should accept the offer and tender their shares. Rothmans has also received an opinion from its financial advisor, BMO Nesbitt Burns (a leading North American financial services provider), that the offer is fair from a financial point of view.
 
Full details of the offer, and the reasons for the recommendation of the Rothmans Board of Directors that Rothmans shareholders tender their shares, are expected to be mailed to Rothmans shareholders within ten days from the date of this release. A copy of the agreement will also be publicly filed in Canada and made available on SEDAR at and will be filed by PMI with the SEC in the United States.
www.sedar.com
The tender offer is expected to commence within ten days from the date of this release, will remain open for acceptance for a minimum of 35 days and is expected to be completed by September 30, 2008. PMI's obligation to acquire the tendered shares will be subject to various conditions, including (i) the valid deposit of at least 66-2/3% of the outstanding shares on a fully-diluted basis; (ii) receipt of Competition Act and Investment Canada approvals; and (iii) the non-occurrence of a material adverse effect. If these conditions are met, PMI will purchase the shares tendered by shareholders in the offer. Following completion of the tender offer, PMI expects to enter into a second-step transaction, pursuant to which each Rothmans share that was not tendered will be converted into the right to receive CAD $30.00 in cash. Upon completion of this second-step transaction, Rothmans will become a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of PMI.
Synergies
Successful completion of the transaction will allow the Canadian business to fully benefit from PMI's global infrastructure. Cost savings and productivity improvement opportunities are expected through purchasing synergies for tobacco and raw materials, participation in supply contracts with PMI's global suppliers, increased investment in state-of-the-art manufacturing equipment and processes, lower financing costs, administrative cost savings associated with Rothmans ceasing to be a stand-alone publicly-traded company and the use of PMI's shared service infrastructure.
Canadian Tobacco Market
Total cigarette volume is estimated to have reached 38 billion units in 2007. The tax-paid market of approximately 30 billion units is mainly supplied by three major manufacturers. RBH has been the only growing major manufacturer in the highly profitable Canadian market and its share reached 33% in 2007.
The Canadian tobacco market consists primarily of Virginia-type cigarettes which account for approximately 99% of the overall market. In addition to cigarettes, a key feature of the Canadian market is the presence of a sizeable segment of fine cut tobacco, estimated to represent a cigarette equivalent of 2.8 billion units in 2007. According to the latest available data, RBH's share of the fine cut market in 2006 was approximately 57%.
A notable development in the Canadian market in recent years has been the emergence and subsequent growth of the value category which has grown, at the expense of the premium segment, from approximately 16% of the tax-paid market in 2003 to approximately 54% in 2007. RBH is the market leader in the value category with an approximate share of 47% and holds a 17% share of the premium segment.
