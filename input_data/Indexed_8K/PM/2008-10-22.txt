This press release contains projections of future results and other forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties and are made pursuant to the Safe
 
Harbor Provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The following important factors could cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from those contained in such forward-looking statements.
Philip Morris International Inc. and its tobacco subsidiaries (PMI) are subject to intense price competition; changes in consumer preferences and demand for their products; fluctuations in levels of customer inventories; increases in raw material costs; the effects of foreign economies and local economic and market conditions; unfavorable currency movements and changes to income tax laws. Their results are dependent upon their continued ability to promote brand equity successfully; to anticipate and respond to new consumer trends; to develop new products and markets and to broaden brand portfolios in order to compete effectively; and to improve productivity.
PMI is also subject to legislation and governmental regulation, including actual and potential excise tax increases; discriminatory excise tax structures; increasing marketing and regulatory restrictions; the effects of price increases related to excise tax increases on consumption rates and consumer preferences within price segments; health concerns relating to the use of tobacco products and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke; privately imposed smoking restrictions; and governmental investigations.

(a) This adjustment reflects the reversal of $15 million of pre-tax asset impairment and exit costs ($11 million after-tax) relating to the streamlining of various administrative functions.
(b) A subsidiary of Altria had provided us with certain services at cost plus a management fee. This adjustment reflects incremental costs of $23 million, partially offset by the related tax benefit of $7 million. These incremental costs reflect the expansion of services that were previously provided by Altria to reflect our status as a stand-alone public company.
(c) As part of the Spin-off, we paid to Altria $4.0 billion in special dividends, of which $3.1 billion were paid in 2007 and the remaining $900 million were paid in the first quarter of 2008. The pro forma adjusted statement of earnings has been adjusted to reflect the incremental interest expense we would have incurred if borrowings to finance the special dividends had been made on January 1, 2007. The incremental interest adjustment of $53 million, partially offset by the related tax benefit of $15 million, was computed by applying a rate of 5.24% (the average rate of our December 2007 borrowings that were incurred to pay Altria the dividend) to the total special dividends that were paid to Altria. An increase or (decrease) of one-eighth of 1% (12.5 basis points) in the interest rate associated with these variable rate borrowings would have increased or (decreased) our pro forma adjusted interest expense by $1.3 million.
(d) The 2007 reported effective tax rate included a tax benefit of $27 million related to the reduction of deferred tax liabilities resulting from future tax rates enacted in Germany. This adjustment reflects the reversal of this transaction.
(e) Basic and diluted earnings per share are calculated based on the number of our shares distributed by Altria on the Distribution Date.
