NEW YORK, October 22, 2009  Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE / Euronext Paris: PM) today announced reported diluted earnings per share of $0.93 in the third quarter of 2009, down by 7.9% from $1.01 in the third quarter of 2008, principally due to a $0.08 tax benefit recorded in 2008 as detailed on the attached Schedules 4 and 13. Excluding currency,
reported diluted earnings per share were up by 8.9%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share in the third quarter of 2009 and 2008 were $0.93, including the items detailed on the attached Schedule 12. Excluding currency, adjusted diluted earnings per share were up by 18.3%.
"The third quarter underscored our proven ability to deliver excellent results and improve our operating margins, with net revenues, adjusted operating companies income and earnings per share up, on a constant currency basis, by a strong 6.9%, 13.7% and 18.3%, respectively," said Louis Camilleri, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
"While we experienced lower organic volume in the quarter, this was largely anticipated given our pricing actions and the on-going impact of the economic crisis on total consumption levels, notably in Spain and Ukraine. Our year-to-date volume decline of 2.1% better reflects our estimated full-year organic volume performance."
"Our strong operating cash flow of $6.4 billion year-to-date enabled us to reward shareholders with a 7.4% increase in the dividend and our robust share repurchase program has remained uninterrupted since its inception."
Conference Call
A conference call, hosted by Hermann Waldemer, Chief Financial Officer, with members of the investment community and news media will be webcast at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time on October 22, 2009.Access is available at

2009 Full-Year Forecast
PMI increases its forecast for 2009 full-year reported diluted earnings per share to a range of $3.20 to $3.25, from $3.10 to $3.20, which includes, at current exchange rates, an unfavorable currency impact of approximately $0.52 per share. Excluding currency, diluted earnings per share are projected to increase by approximately 12%-14%. This guidance includes a pre-tax charge of $135 million ($93 million after-tax), equivalent to $0.04 per share, relating to the Colombian Investment and Cooperation Agreement announced during the second quarter of 2009, and excludes the impact of any potential future acquisitions, asset impairment and exit cost charges, and any unusual events.
The factors described in the Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements section of this release represent continuing risks to these projections.
 
Dividends and Share Repurchase Program
PMI increased its regular quarterly dividend during the quarter to $0.58, up 7.4% from $0.54, which represents an annualized rate of $2.32 per common share.
During the third quarter, PMI spent $1.5 billion to repurchase 31.5 million shares of its common stock. Since May 2008, when PMI began its previously-announced $13 billion, two-year share repurchase program, the company has spent a total of $9.6 billion to repurchase 209.6 million shares.
Acquisitions and Agreements
On September 14, 2009, PMI completed the purchase of Swedish Match South Africa (Proprietary) Limited (SMSA) for ZAR 1.98 billion (approximately $262 million), including acquired cash and working capital. While this acquisition did not impact third quarter results, it is anticipated to be immediately marginally accretive to PMI's earnings per share.
Management reviews operating companies income (OCI), which is defined as operating income before corporate expenses and amortization of intangibles, to evaluate segment performance and to allocate resources. In the following discussion, the term "net revenues" refers to net revenues, excluding excise taxes, unless otherwise stated. Management also reviews OCI, operating margins and EPS on an adjusted basis (which may exclude the impact of currency and other items such as acquisitions or asset impairment and exit charges), EBITDA and net debt. Management believes it is appropriate to disclose these measures to help investors analyze business performance and trends. For a reconciliation of operating companies income to operating income, see the Condensed Statements of Earnings contained in this release. Reconciliations of adjusted measures to corresponding GAAP measures are also provided in this release. References to total international cigarette market, total cigarette market, total market and market shares are PMI estimates based on a number of sources. Comparisons are to the same prior-year period unless otherwise stated.
 
 
 
Net revenues of $6.6 billion were down by 5.3% due to unfavorable currency of $846 million. Excluding currency, net revenues increased by 6.9%, primarily driven by favorable pricing of $590 million across all business segments, and the favorable impact of the 2008 Rothmans Inc., Canada acquisition, partly offset by unfavorable volume/mix, primarily in the EU and EEMA Regions. Excluding currency and acquisitions, net revenues increased by 4.1%.
 
Operating income declined 1.4% to $2.9 billion as shown on Schedule 1. Reported operating companies income declined 1.1% to $2.9 billion, due to unfavorable currency of $449 million.

Excluding the unfavorable impact of currency, adjusted operating companies income margin was up by 2.7 percentage points to 45.2% as detailed on Schedule 11.
 
PMI's cigarette shipment volume of 219.3 billion units was down by 2.9%, reflecting: gains in Latin America & Canada, from the acquisition of Rothmans Inc., offset by declines in the EU and EEMA due to the impact of the economic crisis, primarily in Spain and Ukraine; unfavorable comparisons due to a strong third quarter in 2008, mainly in EEMA; and declines in Asia due to trade inventory movements in Pakistan subsequent to the excise tax increase of June 2009. On an organic basis, which excludes acquisitions, PMI's cigarette shipment volume was down by 4.0%. However, on a year-to-date basis through September 2009, organic volume was down by 2.1%, which is more in line with PMI's expectations for the full year 2009.
Despite strong growth in Asia, total cigarette shipments of of 76.9 billion units were down by 4.3%, primarily due to market declines in the EU and EEMA, largely due to the

effects of the economic crisis in Spain and a softening of the premium segment in Russia and Ukraine. Total cigarette shipments of of 23.4 billion units were down by 2.8%, with double-digit growth in the EU, offset primarily by a decline in Russia.

In the EU, net revenues declined by 9.8% to $2.4 billion, mainly due to unfavorable currency of $304 million. Excluding the impact of currency and acquisitions, net revenues increased by 1.1%, primarily reflecting higher pricing of $173 million across most markets, including a favorable comparison with 2008 in the Czech Republic, which more than offset unfavorable volume/mix of $144 million, largely due to total market declines and unfavorable distributor inventory movements.

The total cigarette market in the EU declined by 1.6%. Adjusted for the favorable impact of the trade inventory distortion in the Czech Republic in anticipation of the January 2008 excise tax increase, the total cigarette market declined by 2.3%. The decline primarily reflects the impact of worsening economic conditions in Spain that were compounded by tax-driven price increases in June 2009.
PMI's cigarette shipment volume in the EU declined by 4.7%, primarily reflecting a lower total market as described above, and unfavorable distributor inventory movements, mainly in Spain.
PMI's market share in the EU was down by 0.2 share points to 38.9%.

Welcome. Thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a news release containing detailed information on our 2009 third-quarter results. You may access the release on our web site at www.pmintl.com.
As we take you through our call today, we will be talking about results in the third quarter of 2009 and comparing them with the same period in 2008 unless specified otherwise. References to volumes are for PMI shipments. Industry volume and share data is sourced from A.C. Nielsen, other third party sources and internal estimates. Organic volume refers to volume excluding acquisitions. Net revenue data excludes excise taxes.
You will find data tables showing how we made adjustments to revenues and Operating Companies Income, or "OCI", for currency and acquisitions, adjustments to EPS as well as other reconciliations to U.S. GAAP measures at the end of today's web cast slides, which are posted on our web site.
Today's remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results, and I direct your attention to the Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements disclosure in today's presentation and news release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections.
It's now my pleasure to introduce Hermann Waldemer, Chief Financial Officer.
Hermann,
HERMANN WALDEMER
Welcome to our third-quarter earnings call. In spite of the impact of the global economic recession, I am pleased to announce that PMI has achieved very strong third-quarter results that confirm our company's ability to grow profitability even in these difficult times.
We have achieved excellent financial results in the quarter, thanks to our strong pricing initiatives, with net revenues excluding currency up 6.9% and excluding currency and acquisitions up 4.1%, adjusted operating companies income, or
 
OCI, excluding currency up 13.7% and excluding currency and acquisitions up 10.6%, and adjusted diluted EPS excluding currency up 18.3%.
While we expect volume in 2009 to fall below last year's levels, the 4.0% organic decline in the quarter was amplified by specific circumstances in a few markets. Therefore, our year-to-date organic volume decline of 2.1% better reflects our anticipated full year volume performance.
On a year-to-date basis through the end of September, we have achieved a 4.7% increase in net revenues excluding currency and acquisitions, an 8.6% increase in adjusted OCI excluding currency and acquisitions, and a 15.4% increase in adjusted diluted EPS excluding currency.
This chart shows that in 2009 we have delivered consistently against our mid to long-term currency neutral financial targets in spite of recession-driven weaker volumes, thus demonstrating our ability to generate strong results even in the most turbulent of economic times.
We are today revising our EPS guidance for the full year 2009 to a level of $3.20 to $3.25. Compared to our previous guidance of $3.10 to $3.20, this represents both an increase in our guidance and a narrowing of the range.
The improved and narrowed guidance reflects the continued strength of our underlying business and a more favorable currency environment. We expect the currency impact to be neutral in the fourth quarter of this year and, at current exchange rates, it would be a tailwind in 2010. However, we will continue to focus on our constant currency growth rates as PMI will continue to manage its business in the long term interests of its shareholders.
The key driver of our improved profitability in 2009 has been our ability to successfully increase prices across nearly all our major markets while safeguarding our competitive position. I would like to emphasize again that our pricing decisions are established on a market by market basis, taking into account the competitive environment, consumer affordability and the fiscal and economic situation. We are confident that our price increases are sustainable and we will continue to balance revenue growth with volume growth going forward as, at the end of the day, shareholders are interested in Earnings Per Share rather than cigarettes per share.
Boosted by recent price increases in Germany and Spain, our pricing variance was $590 million in the third quarter for a total year-to-date variance of $1.5 billion.
 
Even though we increased prices this year at a somewhat faster rate than previously, consumer behavior has remained resilient during this recession. Consumer downtrading, which was a major concern of investors in the first half of the year, has remained a globally manageable phenomenon. It has had a substantial impact in three of our key markets that have been particularly affected by the economic crisis, namely Russia, Spain and Ukraine. The situation in the latter has been severely exacerbated by very large excise tax increases. Positive trends have, however, continued in other emerging markets, such as Argentina, Indonesia and Mexico.
In most markets the key economic component that tends to impact consumer behavior is unemployment, and in particular any sharp increases thereof. In this context, the consumer downtrading in Spain was therefore no surprise as unemployment has climbed to above 18% nationally and to 25% in the south of the country.
With the exception of Brazil and Ukraine, nearly all governments across the world have treated excise taxes so far in 2009 in a rational manner and they have benefitted from the positive impact on excise tax yields of higher retail prices.
We remain optimistic that such a rational approach will generally prevail as governments prepare their budget plans for 2010. Although we do expect some VAT increases, in addition to excise tax increases, as governments seek to boost their revenues, we believe that these should be globally manageable.
Let me now highlight our performance in some of our key markets. As I mentioned earlier, the magnitude of the organic volume decline in the quarter can be attributed to exceptional factors, with nearly two thirds of the decline coming from three markets: Ukraine, Spain and Pakistan.
In Ukraine, the massive excise tax increase in May this year, which led to retail prices increases that month alone of 22% to 50% on PMI brands, resulted in a severe market disruption and our shipments were down by 23.0% in the quarter, broadly in line with the total market contraction. While our share declined slightly in June due to the greater availability of old price competitive products in the market, it has since recovered to reach 35.6% in the third quarter, 0.1 share points above last year's level.
In Spain, the total cigarette market was down an estimated 10.2% in the quarter, due to the recession and higher retail prices, exacerbated by weak tourism. Our shipments declined by 23.5% due to unfavorable distributor inventory movements, as well as the overall market decline. Our market share in the
 
quarter was off just 0.2 points at 32.1%, with gains for nearly completely offsetting the decline of and .

The 16.1% shipment volume decline in Pakistan is attributable to trade inventory movements subsequent to the excise tax increase of June 2009.
In Russia, the total market, which grew at an estimated rate of some 4% in 2008, is declining at an estimated 3 to 4% this year, reflecting the economic downturn and the departure of an estimated two million migrant workers. In the third quarter, PMI shipments were down just 0.8%. Our market share was, however, up 0.6 points in the third quarter to reach 25.6%. This strong performance is attributable to the growth of in the value and in the low price segments, the resilience of , and the overall strength and range of our brand portfolio.

In Indonesia, market growth is trending at 3 to 4% this year, compared to an estimated 10% last year, even though the Indonesian economy has suffered less than others from the global economic downturn.

PMI's key brand, , continued to grow share and was up 0.5 share points in July/August to 10.7%, while 's share was also higher.

With respect to the intentions of the new Government in Japan as to the future of the tobacco sector, there is, at this stage, much speculation but nothing concrete. We expect clarification of their plans early next year. We continue to advocate regular, moderate excise tax increases combined with manufacturers' pricing freedom.
The highlight of our strong quarter in Asia was Korea. Our shipments increased by 21.4% and we gained 2.4 share points to a record quarterly level of 14.6%, due mainly to the continued strong performance of and .

I will now turn to our improved results in the European Union Region. Adjusted OCI excluding currency and acquisitions increased by 5.3% in the third quarter, helped by price increases in Germany and Spain that more than offset negative volume and mix. On a constant currency basis, our adjusted OCI margin grew by 2.2 points to 52.2%. Our market share was down slightly by 0.2 points at 38.9%, due to a weaker performance of in France, Germany and Spain. However, we are continuing to strengthen our second pillar in the EU Region: , already the Region's second best selling brand, gained 0.9 share points to reach a 5.7% regional share behind strong performances notably in Germany, Poland and Spain. We are optimistic that the roll-out in the EU Region of our innovation pipeline behind will start to bear fruit next year.

Our strength in the premium segment underpins our profitability and positions us very well to further grow profitably as the world economy gradually moves out of a recession, during which our cash flow has remained formidable. In the third quarter, our free cash flow totaled $1.7 billion and year-to-date it has reached $5.9 billion. Excluding the impact of currency on net earnings, free cash flow was 17.0% higher in the quarter and 12.4% higher in 2009 through the end of September.
Our commitment to enhance shareholder returns remains as strong as ever. Reflecting the strength of our underlying business, we increased our quarterly dividend in September by 7.4% to a level of $0.58 per share. At our current stock price of $50.82 per share, this represents an attractive yield of 4.6%.
We have continued to steadily implement our share repurchase program, spending a further $1.5 billion in the third quarter to buy back an additional 31.5 million shares. We now have $3.4 billion remaining in our $13 billion program, which runs through the end of April next year.
In 2009, we have so far returned a total of $7.4 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Since we were spun off in March 2008, the number rises to $15.0 billion, representing more than 15% of our current market cap.
Our financial strength is a key component of our success in the current difficult economic environment. It is reinforced by our excellent business momentum. The third quarter has illustrated again our ability to deliver against all our currency neutral financial targets. While volumes remain weaker than last year, we have more than offset this by higher prices, strong performances in most key markets, the continued benefits of our productivity and cost saving programs and we have intensified our efforts to optimize working capital levels.
 
Today, we have raised our 2009 EPS guidance for 2009 to $3.20 to $3.25, representing an increase of 12% to 14% compared to 2008 on a currency neutral basis.
Thank you for your interest in our company. I will now be happy to take your questions.
