Note 1. Background and Basis of Presentation:
Background
Philip Morris International Inc. is a holding company incorporated in Virginia, U.S.A., whose subsidiaries and affiliates and their licensees are engaged in the manufacture and sale of cigarettes and other tobacco products in markets outside of the United States of America. Throughout these financial statements, the term "PMI" refers to Philip Morris International Inc. and its subsidiaries.
Prior to March 28, 2008, PMI was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Altria Group, Inc. ("Altria"). On March 28, 2008 (the "Distribution Date"), Altria distributed all of its interest in PMI to Altria's stockholders in a tax-free transaction pursuant to Section 355 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. For information regarding PMI's separation from Altria and PMI's other transactions with Altria Group, Inc. and its affiliates, see Note 4. .
Transactions with Altria Group, Inc
Basis of presentation
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Significant estimates and assumptions include, among other things, pension and benefit plan assumptions, useful lives and valuation assumptions of goodwill and other intangible assets, marketing programs and income taxes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
The consolidated financial statements include PMI, as well as its wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries. Investments in which PMI exercises significant influence (generally 20%-50% ownership interest), are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Investments in which PMI has an ownership interest of less than 20%, or does not exercise significant influence, are accounted for with the cost method of accounting. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. Transactions between PMI and Altria are included in these consolidated financial statements.
Certain prior years' amounts have been revised to conform with the current year's presentation, due primarily to the adoption of new accounting rules regarding noncontrolling interests and earnings per share. The impact of these revisions was not material to PMI's consolidated financial statements in any of the prior periods presented.
PMI has evaluated subsequent events through February 11, 2010, which was the date of issuance of the consolidated financial statements as filed in PMI's Current Report on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies:
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash equivalents include demand deposits with banks and all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.
 
 
 
 
Depreciation, amortization and goodwill valuation
Property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost and depreciated by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Machinery and equipment are depreciated over periods ranging from 3 to 15 years, and buildings and building improvements over periods up to 40 years. Depreciation expense for 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $779 million, $798 million and $720 million, respectively.
Definite life intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives, which range from 5 to 40 years for trademarks and 10 to 30 years for distribution networks and other definite lived intangible assets. PMI is required to conduct an annual review of goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets for potential impairment. Goodwill impairment testing requires a comparison between the carrying value and fair value of each reporting unit. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, the goodwill is considered impaired. The amount of impairment loss is measured as the difference between the carrying value and implied fair value of goodwill, which is determined using discounted cash flows. Impairment testing for non-amortizable intangible assets requires a comparison between the fair value and carrying value of the intangible asset. If the carrying value exceeds fair value, the intangible asset is considered impaired and is reduced to fair value. In 2009, 2008 and 2007, PMI did not have to record a charge to earnings for an impairment of goodwill or non-amortizable intangible assets as a result of its annual reviews.
Foreign currency translation
PMI translates the results of operations of its subsidiaries and affiliates using average exchange rates during each period, whereas balance sheet accounts are translated using exchange rates at the end of each period. Currency translation adjustments are recorded as a component of stockholders' equity. In addition, some of PMI's subsidiaries have assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies, and to the extent those are not designated as net investment hedges, these assets and liabilities generate transaction gains and losses when translated into their respective functional currencies. PMI reported its net transaction gains of $9 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, losses of $54 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 and gains of $117 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, in marketing, administration and research costs on the consolidated statements of earnings.
Guarantees
PMI accounts for guarantees in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") authoritative guidance, which requires the disclosure of certain guarantees and requires the recognition of a liability for the fair value of the obligation of qualifying guarantee activities. See Note 21. for a further discussion of guarantees.
Contingencies
Hedging instruments
Derivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets as either assets or liabilities. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period either in accumulated other comprehensive earnings (losses) or in earnings, depending on whether a derivative is designated and effective as part of a hedge transaction and, if it is, the type of hedge transaction. Gains and losses on derivative instruments reported in accumulated other comprehensive earnings (losses) are reclassified to the consolidated statements of earnings in the periods in which operating results are affected by the hedged item. Cash flows from hedging instruments are classified in the same manner as the affected hedged item in the consolidated statements of cash flows.
 
 
 
 
Impairment of long-lived assets
PMI reviews long-lived assets, including amortizable intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. PMI performs undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists. For purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment for assets held for use, PMI groups assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identifiable. If an impairment is determined to exist, any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value. Impairment losses on assets to be disposed of, if any, are based on the estimated proceeds to be received, less costs of disposal.
Income taxes
Prior to the Distribution Date, the accounts of PMI were included in Altria's consolidated United States federal income tax return, and federal income taxes were computed on a separate company basis. PMI made payments to, or was reimbursed by, Altria for the tax effects resulting from its inclusion in Altria's consolidated United States federal income tax return. Beginning March 31, 2008, PMI was no longer a member of the Altria consolidated tax return group and filed its own federal consolidated income tax return.
Income tax provisions for jurisdictions outside the United States, as well as state and local income tax provisions, are determined on a separate company basis and the related assets and liabilities are recorded in PMI's consolidated balance sheets. Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions.
On January 1, 2007, PMI adopted the provisions of amended FASB authoritative guidance on the Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. This amendment prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. The amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. As a result of the January 1, 2007 adoption of this amendment, PMI recognized a $472 million decrease in unrecognized tax benefits, which resulted in an increase to stockholders' equity as of January 1, 2007 of $471 million and a reduction of federal deferred tax benefits of $1 million.
PMI recognizes accrued interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as part of the provision for income taxes on the consolidated statements of earnings.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. The first-in, first-out and average cost methods are used to cost substantially all inventories. It is a generally recognized industry practice to classify leaf tobacco inventory as a current asset although part of such inventory, because of the duration of the aging process, ordinarily would not be utilized within one year.
Marketing costs
PMI promotes its products with advertising, consumer incentives and trade promotions. Such programs include, but are not limited to, discounts, rebates, in-store display incentives and volume-based incentives. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Consumer incentive and trade promotion activities are recorded as a reduction of revenues based on amounts estimated as being due to customers and consumers at the end
 
 
 
 
of a period, based principally on historical utilization. For interim reporting purposes, advertising and certain consumer incentive expenses are charged to earnings as a percentage of sales, based on estimated sales and related expenses for the full year.
Revenue recognition
PMI recognizes revenues, net of sales incentives and including shipping and handling charges billed to customers, either upon shipment or delivery of goods when title and risk of loss pass to customers. PMI includes excise taxes billed to customers in revenues. Shipping and handling costs are classified as part of cost of sales and were $603 million, $639 million and $577 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
Software costs
PMI capitalizes certain computer software and software development costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining computer software for internal use. Capitalized software costs are included in property, plant and equipment on PMI's consolidated balance sheets and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the software, which do not exceed five years.
Stock-based compensation
PMI measures compensation cost for all stock-based awards at fair value on date of grant and recognizes the compensation costs over the service periods for awards expected to vest. The fair value of restricted stock and deferred stock is determined based on the number of shares granted and the market value at date of grant. The fair value of stock options is determined using a modified Black-Scholes methodology.
Prior to the Distribution Date, all employee stock incentive awards were granted by Altria.
Excess tax benefits from the vesting of stock-based awards of $26 and $16 million were recognized in additional paid in capital as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and were presented as financing cash flows.
New Accounting Standards
As discussed in Note 10. , PMI adopted the provisions of amended FASB authoritative guidance which requires that unvested share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends are participating securities and therefore shall be included in the earnings per share calculation pursuant to the two-class method.
Earnings Per Share
Effective January 1, 2009, PMI adopted the provisions of amended FASB authoritative guidance which changed the reporting for minority interest by requiring that noncontrolling interests be reported within equity. Additionally, this amendment requires that any transaction between an entity and a noncontrolling interest be accounted for as an equity transaction. The adoption of this amendment has been applied prospectively, except for the presentation and disclosure requirements, which have been adjusted retrospectively for all periods presented.
Effective January 1, 2009, PMI adopted the provisions of amended FASB authoritative guidance for Business Combinations. This amendment requires the recognition of assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree to be measured at fair value as of the acquisition date.
 
 
 
 
Additionally, costs incurred to effect the acquisition are to be recognized separately from the acquisition and expensed as incurred.
Effective January 1, 2009, PMI adopted the provisions of amended FASB authoritative guidance for Derivatives and Hedging. This amendment requires disclosures about how and why a company uses derivative instruments, how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect the company's financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. This amendment is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008. PMI has amended its disclosures accordingly.
The adoption of the new authoritative guidance noted above did not have a material impact on PMI's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Note 3. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, net:
Goodwill and other intangible assets, net, by segment were as follows (in millions):
 
Goodwill is due primarily to PMI's acquisitions in Canada, Indonesia, Mexico, Greece, Serbia, Colombia and Pakistan. The movements in goodwill are as follows (in millions):
 
 
 
 
 
The increase in goodwill from acquisitions during 2009 was due primarily to the final purchase price allocation for PMI's September 2009 purchase of Swedish Match South Africa (Proprietary) Limited, its February 2009 purchase of the tobacco business and its 2008 acquisition of Rothmans Inc. in Canada.
Petteres
The increase in goodwill from acquisitions during 2008 was due primarily to the preliminary allocation of purchase price for PMI's 2008 acquisition in Canada, as well as the final allocation of purchase price for PMI's 2007 acquisitions in Mexico and Pakistan. For further details, see Note 6. .
Acquisitions
Additional details of other intangible assets were as follows (in millions):
 
Non-amortizable intangible assets substantially consist of trademarks from PMI's acquisitions in Indonesia in 2005 and Mexico in 2007. Amortizable intangible assets consist of certain trademarks, distribution networks and non-compete agreements associated with acquisitions. Pre-tax amortization expense for intangible assets during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $74 million, $44 million and $28 million, respectively. Amortization expense for each of the next five years is estimated to be $80 million or less, assuming no additional transactions occur that require the amortization of intangible assets.
The increase in other intangible assets during 2009 was due primarily to currency and the purchase price allocation for the above-mentioned February 2009 purchase of the tobacco business and the September 2009 purchase of Swedish Match South Africa (Proprietary) Limited. For further details, see Note 6. .

Acquisitions
Note 4. Transactions with Altria Group, Inc.:
Separation from Altria Group, Inc.
On January 30, 2008, the Altria Board of Directors announced Altria's plans to spin off all of its interest in PMI to Altria's stockholders in a tax-free transaction pursuant to Section 355 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code (the "Spin-off"). The distribution of all of the PMI shares owned by Altria was made on March 28, 2008 (the "Distribution Date") to stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 19, 2008 (the "Record Date"). Altria distributed one share of PMI common stock for each share of Altria common stock outstanding as of the Record Date.
Holders of Altria stock options were treated similarly to public stockholders and, accordingly, had their stock awards split into two instruments. Holders of Altria stock options received the following stock options, which, immediately after the Spin-off, had an aggregate intrinsic value equal to the intrinsic value of the pre-spin Altria options:
 
 
 
 
 
As stipulated by the Employee Matters Agreement between PMI and Altria, the exercise price of each option was developed to reflect the relative market values of PMI and Altria shares by allocating the price of Altria common stock before the distribution ($73.83) to PMI shares ($51.44) and Altria shares ($22.39), and then multiplying each of these allocated values by the Option Conversion Ratio. The Option Conversion Ratio was equal to the exercise price of the Altria option, prior to any adjustment for the distribution, divided by $73.83. As a result, the new PMI option and the adjusted Altria option have an aggregate intrinsic value equal to the intrinsic value of the pre-split Altria option.
Holders of Altria restricted stock or deferred stock awarded prior to January 30, 2008, retained their existing awards and received the same number of shares of restricted or deferred stock of PMI. The restricted stock and deferred stock will not vest until the completion of the original restriction period (typically, three years from the date of the original grant). Recipients of Altria deferred stock awarded on January 30, 2008, who were employed by Altria after the Distribution Date, received additional shares of deferred stock of Altria to preserve the intrinsic value of the award. Recipients of Altria deferred stock awarded on January 30, 2008, who were employed by PMI after the Distribution Date, received substitute shares of PMI deferred stock to preserve the intrinsic value of the award.
To the extent that employees of Altria and its remaining subsidiaries received PMI stock options, Altria reimbursed PMI in cash for the Black-Scholes fair value of the stock options received. To the extent that employees of PMI or its subsidiaries held Altria stock options, PMI reimbursed Altria in cash for the Black-Scholes fair value of the stock options. To the extent that employees of Altria and its remaining subsidiaries received PMI deferred stock, Altria paid PMI the fair value of the PMI deferred stock less the value of projected forfeitures. To the extent that employees of PMI or its subsidiaries held Altria restricted stock or deferred stock, PMI reimbursed Altria in cash for the fair value of the restricted or deferred stock less the value of projected forfeitures and any amounts previously charged to PMI for the restricted or deferred stock. Based upon the number of Altria stock awards outstanding at the Distribution Date, the net amount of these reimbursements resulted in a payment of $449 million from Altria to PMI. This reimbursement from Altria is reflected as an increase to the additional paid-in capital of PMI on the December 31, 2008 consolidated balance sheet.
Prior to the Spin-off, PMI was included in the Altria consolidated federal income tax return, and federal income tax contingencies were recorded as liabilities on the balance sheet of Altria. In April 2008, Altria reimbursed PMI in cash for these liabilities, which were $97 million.
Prior to the Spin-off, certain employees of PMI participated in the U.S. benefit plans offered by Altria. After the Distribution Date, the benefits previously provided by Altria are now provided by PMI. As a result, new plans have been established by PMI, and the related plan assets (to the extent that the benefit plans were previously funded) and liabilities have been transferred to the new plans. The transfer of these benefits resulted in PMI recording additional liabilities of $103 million in its consolidated balance sheet, partially offset by the related deferred tax assets ($22 million) and an adjustment to stockholders' equity ($26 million). During 2008, Altria paid PMI $55 million related to the transfer of these benefits.
A subsidiary of Altria provided PMI with certain corporate services at cost plus a management fee. After the Distribution Date, PMI undertook these activities, and services provided to PMI ceased in 2008. All
 
 
 
 
intercompany accounts with Altria were settled in cash. As shown in the table below, the settlement of the intercompany accounts (including the amounts discussed above related to stock awards, tax contingencies and benefit plan liabilities) resulted in a net payment from Altria to PMI of $275 million.
 
As part of the Spin-off, PMI paid $4.0 billion in special dividends in addition to its normal dividends to Altria. PMI paid $3.1 billion of these special dividends in 2007 and the remaining $900 million in the first quarter of 2008.
Corporate services
Through March 28, 2008, Altria's subsidiary, Altria Corporate Services, Inc. ("ALCS"), provided PMI with various services, including certain planning, legal, treasury, accounting, auditing, risk management, human resources, office of the secretary, corporate affairs, information technology and tax services. Billings for these services, which were based on the estimated cost to ALCS to provide such services and a management fee, were $13 million and $127 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. PMI believes that the billings were reasonable based on the level of support provided by ALCS and that they reflect all services provided. These costs were paid monthly to ALCS. The effects of these transactions were included in operating cash flows in PMI's consolidated statements of cash flows. On March 28, 2008, PMI entered into a Transition Services Agreement and an Employee Matters Agreement to provide certain transition services after the Spin-off and to govern Altria and PMI's respective obligations with respect to employees and the related compensation and benefit plans. As discussed in Note 11. , Altria and PMI also entered into a Tax Sharing Agreement to govern the parties' respective rights and obligations with regards to taxes.
Income Taxes
On March 28, 2008, PMI Global Services Inc. purchased from ALCS, at a fair market value of $108 million, a subsidiary of ALCS, the principal assets of which were two Gulfstream airplanes. Given that the purchase was from an entity under common control, the planes were recorded at book value ($89 million) and a portion of the purchase price ($19 million) was treated as a dividend to Altria.
Operations
Prior to 2009, PMI had contracts with Philip Morris USA Inc. ("PM USA"), a U.S. tobacco subsidiary of Altria, for the purchase of U.S.-grown tobacco leaf, the contract manufacture of cigarettes for export from the United States and certain research and development activities. Billings for services were generally based upon PM USA's cost to provide such services, plus a service fee. The cost of leaf purchases was the market price of the leaf plus a service fee. Fees paid have been included in operating cash flows on PMI's consolidated statements of cash flows.
In 2008, PMI terminated its contract manufacturing arrangement with PM USA and completed the process of shifting all of its PM USA contract manufactured production to PMI facilities in Europe during the fourth quarter of 2008. During the first quarter of 2008, PMI recorded exit costs of $15 million related to the termination of its manufacturing contract with PM USA.
 
 
 
 
During 2008 and 2007, the goods and services purchased from PM USA were as follows (in millions):
 
Contract manufacturing expense included the cost of cigarettes manufactured for PMI, as well as the cost of PMI's purchases of reconstituted tobacco and production materials. The expenses shown above also included total service fees of $20 million and $52 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
Effective as of January 1, 2008, PMI entered into an Intellectual Property Agreement (the "Intellectual Property Agreement") with PM USA. The Intellectual Property Agreement governs the ownership of intellectual property between PMI and PM USA. Ownership of the jointly funded intellectual property has been allocated as follows:
 
 
Ownership of intellectual property related to patent applications and resulting patents based solely on the jointly funded intellectual property, regardless of when filed or issued, will be exclusive to PM USA in the United States, its territories and possessions and exclusive to PMI everywhere else in the world. Additionally, the Intellectual Property Agreement contains provisions concerning intellectual property that is independently developed by PMI and PM USA following the Spin-off.
Net amounts due from/(to) Altria Group, Inc. and affiliates comprised the following at December 31, 2009 and 2008 (in millions):
 
The 2009 amount due from Altria Group, Inc. and affiliates is reflected in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet and primarily relates to income taxes for years in which PMI was part of Altria's consolidated tax return.
 
 
 
 
Leasing activities
A German subsidiary of PMI had several leveraged lease agreements related principally to transportation assets in Europe. These leveraged lease agreements were managed by Philip Morris Capital Corporation ("PMCC"), Altria's financial services subsidiary. During December 2007, these lease agreements were sold and PMI recorded a pre-tax gain of $52 million ($14 million after taxes) in the 2007 consolidated statement of earnings. As a result of this transaction, PMI no longer has and does not plan to make any future lease investments.
Note 5. Asset Impairment and Exit Costs:
During 2009, 2008 and 2007, pre-tax asset impairment and exit costs consisted of the following (in millions):
 
Manufacturing Optimization Program
As previously discussed in Note 4. , PMI terminated its contract manufacturing arrangement with PM USA in 2008 and completed the process of shifting all of its PM USA contract manufactured production to PMI facilities in Europe during the fourth quarter of 2008. During the first quarter of 2008, PMI recorded exit costs of $15 million related to the termination of its manufacturing contract with PM USA.
Transactions with Altria Group, Inc.
Asset Impairment and Exit Costs
PMI recorded pre-tax asset impairment and exit cost charges of $29 million, $84 million, and $208 million (including the charges associated with the Manufacturing Optimization Program discussed above) for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The pre-tax separation program charges primarily related to severance costs. In 2007, asset impairment and exit costs of $208 million included general corporate pre-tax charges of $13 million related to fees associated with the Spin-off.
Cash payments related to exit costs at PMI were $56 million, $99 million and $131 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Future cash payments for exit costs incurred to date are expected to be approximately $84 million, which will be substantially paid by 2012.
 
 
 
 
The movement in the exit cost liabilities for PMI was as follows (in millions):
 
Note 6. Acquisitions:
Rothmans:
In October 2008, PMI completed the acquisition of Rothmans Inc. ("Rothmans"), which is located in Canada, for CAD $2.0 billion (approximately $1.9 billion based on exchange rates prevailing at the time of the acquisition). Prior to being acquired by PMI, Rothmans' sole holding was a 60% interest in Rothmans, Benson & Hedges Inc. ("RBH"). The remaining 40% interest in RBH was owned by PMI. From January 2008 to September 2008, PMI recorded equity earnings on its equity interest in RBH. After the completion of the acquisition, Rothmans became a wholly-owned subsidiary of PMI and, as a result, PMI recorded all of Rothmans' earnings during the fourth quarter of 2008. Rothmans contributed $187 million of incremental operating income and $80 million of incremental net earnings attributable to PMI during the year ended December 31, 2009.
The final allocation of purchase price to Rothmans assets and liabilities at December 31, 2009 was principally as follows (in billions):
 
 
 
 
 
Mexico:
In November 2007, PMI acquired an additional 30% interest in its Mexican tobacco business from Grupo Carso, S.A.B. de C.V., ("Grupo Carso"), which increased PMI's ownership interest to 80%, for $1.1 billion. After this transaction was completed, Grupo Carso retained a 20% interest in the business. A director of PMI has an affiliation with Grupo Carso. PMI also entered into an agreement with Grupo Carso which provides the basis for PMI to potentially acquire, or for Grupo Carso to potentially sell to PMI, Grupo Carso's remaining 20% in the future. During 2008, the allocation of purchase price was completed.
Other:
In September 2009, PMI acquired Swedish Match South Africa (Proprietary) Limited, for ZAR 1.93 billion (approximately $256 million based on exchange rates prevailing at the time of the acquisition), including acquired cash. The final allocation of purchase price was primarily to goodwill ($163 million), definite-lived trademarks ($40 million), acquired cash ($36 million) and the distribution network ($19 million).
In February 2009, PMI purchased the tobacco business. Assets purchased consisted primarily of definite-lived trademarks primarily sold in Norway and Sweden.
Petteres
In June 2008, PMI purchased the fine cut trademark and certain other trademarks in the other tobacco products category from Imperial Tobacco Group PLC for $407 million. This purchase is reflected in other investing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2008.
Interval
During the first quarter of 2007, PMI acquired an additional 58.2% interest in a Pakistan cigarette manufacturer, Lakson Tobacco Company Limited ("Lakson Tobacco"), which increased PMI's total ownership interest in Lakson Tobacco from 40% to approximately 98%, for $388 million.
The effect of these other acquisitions presented above was not material to PMI's consolidated financial position, results of operations or operating cash flows in any of the periods presented.
In July 2009, PMI announced that it had entered into an agreement to purchase 100% of the shares of privately-owned Colombian cigarette manufacturer, Productora Tabacalera de Colombia, Protabaco Ltda., for $452 million. The transaction, which is subject to competition authority approval and final confirmatory due diligence, is expected to close in the first half of 2010.

Fair Value Measurements
 
 
 
 
Credit Lines:
At December 31, 2009, PMI's committed credit lines were as follows (in billions of dollars):
 
At December 31, 2009, there were no borrowings under the committed credit lines.
These facilities require PMI to maintain a ratio of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") to interest of not less than 3.5 to 1.0 on a rolling twelve month basis. At December 31, 2009, PMI's ratio calculated in accordance with the agreements was 13.7 to 1.0. These facilities do not include any credit rating triggers, material adverse change clauses or any provisions that could require PMI to post collateral. These facilities can be used to support the issuance of commercial paper in Europe and the United States.
In addition to the credit lines shown above, certain PMI subsidiaries maintain credit lines to meet their respective working capital needs. These credit lines, which amounted to approximately $2.3 billion at December 31, 2009, are for the sole use of the subsidiaries. Borrowings on these lines amounted to $312 million and $375 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
 
 
 
 
Note 8. Capital Stock:
As discussed in Note 1. , on March 28, 2008, Altria completed the distribution of one share of PMI common stock for each share of Altria common stock outstanding as of the Record Date. As a result, PMI had 2,108,901,789 shares of common stock outstanding immediately following the distribution. PMI commenced a $13.0 billion two-year share repurchase program on May 1, 2008. Since the inception of this program, the total repurchases through December 31, 2009 were 236.5 million shares for $10.9 billion ($46.20 per share). On February 11, 2010, PMI announced that its Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program of $12 billion over three years. The new program will commence in May 2010 after the completion of the two-year $13 billion program that began on May 1, 2008.
Background and Basis of Presentation
Shares of authorized common stock are 6.0 billion; issued, repurchased and outstanding shares after the distribution by Altria were as follows:
 
At December 31, 2009, 55,003,149 shares of common stock were reserved for stock options and other stock awards under PMI's stock plans, and 250 million shares of preferred stock, without par value, were authorized but unissued. PMI currently has no plans to issue any shares of preferred stock.
Note 9. Stock Plans:
Performance Incentive Plan and Stock Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors
Under the Philip Morris International Inc. 2008 Performance Incentive Plan (the "Plan"), PMI may grant to certain eligible employees stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units and deferred stock units and other stock-based awards based on PMI's common stock, as well as performance-based incentive awards. Up to 70 million shares of PMI's common stock may be issued under the Plan. At March 31, 2008, approximately 34.1 million shares were granted under the Plan to reflect PMI's Spin-off from Altria. At December 31, 2009, 33,811,948 shares were available for grant under the Plan.
PMI has also adopted the Philip Morris International Inc. 2008 Stock Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors (the "Non-Employee Directors Plan"). A non-employee director is defined as each member of the PMI Board of Directors who is not a full-time employee of PMI or of any corporation in which PMI owns, directly or indirectly, stock possessing at least 50% of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote in the election of directors in such corporation. Up to 1,000,000 shares of PMI common stock may be awarded under the Non-Employee Directors Plan. As of December 31, 2009, 866,494 shares were available for grant under the plan.
 
 
 
 
Stock Option Plan
In connection with the PMI Spin-off, Altria employee stock options were modified through the issuance of PMI employee stock options and the adjustment of the stock option exercise prices for the Altria awards. As a result of these modifications, the aggregate intrinsic value of the PMI and Altria stock options immediately after the Spin-off was not greater than the aggregate intrinsic value of the Altria stock options before the Spin-off. Since the Black-Scholes fair values of the awards immediately before and immediately after the Spin-off were equivalent, as measured in accordance with the FASB authoritative guidance for Stock Compensation, no incremental compensation expense was recorded as a result of the modification of the Altria awards.
On March 31, 2008, upon the completion of the conversion of existing Altria stock options, PMI issued 28,336,348 shares subject to option at a weighted-average exercise price of $22.90. At December 31, 2009, the number of PMI shares subject to option were as follows:
 
After the Spin-off, the total intrinsic value of PMI options exercised for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 were $222 million and $147 million, respectively. The total intrinsic value of Altria options exercised by PMI employees during the year ended December 31, 2007 was $80 million.
Prior to the Spin-off, PMI employees solely held Altria stock options. Altria has not granted stock options to employees of PMI since 2002. Under certain circumstances, senior executives who exercised outstanding stock options, using shares to pay the option exercise price and taxes, received Executive Ownership Stock Options ("EOSOs") equal to the number of shares tendered. This feature ceased in March 2007. During the year ended December 31, 2007, Altria granted 35,278 EOSOs to PMI employees. EOSOs were granted at an exercise price of not less than fair market value on the date of the grant. The weighted-average grant date fair value of Altria EOSOs granted during the year ended December 31, 2007 was $16.46. PMI recorded pre-tax compensation cost related to these Altria stock options totaling $1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The fair value of these awards was determined using a modified Black-Scholes methodology using the following weighted-average assumptions:
 
 
 
 
 
Restricted and Deferred Stock Awards
PMI may grant restricted stock and deferred stock awards to eligible employees, giving them in most instances all of the rights of stockholders, except that they may not sell, assign, pledge or otherwise encumber such shares. Such shares are subject to forfeiture if certain employment conditions are not met. Restricted stock and deferred stock awards generally vest on the third anniversary of the grant date.
Upon the conversion of existing Altria awards on March 31, 2008, PMI issued 5,867,974 shares of restricted and deferred stock. During 2009, the activity for restricted stock and deferred stock awards was as follows:
 
The weighted-average grant date fair value of the restricted stock and deferred stock awards granted to PMI employees during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $142 million, $102 million and $70 million, or $37.01, $51.44 and $65.59 per restricted or deferred share, respectively. The fair value of the restricted stock and deferred stock awards at the date of grant is amortized to expense ratably over the restriction period. PMI recorded compensation expense for these restricted stock and deferred stock awards of $93 million, $68 million and $55 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007. The unamortized compensation expense related to restricted stock and deferred stock awards was $141 million at December 31, 2009 and is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2 years.
For the year ended December 31, 2009, 1.5 million shares of PMI restricted stock and deferred stock awards vested. Of this amount, 1.0 million shares went to PMI employees and the remainder went to Altria and Kraft Foods Inc. employees who held PMI stock awards as a result of the Spin-off. The grant date fair value of all the vested shares was approximately $107 million. The total fair value of restricted stock and deferred stock awards that vested in 2009 was approximately the same as the grant date fair value. The grant price information for restricted stock and deferred stock awarded prior to January 30, 2008 reflects historical market prices of Altria stock at date of grant and is not adjusted to reflect the Spin-off.
Following the Spin-off from Altria, 0.3 million shares of PMI restricted and deferred stock awards vested in the year ended December 31, 2008. The total fair value of restricted stock and deferred stock awards that vested after the Spin-off in 2008 was approximately $14 million. For the period prior to the Spin-off from Altria in 2008, the total fair value of vested Altria and Kraft Foods Inc. stock awards held by PMI employees was $69 million.
For the year ended December 31, 2007, the total fair value of vested Altria and Kraft Foods Inc. stock awards held by PMI employees was $76 million.
 
 
 
 
Note 10. Earnings per Share:
Effective January 1, 2009, PMI adopted the provisions of amended FASB authoritative guidance which requires that unvested share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends are participating securities and therefore shall be included in the earnings per share calculation pursuant to the two-class method. This amendment requires the retrospective adjustment of all prior period earnings per share data. The adoption and retrospective application of this amendment did not have a material impact on PMI's basic and diluted earnings per share ("EPS").
Basic and diluted EPS were calculated using the following (in millions):
 
For the 2009 computation, the number of stock options excluded from the calculation of weighted-average shares for diluted EPS because their effects were antidilutive was immaterial. For the 2008 and 2007 computations, there were no antidilutive stock options.
As discussed in Note 1. on March 28, 2008, Altria completed the distribution of one share of PMI common stock for each share of Altria common stock outstanding as of the Record Date. As a result, PMI had 2,108,901,789 shares of common stock outstanding immediately following the distribution.
Background and Basis of Presentation,
Prior to the Distribution Date, PMI had 150 shares of common stock outstanding. As a result of the distribution, all EPS amounts prior to the Distribution Date were adjusted to reflect the new capital structure of PMI. The same number of shares is being used for both diluted EPS and basic EPS for all periods prior to the Distribution Date as no PMI equity awards were outstanding prior to the Distribution Date.
 
 
 
 
Note 11. Income Taxes:
Earnings before income taxes and provision for income taxes consisted of the following for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 (in millions):
 
United States income tax is primarily attributable to repatriation costs.
At December 31, 2009, applicable United States federal income taxes and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on approximately $14 billion of accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are expected to be permanently reinvested. The determination of the amount of deferred tax related to these earnings is not practicable.
On March 28, 2008, PMI entered into a Tax Sharing Agreement (the "Tax Sharing Agreement") with Altria. The Tax Sharing Agreement generally governs PMI's and Altria's respective rights, responsibilities and obligations for pre-distribution periods and for potential taxes on the Spin-off. With respect to any potential tax resulting from the Spin-off, responsibility for the tax will be allocated to the party that acted (or failed to act) in a manner which resulted in the tax.
The U.S. federal statute of limitations remains open for the year 2000 and onward with years 2000 to 2003 currently under examination by the IRS. Foreign and U.S. state jurisdictions have statutes of limitations generally ranging from 3 to 5 years. Years still open to examination by foreign tax authorities in major jurisdictions include Germany (2002 onward), Indonesia (2007 onward), Russia (2007 onward) and Switzerland (2007 onward). PMI is currently under examination in various foreign jurisdictions.
 
 
 
 
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in millions):
 
Unrecognized tax benefits and PMI's liability for contingent income taxes, interest and penalties were as follows (in millions):
 
The amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate was $152 million at December 31, 2009. The remainder, if recognized, would principally affect deferred taxes.
PMI recognizes accrued interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as part of the provision for income taxes on the consolidated statements of earnings and as part of income taxes on the consolidated balance sheets. For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, PMI recognized (income) expense in its consolidated statements of earnings ($1) million, $1 million and $19 million of interest and penalties, respectively.
PMI is regularly examined by tax authorities around the world. It is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months certain examinations will close, which could result in a decrease in unrecognized tax benefits along with related interest and penalties. An estimate of the range of the possible decrease cannot be made at this time.
 
 
 
 
The effective income tax rate on pre-tax earnings differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate for the following reasons for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007:
 
The 2008 effective tax rate included the adoption of U.S. income tax regulations proposed in 2008 ($154 million) and the enacted reduction of future corporate income tax rates in Indonesia ($67 million), partially offset by the impact of the after-tax charge of $124 million related to the RBH settlement with the Government of Canada and all ten provinces, and the tax cost of a legal entity restructuring ($45 million). In 2007, PMI recorded tax benefits of $27 million related to the reduction of deferred tax liabilities resulting from future lower tax rates enacted in Germany.
The tax effects of temporary differences that gave rise to deferred income tax assets and liabilities consisted of the following (in millions):
 
 
 
 
 
Note 12. Segment Reporting:
PMI's subsidiaries and affiliates are engaged in the manufacture and sale of cigarettes and other tobacco products in markets outside of the United States of America. Reportable segments for PMI are organized and managed by geographic region. PMI's reportable segments are European Union; Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa; Asia; and Latin America & Canada. PMI records net revenues and operating companies income to its segments based upon the geographic area in which the customer resides.
PMI's management evaluates segment performance and allocates resources based on operating companies income, which PMI defines as operating income before general corporate expenses and amortization of intangibles. Interest expense, net, and provision for income taxes are centrally managed and, accordingly, such items are not presented by segment since they are excluded from the measure of segment profitability reviewed by management. Information about total assets by segment is not disclosed because such information is not reported to or used by PMI's chief operating decision maker. Segment goodwill and other intangible assets, net, are disclosed in Note 3. . The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in Note 2.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, net
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.
Segment data were as follows (in millions):
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Long-lived assets consist of non-current assets other than goodwill, other intangible assets, net, and deferred tax assets. Total long-lived assets located in Switzerland were $976 million, $929 million and $875 million at December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
Items affecting the comparability of results from operations were as follows:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Note 13. Benefit Plans:
Pension coverage for employees of PMI's non-U.S. subsidiaries is provided, to the extent deemed appropriate, through separate plans, many of which are governed by local statutory requirements. Prior to the Spin-off, certain employees of PMI participated in the U.S. benefit plans offered by Altria. After the Distribution Date, the benefits previously provided by Altria are now provided by PMI. As a result, new postretirement and pension plans have been established by PMI, and the related plan assets (to the extent that the benefit plans were previously funded) and liabilities have been transferred to the new plans.
In December 2008, PMI adopted the provisions of amended FASB authoritative guidance for Retirement Benefits that requires an entity to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of its fiscal year-end statement of financial position. Prior to this adoption, PMI historically used September 30 to measure its non-U.S. pension plans. The change of measurement date from September 30 to December 31 resulted in a net charge to stockholders' equity of $9 million at December 31, 2008.
The amounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive earnings (losses) at December 31, 2009 consisted of the following (in millions):
 
The amounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive earnings (losses) at December 31, 2008 consisted of the following (in millions):
 
 
 
 
 
The amounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive earnings (losses) at December 31, 2007 consisted of the following (in millions):
 
The movements in other comprehensive earnings (losses) during the year ended December 31, 2009 were as follows (in millions):
 
 
 
 
 
The movements in other comprehensive earnings (losses) during the year ended December 31, 2008 were as follows (in millions):
 
 
 
 
 
Pension Plans
Obligations and Funded Status
The benefit obligations, plan assets and funded status of PMI's pension plans at December 31, 2009 and 2008, were as follows (in millions):
 
At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the combined U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans resulted in a net pension liability of $440 million and $1,045 million, respectively. These amounts were recognized in PMI's consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2009 and 2008, as follows (in millions):
 
 
 
 
 
The accumulated benefit obligation, which represents benefits earned to date, for the U.S. pension plans was $255 million and $244 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The accumulated benefit obligation for non-U.S. pension plans was $4,010 million and $3,468 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
For U.S. pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets, the projected benefit obligation and accumulated benefit obligation were $74 million and $61 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2009. The projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets were $282 million, $244 million and $163 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2008. The underfunding relates to plans for salaried employees that cannot be funded under IRS regulations. For non-U.S. plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets, the projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets were $282 million, $210 million, and $43 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2009, and $2,671 million, $2,294 million, and $1,749 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2008.
The following weighted-average assumptions were used to determine PMI's benefit obligations at December 31:
 
The discount rate for PMI's U.S. plans is based on an index of high-quality corporate bonds with durations that match the benefit obligations. The discount rate for PMI's non-U.S. plans was developed from local bond indices that match local benefit obligations as closely as possible.
Components of Net Periodic Benefit Cost
Net periodic pension cost consisted of the following for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 (in millions):
 
Termination, settlement and curtailment charges were due primarily to early retirement programs.
 
 
 
 
For the combined U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans, the estimated net loss and prior service cost that are expected to be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive earnings into net periodic benefit cost during 2010 are $45 million and $10 million, respectively.
The following weighted-average assumptions were used to determine PMI's net pension cost:
 
PMI's expected rate of return on plan assets is determined by the plan assets' historical long-term investment performance, current asset allocation and estimates of future long-term returns by asset class.
PMI and certain of its subsidiaries sponsor defined contribution plans. Amounts charged to expense for defined contribution plans totaled $42 million, $36 million and $20 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
Plan Assets
PMI's investment strategy for U.S and non-U.S. plans is based on an expectation that equity securities will outperform debt securities over the long term. Accordingly, the target allocation of PMI's plan assets is broadly characterized as approximately a 60%/40% split between equity and debt securities. The strategy primarily utilizes indexed U.S. equity securities, international equity securities and investment grade debt securities. PMI's plans have no investments in hedge funds, private equity or derivatives. PMI attempts to mitigate investment risk by rebalancing between equity and debt asset classes once a year or as PMI's contributions and benefit payments are made.
In December 2009, PMI adopted the provisions of amended FASB authoritative guidance for Retirement Benefits which expands the benefit plan asset disclosure requirements, including employers' investment strategies, major categories of plan assets, concentrations of risk within plan assets and the valuation techniques used to measure the fair values of plan assets.
 
 
 
 
The fair value of PMI's pension plan assets at December 31, 2009 by asset category was as follows (in millions):
 
 
See Note 16. for a discussion of the fair value of pension plan assets.
Fair Value Measurements
PMI presently makes, and plans to make, contributions, to the extent that they are tax deductible and to meet specific funding requirements of its funded U.S. and non-U.S. plans. Currently, PMI anticipates making contributions of approximately $230 million in 2010 to its pension plans, based on current tax and benefit laws. However, this estimate is subject to change as a result of changes in tax and other benefit laws, as well as asset performance significantly above or below the assumed long-term rate of return on pension assets, or changes in interest rates.
 
 
 
 
The estimated future benefit payments from PMI pension plans at December 31, 2009, were as follows (in millions):
 
Postretirement Benefit Plans
Net postretirement health care costs consisted of the following for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 (in millions):
 
The following weighted-average assumptions were used to determine PMI's net postretirement costs for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008:
 
 
 
 
 
PMI's postretirement health care plans are not funded. The changes in the accumulated benefit obligation and net amount accrued at December 31, 2009 and 2008 were as follows (in millions):
 
The current portion of PMI's accrued postretirement health care costs of $9 million and $6 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, is included in accrued employment costs on the consolidated balance sheet.
The following weighted-average assumptions were used to determine PMI's postretirement benefit obligations at December 31, 2009 and 2008:
 
Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans. A one-percentage-point change in assumed health care trend rates would have the following effects as of December 31, 2009:
 
 
 
 
 
PMI's estimated future benefit payments for its postretirement health care plans at December 31, 2009, were as follows (in millions):
 
Postemployment Benefit Plans
PMI and certain of its subsidiaries sponsor postemployment benefit plans covering substantially all salaried and certain hourly employees. The cost of these plans is charged to expense over the working life of the covered employees. Net postemployment costs consisted of the following (in millions):
 
During 2009, 2008 and 2007, certain salaried employees left PMI under separation programs. These programs resulted in incremental postemployment costs, which are included in other expense, above.
The estimated net loss for the postemployment benefit plans that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive earnings into net postemployment costs during 2010 is approximately $39 million.
The changes in the benefit obligations of the plans at December 31, 2009 and 2008 were as follows (in millions):
 
The accrued postemployment costs were determined using a weighted-average discount rate of 8.6% and 9.6% in 2009 and 2008, respectively, an assumed ultimate annual weighted-average turnover rate of 2.1% and 4.0% in 2009 and 2008, respectively, assumed compensation cost increases of 4.5% in 2009 and 2008, and assumed benefits as defined in the respective plans. Postemployment costs arising from actions that offer employees benefits in excess of those specified in the respective plans are charged to expense when incurred.

Minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases in effect at December 31, 2009, were as follows (in millions):
 
Note 15. Financial Instruments:
Overview
PMI operates in markets outside of the United States, with manufacturing and sales facilities in various locations around the world. PMI utilizes certain financial instruments to manage foreign currency exposure. Derivative financial instruments are used by PMI principally to reduce exposures to market risks resulting from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates by creating offsetting exposures. PMI is not a party to leveraged derivatives and, by policy, does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. Financial instruments qualifying for hedge accounting must maintain a specified level of effectiveness between the hedging instrument and the item being hedged, both at inception and throughout the hedged period. PMI formally documents the nature and relationships between the hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk-management objectives, strategies for undertaking the various hedge transactions and method of assessing hedge effectiveness. Additionally, for hedges of forecasted transactions, the significant characteristics and expected terms of the forecasted transaction must be specifically identified, and it must be probable that each forecasted transaction will occur. If it were deemed probable that the forecasted transaction would not occur, the gain or loss would be recognized in earnings. PMI reports its net transaction losses and its net transaction gains in marketing, administration and research costs on the consolidated statements of earnings.
 
 
 
 
PMI uses forward foreign exchange contracts, foreign currency swaps and foreign currency options, hereafter collectively referred to as foreign exchange contracts, to mitigate its exposure to changes in exchange rates from third-party and intercompany actual and forecasted transactions. The primary currencies to which PMI is exposed include the Euro, Indonesian rupiah, Japanese yen, Mexican peso, Russian ruble, Swiss franc and Turkish lira. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, PMI had contracts with aggregate notional amounts of $13.9 billion and $17.8 billion, respectively. Of the $13.9 billion aggregate notional amount at December 31, 2009, $3.2 billion related to cash flow hedges, $1.3 billion related to hedges of net investments in foreign operations and $9.4 billion related to other derivatives that primarily offset currency exposures on intercompany financing. Of the $17.8 billion aggregate notional amount at December 31, 2008, $2.1 billion related to cash flow hedges, $0.4 billion related to fair value hedges, $1.7 billion related to hedges of net investments in foreign operations and $13.6 billion related to other derivatives that primarily offset currency exposures on intercompany financing.
The fair value of PMI's foreign exchange contracts as of December 31, 2009, was as follows (in millions):
 
 
 
 
 
Hedging activities, which represent movement in derivatives as well as the respective underlying transactions, had the following effect on PMI's consolidated statements of earnings and other comprehensive earnings for the year ended December 31, 2009 (in millions):
 
Each type of hedging activity is described in greater detail below.
Cash Flow Hedges
PMI has entered into foreign exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency exchange risk related to certain forecasted transactions. The effective portion of unrealized gains and losses associated with qualifying cash flow hedge contracts is deferred as a component of accumulated other comprehensive earnings (losses) until the underlying hedged transactions are reported in PMI's consolidated statements of earnings. During the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, ineffectiveness related to cash flow hedges was not material. As of December 31, 2009, PMI has hedged forecasted transactions for periods not exceeding the next twelve months. The impact of these hedges is included in operating cash flows on PMI's consolidated statement of cash flows.
 
 
 
 
For the year ended December 31, 2009, foreign exchange contracts that were designated as cash flow hedging instruments impacted the consolidated statements of earnings and other comprehensive earnings as follows (pre-tax, in millions):
 
Fair Value Hedges
PMI has entered into foreign exchange contracts to hedge the foreign currency exchange risk related to an intercompany loan between subsidiaries. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative, as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, is recognized in current earnings. At June 30, 2009, all fair value hedges matured and were settled. During the third and fourth quarters of 2009, there were no outstanding fair value hedges. For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, ineffectiveness related to fair value hedges was not material. Gains (losses) associated with qualifying fair value hedges are recorded in the consolidated statements of earnings and were $42 million, $49 million and $0.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The impact of fair value hedges is included in operating cash flows on PMI's consolidated statement of cash flows.
 
 
 
 
For the year ended December 31, 2009, foreign exchange contracts that were designated as fair value hedging instruments impacted the consolidated statement of earnings as follows (pre-tax, in millions):
 
Hedges of Net Investments in Foreign Operations
PMI designates certain foreign currency denominated debt and forward exchange contracts as net investment hedges of its foreign operations. For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, these hedges of net investments resulted in gains (losses), net of income taxes, of ($71) million, $124 million and $19 million, respectively. These gains (losses) were reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive earnings (losses) within currency translation adjustments. For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, ineffectiveness related to net investment hedges was not material. Settlement of net investment hedges is included in other investing cash flows on PMI's consolidated statement of cash flows.
For the year ended December 31, 2009, foreign exchange contracts that were designated as net investment hedging instruments impacted the consolidated statements of earnings and other comprehensive earnings as follows (pre-tax, in millions):
 
 
 
 
 
Other Derivatives
PMI has entered into foreign exchange contracts to hedge the foreign currency exchange risks related to intercompany loans between certain subsidiaries. While effective as economic hedges, no hedge accounting is applied for these contracts and, therefore, the unrealized gains (losses) relating to these contracts are reported in PMI's consolidated statement of earnings. For the year ended December 31, 2009, the gains from contracts for which PMI did not apply hedge accounting were $248 million, which substantially offset the losses and gains generated by the underlying intercompany loans being hedged.
As a result, for the year ended December 31, 2009, these items affected the consolidated statement of earnings as follows (pre-tax, in millions):
 
Qualifying Hedging Activities Reported in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Earnings (Losses)
Derivative gains or losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive earnings (losses) are a result of qualifying hedging activity. Transfers of these gains or losses to earnings are offset by the corresponding gains or losses on the underlying hedged item. Hedging activity affected accumulated other comprehensive earnings (losses), net of income taxes, as follows (in millions):
 
At December 31, 2009, PMI expects $7 million of derivative gains reported in accumulated other comprehensive earnings (losses) to be reclassified to the consolidated statement of earnings within the next twelve months. These losses and gains are expected to be substantially offset by the statement of earnings impact of the respective forecasted transactions.
Contingent features
PMI's derivative instruments do not contain contingent features.
 
 
 
 
Credit exposure and credit risk
PMI is exposed to credit loss in the event of non-performance by counterparties. While PMI does not anticipate non-performance, its risk is limited to the fair value of the financial instruments. PMI actively monitors its exposure to credit risk through the use of credit approvals and credit limits, and by selecting a diverse group of major international banks and financial institutions as counterparties.
Fair value
See Note 16. for disclosures related to the fair value of PMI's derivative financial instruments.
Fair Value Measurements
Note 16. Fair Value Measurements:
The authoritative guidance defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The guidance also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The guidance describes three levels of input that may be used to measure fair value, which are as follows:
 
Securities Available for Sale
PMI assesses the fair value of securities available for sale, which consist of warrants to purchase third-party common stock, by using a Black-Scholes methodology based on observable market inputs. Securities available for sale have been classified within Level 2.
Derivative Financial Instruments
PMI assesses the fair value of its derivative financial instruments using internally developed models that use, as their basis, readily observable future amounts, such as cash flows, earnings, and the current market expectations of those future amounts. These derivatives include forward foreign exchange contracts, foreign currency swaps and foreign currency options. Derivative financial instruments have been classified within Level 2. See Note 15. for additional discussion on derivative financial instruments.
Financial Instruments
 
 
 
 
Pension Plan Assets
The fair value of pension plan assets determined by using readily available quoted market prices in active markets has been classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of pension plan assets determined by using quoted prices in markets that are not active has been classified within Level 2. See Note 13. for additional discussion on pension plan assets.
Benefit Plans
Debt
The fair value of PMI's outstanding debt, as utilized solely for disclosure purposes, is determined by utilizing quotes and market interest rates currently available to PMI for issuances of debt with similar terms and remaining maturities. The aggregate carrying value of PMI's debt, excluding $208 million of capital lease obligations, was $13,546 million at December 31, 2009. The fair value of PMI's outstanding debt has been classified within Level 1.
The aggregate fair value of PMI's securities available for sale, derivative financial instruments, pension plan assets and debt as of December 31, 2009, was as follows (in millions):
 
Note 17. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Earnings (Losses):
PMI's accumulated other comprehensive earnings (losses), net of taxes, consisted of the following (in millions):
 
 
 
 
 
Note 18. Colombian Investment and Cooperation Agreement:
On June 19, 2009, PMI announced that it had signed an agreement with the Republic of Colombia, together with the Departments of Colombia and the Capital District of Bogota, to promote investment and cooperation with respect to the Colombian tobacco market and to fight counterfeit and contraband tobacco products. The Investment and Cooperation Agreement provides $200 million in funding to the Colombian governments over a 20-year period to address issues of mutual interest, such as combating the illegal cigarette trade, including the threat of counterfeit tobacco products, and increasing the quality and quantity of locally grown tobacco. As a result of the Investment and Cooperation Agreement, PMI recorded a pre-tax charge of $135 million in the operating results of the Latin America & Canada segment during the second quarter of 2009. This pre-tax charge, which represents the net present value of the payments prescribed by the agreement, is reflected in marketing, administration and research costs on the consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2009.
At December 31, 2009, PMI had $93 million of discounted liabilities associated with the Colombian Investment and Cooperation Agreement. These discounted liabilities are primarily reflected in other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet.
Note 19. RBH Legal Settlement:
On July 31, 2008, Rothmans announced the finalization of a CAD $550 million settlement (or approximately $540 million, based on the prevailing exchange rate at that time) between itself and RBH, on the one hand, and the Government of Canada and all ten provinces, on the other hand. The settlement resolves the Royal Canadian Mounted Police's investigation relating to products exported from Canada by RBH during the 1989-1996 period. Rothmans' sole holding was a 60% interest in RBH. The remaining 40% interest in RBH was owned by PMI.
As a result of the finalization of the settlement, PMI recorded a charge of $124 million in the operating results of the Latin America & Canada segment during the second quarter of 2008. The charge represented the present value of PMI's 40% equity interest in RBH's portion of the settlement and was reflected in marketing, administration and research costs on the consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2008.
Subsequent to the finalization of the settlement, PMI announced that it had entered into an agreement with Rothmans to purchase, by way of a tender offer, all of the outstanding common shares of Rothmans. In October 2008, PMI completed the acquisition of all of Rothmans shares. See Note 6. for more details regarding this acquisition.
Acquisitions
At December 31, 2009 and 2008, PMI had $243 million and $207 million, respectively, of discounted accrued settlement charges associated with the RBH legal settlement. These accrued settlement charges are primarily reflected in other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.
 
 
 
 
Note 20. E.C. Agreement:
In 2004, PMI entered into an agreement with the European Commission ("E.C.") and 10 Member States of the European Union that provides for broad cooperation with European law enforcement agencies on anti-contraband and anti-counterfeit efforts. This agreement has been signed by all 27 Member States. The agreement resolves all disputes between the parties relating to these issues. Under the terms of the agreement, PMI will make 13 payments over 12 years, including an initial payment of $250 million, which was recorded as a pre-tax charge against its earnings in 2004. The agreement calls for additional payments of approximately $150 million on the first anniversary of the agreement (this payment was made in July 2005), approximately $100 million on the second anniversary (this payment was made in July 2006) and approximately $75 million each year thereafter for 10 years, each of which is to be adjusted based on certain variables, including PMI's market share in the European Union in the year preceding payment. Because future additional payments are subject to these variables, PMI records charges for them as an expense in cost of sales when product is shipped. In addition, PMI is also responsible to pay the excise taxes, VAT and customs duties on qualifying product seizures of up to 90 million cigarettes and is subject to payments of five times the applicable taxes and duties if qualifying product seizures exceed 90 million cigarettes in a given year. To date, PMI's annual payments related to product seizures have been immaterial. Total charges related to the E.C. Agreement of $84 million, $80 million and $100 million were recorded in cost of sales in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
Note 21. Contingencies:
Legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened against us, and/or our subsidiaries, and/or our indemnitees in various jurisdictions. Our indemnitees include distributors, licensees, and others that have been named as parties in certain cases and that we have agreed to defend, as well as pay costs and some or all of judgments, if any, that may be entered against them. Altria Group, Inc. and PM USA are also indemnitees, in certain cases, pursuant to the terms of the Distribution Agreement between Altria Group, Inc. and PMI. Various types of claims are raised in these proceedings, including, among others, product liability, consumer protection, antitrust, and tax.
It is possible that there could be adverse developments in pending cases against us and our subsidiaries. An unfavorable outcome or settlement of pending tobacco-related litigation could encourage the commencement of additional litigation.
Damages claimed in some of the tobacco-related litigation are significant and, in certain cases in Brazil, Israel, Nigeria and Canada, range into the billions of dollars. The variability in pleadings in multiple jurisdictions, together with the actual experience of management in litigating claims, demonstrate that the monetary relief that may be specified in a lawsuit bears little relevance to the ultimate outcome. Much of the litigation is in its early stages and litigation is subject to uncertainty. However, as discussed below, we have to date been largely successful in defending tobacco-related litigation.
We and our subsidiaries record provisions in the consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when we determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. At the present time, while it is reasonably possible that an unfavorable outcome in a case may occur, (i) management has concluded that it is not probable that a loss has been incurred in any of the pending tobacco-related cases; (ii) management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of any of the pending tobacco-related cases; and (iii) accordingly, management has not provided any amounts in the consolidated financial statements for unfavorable outcomes in these cases, if any. Legal defense costs are expensed as incurred.
 
 
 
 
It is possible that our consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position could be materially affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of certain pending litigation. Nevertheless, although litigation is subject to uncertainty, we and each of our subsidiaries named as a defendant believe, and each has been so advised by counsel handling the respective cases, that we have valid defenses to the litigation pending against us, as well as valid bases for appeal of adverse verdicts, if any. All such cases are, and will continue to be, vigorously defended. However, we and our subsidiaries may enter into settlement discussions in particular cases if we believe it is in our best interests to do so.
The table below lists the number of tobacco-related cases pending against us and/or our subsidiaries or indemnitees as of December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007:
 
 
Since 1995, when the first tobacco-related litigation was filed against a PMI entity, 351
(3)
Smoking and Health, Lights, Health Care Cost Recovery cases and Public Civil Actions in which we and/or one of our subsidiaries and/or indemnitees was a defendant have been terminated in our favor. Nine cases have had decisions in favor of plaintiffs. Five of these cases have subsequently reached final resolution in our favor, one has been annulled and returned to the trial court for further proceedings, and three remain on appeal. To date, we have paid total judgments including costs of approximately six thousand Euros. These payments were made in order to appeal three Italian small claims cases, two of which were subsequently reversed on appeal and one of which remains on appeal. To date, no tobacco-related case has been finally resolved in favor of a plaintiff against us, our subsidiaries or indemnitees.
 
 
 
 
 
The table below lists the verdicts and post-trial developments in the three pending cases (excluding one individual case on appeal from Italian small claims court) in which verdicts were returned in favor of plaintiffs:
 
 
 
 
 
Pending claims related to tobacco products generally fall within the following categories:
 These cases primarily allege personal injury and are brought by individual plaintiffs or on behalf of a class of individual plaintiffs. Plaintiffs' allegations of liability in these cases are based on various theories of recovery, including negligence, gross negligence, strict liability, fraud, misrepresentation, design defect, failure to warn, breach of express and implied warranties, violations of deceptive trade practice laws and consumer protection statutes. Plaintiffs in these cases seek various forms of relief, including compensatory and other damages, and injunctive and equitable relief. Defenses raised in these cases include licit activity, failure to state a claim, lack of defect, lack of proximate cause, assumption of the risk, contributory negligence, and statute of limitations.
Smoking and Health Litigation:
As of December 31, 2009, there were a number of smoking and health cases pending against us, our subsidiaries or indemnitees, as follows:
 
 
 
 
 
 
In the individual cases in Finland, our two indemnitees (our former licensees now known as Amer Sports Corporation and Amerintie 1 Oy) and another member of the industry are defendants. Plaintiffs allege personal injuries as a result of smoking. All three cases were tried together before the District Court of Helsinki. Trial began in March 2008 and concluded in May 2008. In October 2008, the District Court issued decisions in favor of defendants in all three cases. Plaintiffs filed appeals. One of the three plaintiffs has since withdrawn her appeal, making the District Court's decision in favor of the defendants final. The other two plaintiffs continued to pursue their appeals. The appellate hearing, which was essentially a re-trial of these cases before the Appellate Court, concluded in December 2009. The parties are awaiting the Appellate Court's decision.
In the first class action pending in Brazil, , filed July 25, 1995, our subsidiary and another member of the industry are defendants. The plaintiff, a consumer organization, is seeking damages for smokers and former smokers, and injunctive relief. In February 2004, the trial court found defendants liable without hearing evidence. The court did not assess moral or actual damages, which were to be assessed in a second phase of the case. The size of the class was not defined in the ruling. In April 2004, the court clarified its ruling, awarding "moral damages" of R$1,000 (approximately $580) per smoker per full year of smoking plus interest at the rate of 1% per month, as of the date of the ruling. The court did not award actual damages, which were to be assessed in the second phase of the case. The size of the class still has not been estimated. Defendants appealed to the So Paulo Court of Appeals, and the case, including the execution of the judgment, was stayed pending appeal. In November 2008, the So Paulo Court of Appeals annulled the ruling finding that the trial court had inappropriately ruled without hearing evidence and returned the case to the trial court for further proceedings. In addition, the defendants have filed a constitutional appeal to the Federal Supreme Court on the basis that the consumer association did not have standing to bring the lawsuit. This appeal is still pending.
The Smoker Health Defense Association (ADESF) v. Souza Cruz, S.A. and Philip Morris Marketing, S.A., Nineteenth Lower Civil Court of the Central Courts of the Judiciary District of So Paulo, Brazil
In the second class action pending in Brazil, filed August 6, 2007, our subsidiary is a defendant. The plaintiff, the Public Prosecutor of the State of So Paulo, is seeking (1) unspecified damages on behalf of all smokers nationwide, former smokers, and their relatives; (2) unspecified damages on behalf of people exposed to environmental tobacco smoke ("ETS") nationwide, and their relatives; and (3) reimbursement of the health care costs allegedly incurred for the treatment of tobacco-related diseases by all 26 States, approximately 5,000 Municipalities, and the Federal District. In an interim ruling issued in December 2007, the trial court limited the scope of this claim to the State of So Paulo only. Our subsidiary was served with the claim in February 2008, and filed its answer to the complaint in March 2008. In December 2008, the trial court issued a decision declaring that it lacked jurisdiction and transferred the case to the Nineteenth Lower Civil Court in So Paulo where the case discussed above is pending. Our subsidiary appealed this decision to the State of So Paulo Court of Appeals, which subsequently declared the case stayed pending the outcome of the appeal.
Public Prosecutor of So Paulo v. Philip Morris Brasil Industria e Comercio Ltda, Civil Court of the City of So Paulo, Brazil,
ADESF
In the class action in Bulgaria, filed March 12, 2008, our subsidiaries and other members of the industry are defendants.

Plaintiff seeks damages for economic loss, pain and suffering, medical treatment, and withdrawal from the market of all cigarettes that allegedly do not comply with tar and nicotine labeling requirements. The trial court dismissed the youth marketing claims. This decision has been affirmed on appeal. The trial court also

: These cases, brought by governmental and non-governmental plaintiffs, seek reimbursement of health care cost expenditures allegedly caused by tobacco products. Plaintiffs' allegations of liability in these cases are based on various theories of recovery including unjust enrichment, negligence, negligent design, strict liability, breach of express and implied warranties, violation of a voluntary undertaking or special duty, fraud, negligent misrepresentation, conspiracy, public nuisance, defective product, failure to warn, sale of cigarettes to minors, and claims under statutes governing competition and deceptive trade practices. Plaintiffs in these cases seek various forms of relief including compensatory and other damages, and injunctive and equitable relief. Defenses raised in these cases include lack of proximate cause, remoteness of injury, failure to state a claim, adequate remedy at law, "unclean hands" (namely, that plaintiffs cannot obtain equitable relief because they participated in, and benefited from, the sale of cigarettes), and statute of limitations.
Health Care Cost Recovery Litigation
As of December 31, 2009, there were a total of 11 health care cost recovery cases pending against us, our subsidiaries or indemnitees, compared with 11 such cases on December 31, 2008, and 8 such cases on December 31, 2007, as follows:
 
 
In the first health care cost recovery case pending in Canada, filed January 24, 2001, we, our subsidiaries, our indemnitee (PM USA), and other members of the industry are defendants. The plaintiff, the government of the province of British Columbia, brought a claim based upon legislation enacted by the province authorizing the government to file a direct action against cigarette manufacturers to recover the health care costs it has incurred, and will incur, resulting from a "tobacco related wrong." The Supreme Court has held that the statute is constitutional. We and certain other non-Canadian defendants challenged the jurisdiction of the court. The court rejected the jurisdictional challenge. Pre-trial discovery is ongoing. The court has set September 2011 as the target trial date.

The Attorney General of Ogun State v. British American Tobacco (Nigeria) Limited, et al., High Court of Ogun State, Abeokuta, Nigeria
In the series of proceedings in Spain, the first of which was filed February 21, 2002, our subsidiary and other members of the industry were defendants. The plaintiffs sought reimbursement for the cost of treating certain of their citizens for various smoking-related illnesses. In May 2004, the first instance court dismissed the initial case, finding that the State was a necessary party to the claim, and thus, the claim must be filed in the Administrative Court. The plaintiffs appealed. In February 2006, the appellate court affirmed the lower court's dismissal. The plaintiffs then filed notice that they intended to pursue their claim in the Administrative Court against the State. Because they were defendants in the original proceeding, our subsidiary and other members of the industry filed notices with the Administrative Court that they are interested parties in the case. In September 2007, the plaintiffs filed their complaint in the Administrative Court. In November 2007, the Administrative Court dismissed the claim based on a procedural issue. The plaintiffs asked the Administrative Court to reconsider its decision dismissing the case, and that request was rejected in a ruling rendered in February 2008. Plaintiffs appealed to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court rejected plaintiffs' appeal in November 2009 resulting in the final dismissal of the claim. However, plaintiffs have filed a second claim in the Administrative Court against the Ministry of Economy. This second claim seeks the same relief as the original claim, but relies on a different procedural posture. The Administrative Court has recognized our subsidiary as a party in this proceeding.
Junta de Andalucia, et al. v. Philip Morris Spain, et al., Court of First Instance, Madrid, Spain,
: These cases, brought by individual plaintiffs, or on behalf of a class of individual plaintiffs, allege that the use of the term "lights" constitutes fraudulent and misleading conduct.

Plaintiffs seek various forms of relief including restitution, injunctive relief, and compensatory and other damages. Defenses raised include lack of causation, lack of reliance, assumption of the risk, and statute of limitations.
Lights Cases
As of December 31, 2009, there were a number of lights cases pending against our subsidiaries or indemnitees, as follows:
 
 
 
 
 
 
In one class action pending in Israel, filed January 18, 2004, our subsidiary and our indemnitees (PM USA and our former importer Menache H. Eliachar Ltd.) are defendants. The plaintiffs filed a purported class action claiming that the class members were misled by the descriptor "lights" into believing that lights cigarettes are safer than full flavor cigarettes. The claim seeks recovery of the purchase price of lights cigarettes and compensation for distress for each class member. Hearings took place in November and December 2008 regarding whether the case meets the legal requirements necessary to allow it to proceed as a class action. The parties' briefing on class certification is scheduled to be completed in June 2010.

At December 31, 2009, PMI's third-party guarantees were $5 million, which will expire through 2013 with $2 million guarantees expiring during 2010. PMI is required to perform under these guarantees in the event that a third party fails to make contractual payments. PMI does not have a liability on its consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2009, as the fair value of these guarantees is insignificant due to the fact that the probability of future payments under these guarantees is remote.
Under the terms of the Distribution Agreement between Altria and PMI, liabilities concerning tobacco products will be allocated based in substantial part on the manufacturer. PMI will indemnify Altria and PM USA for liabilities related to tobacco products manufactured by PMI or contract manufactured for PMI by PM USA, and PM USA will indemnify PMI for liabilities related to tobacco products manufactured by PM USA, excluding tobacco products contract manufactured for PMI. PMI does not have a liability recorded on its balance sheet at December 31, 2009, as the fair value of this indemnification is insignificant since the probability of future payments under this indemnification is remote.

Exhibit 99.2
REPORT OF MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
Management of Philip Morris International Inc. ("PMI") is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. PMI's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Internal control over financial reporting includes those written policies and procedures that:
 
 
 
 
Internal control over financial reporting includes the controls themselves, monitoring and internal auditing practices and actions taken to correct deficiencies as identified.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Management assessed the effectiveness of PMI's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009. Management based this assessment on criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in "" issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Management's assessment included an evaluation of the design of PMI's internal control over financial reporting and testing of the operational effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting. Management reviewed the results of its assessment with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.
Internal Control  Integrated Framework
Based on this assessment, management determined that, as of December 31, 2009, PMI maintained effective internal control over financial reporting.
PricewaterhouseCoopers SA, an independent registered public accounting firm, who audited and reported on the consolidated financial statements of PMI included in this report, has audited the effectiveness of PMI's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, as stated in their report herein.

Exhibit 99.3
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
    Philip Morris International Inc. and Subsidiaries:
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of earnings, stockholders' equity, and cash flows, present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Philip Morris International Inc. and its subsidiaries ("PMI") at December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2009 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, PMI maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on criteria established in issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). PMI's management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on PMI's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits (which were integrated audits for 2009 and 2008). We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
Internal Control - Integrated Framework
As discussed in Notes 13 and 2 to the consolidated financial statements, PMI changed the measurement date for non-U.S. pension plans in fiscal 2008 and the manner in which it accounts for uncertain tax positions in fiscal 2007.
A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,
and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
