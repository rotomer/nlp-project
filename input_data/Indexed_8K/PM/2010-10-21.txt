NEW YORK, October 21, 2010  Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE / Euronext Paris: PM) today announced reported diluted earnings per share of $0.99 in the third quarter of 2010, up by 6.5% from $0.93 in the third quarter of 2009. Excluding currency, reported diluted earnings per share were up by 4.3% as detailed on Schedule 13. Adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.00 were up by 7.5% from 2009 adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.93, including the items detailed on the attached Schedule 12. Excluding currency, adjusted diluted earnings per share were up 5.4%. Free cash flow, defined as net cash provided
by operating activities less capital expenditures, increased by 33.6% to $2.3 billion, as detailed on Schedule 19.
"As anticipated, our third quarter results suffered from various timing issues affecting several markets, Japan in particular. In addition, the significant excise tax increases that were implemented in Greece and Turkey continued to weigh on our overall performance," said Louis Camilleri, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "The notable highlight of the quarter was our continued strong cash flow performance allowing us to accelerate the implementation of our share repurchase program."
"I should also highlight that the headline quarterly numbers masked continued progress in our underlying performance on several fronts, and in particular on our widespread market share gains, such that we are now pleased to raise our full year earnings guidance to a range of $3.90 to $3.95, up by approximately 20% to 22% compared to $3.24 in 2009."

Dividends and Share Repurchase Program
PMI increased its regular quarterly dividend during the quarter to $0.64, up 10.3% from $0.58, which represents an annualized rate of $2.56 per common share. Since its spin-off in March 2008, PMI has increased its regular quarterly dividend by 39.0% from the initial annualized dividend rate of $1.84 per common share.
In April 2010, PMI completed its 2008-2010 share repurchase program of $13 billion and, in May 2010, initiated a new, three-year share repurchase program of $12 billion. During the quarter, PMI spent $1.1 billion to repurchase 20.7 million shares of its common stock, as shown in the table below.
 
PMI announces the acceleration of an additional $1.0 billion in share repurchases in 2010 to an approximate total of $5 billion.
Since May 2008, when PMI began its first share repurchase program, the company has spent an aggregate total of $14.9 billion to repurchase 315 million shares.
2010 Full-Year Forecast
PMI increases and narrows its forecast for 2010 full-year reported diluted earnings per share to a range of $3.90 to $3.95, up by approximately 20% to 22% compared to $3.24 in 2009, driven by favorable
 
currency at prevailing rates, an improved business performance and a lower tax rate. Excluding currency, reported diluted earnings per share are projected to increase by approximately 16% to 18%. This guidance includes $0.07 per share for the previously announced reversal of tax provisions, largely due to the completion of U.S. tax audits, and $0.01 per share for asset impairment and exit costs related to restructuring charges in Greece and Portugal. This guidance excludes the impact of any potential future acquisitions, asset impairment and exit cost charges, and any unusual events.
The factors described in the Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements section of this release represent continuing risks to these projections.
Management reviews operating companies income (OCI), which is defined as operating income before corporate expenses and amortization of intangibles, to evaluate segment performance and to allocate resources. In the following discussion, the term "net revenues" refers to net revenues, excluding excise taxes, unless otherwise stated. Management also reviews OCI, operating margins and EPS on an adjusted basis (which may exclude the impact of currency and other items such as acquisitions or asset impairment and exit costs), EBITDA, free cash flow and net debt. Management believes it is appropriate to disclose these measures to help investors analyze business performance and trends. For a reconciliation of operating companies income to operating income, see the Condensed Statements of Earnings provided with this release. Reconciliations of adjusted measures to corresponding GAAP measures are also provided with this release. References to total international cigarette market, total cigarette market, total market and market shares are PMI estimates based on latest available data from a number of sources. Comparisons are to the same prior-year period unless otherwise stated.
 
Net revenues of $6.6 billion were up by 0.4%, including unfavorable currency of $138 million due predominantly to the Euro. Excluding currency, net revenues increased by 2.5%, primarily driven by favorable pricing of $292 million across all business segments and acquisitions, partly offset by unfavorable volume/mix of $302 million. The favorable pricing variance was partly offset by the impact of a partial tax absorption in Egypt and Greece. Excluding currency and acquisitions, net revenues decreased by 0.2%, partly reflecting the payback of distributor inventory in Japan, built up in the second quarter of 2010 in anticipation of increased trade and consumer purchases ahead of the significant October 1, 2010, excise tax increase.
 
 
On a year-to-date basis, net revenues of $20.2 billion were up by 10.1%, including favorable currency of $734 million. Excluding currency, net revenues increased by 6.1%, primarily driven by favorable pricing of $1.1 billion across all business segments and the impact of acquisitions, partly offset by unfavorable volume/mix of $423 million.
 
Operating income decreased in the quarter by 0.5% to $2.8 billion. Reported operating companies income in the quarter was essentially flat at $2.9 billion, including favorable currency of $20 million. Excluding currency, operating companies income was down by 0.8%, primarily due to unfavorable volume/mix, timing of costs, and the unfavorable impact of the aforementioned asset impairment and exit costs in Greece and Portugal related to factory restructuring, partly offset by higher pricing. Excluding currency and the favorable impact of acquisitions which contributed 1.5 percentage points of growth, operating companies income was down by 2.3%.
Adjusted operating companies income in the quarter, which excludes $20 million of factory restructuring costs in Greece and Portugal, grew by 0.5%, as shown in the table below and detailed on Schedule 11.
On a year-to-date basis, operating companies income, excluding currency, was up by 7.2%, primarily driven by higher pricing, partly offset by unfavorable volume/mix and higher costs.

In Asia, PMI's cigarette shipment volume increased by 28.8%, primarily reflecting growth in Indonesia, Korea and Pakistan, as well as the favorable impact of the PMFTC Inc. business combination in the Philippines of 16.2 billion units. This was partially offset by the timing of shipments in Japan, reflecting the payback of the distributor inventory build-up in the second quarter of 2010 in anticipation of increased trade and consumer purchases ahead of the October 1, 2010, tax increase. In Latin America & Canada, cigarette shipment volume decreased by 1.7%, due mainly to unfavorable trade inventory movements in Colombia following the tax-driven price increase in July and a decline in the tax-paid market. On an organic basis, which excludes acquisitions, PMI's cigarette shipment volume was down by 2.9% in the quarter and by 1.6% year-to-date.
Total cigarette shipments of of 75.9 billion units were down by 1.2% in the quarter, or by a moderate 0.8% on a year-to-date basis, due primarily to a decrease in the EU, mainly reflecting: a share decline in Germany, lower share in Greece, driven by excise tax and VAT-driven price increases, and unfavorable distributor inventory movements in Italy; a slight decrease in EEMA of 0.2%, primarily due to Turkey, partially offset by robust growth in North Africa; an essentially flat performance in Asia, led by growth in Korea and the Philippines, offset by Japan; and growth in Latin America and Canada of 0.8%, driven by Argentina, Colombia and Mexico.

NICK ROLLI
Welcome. Thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a news release containing detailed information on our 2010 third-quarter results. You may access the release on our web site at www.pmi.com.
During our call today, we will be talking about results in the third quarter of 2010 and comparing them with the same period in 2009 unless otherwise stated. References to volumes are for PMI shipments. Industry volume and market shares are the latest data available from a number of internal and external sources. Net revenue data excludes excise taxes. "Acquisitions", for the purposes of this presentation, also include our business combination with Fortune Tobacco Corporation in the Philippines. Organic volume refers to volume excluding acquisitions.
You will find data tables showing how we made adjustments to net revenues and operating companies income, or "OCI", for currency, acquisitions, asset impairment, exit and other costs, free cash flow calculations, and adjustments to Earnings per Share, or "EPS", as well as reconciliations to U.S. GAAP measures, at the end of today's web cast slides, which are posted on our web site.
Today's remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results, and I direct your attention to the Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements disclosure in today's presentation and news release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections.
It is now my pleasure to introduce Hermann Waldemer, Chief Financial Officer.
Hermann.

Thank you, Nick, and welcome ladies and gentlemen.
As anticipated, our third quarter results were adversely impacted by various timing issues, in particular relating to Japan. More than half our organic volume decline in the quarter was attributable to the payback for the previously disclosed 3.4 billion unit build-up of stocks at our distributor in Japan during the second quarter this year. The lower sales to Japan also drove an unfavorable geographic mix in the quarter. We do, however, remain very competitive in this important market, where is growing share behind innovative line extensions, such as and , which reached a combined market share of 2.0% in the quarter.

We continued to face a difficult environment in both Greece and Turkey, resulting from the significant tax increases that occurred earlier this year. Industry volume in these markets was down by 8% and 6%, respectively, in the third quarter, and the widening of price gaps has led to consumer downtrading and an unfavorable product mix.
These three issues masked an otherwise strong underlying business performance. I would like to mention in particular the good results of , driven by the new architecture and innovative line extensions. The market share of was higher or stable in the third quarter across all four of our Regions.

A notable highlight of the quarter was our continued strong cash flow performance, with operating cash flow increasing by more than 30% in the third quarter. This allowed us to accelerate the implementation of our share repurchase program and to increase our dividend by 10.3% in September.
Indeed the strength of our underlying business, along with more favorable exchange rates and a lower tax rate, has led us to raise and narrow our reported diluted EPS guidance for 2010 to a range of $3.90 to $3.95. This represents a reported diluted EPS growth rate of approximately 20% to 22%, compared to the $3.24 achieved last year. Excluding currency, the growth rate in our guidance is now approximately 16% to 18%, compared to 14% to 17% projected previously.
Our cigarette volume in the quarter increased by 4.5% to 229.2 billion units, driven by our successful business combination with Fortune Tobacco in the Philippines. Excluding acquisitions, our volume declined by 2.9%, or 6.3 billion units.
In addition to Japan, Ukraine contributed 2.6 billion units to this decline, reflecting both the timing of shipments and market contraction following a series of tax-driven price increases. Our volume was also unfavorably influenced by lower industry volumes in such markets as Greece, Poland, Spain and Turkey.
On a year-to-date basis, our organic volume was down by 1.6%, or 10.5 billion units. The decline was driven in particular by Turkey and Ukraine, whose combined volume was
 
down 10.1 billion units, as well as by Greece and Spain. Our volume in a number of important emerging markets, including Algeria, Argentina, Egypt, Indonesia, Korea, Mexico and Russia, has, however, increased this year.
Our net revenues, excluding currency and acquisitions, were down slightly in the quarter, impacted in particular by the timing of shipments to Japan, the need to partially absorb taxes and lower volumes in Greece, lower volumes and an unfavorable mix in Turkey, and the lapping of last year's price increase in Germany. On a year-to-date basis, our net revenues, excluding currency and acquisitions, are up 3.6%.
Our OCI in the third quarter was unfavorably impacted by two timing effects and difficult comparisons, namely the aforementioned timing of Japanese shipments and pricing, as well as the tax-driven industry volume declines and unfavorable mix in Greece and Turkey, and lower industry volumes in Spain and Ukraine.
During the third quarter last year, we achieved a record pricing variance of $590 million. Our pricing variance in the third quarter this year was $292 million, as we notably lapped price increases in Germany and Turkey, and were obliged to partially absorb higher taxes in Greece. Consequently, we were not able to fully offset the lower volume and unfavorable geographic mix in this quarter, and adjusted OCI declined by 1.7%, excluding currency and acquisitions, while adjusted diluted EPS grew at the slower rate of 5.4%, excluding currency.
On a year-to-date basis, adjusted OCI increased by 4.5%, excluding currency and acquisitions. These results were impacted by lower volumes, the skew of our pricing variance this year towards the fourth quarter, and higher costs, which we were able to partially offset through our productivity program. As previously disclosed, tobacco leaf price increases are expected to have an impact of around $215 million for the full year 2010. In addition, we have increased our investments in marketing, sales, R&D and infrastructure. Going forward, we expect tobacco leaf price increases to be broadly in line with inflation and we will continue our rigorous focus on cost controls and productivity gains. Our adjusted diluted EPS growth so far this year was 12.5%, excluding currency.
The underlying strength of our business and favorable pricing prospects are the basis for our confidence in our full year guidance.
We expect to reap the benefit in the fourth quarter of recently implemented price increases in Argentina, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Russia and the UK. In addition, we have announced a price increase of 30 Euro cents across our portfolio in France, higher prices as of next month in Poland, and have filed for a price increase with the customs
 
authorities in Portugal. Furthermore, we will benefit substantially in the fourth quarter from the revaluation of the inventories at our distributor in Japan. This represents the increased margin on our future sales to the trade, but from an accounting perspective was taken in October in one go due to our import structure in this market. We therefore expect our pricing variance in the fourth quarter this year to be significantly higher than in the third quarter.
Our underlying business performed strongly in the third quarter, with a share gain for the company and for in the EU Region, and good share momentum across all Regions. PMI achieved year-on-year or sequential share growth notably in Algeria, Argentina, Egypt, Greece, Indonesia, Korea, Mexico, the Netherlands, Poland, Russia, Serbia, Spain and Turkey.

A key driver of our improved business momentum has been the successful roll-out of the new architecture. In the third quarter, the share of increased or was stable in all four of our Regions.

The market share of in the EU Region grew by 0.2 points in the third quarter to 18.4%, with solid performances notably in Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland and Spain. In the highly price sensitive German market, 's recovery is being hampered by a widening of price gaps. In Greece, consumers have been downtrading due to steep price increases and enlarged price gaps in a difficult economic environment.

Let me now turn to our momentum in key markets, starting with the EU Region. In the third quarter, total industry volume was down 5.5%, driven primarily by the recession-related double-digit decline of the Spanish market, the combination of price elasticity this year and trade purchase patterns last year in the Polish market, and the impact of higher prices and the economic crisis in Greece.
Our total market share in the EU Region increased by 0.2 points in the third quarter to 39.1%, behind an overall solid performance across our main markets.
In Greece, our market share is increasing sequentially, as the growth of has more than offset the decline in . To maintain the competitiveness of we were obliged to partially absorb tax increases that occurred earlier this year. We expect that the Greek market will continue to act as a drag on our regional profitability growth into the beginning of next year, while discussions on structural changes to the excise tax system continue.

Marlboro,
We increased our shipment volume in the very important Russian market by 1.4% in the third quarter to a record level of 25.4 billion units. This strong performance was driven by above premium , mid-price and low-price and . PMI implemented price increases of two to three Rubles per pack in July. The market is stabilizing overall and consumer downtrading continues to slow.

Industry volume during the third quarter in Ukraine is estimated to have been down about 15%, reflecting the size of trade purchases in June ahead of the latest tax increases, and a market contraction resulting from continuous price increases over the last two years. Our volume declined by 2.6 billion units, or about one quarter. Premium and mid-price gained share, but we shed share at the low end of the market. The improved mix and higher prices enabled us to strongly increase our profitability in Ukraine during the third quarter.

While the decline slowed in the third quarter, industry volume in Turkey was still down by about 6% year on year, as consumers have switched to contraband cigarettes and loose tobacco, following the very large tax-driven price increases earlier this year. Though our volume and product mix remains unfavorable compared to last year, our market share in
 
Turkey is starting to improve sequentially, which makes us optimistic that the outlook will be better next year after a difficult 2010.
While our shipments to Japan in the third quarter were 3.5 billion units below the prior year, sales by our distributor to the trade rose by 4.0 billion units, or 27.3%. We estimate that the retail trade built up about ten days of additional stock and consumers purchased some three weeks of stock ahead of the October 2010 retail price increase. Consequently, retail sales this month have been very limited and we will only be able to see the consumers' reaction to the higher prices towards the end of the quarter and during the first part of next year.
Let me remind you that the retail selling price for cigarettes grew very significantly this month, with a 37.5% increase for . While the price increases are unprecedented in their magnitude and take place in a deflationary environment, cigarettes remain relatively affordable and, therefore, we are optimistic that our profitability will be enhanced going forward.

Industry volume in Indonesia grew by a further 3.9% in the quarter, broadly in line with the annual trend. Our shipments were up 3.1% in the third quarter, despite the temporarily unfavorable impact on , the leading brand in Indonesia, of passing through the 10,000 Rupiah per pack price point. Our overall market share was down 0.2 points, while our profitability in Indonesia grew at a double-digit rate in the quarter, thanks to higher prices and the growing volumes.

In Korea, PMI volume increased by 9.7% in the third quarter, and our market share grew by 2.4 points to 17.0%, thanks in particular to and , whose growth in recent quarters in Korea has been nothing less than spectacular. Meanwhile, as elsewhere in the world, PMI continues to advocate for the adoption of a system of regular, moderate excise tax increases.

In the Latin America and Canada Region, overall industry volume in key markets was essentially stable in the quarter. The Canadian market grew by 4.2%, a slower pace that reflects the fact that we have lapped the period last year when the provincial authorities in Quebec and Ontario started to increase their enforcement against contraband sales. The markets in Argentina and Mexico were down slightly. Our strong share growth continued in the quarter in the key markets of Argentina and Mexico. In the latter,
Marlboro
 
continued to grow share and has now captured nearly half the market, helped by the roll-out of the new architecture.
Excluding currency and acquisitions, OCI in the quarter was up 2.2%, driven by higher pricing that was partly offset by lower volumes and an unfavorable mix in Canada, where low-price brands have become more prominent following the decline in the illicit trade. In the fourth quarter, profitability will be enhanced by the recently announced retail price increase of half a Peso in Argentina.
Our working capital reduction program is reinforcing our tremendous cash flow generation. In the third quarter this year, our operating cash flow was 30.9% higher at $2.4 billion. Excluding currency, operating cash flow was up by 43.6%. Free cash flow increased at the slightly faster rates of 33.6%, and 47.4% excluding currency.
On a year-to-date basis, our operating cash flow has reached $7.9 billion, for a cumulative total of $23.7 billion since the beginning of 2008. With one quarter to go, we have already surpassed the $21.7 billion cumulative three year operating cash flow target that we established at the spin by nearly 10%.
Our financial strength enables us to generously reward our shareholders. Thanks to the continued strong growth of our cash flow, we have increased our allocation for share repurchases for the full year to $5 billion, accelerating the rate of purchases this year under our previously approved program by $1 billion more than originally foreseen. In the third quarter, we spent $1.1 billion to purchase an additional 20.7 million shares and have spent $3.9 billion in all so far this year to buy 78.5 million shares.
In September, we increased our quarterly dividend by 10.3% to 64 cents a share, an annualized rate of $2.56. In fact, since the March 2008 spin, we have raised our dividend by 39% and our dividend yield stands at 4.5%.
So let me now summarize why we believe we continue to be an attractive investment opportunity.
We have strong business momentum going into the fourth quarter, and will benefit from higher margins in Japan, as well as price increases in Argentina, France, Indonesia, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Russia and the UK. We also have a more favorable currency tailwind
 
than previously factored into our forecast and a lower tax rate. Consequently, we are raising and narrowing our reported diluted EPS guidance for 2010 to a range of $3.90 to $3.95. Compared to 2009, this represents a strong growth rate of approximately 20% to 22%.
We have market leadership and are growing volume and overall share in emerging markets. is performing well behind its new brand architecture and innovative line extensions, with overall share up in the EU Region in the third quarter, and either increasing or stable in our three other Regions. Our pricing power remains strong due to our brand leadership and broad portfolio. The outlook for costs going forward is improving. Our growing cash flow has enabled us to accelerate our share repurchase program this year to a total spending target of $5 billion, and we raised our dividend by 10.3% in September, thus providing attractive returns to our shareholders.
