On October 25, 2011, Philip Morris International Inc. ("PMI") entered into a credit agreement (the "Credit Agreement") relating to a senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the "Facility") with the lenders named therein and Citibank International plc ("CIP"), as facility agent. The Facility provides for borrowings up to an aggregate principal amount of US$3.5 billion (or the equivalent in Euro) and expires on October 25, 2016.
Interest rates on borrowings under the Facility will be based on prevailing interest rates for U.S. Dollars or Euro, as applicable, and as further described in the Credit Agreement.
The Facility will be used for general corporate purposes. The Credit Agreement requires the maintenance of an EBITDA to interest ratio, as defined therein, of not less than 3.5 to 1.0.
The Credit Agreement contains certain events of default customary for credit facilities of this type (with customary grace periods, as applicable), including nonpayment of principal or interest when due; material incorrectness of representations and warranties when made; breach of covenants; bankruptcy and insolvency; unsatisfied ERISA obligations; unstayed material judgment beyond specified periods; acceleration or payment default of other material indebtedness; and invalidation of PMI's guaranty.
If any events of default occur and are not cured within applicable grace periods or waived, the outstanding loans may be accelerated and the lenders' commitments may be terminated. The occurrence of the bankruptcy and insolvency event of default will result in the automatic termination of commitments and acceleration of outstanding loans under the Credit Agreement.
The Facility replaces PMI's existing $2,692,500,000 revolving credit agreement, dated as of December 4, 2007, by and among PMI, J.P. Morgan Europe Limited, as facility agent, and the lender parties thereto, which was to expire on December 4, 2012 (the "2007 Credit Agreement"). The 2007 Credit Agreement was terminated effective October 25, 2011.
At October 25, 2011, PMI had no borrowings outstanding under the 2007 Credit Agreement.
Some of the lenders under the Credit Agreement and their affiliates have various relationships with PMI and its subsidiaries involving the provision of financial services, including cash management, investment banking and trust services. In addition, PMI and some of its subsidiaries may enter into foreign exchange and other derivative arrangements with certain of the lenders and their affiliates.
The description above is a summary and is qualified in its entirety by the Credit Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this report and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
The information set forth above under Item 1.01 regarding the 2007 Credit Agreement is hereby incorporated by reference into this Item 1.02.
Item 2.03. Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.

If clause (i) of this Section 2.18(b) is unenforceable for any reason in respect of any Borrower, then:

Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Agents for any taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings and all liabilities with respect thereto attributable to such Lender that are paid or payable by the Agents in connection with this Agreement and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges, withholdings or liabilities were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant governmental authority. The indemnity under this Section 2.18(e) shall be paid within 10 days after the applicable Agent delivers to the applicable Lender a certificate stating the amount of taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges, withholdings or liabilities so paid or payable by the Agent.

Revenue Service Forms W-9, W-8BEN or W-8ECI, as appropriate, or any successor or other form prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service), certifying that such Lender is exempt from or entitled to a reduced rate of Home Jurisdiction Withholding Taxes on payments pursuant to this Agreement. Thereafter, each such Lender shall provide additional forms or certificates (i) to the extent a form or certificate previously provided has become inaccurate or invalid or has otherwise ceased to be effective or (ii) as requested in writing by any Borrower, PMI or the relevant Agent. Unless the Borrowers, PMI and the Agents have received forms or other documents satisfactory to them indicating that payments hereunder are not subject to Home Jurisdiction Withholding Taxes or are subject to Home Jurisdiction Withholding Taxes at a rate reduced by an applicable tax treaty, such Borrowers, PMI or Agents shall withhold taxes from such payments at the applicable statutory rate in the case of payments to or for any Lender.
(g) If a payment made to a Lender hereunder would be subject to U.S. Federal withholding tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Agents at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the applicable Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Internal Revenue Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the applicable Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the applicable Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender's obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment.
(h) Any Lender claiming any additional amounts payable pursuant to this Section 2.18 agrees to use reasonable efforts (consistent with its internal policy and legal and regulatory restrictions) to select or change the jurisdiction of its Applicable Lending Office if the making of such a selection or change would avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, any such additional amounts that may thereafter accrue and would not, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, be otherwise economically disadvantageous to such Lender.
(i) No additional amounts will be payable pursuant to this Section 2.18 with respect to (i) any Home Jurisdiction Withholding Taxes that would not have been payable had the Lender provided the relevant forms or other documents pursuant to Section 2.18(f); or (ii) in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance by a Lender to an Eligible Assignee, any Home Jurisdiction Withholding Taxes that exceed the amount of such Home Jurisdiction Withholding Taxes that are imposed prior to such Assignment and Acceptance, unless such Assignment and Acceptance resulted from the demand of PMI.
(j) No additional amounts will be payable pursuant to this Section 2.18 with respect to any taxes imposed by the United States by means of withholding tax on payments made by any Borrower to any Lender's Applicable Lending Office or to any Agent, even if such taxes are imposed as a result of the treatment of payments made by a Borrower that is not organized under the laws of the United States as having been made by a United
 
States person for United States federal income tax purposes, including as a result of an election made to treat such Borrower as a disregarded entity for United States federal income tax purposes (regardless of whether such election was made after such Borrower became a Borrower under this Agreement), if and to the extent such taxes were in effect and would have been applicable as of the date hereof to payments to be made by a United States person to such Lender's Applicable Lending Office or to such Agent (as the case may be).
(k) If any Lender or Agent, as the case may be, obtains a refund of any Tax for which payment has been made pursuant to this Section 2.18, which refund in the good faith judgment of such Lender or Agent, as the case may be, (and without any obligation to disclose its tax records) is allocable to such payment made under this Section 2.18, the amount of such refund (together with any interest received thereon and reduced by reasonable costs incurred in obtaining such refund) promptly shall be paid to the Borrower to the extent payment has been made in full by the Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.18.

In connection with this opinion, we have examined a copy of the Credit Agreement signed by the Company and by the Facility Agent, the Swingline Agent and the Lenders.
In addition, we have examined, and relied as to matters of fact upon, the documents delivered to you at the closing, and upon originals, or duplicates or certified or conformed copies, of such records, agreements, documents and other instruments and such certificates or comparable documents of public officials and of officers and representatives of the Company and have made such other investigations as we have deemed relevant and necessary in connection with the opinion hereinafter set forth. In such examination, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the legal capacity of natural persons, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as duplicates or certified or conformed copies and the authenticity of the originals of such latter documents. In addition, we have relied as to certain matters of fact upon the representations made in the Credit Agreement.
In rendering the opinion set forth below we have assumed that (1) the Credit Agreement is a valid and legally binding obligation of each party thereto other than the Company, (2) the Company is validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is organized and has duly authorized, executed and delivered the Credit Agreement in accordance with its organizational documents, (3)(a) execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Credit Agreement do not violate, or require any consent not obtained under, the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is organized or any other applicable laws or any order known to us issued by any court or governmental agency or body and (c) execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Credit Agreement will not breach or result in a default under or result in the creation of any lien upon or security interest in the Company's properties pursuant to the terms of any agreement or instrument that is binding on the Company; and (4) the Company is not an "investment company" within the meaning of and subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

Our opinion set forth above is subject to (i) the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally, (ii) general equitable principles (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law), (iii) an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and (iv) the effects of the possible judicial application of foreign laws or foreign governmental or judicial action affecting creditors' rights.
We express no opinion with respect to:
(A) the effect of any provision of the Credit Agreement that is intended to permit modification thereof only by means of an agreement in writing by the parties thereto;
(B) the effect of any provision of the Credit Agreement insofar as it provides that any Person purchasing a participation from a Lender or other Person may exercise set-off or similar rights with respect to such participation or that any Lender or other Person may exercise set-off or similar rights other than in accordance with applicable law;
(C) the effect of any provision of the Credit Agreement imposing penalties or forfeitures;
(D) the enforceability of any provision of the Credit Agreement to the extent that such provision constitutes a waiver of illegality as a defense to performance of contract obligations; or
(E) the effect of any provision of the Credit Agreement relating to indemnification or exculpation in connection with violations of any securities laws or relating to indemnification, contribution or exculpation in connection with willful, reckless or criminal acts or gross negligence of the indemnified or exculpated Person or the Person receiving contribution.
In connection with the provisions of the Credit Agreement whereby the parties submit to the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States of America located in the State of New York, we note the limitation of 28 U.S.C.  1331 and 1332 on subject matter jurisdiction of the federal courts. In connection with the provisions of the Credit Agreement which relate to forum selection (including, without limitation, any waiver of any objection to venue or any objection that a court is an inconvenient forum), we note that under NYCPLR  510, a New York State court may have discretion to transfer the place of trial, and under 28 U.S.C.  1404(a), a United States district court has discretion to transfer an action from one federal court to another.
We do not express any opinion herein concerning any law other than the law of the State of New York and the federal law of the United States.

This opinion letter may not be relied upon by you for any other purpose, or relied upon by, or furnished to, any other person, firm or corporation without our prior written consent.
