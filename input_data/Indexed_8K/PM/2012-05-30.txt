This is one of the Securities of the series designated therein described in the within-mentioned Indenture.
 
This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of debentures, notes or other evidences of indebtedness (hereinafter called the "Securities") of the Company of the series hereinafter specified, which series is limited in aggregate principal amount to 750,000,000 (except as provided in the Indenture hereinafter mentioned), all such Securities issued and to be issued under an Indenture dated as of April 25, 2008 between the Company and HSBC Bank USA, National Association, as Trustee (herein called the "Indenture"), to which Indenture and all other indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the rights and limitations of rights thereunder of the Holders of the Securities and of the rights, obligations, duties and immunities of the Trustee for each series of Securities and of the Company, and the terms upon which the Securities are and are to be authenticated and delivered. As provided in the Indenture, the Securities may be issued in one or more series, which different series may be issued in various aggregate principal amounts, may mature at different times, may bear interest, if any, at different rates, may be subject to different redemption provisions, if any, may be subject to different sinking, purchase or analogous funds, if any, may be subject to different covenants and Events of Default and may otherwise vary as in the Indenture provided or permitted. This Note is one of a series of the Securities designated therein as 2.125% Notes due 2019 (the "Notes").
Principal and interest payments in respect of the Notes are payable by the Company in euro, but holders of beneficial interests in Global Securities held through the Depositary, other than Euroclear and Clearstream, will receive payments in Dollars unless they elect to receive payments in euro. If a Holder through the Depositary has not made such an election payments to the Holder will be converted to Dollars by exchange agent, which will be the Currency Determination Agent under the Indenture. All costs of conversion will be borne by the Holder by deduction from the payments. The Dollar amount of any payment in respect of principal or interest received by a Holder not electing payment in euro will be the amount of euro otherwise payable exchanged into Dollars at the euro/Dollar rate of exchange prevailing as at 11:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the day which is two Business Days prior to the relevant payment date, less any costs incurred by the exchange agent for the conversion (to be shared pro rata among the holders of beneficial interests in the Global Securities accepting Dollar payments in proportion to their respective holdings), all in accordance with the Indenture and the Notes. The Trustee will obtain a bid quotation from a leading foreign exchange bank in the City of New York, which may be the Trustee or selected by the Trustee for that purpose after consultation with the Company. If no bid quotation from a leading foreign exchange bank is available, payment will be made in euro to the account or accounts specified by the Depositary to the Trustee unless euro are unavailable due to the imposition of exchange controls or other circumstances beyond the Company's control.
The holder of a beneficial interest in the Global Securities held through a participant of the Depositary (other than Euroclear or Clearstream) may elect to receive payment or payments under a Global Security in euro by notifying the Depositary participant through which its Notes are held on or prior to the applicable Regular Record Date of (1) the Holder's election to receive
all or a portion of the payment in euro and (2) wire transfer instructions to a euro account located outside of the United States. The Depositary must be notified of an election and wire transfer instructions (1) on or prior to the third New York Business Day after the Regular Record Date for any payment of interest and (2) on or prior to the fifth New York Business Day prior to the date for any payment of principal. The Depositary will notify the Trustee of an election and wire transfer instructions (1) on or prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth New York Business Day after the Regular Record Date for any payment of interest and (2) on or prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the third New York Business Day prior to the date for any payment of principal. If complete instructions are forwarded to and received by the Depositary through Depositary participants and forwarded by the Depositary to the Trustee and received on or prior to such dates, such Holder will receive payment in euro outside the Depositary: otherwise, only Dollar payments will be made by the Trustee to the Depositary. All costs of conversion will be borne by holders of beneficial interests in the Global Securities receiving Dollars by deduction from those payments.
So long as the Notes of this series are in the form of Global Securities only, all Notes of this series will collectively be evidenced (a) by one or more Global Securities (the "DTC Global Notes") and (b) by the Global Security of this series registered in the name of HSBC Issuer Services Common Depositary Nominee (UK) Limited (the "International Global Note"). The DTC Global Notes and the International Global Note will at all times collectively represent the aggregate principal amount of this series outstanding from time to time. If at any time a portion of the International Global Note is exchanged for an interest in one or more DTC Global Notes, the principal amount of one or more DTC Global Notes shall be increased by the amount of such portion, and such DTC Global Notes shall be endorsed on the Schedule of Exchanges of Interests thereto to reflect such principal increase, subject to the limitation that in no event may the principal amount of any DTC Global Note be greater than the equivalent in Dollars of $500,000,000. If at any time a portion of a DTC Global Note is exchanged for an interest in the International Global Note, the principal amount of such DTC Global Note shall be decreased by the amount of such portion, and the DTC Global Note shall be endorsed on the Schedule of Exchanges of Interests thereto to reflect such principal decrease. To ascertain the Dollar equivalent of the principal amount endorsed on the Schedule of Exchanges of Interests attached to such DTC Global Note, inquiry shall be made of the Currency Determination Agent, and the Dollar equivalent quoted by the Currency Determination Agent (and the date of such quote) shall be noted on such Schedule of Exchanges of Interests next to the corresponding euro amount.
Section 1010 of the Indenture shall be applicable to the Notes, except that (i) the term "Holder," when used in Section 1010 of the Indenture, shall mean the beneficial owner of a Note or any person holding on behalf or for the account of the beneficial owner of a Note; (ii) the following language shall replace subsection (k) to Section 1010 of the Indenture "any tax, assessment or other governmental charge imposed pursuant to the provisions of Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code" and (iii) the following language shall be included as subsection (l) to Section 1010 of the Indenture "any combination of items (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g), (h), (i), (j) and (k)."
The Company may redeem the Notes prior to maturity in whole, but not in part, on not more than 60 days' notice and not less than 30 days' notice at a redemption price equal to the
principal amount of such Notes plus any accrued interest and additional amounts to the date fixed for redemption if:
 
 
and the Company in its business judgment determines that such obligations cannot be avoided by the use of reasonable measures available to the Company.
If the Company exercises its option to redeem the Notes, the Company will deliver to the Trustee a certificate signed by an authorized officer stating that it is entitled to redeem the Notes and the written opinion of independent legal counsel if required.
The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time of the entire principal of all the Securities of any series upon compliance by the Company with certain conditions set forth therein.
If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in Section 501(4) or 501(5) of the Indenture) with respect to the Notes shall occur and be continuing, then either the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of all series then Outstanding (or, if such default is not applicable to all series of the Securities, the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the then Outstanding Securities of all series to which it is applicable) (in each case voting as a single class) may declare the entire principal amount of the Securities of all series so affected due and payable in the manner and with effect provided in the Indenture.

This is one of the Securities of the series designated therein described in the within-mentioned Indenture.
 
This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of debentures, notes or other evidences of indebtedness (hereinafter called the "Securities") of the Company of the series hereinafter specified, which series is limited in aggregate principal amount to 600,000,000 (except as provided in the Indenture hereinafter mentioned), all such Securities issued and to be issued under an Indenture dated as of April 25, 2008 between the Company and HSBC Bank USA, National Association, as Trustee (herein called the "Indenture"), to which Indenture and all other indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the rights and limitations of rights thereunder of the Holders of the Securities and of the rights, obligations, duties and immunities of the Trustee for each series of Securities and of the Company, and the terms upon which the Securities are and are to be authenticated and delivered. As provided in the Indenture, the Securities may be issued in one or more series, which different series may be issued in various aggregate principal amounts, may mature at different times, may bear interest, if any, at different rates, may be subject to different redemption provisions, if any, may be subject to different sinking, purchase or analogous funds, if any, may be subject to different covenants and Events of Default and may otherwise vary as in the Indenture provided or permitted. This Note is one of a series of the Securities designated therein as 2.875% Notes due 2024 (the "Notes").
Principal and interest payments in respect of the Notes are payable by the Company in euro, but holders of beneficial interests in Global Securities held through the Depositary, other than Euroclear and Clearstream, will receive payments in Dollars unless they elect to receive payments in euro. If a Holder through the Depositary has not made such an election payments to the Holder will be converted to Dollars by exchange agent, which will be the Currency Determination Agent under the Indenture. All costs of conversion will be borne by the Holder by deduction from the payments. The Dollar amount of any payment in respect of principal or interest received by a Holder not electing payment in euro will be the amount of euro otherwise payable exchanged into Dollars at the euro/Dollar rate of exchange prevailing as at 11:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the day which is two Business Days prior to the relevant payment date, less any costs incurred by the exchange agent for the conversion (to be shared pro rata among the holders of beneficial interests in the Global Securities accepting Dollar payments in proportion to their respective holdings), all in accordance with the Indenture and the Notes. The Trustee will obtain a bid quotation from a leading foreign exchange bank in the City of New York, which may be the Trustee or selected by the Trustee for that purpose after consultation with the Company. If no bid quotation from a leading foreign exchange bank is available, payment will be made in euro to the account or accounts specified by the Depositary to the Trustee unless euro are unavailable due to the imposition of exchange controls or other circumstances beyond the Company's control.
The holder of a beneficial interest in the Global Securities held through a participant of the Depositary (other than Euroclear or Clearstream) may elect to receive payment or payments under a Global Security in euro by notifying the Depositary participant through which its Notes are held on or prior to the applicable Regular Record Date of (1) the Holder's election to receive
all or a portion of the payment in euro and (2) wire transfer instructions to a euro account located outside of the United States. The Depositary must be notified of an election and wire transfer instructions (1) on or prior to the third New York Business Day after the Regular Record Date for any payment of interest and (2) on or prior to the fifth New York Business Day prior to the date for any payment of principal. The Depositary will notify the Trustee of an election and wire transfer instructions (1) on or prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth New York Business Day after the Regular Record Date for any payment of interest and (2) on or prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the third New York Business Day prior to the date for any payment of principal. If complete instructions are forwarded to and received by the Depositary through Depositary participants and forwarded by the Depositary to the Trustee and received on or prior to such dates, such Holder will receive payment in euro outside the Depositary: otherwise, only Dollar payments will be made by the Trustee to the Depositary. All costs of conversion will be borne by holders of beneficial interests in the Global Securities receiving Dollars by deduction from those payments.
So long as the Notes of this series are in the form of Global Securities only, all Notes of this series will collectively be evidenced (a) by one or more Global Securities (the "DTC Global Notes") and (b) by the Global Security of this series registered in the name of HSBC Issuer Services Common Depositary Nominee (UK) Limited (the "International Global Note"). The DTC Global Notes and the International Global Note will at all times collectively represent the aggregate principal amount of this series outstanding from time to time. If at any time a portion of the International Global Note is exchanged for an interest in one or more DTC Global Notes, the principal amount of one or more DTC Global Notes shall be increased by the amount of such portion, and such DTC Global Notes shall be endorsed on the Schedule of Exchanges of Interests thereto to reflect such principal increase, subject to the limitation that in no event may the principal amount of any DTC Global Note be greater than the equivalent in Dollars of $500,000,000. If at any time a portion of a DTC Global Note is exchanged for an interest in the International Global Note, the principal amount of such DTC Global Note shall be decreased by the amount of such portion, and the DTC Global Note shall be endorsed on the Schedule of Exchanges of Interests thereto to reflect such principal decrease. To ascertain the Dollar equivalent of the principal amount endorsed on the Schedule of Exchanges of Interests attached to such DTC Global Note, inquiry shall be made of the Currency Determination Agent, and the Dollar equivalent quoted by the Currency Determination Agent (and the date of such quote) shall be noted on such Schedule of Exchanges of Interests next to the corresponding euro amount.
Section 1010 of the Indenture shall be applicable to the Notes, except that (i) the term "Holder," when used in Section 1010 of the Indenture, shall mean the beneficial owner of a Note or any person holding on behalf or for the account of the beneficial owner of a Note; (ii) the following language shall replace subsection (k) to Section 1010 of the Indenture "any tax, assessment or other governmental charge imposed pursuant to the provisions of Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code" and (iii) the following language shall be included as subsection (l) to Section 1010 of the Indenture "any combination of items (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g), (h), (i), (j) and (k)."
The Company may redeem the Notes prior to maturity in whole, but not in part, on not more than 60 days' notice and not less than 30 days' notice at a redemption price equal to the
principal amount of such Notes plus any accrued interest and additional amounts to the date fixed for redemption if:
 
 
and the Company in its business judgment determines that such obligations cannot be avoided by the use of reasonable measures available to the Company.
If the Company exercises its option to redeem the Notes, the Company will deliver to the Trustee a certificate signed by an authorized officer stating that it is entitled to redeem the Notes and the written opinion of independent legal counsel if required.
The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time of the entire principal of all the Securities of any series upon compliance by the Company with certain conditions set forth therein.
If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in Section 501(4) or 501(5) of the Indenture) with respect to the Notes shall occur and be continuing, then either the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of all series then Outstanding (or, if such default is not applicable to all series of the Securities, the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the then Outstanding Securities of all series to which it is applicable) (in each case voting as a single class) may declare the entire principal amount of the Securities of all series so affected due and payable in the manner and with effect provided in the Indenture. If an Event of Default specified in Section 501(4) or 501(5) occurs with respect to the Company, all of the unpaid principal amount and accrued interest then Outstanding shall become and be immediately due and payable in the manner with the effect provided in the Indenture without any declaration or other act by the Trustee or any Holder.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, PHILIP MORRIS INTERNATIONAL INC. has caused this instrument to be duly executed.
 
 
This is one of the Securities of the series designated therein described in the within-mentioned Indenture.
 
This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of debentures, notes or other evidences of indebtedness (hereinafter called the "Securities") of the Company of the series hereinafter specified, which series is limited in aggregate principal amount to 600,000,000 (except as provided in the Indenture hereinafter mentioned), all such Securities issued and to be issued under an Indenture dated as of April 25, 2008 between the Company and HSBC Bank USA, National Association, as Trustee (herein called the "Indenture"), to which Indenture and all other indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the rights and limitations of rights thereunder of the Holders of the Securities and of the rights, obligations, duties and immunities of the Trustee for each series of Securities and of the Company, and the terms upon which the Securities are and are to be authenticated and delivered. As provided in the Indenture, the Securities may be issued in one or more series, which different series may be issued in various aggregate principal amounts, may mature at different times, may bear interest, if any, at different rates, may be subject to different redemption provisions, if any, may be subject to different sinking, purchase or analogous funds, if any, may be subject to different covenants and Events of Default and may otherwise vary as in the Indenture provided or permitted. This Note is one of a series of the Securities designated therein as 2.875% Notes due 2024 (the "Notes").
Principal and interest payments in respect of the Notes are payable by the Company in euro, but holders of beneficial interests in Global Securities held through the Depository Trust Company ("DTC"), other than Euroclear and Clearstream, will receive payments in Dollars unless they elect to receive payments in euro. If a Holder through DTC has not made such an election, payments to the Holder will be converted to Dollars by the exchange agent, which will be the Currency Determination Agent under the Indenture. All costs of conversion will be borne by the Holder by deduction from the payments. The Dollar amount of any payment in respect of principal or interest received by a Holder not electing payment in euro will be the amount of euro otherwise payable exchanged into Dollars at the euro/Dollar rate of exchange prevailing as at 11:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the day which is two Business Days prior to the relevant payment date, less any costs incurred by the exchange agent for the conversion (to be shared pro rata among the holders of beneficial interests in the Global Securities accepting Dollar payments in proportion to their respective holdings), all in accordance with the Indenture and the Notes.
The Trustee will obtain a bid quotation from a leading foreign exchange bank in the City of New York, which may be the Trustee or selected by the Trustee for that purpose after consultation with the Company. If no bid quotation from a leading foreign exchange bank is available, payment will be made in euro to the account or accounts specified by DTC to the Trustee unless euro are unavailable due to the imposition of exchange controls or other circumstances beyond the Company's control.
The holder of a beneficial interest in the Global Securities held through a participant of DTC (other than Euroclear or Clearstream) may elect to receive payment or payments under a Global Security in euro by notifying the DTC participant through which its Notes are held on or prior to the applicable Regular Record Date of (1) the Holder's election to receive all or a portion
of the payment in euro and (2) wire transfer instructions to a euro account located outside of the United States. DTC must be notified of an election and wire transfer instructions (1) on or prior to the third New York Business Day after the Regular Record Date for any payment of interest and (2) on or prior to the fifth New York Business Day prior to the date for any payment of principal. DTC will notify the Trustee of an election and wire transfer instructions (1) on or prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth New York Business Day after the Regular Record Date for any payment of interest and (2) on or prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the third New York Business Day prior to the date for any payment of principal. If complete instructions are forwarded to and received by DTC through DTC participants and forwarded by DTC to the Trustee and received on or prior to such dates, such Holder will receive payment in euro outside DTC: otherwise, only Dollar payments will be made by the Trustee to DTC. All costs of conversion will be borne by holders of beneficial interests in the Global Securities receiving Dollars by deduction from those payments.
So long as the Notes of this series are in the form of Global Securities only, all Notes of this series will collectively be evidenced (a) by one or more Global Securities (the "DTC Global Notes") and (b) by the Global Security of this series registered in the name of HSBC Issuer Services Common Depositary Nominee (UK) Limited (the "International Global Note"). The DTC Global Notes and the International Global Note will at all times collectively represent the aggregate principal amount of this series outstanding from time to time. If at any time a portion of the International Global Note is exchanged for an interest in one or more DTC Global Notes, the principal amount of one or more DTC Global Notes shall be increased by the amount of such portion, and such DTC Global Notes shall be endorsed on the Schedule of Exchanges of Interests thereto to reflect such principal increase, subject to the limitation that in no event may the principal amount of any DTC Global Note be greater than the equivalent in Dollars of $500,000,000. If at any time a portion of a DTC Global Note is exchanged for an interest in the International Global Note, the principal amount of such DTC Global Note shall be decreased by the amount of such portion, and the DTC Global Note shall be endorsed on the Schedule of Exchanges of Interests thereto to reflect such principal decrease. To ascertain the Dollar equivalent of the principal amount endorsed on the Schedule of Exchanges of Interests attached to such DTC Global Note, inquiry shall be made of the Currency Determination Agent, and the Dollar equivalent quoted by the Currency Determination Agent (and the date of such quote) shall be noted on such Schedule of Exchanges of Interests next to the corresponding euro amount.
Section 1010 of the Indenture shall be applicable to the Notes, except that (i) the term "Holder," when used in Section 1010 of the Indenture, shall mean the beneficial owner of a Note or any person holding on behalf or for the account of the beneficial owner of a Note; (ii) the following language shall replace subsection (k) to Section 1010 of the Indenture "any tax, assessment or other governmental charge imposed pursuant to the provisions of Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code" and (iii) the following language shall be included as subsection (l) to Section 1010 of the Indenture "any combination of items (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g), (h), (i), (j) and (k)."
The Company may redeem the Notes prior to maturity in whole, but not in part, on not more than 60 days' notice and not less than 30 days' notice at a redemption price equal to the principal amount of such Notes plus any accrued interest and additional amounts to the date fixed for redemption if:
 
and the Company in its business judgment determines that such obligations cannot be avoided by the use of reasonable measures available to the Company.
If the Company exercises its option to redeem the Notes, the Company will deliver to the Trustee a certificate signed by an authorized officer stating that it is entitled to redeem the Notes and the written opinion of independent legal counsel if required.
The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time of the entire principal of all the Securities of any series upon compliance by the Company with certain conditions set forth therein.
If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in Section 501(4) or 501(5) of the Indenture) with respect to the Notes shall occur and be continuing, then either the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of all series then Outstanding (or, if such default is not applicable to all series of the Securities, the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the then Outstanding Securities of all series to which it is applicable) (in each case voting as a single class) may declare the entire principal amount of the Securities of all series so affected due and payable in the manner and with effect provided in the Indenture. If an Event of Default specified in Section 501(4) or 501(5) occurs with respect to the Company, all of the unpaid principal amount and accrued interest then Outstanding shall become and be immediately due and payable in the manner with the effect provided in the Indenture without any declaration or other act by the Trustee or any Holder.
