Item 8.01.   Other Events.
On June 21 and 22, 2012, Philip Morris International Inc. ("PMI") is holding a two-day investor meeting ("2012 Investor Day"). In connection with the 2012 Investor Day, PMI is issuing a press release (the "Press Release") on June 21, 2012 announcing key highlights of the presentations made during the 2012 Investor Day.
A copy of the Press Release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference into this Current Report on Form 8-K.
Adjusted diluted EPS is not a U.S. GAAP measure. PMI defines adjusted diluted EPS as reported diluted EPS adjusted for asset impairment and exit costs, discrete tax items and unusual items. PMI believes it is appropriate to disclose this measure as it represents core earnings, improves comparability and helps investors analyze business performance and trends. Adjusted diluted EPS should be considered neither in isolation nor as a substitute for reported diluted EPS prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
The information on PMI's website referenced in the press release, including the presentations made during the 2012 Investor Day, is not, and shall not be deemed to be, part of this Form 8-K or incorporated into any filing PMI makes with the Securities and Exchange Commission, except as expressly set forth in such a filing.
Item 9.01.   Exhibits.
(d)
Exhibits
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
DATE: June 21, 2012
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
NEW YORK, June 21, 2012  Philip Morris International Inc.'s (NYSE / Euronext Paris: PM) senior management will offer its perspective on the company's business outlook and long-term growth strategies at a two-day investor meeting starting today at approximately 9:00 a.m. (Swiss time) at its Operations Center in Lausanne, Switzerland.
PMI revises, for prevailing exchange rates only, its 2012 full-year reported diluted earnings per share forecast to be in a range of $5.10 to $5.20, versus $4.85 in 2011. Excluding a forecasted total unfavorable currency impact of approximately $0.25 for the full-year 2012, reported diluted earnings per share are projected to increase by approximately 10% to 12% versus adjusted diluted earnings per share of $4.88 in 2011.
Adjusted diluted earnings per share of $4.88 in 2011 is calculated as reported diluted earnings per share of $4.85, less a $0.02 per share benefit for discrete tax items, plus a $0.05 per share charge related to asset impairment and exit costs.
This guidance excludes the impact of any potential future acquisitions, unanticipated asset impairment and exit cost charges, and any unusual events.
Highlights of the event include:
