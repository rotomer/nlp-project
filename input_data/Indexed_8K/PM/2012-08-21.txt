This is one of the Securities of the series designated therein described in the within-mentioned Indenture.
 
This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of debentures, notes or other evidences of indebtedness (hereinafter called the "Securities") of the Company of the series hereinafter specified, which series is limited in aggregate principal amount to $750,000,000 (except as provided in the Indenture hereinafter mentioned), all such Securities issued and to be issued under an Indenture dated as of April 25, 2008 between the Company and HSBC Bank USA, National Association, as Trustee (herein called the "Indenture"), to which Indenture and all other indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the rights and limitations of rights thereunder of the Holders of the Securities and of the rights, obligations, duties and immunities of the Trustee for each series of Securities and of the Company, and the terms upon which the Securities are and are to be authenticated and delivered. As provided in the Indenture, the Securities may be issued in one or more series, which different series may be issued in various aggregate principal amounts, may mature at different times, may bear interest, if any, at different rates, may be subject to different redemption provisions, if any, may be subject to different sinking, purchase or analogous funds, if any, may be subject to different covenants and Events of Default and may otherwise vary as in the Indenture provided or permitted. This Note is one of a series of the Securities designated therein as 2.500% Notes due 2022 (the "Notes").
Section 1010 of the Indenture shall be applicable to the Notes, except that (i) the term "Holder," when used in Section 1010 of the Indenture, shall mean the beneficial owner of a Note or any person holding on behalf or for account of the beneficial owner of a Note; (ii) the following language shall replace subsection (k) to Section 1010 of the Indenture "any tax, assessment or other governmental charge imposed pursuant to the provisions of Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code" and (iii) the following language shall be included as subsection (l) to Section 1010 of the Indenture "any combination of items (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g), (h), (i), (j) and (k)."
The Company may redeem the Notes prior to maturity in whole, but not in part, on not more than 60 days' notice and not less than 30 days' notice at a redemption price equal to the principal amount of such Notes plus any accrued interest and additional amounts to the date fixed for redemption if:
 
 
and the Company in its business judgment determines that such obligations cannot be avoided by the use of reasonable measures available to the Company.

The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time of the entire principal of all the Securities of any series upon compliance by the Company with certain conditions set forth therein.
If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in Section 501(4) or 501(5) of the Indenture) with respect to the Notes shall occur and be continuing, then either the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of all series then Outstanding (or, if such default is not applicable to all series of the Securities, the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the then Outstanding Securities of all series to which it is applicable) (in each case voting as a single class) may declare the entire principal amount of the Securities of all series so affected due and payable in the manner and with effect provided in the Indenture. If an Event of Default specified in Section 501(4) or 501(5) occurs with respect to the Company, all of the unpaid principal amount and accrued interest then Outstanding shall become and be immediately due and payable in the manner with the effect provided in the Indenture without any declaration or other act by the Trustee or any Holder.

The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities under the Indenture at any time by the Company with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of all series of Securities affected thereby (voting as a single class). The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of all series affected thereby at the time Outstanding (voting as a single class) to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences to the affected series. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Note and of any Note issued upon the transfer hereof or in exchange or in lieu hereof whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note.
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay
the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on this Note at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein and in the Indenture prescribed.
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, this Note is transferable on the Security Register of the Company, upon surrender of this Note for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company to be maintained for that purpose in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, or at any other office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar duly executed by the Holder hereof or his or her attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Notes, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.
The Notes are issuable only in registered form in denominations of $2,000 and any integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Notes are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Notes of a like tenor and of a different authorized denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.
No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
The Company, the Trustee for the Notes and any agent of the Company or such Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Note is registered as the owner hereof for the purpose of receiving payment as herein provided and for all other purposes, whether or not this Note be overdue, and neither the Company, such Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
Certain of the Company's obligations under the Indenture with respect to Notes may be terminated if the Company irrevocably deposits with the Trustee money or Government Obligations sufficient to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on all Notes, as provided in the Indenture.
This Note shall for all purposes be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York.
Certain terms used in this Note which are defined in the Indenture have the meanings set forth therein.

We have acted as special counsel to Philip Morris International Inc., a Virginia corporation (the "Company"), in connection with (1) the registration by the Company of an indeterminate amount of its debt securities (the "Debt Securities") and warrants to purchase Debt Securities, as set forth in the Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-172490) (the "Registration Statement") filed by the Company on February 28, 2011 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), and (2) the Company's offering and sale of $750,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 1.125% Notes due 2017, $750,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 2.500% Notes due 2022 and $750,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 3.875% Notes due 2042 (collectively, the "Notes").
The Notes were offered and sold as described in the prospectus, dated February 28, 2011, contained in the Registration Statement, and the prospectus supplement thereto, dated August 14, 2012 (collectively, the "Prospectus").
