Dividends and Share Repurchase Program
PMI increased its regular quarterly dividend during the quarter to $0.85, up by 10.4% from $0.77, which represents an annualized rate of $3.40 per common share. Since its spin-off in March 2008, PMI has increased its regular quarterly dividend by 84.8% from the initial annualized rate of $1.84 per common share.
In July 2012, PMI completed ahead of schedule its three-year share repurchase program of $12 billion that began in May 2010, and, in August 2012, initiated a new three-year share repurchase program of
 
$18 billion. During the quarter, PMI spent $1.5 billion to repurchase 16.7 million shares. On a September year-to-date basis, PMI spent $4.5 billion to repurchase 52.5 million shares, as shown in the table below.
 
Since May 2008, when PMI began its first share repurchase program of $13 billion, which was completed in April 2010, the company has spent an aggregate of $25.9 billion to repurchase 466.6 million shares at an average price of $55.49 per share, or 22.1% of the shares outstanding at the time of the spin-off in March 2008. PMI has a share repurchase target for the full-year 2012 of $6 billion.
2012 Full-Year Forecast
PMI narrows, at prevailing exchange rates, its 2012 full-year reported diluted earnings per share forecast to a range of $5.12 to $5.18 versus $4.85 in 2011. Excluding incremental adjustments since the previously announced forecast of July 19, 2012, of $0.05 per share for a net tax expense of $79 million related to the completion of the U.S. Federal Income Tax audit for the years 2004 through 2006, and $0.01 per share for asset impairment and exit costs, the range is forecast to be $5.18 to $5.24.
Excluding a forecasted total unfavorable currency impact of approximately $0.23 for the full-year 2012, which compares favorably by $0.04 per share to the unfavorable full-year currency forecast of $0.27 per share previously announced on July 19, 2012, the reported diluted earnings forecast range of $5.12 to $5.18 per share represents a projected increase of approximately 10.5% to 11.5% versus $4.85 in 2011.
Excluding the unfavorable impact of currency, the aforementioned net tax expense of $0.05 per share and year-to-date asset impairment and exit costs of $0.02 per share, the full-year reported diluted earnings forecast range of $5.12 to $5.18 per share represents a growth rate of approximately 11% to 12% versus adjusted diluted earnings per share of $4.88 in 2011, as detailed in the attached Schedule 20.
This guidance excludes the impact of any potential future acquisitions, unanticipated asset impairment and exit cost charges, and any unusual events.
The factors described in the Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements section of this release represent continuing risks to these projections.
In this press release, "PMI" refers to Philip Morris International Inc. and its subsidiaries. References to total international cigarette market, defined as worldwide cigarette volume excluding the United States, total cigarette market, total market and market shares are PMI estimates based on the latest available data from a number of internal and external sources and may, in defined instances, exclude the People's Republic of China and/or PMI's duty-free business. The term "net revenues" refers to operating revenues from the sale of our products, excluding excise taxes and net of sales and promotion incentives.
 
Operating companies income, or "OCI", is defined as operating income before general corporate expenses and the amortization of intangibles. PMI's management evaluates business segment performance and allocates resources based on OCI.

PMI believes it is appropriate to disclose these measures as they improve comparability and help investors analyze business performance and trends. Non-GAAP measures used in this release should be considered neither in isolation nor as a substitute for the financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Comparisons are to the same prior-year period unless otherwise stated. For a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to corresponding GAAP measures, see the relevant schedules provided with this release.

NICK ROLLI
Welcome. Thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a press release containing detailed information on our 2012 third-quarter results. You may access the release on our web site at www.pmi.com.
During our call today, we will be talking about results for the third-quarter 2012 and comparing them with the same period in 2011, unless otherwise stated. References to volumes are to PMI shipments. Industry volume and market shares are the latest data available from a number of internal and external sources. Organic volume refers to volume excluding acquisitions. Net revenues exclude excise taxes. Operating Companies Income, or "OCI", is defined as operating income before general corporate expenses and the amortization of intangibles.
You will find data tables showing adjustments to net revenues and OCI, for currency, acquisitions, asset impairment, exit and other costs, free cash flow calculations, and adjustments to earnings per share, or "EPS", as well as reconciliations to U.S. GAAP measures, at the end of today's webcast slides, which are posted on our web site.
Today's remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results. I direct your attention to the Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements disclosure in today's presentation and press release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements.
It's now my pleasure to introduce Jacek Olczak, our Chief Financial Officer.

JACEK OLCZAK
 
Thank you Nick, and welcome ladies and gentlemen.
We remain confident that the fundamentals of our business are solid, despite the difficult comparisons in the third-quarter that we have previously discussed. We expect to achieve our annual organic volume growth target of 1% and adjusted diluted EPS growth in line with our mid-to-long term constant currency annual growth target for the full year 2012.
Today, we narrowed the range of our 2012 reported diluted earnings per share guidance to $5.12 to $5.18, compared to $4.85 in 2011.
This guidance includes unfavorable currency of 23 cents, a tax charge of 5 cents related to the closing of the U.S. Federal Income Tax Audit for the years 2004  2006 and 2 cents for asset impairment and exit costs.
Excluding the impact of currency, the aforementioned tax charge and asset impairment and exit costs, our guidance implies a growth rate of approximately 11% to 12%, compared to an adjusted diluted EPS of $4.88 in 2011. Let me remind you that if we exclude the 10 cent hurdle due to Japan in 2011, the growth rate would be even higher at 13.5% to 14.5%.
Our revised guidance also reflects increased investments in marketing, sales and distribution, particularly in the Asia and EEMA Regions.
Turning to our third-quarter results.
We posted our strongest-ever quarterly results this time last year, with organic cigarette volume growth of 4.4% and adjusted diluted EPS up 33% on a currency-neutral basis.
As expected, therefore, our third quarter results this year suffered from these very tough comparisons with organic cigarette volume down 1.3% and adjusted diluted EPS up only 5.8% on a currency-neutral basis.
Through the end of September this year, we have achieved strong results with organic cigarette volume up by 0.7%. Excluding currency and acquisitions, our net revenues and adjusted OCI have increased by 5.4% and 6.9%, respectively. Adjusted diluted EPS has grown on a currency-neutral basis by 10.9%.
Let me now move to the European Union where economic conditions continue to be very difficult.
 
Unemployment continues to rise in the southern European countries, most notably Spain. Consequently, tax-paid cigarette volumes were down at a double-digit rate in the quarter in Greece, Spain and Italy while, in contrast, the decline in Germany was a much more moderate 2.0%. For the EU Region as a whole, the decline was 7.5%, an improved trend compared to the second quarter, and down 6.5% through the first nine months of the year. For the full-year 2012, we still expect that cigarette industry volume will decline by about 6%.
A key component in the decline of the duty-paid cigarette markets in Southern Europe has been adult smokers switching to lower-taxed fine cut products and to illicit cigarettes. This can be illustrated by Italy, where the duty-paid cigarette industry volume declined by 10.1% during the third quarter, while fine cut grew by 41%. In addition, the incidence of non-domestic illicit trade for 2012 in Italy is expected to reach approximately 9%, up from an estimated 6.5% in 2011.
Our business performed very well in this difficult environment. gained 0.8 points in the quarter to reach a cigarette market share of 23.5%. This was sufficient, along with the 0.4 share points gained by , to more than offset the share decline of our traditional local brand Overall, PMI's market share rose by 0.2 points to 53.2%. We are now also the leader in the fine cut category and doubled our share to 27.2% behind and the launch of .

In Germany, where unemployment remains low, cigarette industry volume declined just 2.0% in the third quarter, while sales of fine cut products increased by 2.3%. These robust trends took place despite tax-driven retail price increases earlier this year, and were due in part to a reduction in border sales.
continued to gain share in the cigarette category in the third quarter, up 0.2 points to 21.0%. With essentially stable at 10.2%, our overall cigarette market share was in line with 2011.

In the EU Region as a whole, economic conditions will remain difficult until the issue of unemployment is tackled. In the third quarter, our cigarette shipments declined by 8.1%, or 4.6 billion units, driven by the 7.5% decrease in industry volume. Our fine cut volume, in contrast, increased by 15.2%. The drop in our cigarette volume can be, in large part, attributed to an increase in illicit trade, particularly in southern European countries where total tobacco smoking incidence levels have remained relatively stable.
 
We are very pleased by the performance of in the quarter. In an obviously difficult environment for premium brands, was able to expand its market share by 0.4 points to 18.4%.

Across the EU Region, our pricing remained strong, the latest increase having taken place this month in France. However, the positive pricing variance was insufficient to offset the volume decline. Net revenues and adjusted OCI, excluding currency, were consequently down by 1.9% and 2.9%, respectively. This also reflects the continued investments behind our brands and field sales force. In the first nine months of the year, adjusted OCI on the same basis has decreased by just 0.9%, and we remain confident that we should be able to achieve an increase in profitability, excluding currency, in the EU Region for the full-year 2012.
Our results in the Asia Region were impacted by the difficult volume comparisons in Japan and Korea, where our shipments grew by 47.1% and 22.4%, respectively, in the third quarter of 2011. We also faced challenging comparisons in Indonesia, where we achieved a 22.5% volume increase in the third quarter of last year. Nevertheless, our volume this quarter in Indonesia grew by a further 13.0% as we continued to increase our share in this growing market.
Adjusted OCI, excluding currency and acquisitions, grew by 1.2% in the Asia Region during the quarter, this despite the unfavorable geographic mix. Improved profitability in Indonesia and higher pricing across the Region more than offset the impact of lower volumes in Japan and Korea. Importantly, our market share in Korea has sequentially improved from the second to third quarter of this year and is at a higher margin following our price increase in February 2012.
Industry volume in Japan declined by 7.7% in the quarter, compared to a very distorted third quarter last year when distributor and trade inventories had been replenished to ensure adequate stock levels following the events in Japan. Nevertheless, we still expect stable industry volume for the full-year 2012.
 
PMI's market share of 27.5% in the third quarter reflects a continued positive trend for , which increased its quarterly share sequentially in 2012 to 12.5%. On a September year-to-date basis, PMI's market share of 27.8% remains nearly 3 share points higher than the level before the events unfolded in Japan last year.

However, we have witnessed unusually high levels of competitive product introductions, which have put pressure on our traditional brands, and . We continue to develop our innovation pipeline and expect 's positive momentum to continue. For the full-year, we are now expecting our market share to be slightly below our 2011 exit share of approximately 28%.

Our leading position and our strong share momentum in Indonesia give us a unique position in the global tobacco industry. Market growth is expected to continue, driven by favorable demographics. In addition, improving consumer purchasing power is helping to drive uptrading, with the premium segment reaching a share of 27.4% in the third quarter, compared to 24.9% a year ago.
In the third quarter, we witnessed a decline in the low price segment, where retail selling prices have increased at a faster rate than in other price segments. As a result, combined with the anticipated enforcement of Decree 191 by the end of November, which will eliminate a tax loophole, we expect industry volume to grow in the range of 6-7% for the full-year 2012.
Our volume increased by a further 13.0% in the third quarter and market share grew by 3.3 points to 34.9% with a particularly strong performance from premium-price in the kretek category and in the "white" cigarette category.

Let me conclude the Asia Region with an update on plain packaging. As you know, the Australian High Court ruled in August that the plain packaging legislation does not violate the Australian Constitution and on October 5th issued its reasoning.
In reaching their conclusion, 6 of the 7 High Court judges recognized that plain packaging deprives tobacco companies of valuable intellectual property.
The conclusions of the High Court are significant for other governments considering plain packaging as they demonstrate that plain packaging is a deprivation of property, something that we expect would raise serious questions about the legality of plain packaging legislation in other jurisdictions.
The ruling turned on the specific, if not unique, nature of the Australian Constitution, which provides broad powers to the Commonwealth Parliament to make laws but contains few protections for basic rights. Australian law is
 
violated only if the Government, as the taker of property, receives a proprietary benefit from that property. Despite the fact that property was taken, the Court found that the government did not "acquire" the property because it did not receive such a proprietary benefit. By contrast, the law in Europe and other countries is different. For example, in contrast to the Australian Constitution, the Constitutions of the EU Member States generally contain strong protections for fundamental rights and place limits on the powers of central governments. A finding that manufacturers have been "deprived" of property would, in our view, amount to a violation of a number of EU and Member State laws.
Due to the scope of this specific case, the Australian High Court did not rule on whether plain packaging will reduce smoking prevalence or whether plain packaging breaches Australia's international trade and treaty obligations.
The High Court ruling confirms that other ongoing international legal cases are strong and that the Australian government is at serious risk of having to pay substantial compensation in these cases or bring its plain packaging measures into conformity with international treaties, or both.
Three countries have already initiated proceedings against Australia before the World Trade Organization (WTO) on the ground that the plain packaging legislation is contrary to Australia's obligations as a WTO member. PM Asia is suing the Australian government for multiple breaches of its Bilateral Investment Treaty with Hong Kong. Decisions in these cases are expected within two to three years. In broad terms, these cases will examine a number of issues, including:
 
 
 
 
We believe that the international legal cases are strong, and there is still a long way to go before all the legal questions about plain packaging are fully explored and resolved.
Let me now move to the Latin America & Canada Region, which had solid share momentum in the third quarter. Although volume was down, we increased our share in the key markets of Argentina, Brazil, Colombia and
 
Mexico. was particularly strong across the Region with share up in Brazil, Colombia and Mexico. Excluding currency, adjusted OCI increased by 10.5% in the third quarter.

The EEMA Region was our strongest performer in the quarter, this despite a challenging comparison. Volume grew by 3.0% with continued strong business momentum in Russia and Turkey, as well as an improving market climate in Egypt.
Higher volumes, a favorable mix, and pricing in Russia and many other markets, resulted in a growth in adjusted OCI, excluding currency and acquisitions, of 17.3%. This is the sixth consecutive quarter that our volume/mix has been favorable in the EEMA Region.
Russia was a key driver of our strong EEMA Region performance, both in terms of volume and pricing. In July, we implemented a tax-driven 3 Ruble per pack price increase. Along with lower revised estimates for industry volume in the first half of the year and higher prices in the market, industry volume is now expected to show a slight decline for the full-year 2012.
Our volume, in contrast, increased by 4.5% in the quarter thanks to our good share momentum, as well as some favorable inventory adjustments. Our Nielsen market share on a quarter and year-to-date basis through the end of August was 0.7 and 0.6 points higher at 26.5% and 26.2%, respectively. , and remain the key drivers of our stronger share performance. We are also pleased that 's turnaround is gaining momentum, with a 0.2 share point gain in the first two months of the quarter.

In Russia, the government approved amendments to the Tax Code at the end of September, including excise tax rates for the period 2013-2015. The government has reconfirmed the excise tax rates for cigarettes in 2013-2014 and extended the tax code to 2015 with an indexation of the specific excise tax set at 20%. The Duma will now review the code by mid-November and we expect a final vote by year-end.

We continue to expand our market share in our top 30 OCI markets. Our September year-to-date share reached 37.0%. This is 0.4 points above our full-year 2011 share and 1.5 points above our full-year 2010 share.
The pricing environment continues to be favorable. This is highlighted by the $505 million in pricing variance that we achieved in the third quarter and the $1.3 billion year-to-date.
The combination of strong pricing, limited input cost increases and productivity savings has enabled us to continue to grow our superior adjusted OCI margin. On a PMI-wide basis, our adjusted OCI margin, excluding currency and acquisitions, reached 46.2%, a gain of 0.7 points, in the first nine months of the year.
On a September year-to-date basis, our free cash flow reached $7.1 billion. Compared to the previous year, free cash flow, excluding currency, was down $1.7 billion or 18.6%. The decrease was driven by higher working capital requirements, mainly related to finished goods forestalling and the planned replenishment of tobacco leaf and clove inventories. For the full-year 2012, we expect that our free cash flow, excluding currency, will be down slightly and will not adversely impact our dividend and share repurchase programs.
Our confidence in the underlying strength of the business and our ability to continue to generate significant cash flow is reflected in the 10.4% increase in our dividend that was announced last month. Since the March 2008 spin-off, we have raised the dividend five times, increasing the annualized dividend by almost 85% over the period.
 
We spent $1.5 billion to repurchase a further 16.7 million shares in the third-quarter. Since the spin-off, we have now used almost $26 billion to repurchase nearly 467 million shares at an average price of $55.49. We continue to target spending of $6 billion this year.
In conclusion, the third quarter of 2012 was, as expected, a difficult quarter in terms of comparisons with last year's record third quarter.
Looking at our performance year-to-date through September, we remain confident that for the full year 2012, we should be able to deliver on our 1% organic volume annual growth target, driven by strong performances in the Asia and EEMA Regions.
We narrowed the range of our 2012 reported diluted EPS guidance to $5.12 to $5.18. Excluding the impact of currency, a tax charge and asset impairment and exit costs, our guidance implies a growth rate of approximately 11% to 12%.
Finally, we remain steadfast in our commitment to deliver superior returns to our shareholders evidenced by the fifth consecutive increase in our dividend since the spin and our $6 billion target for share repurchases this year.
Thank you. I will now be happy to answer your questions.
