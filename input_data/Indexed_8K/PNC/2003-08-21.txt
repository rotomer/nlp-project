United National Bancorp is a $3 billion asset bank holding company for UnitedTrust Bank, which provides a full range of commercial and retail bank services through 45 branches in New Jersey and seven branches in Pennsylvania. With this acquisition, PNC will increase its customer base by more than 100,000 households and businesses. "United National is a well-run organization with an exceptional work force and a great geographic fit," said James E. Rohr, chairman and chief executive officer of The PNC Financial Services Group. "UnitedTrust's retail and business customers will be well served by our comprehensive product offerings and our shared commitment to superior service. This agreement demonstrates our commitment to strategically and prudently expand our high-performing banking franchise. Combined with our recently announced Stop & Shop alliance, this transaction dramatically enhances our presence in this very attractive market - and we expect that it will be accretive to earnings in 2004."
"Combining with PNC makes great sense. We share a similar customer-focused culture and a deep commitment to the communities we serve," said Thomas C. Gregor, chairman, president and chief executive officer of United National Bancorp. "We look forward to working with the team at PNC to execute the integration smoothly and enhance the value we provide to customers and shareholders." Under the terms of the merger agreement, which has been unanimously approved by the Boards of Directors of both companies, United National Bancorp will merge with and into a subsidiary of PNC, with the PNC subsidiary surviving the merger.

United National Bancorp shareholders will be entitled to elect to receive the merger consideration in shares of PNC common stock or in cash, subject to pro-ration. The aggregate consideration is comprised of approximately 6.55 million shares of PNC common stock and $320 million in cash, subject to adjustment. The actual value of the merger consideration to be paid upon closing will be depend on the average PNC stock price shortly prior to completion of the merger, and the cash and stock components on a per United National Bancorp share basis will be determined at that time based on that average PNC stock price so that each share of United National Bancorp receives consideration representing equal value. The United National Bancorp stock options, currently with an aggregate in-the-money value of approximately $11 million, will be cashed out prior to closing, if not exercised. The transaction is anticipated to close in January 2004. The merger is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals and the approval of shareholders of United National Bancorp. After closing, UnitedTrust Bank branches will assume the PNC Bank name. An integration team, which has been formed with representatives from both companies, will report to Joseph C. Guyaux, president of The PNC Financial Services Group. "We believe that United National and PNC are an outstanding fit both strategically and culturally," said Guyaux, "We both share the desire to grow our core consumer and business banking franchise, provide excellent customer service and continue our commitment to make a difference in our communities. After getting to know United National's key leaders, we are very excited about the role they will play in helping to expand PNC's franchise."
