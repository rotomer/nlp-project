(ii) "AGGREGATE COMPANY SHARE AMOUNT" shall equal 18,822,954 shares of Company Common Stock; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Aggregate Company Share Amount shall be increased by virtue of the issuance of any shares of Company Common Stock upon the exercise from and after August 20, 2003 and prior to the Effective Time of Company Stock Options outstanding on August 20, 2003.

(vii) "EXCHANGEABLE SHARES" means the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, rounded to the nearest one-thousandth of a share. (viii)"PER SHARE AMOUNT" means the amount obtained by dividing the Closing Transaction Value by the number of Exchangeable Shares. The Cash Consideration and Stock Consideration are sometimes referred to herein collectively as the "MERGER CONSIDERATION." (e) ADJUSTMENTS TO PRESERVE TAX TREATMENT. (i) In the event that the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product of (i) the Aggregate Parent Share Amount and (ii) the Final Parent Share Value by (y) the sum of the Aggregate Cash Amount and the product of (i) the Aggregate Parent Share Amount and (ii) the Final Parent Share Value is less than 0.425, the Aggregate Parent Share Amount shall be increased by the Share Adjustment Amount (as defined in this Section 2.1(e)) and the Aggregate Cash Amount shall be decreased by the product of (x) the Final Parent Share Value and (y) the Share Adjustment Amount, where the "SHARE ADJUSTMENT AMOUNT" shall be equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the difference obtained by subtracting (i) the product of (a) 0.425 and (b) the sum of the Aggregate Cash Amount and the product of (1) the Aggregate Parent Share Amount and (2) the Final Parent Share Value from (ii) the product of (a) the Aggregate Parent Share Amount and (b) the Final Parent Share Value by (y) the Final Parent Share Value.

SECTION 2.2 PRORATION. (a) Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement, the total number of shares of Company Common Stock to be converted into Stock Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(c) (the "STOCK CONVERSION NUMBER") shall be equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the Aggregate Parent Share Amount by (y) the Exchange Ratio. All of the other shares of Company Common Stock shall be converted into Cash Consideration (in each case, excluding shares of Company Common Stock to be canceled as provided in Section 2.1(b) ). (b) Within five business days after the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.3), Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent (as defined in Section 2.4) to effect the allocation among holders of Company Common Stock of rights to receive the Cash Consideration and the Stock Consideration as follows: (i) If the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock with respect to which Stock Elections shall have been made (the "STOCK ELECTION NUMBER") exceeds the Stock Conversion Number, then all Cash Election Shares and all Non-Election Shares of each holder thereof shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration, and Stock Election Shares of each holder thereof will be converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration in respect of that number of Stock Election Shares equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of Stock Election Shares held by such holder by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Stock Conversion Number and the denominator of which is the Stock Election Number, with the remaining number of such holder's Stock Election Shares being converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration; and (ii) If the Stock Election Number is less than the Stock Conversion Number (the amount by which the Stock Conversion Number exceeds the Stock Election Number being referred to herein as the "SHORTFALL NUMBER"), then all Stock Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration and the Non-Election Shares and Cash Election Shares shall be treated in the following manner: (A) If the Shortfall Number is less than or equal to the number of Non-Election Shares, then all Cash Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration and the Non-Election Shares of each holder thereof shall convert into the right to 6
receive the Stock Consideration in respect of that number of Non-Election Shares equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of Non-Election Shares held by such holder by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Shortfall Number and the denominator of which is the total number of Non-Election Shares, with the remaining number of such holder's Non-Election Shares being converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration; or (B) If the Shortfall Number exceeds the number of Non-Election Shares, then all Non-Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration and Cash Election Shares of each holder thereof shall convert into the right to receive the Stock Consideration in respect of that number of Cash Election Shares equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of Cash Election Shares held by such holder by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount by which (1) the Shortfall Number exceeds (2) the total number of Non-Election Shares and the denominator of which is the total number of Cash Election Shares, with the remaining number of such holder's Cash Election Shares being converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration. SECTION 2.3 COMPANY STOCK OPTIONS. As of the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option representing a right to receive Company Common Stock upon exercise of such Company Stock Option outstanding at the Effective Time, whether or not exercisable or vested, shall be canceled and converted into the right to receive from Parent, subject to required withholding taxes, if any, cash in an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (x) the Cash Consideration over (y) the per share exercise price of such Company Stock Option for each share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option. The Board of Directors of the Company has taken action pursuant to Article XII of the Company's 2001 Non-Employee Director Long Term Equity Plan, Article XIII of the Company's 2001 Officer Long-Term Equity Plan, Article I of the Company's Long-Term Stock Based Incentive Plan, and Article VIII of the Company's 1995 Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee Directors to provide for the termination of such plans as of the Effective Time and the payments contemplated by the preceding sentence of this Section 2.3. SECTION 2.4 ELECTION AND EXCHANGE PROCEDURES. Each holder of record of shares of Company Common Stock ("HOLDER") shall have the right, subject to the limitations set forth in this Article II, to submit an election in accordance with the following procedures: (a) Each Holder may specify in a request made in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.4 (herein called an "ELECTION") (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock owned by such Holder with respect to which such 7
Holder desires to make a Stock Election and (y) the number of shares of Company Common Stock owned by such Holder with respect to which such Holder desires to make a Cash Election. (b) Parent shall prepare a form reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "FORM OF ELECTION") which shall be mailed to the Company's shareholders entitled to vote at the meeting of the shareholders of the Company at which the shareholders of the Company consider and vote on this Agreement (the "COMPANY SHAREHOLDERS MEETING") so as to permit the Company's shareholders to exercise their right to make an Election prior to the Election Deadline. (c) Parent shall make the Form of Election initially available at the time that the Proxy Statement (as defined herein) is made available to the shareholders of the Company, to such shareholders, and shall use all reasonable efforts to make available as promptly as possible a Form of Election to any shareholder of the Company who requests such Form of Election following the initial mailing of the Forms of Election and prior to the Election Deadline. In no event shall the Form of Election be made available less than twenty (20) days prior to the Election Deadline. (d) Any Election shall have been made properly only if the Person (as defined under Section 8.3) authorized to receive Elections and to act as exchange agent under this Agreement, which Person shall be designated by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "EXCHANGE AGENT"), pursuant to an agreement (the "EXCHANGE AGENT AGREEMENT") entered into prior to Closing and reasonably acceptable to the Company, shall have received, by 5:00 p.m. local time in the city in which the principal office of such Exchange Agent is located, on the date of the Election Deadline, a Form of Election properly completed and signed and accompanied by certificates of the shares of Company Common Stock (the "COMPANY STOCK CERTIFICATES") to which such Form of Election relates or by an appropriate customary guarantee of delivery of such certificates, as set forth in such Form of Election, from a member of any registered national securities exchange or a commercial bank or trust company in the United States; provided, that such certificates are in fact delivered to the Exchange Agent by the time required in such guarantee of delivery. Failure to deliver shares of Company Common Stock covered by such a guarantee of delivery within the time set forth on such guarantee shall be deemed to invalidate any otherwise properly made Election, unless otherwise determined by Parent, in its sole discretion. As used herein, "ELECTION DEADLINE" means 5:00 p.m. on the date that is the day prior to the date of the Company Shareholder Meeting. The Company and Parent shall cooperate to issue a press release reasonably satisfactory to each of them announcing the date of the Election Deadline not more than fifteen (15) business days before, and at least five (5) business days prior to, the Election Deadline. (e) Any Company shareholder may, at any time prior to the Election Deadline, change or revoke his or her Election by written notice received by the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline accompanied by a properly completed and signed, revised Form of Election. Subject to the terms of the Exchange Agent Agreement, if Parent shall determine in its reasonable discretion that any Election is not properly made with respect to any shares of Company Common Stock, such Election 8
shall be deemed to be not in effect, and the shares of Company Common Stock covered by such Election shall, for purposes hereof, be deemed to be Non-Election Shares, unless a proper Election is thereafter timely made. (f) Any Company shareholder may, at any time prior to the Election Deadline, revoke his or her Election by written notice received by the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline or by withdrawal prior to the Election Deadline of his or her Company Stock Certificate, or of the guarantee of delivery of such certificates, previously deposited with the Exchange Agent. All Elections shall be revoked automatically if the Exchange Agent is notified in writing by Parent or the Company that this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with Article VII. (g) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name a Company Stock Certificate so surrendered is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that such Company Stock Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other similar Taxes (as defined in Section 3.1(j)(xx)) required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Company Stock Certificate, or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable. The Exchange Agent (or, subsequent to the first anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration (including cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock) otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Company Common Stock such amounts as the Exchange Agent or Parent, as the case may be, is required to deduct and withhold under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law, with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent the amounts are so withheld by the Exchange Agent or Parent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of shares of Company Common Stock in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made by the Exchange Agent or Parent, as the case may be. (h) After the Effective Time there shall be no further registration or transfers of shares of Company Common Stock. If after the Effective Time, Company Stock Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Article II. (i) At any time following the first anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent shall be entitled to require the Exchange Agent to deliver to it any remaining portion of the Merger Consideration not distributed to Holders of shares of Company Common Stock that was deposited with the Exchange Agent at the Effective Time (the "EXCHANGE FUND") (including any interest received with respect thereto and other income resulting from investments by the Exchange Agent, as directed by Parent), and Holders shall be entitled to look only to the Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws) with respect to the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock and any dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock payable upon due surrender of their Company 9
Stock Certificates, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Parent nor the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Holder of a Company Stock Certificate for Merger Consideration (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or cash from the Exchange Fund in each case delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. (j) In the event any Company Stock Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Company Stock Certificate(s) to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such sum as Parent may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Company Stock Certificate(s), the Exchange Agent will issue the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Stock Certificates. (k) No dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Company Stock Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock represented thereby, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to subsection (l) below, and all such dividends, other distributions and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be paid by Parent to the Exchange Agent and shall be included in the Exchange Fund, in each case until the surrender of such Company Stock Certificate in accordance with subsection (l) below. Subject to the effect of applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws, following surrender of any such Company Stock Certificate there shall be paid to the Holder of a certificate for Parent Common Stock (a "PARENT STOCK CERTIFICATE") representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock and the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which such Holder is entitled pursuant to subsection (l), and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and with a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock. Parent shall make available to the Exchange Agent cash for these purposes, if necessary. (l) No Parent Stock Certificates representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Company Stock Certificates; no dividend or distribution by Parent shall relate to such fractional share interests; and such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights as a shareholder of Parent. In lieu of any such fractional shares, each Holder of a Company Stock Certificate who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fractional share interest in exchange for such Company Stock Certificate shall receive from the Exchange Agent an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A) the fractional share interest to which such Holder (after taking into 10
account all shares of Company Common Stock held by such holder at the Effective Time) would otherwise be entitled by (B) the Closing Parent Share Value. Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement, funds utilized to acquire fractional shares as aforesaid shall be furnished by Parent on a timely basis and shall in no event be derived from or diminish the Cash Consideration available for distribution as part of the Merger Consideration. (m) Subject to the terms of the Exchange Agent Agreement, Parent, in the exercise of its reasonable discretion, shall have the right to make all determinations, not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement, governing (A) the validity of the Forms of Election and compliance by any Company Shareholder with the Election procedures set forth herein, (B) the manner and extent to which Elections are to be taken into account in making the determinations prescribed by Section 2.4, (C) the issuance and delivery of Parent Stock Certificates into which shares of Company Common Stock are converted in the Merger and (D) the method of payment of cash for shares of Company Common Stock converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock where the holder of the applicable Company Stock Certificate has no right to receive whole shares of Parent Common Stock. (n) As soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time (and in any event within five business days following the Closing), Parent will deposit with the Exchange Agent (i) certificates representing the number of shares of Parent Common Stock sufficient to deliver in a timely manner, and the Parent shall instruct the Exchange Agent to timely deliver, the aggregate Stock Consideration, and (ii) immediately available funds equal to the aggregate Cash Consideration and Parent shall instruct the Exchange Agent to timely pay the Cash Consideration, and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock where the holder of the applicable Company Stock Certificate has no right to receive whole shares of Parent Common Stock. (o) As soon as reasonably practicable, but no later than seven business days after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a Company Stock Certificate(s) which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock whose shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1 and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor who did not complete an Election Form, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Company Stock Certificate(s) shall pass, only upon delivery of the Company Stock Certificate(s) (or affidavits of loss in lieu of such certificates) (the "LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL") to the Exchange Agent and shall be substantially in such form and have such other provisions as shall be prescribed by the Exchange Agent Agreement and (ii) instructions for use in surrendering the Company Stock Certificate(s) in exchange for the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor upon surrender of such certificate in accordance with Section 2.4(k) and any dividends or distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.4(j). 11
(p) Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of its Company Stock Certificate or Company Stock Certificates, accompanied by a properly completed Form of Election or a properly completed Letter of Transmittal a Holder of Company Common Stock will be entitled to receive promptly after the Effective Time the Merger Consideration (elected or deemed elected by it, subject to Sections 2.1 and 2.2) in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by its Company Stock Certificate. Until so surrendered, each such Company Stock Certificate shall represent after the Effective Time, for all purposes, only the right to receive the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor upon surrender of such certificate in accordance with Section 2.4(k) and any dividends or distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.3(l). SECTION 2.5 CERTAIN ADJUSTMENTS. If after the date hereof and on or prior to the Effective Time the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock shall be changed into a different number of shares by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization or combination, stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend or rights issued in respect of such stock, or any similar event shall occur (any such action, a "PARENT ADJUSTMENT EVENT"), the Exchange Ratio shall be proportionately adjusted so that each Holder of Company Common Stock shall receive at the Effective Time, in exchange for his Stock Election Shares and, if applicable, his Cash Election Shares and Non-Election Shares which have been converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration pursuant to Section 2.2(b), such number of shares of Parent Common Stock as such Holder would be entitled to receive if the Effective Time had occurred immediately prior to the consummation of such Parent Adjustment Event. In addition, if Parent enters into an agreement pursuant to which shares of Parent Common Stock would be converted, prior to the Effective Time, into shares or other securities or obligations of another corporation, proper provision shall be made in such agreement so that each holder of Company Common Stock shall be entitled to receive, in exchange for his Stock Election shares and, if applicable, his Cash Election Shares and Non-Election Shares which have been converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration pursuant to Section 2.2(b), such number of shares or other securities or amount of obligations of such other corporation as such holder of Company Common Stock would have been entitled to receive if the Effective Time had occurred immediately prior to the consummation of such conversion. 12

(a) As promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement, Parent and the Company shall prepare, and Parent shall file with the SEC, the Form S-4, in which the Proxy Statement will be included as a prospectus. Each of Parent and the Company shall use all reasonable efforts to have the Form S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act, and for the Proxy Statement to be cleared under the Exchange Act, as promptly as practicable after such filing. Without limiting any other provision hereinabove contained, the Form S-4 and the Proxy Statement will contain, without limitation, such information and disclosure reasonably requested by either Parent or the Company so that (i) the Form S-4 conforms in both form and substance to the requirements of the Securities act, and (ii) the Proxy Statement conforms in both form 57
and substance to the requirements of the Exchange Act. The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to holders of Company Common Stock as promptly as practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective. (b) If at any time prior to the Effective Time there shall occur (i) any event with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or with respect to other information supplied by Company for inclusion in the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement or (ii) any event with respect to Parent, or with respect to information supplied by Parent for inclusion in the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement, in either case, which event is required to be described in an amendment of, or a supplement, to the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement, such event shall be so described, and such amendment or supplement shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, as required by law, disseminated to the shareholders of Company. (c) Each of the Company and Parent shall promptly notify the other of the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff or any other appropriate government official and of any requests by the SEC or its staff or any other appropriate government official for amendments or supplements to any of the filings with the SEC in connection with the Merger and other transactions contemplated hereby or for additional information and shall supply the other with copies of all correspondence between the Company or any of its representatives, or Parent or any of its representatives, as the case may be, on the one hand, and the SEC or its staff or any other appropriate government official, on the other hand, with respect thereto.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company agrees that its obligations pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 5.1(d) shall not be affected by the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the Company of any Company Takeover Proposal. Notwithstanding any Change in the Company Recommendation, unless otherwise directed in writing by Parent, this Agreement and the Merger shall be submitted to the shareholders of the Company at the Company Shareholders Meeting for the purpose of approving the Agreement and the Merger and nothing contained herein shall be deemed 58
to relieve the Company of such obligation, provided, however, that if the Board of Directors of the Company shall have effected a Change in the Company Recommendation in accordance with this Agreement, then in submitting this Agreement to the Company's shareholders, the Board of Directors of the Company may submit this Agreement to the Company's shareholders without recommendation (although the resolutions adopting this Agreement and the Plan of Merger as of the date hereof may not be rescinded or amended), in which event the Board of Directors of the Company may communicate the basis for its lack of a recommendation to the Company's shareholders in the Proxy Statement or an appropriate amendment or supplement thereto to the extent required by law. (e) The Company shall coordinate and cooperate with Parent with respect to the timing of the Company Shareholders Meeting. SECTION 5.2 ACCESS TO INFORMATION; CONFIDENTIALITY.

In addition, each party may, at any time, with notice (in advance, if practicable) to the other party, make disclosures of such information and documents as may be required or requested by such party's applicable regulatory authorities. This Agreement shall not be construed to limit in any way either party's ability to consult any tax advisor regarding the tax treatment or tax structure of the Merger or the Bank Combination. These provisions are meant to be interpreted so as to prevent the Merger or the Bank Combination from being treated as offered under "conditions of confidentiality" within the meaning of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder.

SECTION 6.4 FRUSTRATION OF CLOSING CONDITIONS.

ARTICLE VII TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER SECTION 7.1 TERMINATION. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Effective Time, and whether before or after the Company Shareholder Approval (the party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to clause (b), (c), (d), (e) or (f) below shall give written notice of such termination to the other party in accordance with Section 8.2, specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which such termination is effected): (a) by mutual written consent of Parent and the Company; (b) by either Parent or the Company: (i) if the Merger shall not have been consummated by the date that is twelve months following the date hereof, provided, however, that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(b) shall not be available to any party whose failure to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement results in the failure of the Merger to be consummated by such time; 69
(ii) if the Company Shareholder Approval shall not have been obtained at the Company Shareholders Meeting duly convened therefor or at any adjournment or postponement thereof; (iii) if any Restraint having any of the effects set forth in Section 6.1(d) shall be in effect and shall have become final and nonappealable; provided, that the party seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(b)(iii) shall have used reasonable best efforts to prevent the entry of and to remove such Restraint; or (iv) if any Governmental Entity that must grant a Requisite Regulatory Approval has denied the applicable Requisite Regulatory Approval and such denial has become final and nonappealable; (c) by Parent, if (i) the Company shall have failed to make the Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, (ii) the Company shall have effected a Change in the Company Recommendation or (iii) the Company shall have breached its obligations under this Agreement by reason of a failure to call or convene the Company Shareholders Meeting in accordance with Section 5.1(d); (d) by Parent, if the Company shall have breached any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach (i) would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Section 6.2(a) or (b), and (ii) is incapable of being cured by the Company or is not cured within 30 days of written notice thereof; or (e) by the Company, if Parent shall have breached any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach (A) would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Section 6.3(a) or (b), and (B) is incapable of being cured by Parent or is not cured within 30 days of written notice thereof. (f) By the Company, if (either before or after the approval of this Agreement by the shareholders of the Company) its Board of Directors so determines at any time during the three business day period commencing with (and including) the Determination Date (as defined in Section 8.3), if both of the following conditions are satisfied: (x) the Determination Date Value (as defined in Section 8.3) is less than the product of 0.85 and the Initial Value (as defined in Section 8.3); and (y) (i) the number obtained by dividing the Parent Average Price (as defined in Section 8.3) by $48.84 (such number, the "PARENT RATIO") shall be less than (ii) the number obtained by dividing the Index Price (as defined in Section 8.3) as of the Determination Date by $38.70 and subtracting 0.15 from such number (such number less 0.15, the "INDEX RATIO"). 70
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company elects to exercise its termination right pursuant to this Section 7.1(f), then during the seventy-two hour period commencing with the receipt by Parent of the notice required pursuant to the last paragraph of this Section 7.1, Parent shall have the option of adjusting the consideration to be paid to the Company shareholders under Section 2.1 by increasing the Aggregate Parent Share Amount by that number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the lesser of (i) the quotient obtained by dividing (x) (A) the product of 0.85 and the Initial Value less (B) the Determination Date Value by (y) the Parent Average Price and (ii) the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the Peer Equivalent Value (as defined in Section 8.3) less the Determination Date Value by (y) the Parent Average Price, in each case, rounded up to the nearest whole share. If Parent makes an election contemplated by the preceding sentence within such seventy-two hour period, it shall give prompt written notice to the Company of such election and the revised Aggregate Parent Share Amount, whereupon no termination shall have occurred pursuant to this Section 7.1(f) and this Agreement shall remain in effect in accordance with its terms (except as Aggregate Parent Share Amount shall have been so modified), and any references in this Agreement to Aggregate Parent Share Amount shall thereafter be deemed to refer to the Aggregate Parent Share Amount as adjusted pursuant to this Section 7.1(f) (together with any additional adjustments pursuant to Section 2.1(e)). SECTION 7.2 EFFECT OF TERMINATION. (a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by either the Company or Parent as provided in Section 7.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, without any liability or obligation on the part of Parent or the Company, other than that the provisions of Section 5.2 (other than the first sentence thereof), Section 5.6, this Section 7.2 and Article VIII shall survive such termination, provided, however, that nothing herein shall relieve any party from any liability for any willful breach by a party of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement. (b) (i) In the event that (A) a Company Pre-Termination Takeover Proposal Event (as defined below) shall occur after the date of this Agreement and thereafter this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(ii), by Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(c) or by Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(d) as a result of a willful breach by the Company and (B) prior to the date that is twelve (12) months after the date of such termination the Company consummates a Company Takeover Proposal or enters into any letter of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or other similar agreement (each, a "COMPANY ACQUISITION AGREEMENT") related to any Company Takeover Proposal, then the Company shall (1) on the date such Company Takeover Proposal is consummated or such Company Acquisition Agreement is entered into, pay Parent a fee equal to $25 million by wire transfer of same day funds, and (2) within two business days following a written request by Parent, reimburse Parent for all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Parent in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including all 71
costs (excluding the fees and disbursements of counsel and accountants) incurred in connection with the preparation (including copying and printing) of the Form S-4 and the Proxy Statement and applications to Governmental Entities for the approval of the Merger and the Bank Combination and all listing, filing or registration fees, including fees paid for filing the Form S-4 and the Proxy Statement with the SEC and fees paid for filings with Governmental Entities), by wire transfer of same day funds. (ii) For purposes of this Section 7.2(b), a "PRE-TERMINATION TAKEOVER PROPOSAL EVENT" shall be deemed to occur if, prior to the event giving rise to the right to terminate this Agreement, a bona fide Company Takeover Proposal shall have been made known to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or has been made directly to its shareholders generally or any person shall have publicly announced an intention (whether or not conditional) to make a Company Takeover Proposal, and such Company Takeover Proposal or public announcement shall not have been irrevocably withdrawn not less than five business days prior to the Company Shareholders Meeting. The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 7.2(b) are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Parent would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to pay the amount due pursuant to this Section 7.2(b), and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a suit which results in a judgment against the Company for the fee set forth in this Section 7.2(b), the Company shall pay to Parent its costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees and expenses) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the amount of the fee at the rate on six-month U.S. Treasury obligations plus 300 basis points in effect on the date such payment was required to be made. SECTION 7.3 AMENDMENT. This Agreement may be amended by the parties at any time before or after the Company Shareholder Approval; provided, however, that after such approval, there shall not be made any amendment that by law requires further approval by the shareholders of the Company without the further approval of such shareholders. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of all of the parties. SECTION 7.4 EXTENSION; WAIVER. At any time prior to the Effective Time, a party may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other party, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other party contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to this Agreement or (c) subject to the proviso of Section 7.3, waive compliance by the other party with any of the agreements or conditions contained in this Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights. ARTICLE VIII GENERAL PROVISIONS 72

EXHIBIT A FORM OF AFFILIATE LETTER , 2003 -------------- The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. One PNC Plaza 249 Fifth Avenue Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15222 Attention: General Counsel Ladies and Gentlemen: I have been advised that I may be deemed to be an "affiliate" of United National Bancorp, a New Jersey corporation (the "COMPANY"), as that term is defined in Rule 145 promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "SECURITIES ACT"). I understand that pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of August 20, 2003 (the "MERGER AGREEMENT"), by and among The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc., a Pennsylvania corporation ("PARENT"), PNC Bancorp Inc., a Delaware corporation and a subsidiary of Parent ("MERGER SUB") and the Company, the Company plans to merge with and into Merger Sub (the "MERGER") with Merger Sub being the surviving corporation. Capitalized terms used herein but not otherwise defined shall have the meanings given to such terms in the Merger Agreement. I further understand that, as a result of the Merger, in exchange for shares of common stock, par value $1.25 per share, of the Company ("COMPANY COMMON STOCK") I may receive common stock, par value $5.00 per share, of Parent ("PARENT COMMON STOCK"). I have read this letter and discussed the requirements hereof to the extent I felt necessary with my counsel or counsel for the Company. I represent, warrant and covenant with and to Parent that in the event I receive any Parent Common Stock as a result of the Merger: 1. I shall not make any sale, transfer, or other disposition of such Parent Common Stock unless (i) such sale, transfer or other disposition has been registered under the Securities Act, (ii) such sale, transfer or other disposition is made in conformity with the provisions of Rule 145 under the Securities Act (as such rule may be amended from time to time), (iii) in the opinion of counsel in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent, or under a "no-action" letter or interpretive letter from the staff of 80
the SEC, such sale, transfer or other disposition will not violate or is otherwise exempt from registration under the Securities Act, or (iii) I have the right to have the legend set forth in Sections 3 and 4 below removed pursuant to Section 4 below. 2. I understand that Parent is under no obligation to register the sale, transfer or other disposition of Parent Common Stock by me or on my behalf under the Securities Act or, other than as set forth below, to take any other action necessary in order to make compliance with an exemption from such registration available. 3. I understand that stop transfer instructions will be given to Parent's transfer agent with respect to the Parent Common Stock issued to me as a result of the Merger and that there will be placed on the certificates, if any, for such shares, or any substitutions therefor, a legend stating in substance: "The shares represented by this certificate were issued in a transaction to which Rule 145 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933 applies. The shares represented by this certificate may be transferred only in accordance with the terms of a letter agreement between the registered holder hereof and The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc., a copy of which agreement is on file at the principal offices of PNC" 4. I understand that, unless the transfer by me of the Parent Common Stock issued to me as a result of the Merger has been registered under the Securities Act or such transfer is made in conformity with the provisions of Rule 145(d) under the Securities Act, Parent reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to place the following legend on the certificates, if any, issued to my transferee: "The shares represented by this certificate have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933 and were acquired from a person who received such shares in a transaction to which Rule 145 under the Securities Act of 1933 applies. The shares may not be sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of except pursuant to an effective registration statement under, or in accordance with an exemption from the registration requirements of, the Securities Act of 1933." It is understood and agreed that the legends set forth in paragraphs (3) and (4) above shall be removed by delivery of substitute certificates without such legend and/or any stop transfer instructions will be lifted (A) if one year (or such other period as may be required by Rule 145(d)(2) or any successor thereto) shall have elapsed from the date I acquired the Parent Common Stock received in the Merger and the provisions of Rule 145(d)(2) (or any successor thereto) are then available to me, (B) if two years (or such other period as may be required by Rule 145(d)(3) or any successor thereto) shall have elapsed from the date I acquired the Parent Common Stock received in the Merger and the provisions of Rule 145(d)(3) (or any successor thereto) are then available to me or (C) if I shall have delivered to Parent (i) a copy of a "no-action" letter or interpretative letter from the staff of the SEC, or an opinion of counsel in form and substance A-2
reasonably satisfactory to Parent, to the effect that such legend is not required for purposes of the Securities Act or (ii) a written statement from me representing that that the Parent Common Stock represented by such certificates are being or have been sold in conformity with the provisions of Rule 145(d) or pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act. Execution of this letter should not be considered an admission on my part of "affiliate" status as described in the first paragraph of this letter agreement, or as a waiver of any rights I may have to object to any claim that I am such an affiliate on or after the date of this letter.
