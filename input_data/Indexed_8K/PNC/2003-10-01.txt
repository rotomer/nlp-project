EXHIBIT INDEX

EXHIBIT 99.1 THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, INC. IDENTIFICATION AND RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002, AS AMENDED This Exhibit 99.1 includes excerpts from or references to portions of the Corporation's 2002 Annual Report to Shareholders ("2002 Annual Report") that were incorporated by reference into the Corporation's Annual Report on Form 10-K, as amended, for the year ended December 31, 2002 ("2002 Form 10-K"). These excerpts or references include disclosures of non-GAAP financial measures as defined by the SEC's Release No. 33-8176, "Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures," that was effective subsequent to the Corporation's filing of the 2002 Form 10-K. In addition to such non-GAAP financial measures, this Exhibit 99.1 provides corresponding amounts or disclosures on a basis consistent with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") as required by Release No. 33-8176 and in accordance with the SEC's "Frequently Asked Questions Regarding the Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures" guidance issued June 13, 2003. In addition, this Exhibit 99.1 includes a Glossary of Terms similar to the glossary that was included in the Financial Review section of the Corporation's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended June 30, 2003 ("June 2003 Form 10-Q"). Many of these terms were also used in the 2002 Annual Report and 2002 Form 10-K. The information in this Exhibit 99.1 is provided solely for the purpose of identifying and reconciling to GAAP the applicable items disclosed in the 2002 Annual Report and does not represent the consolidated financial statements of the Corporation for any period nor does it purport to serve any other purpose under the SEC's financial reporting and disclosure rules and regulations. 1
1-a. TAXABLE-EQUIVALENT NET INTEREST INCOME IN THE 2002 ANNUAL REPORT: In the "Consolidated Statement of Income Review" and "2001 versus 2000 - Consolidated Income Statement Review" portions of the Financial Review section of the 2002 Annual Report, the Corporation discussed taxable-equivalent net interest income (net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis). Further, total revenue as used in the "Selected Ratios" portions of "Selected Consolidated Financial Data" and in the "Results of Businesses" table of "Review of Businesses" in the Financial Review section of the 2002 Annual Report reflects the sum of net interest income, taxable-equivalent basis and noninterest income. 1-b. DISCUSSION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE AND RECONCILIATION TO GAAP: The interest income earned on certain earning assets is completely or partially exempt from federal income tax. As such, these tax-exempt instruments typically yield lower returns than a taxable investment. In presenting net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis, the interest income earned on tax-exempt assets is increased to make them fully equivalent to other taxable interest income investments in order to provide accurate comparisons of yields and margins for all earning assets. A reconciliation of net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis to net interest income as reported in the Corporation's Consolidated Statement of Income in the 2002 Annual Report follows: A reconciliation of total revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis to total revenue on a GAAP basis (net interest income on a GAAP basis and noninterest income) follows: 2
2-a. EXCERPT FROM PAGE 26, "FINANCIAL REVIEW - SELECTED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL DATA," OF THE 2002 ANNUAL REPORT: 2-b. DISCUSSION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE AND RECONCILIATION TO GAAP: The caption "noninterest income before net securities gains" is not found within the Corporation's 2002 consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Total noninterest income disclosed in accordance with GAAP is the sum of the two line items disclosed above as follows: 3-a. EXCERPT FROM PAGE 27, "FINANCIAL REVIEW - SELECTED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL DATA," OF THE 2002 ANNUAL REPORT: (b) The efficiency ratio is noninterest expense divided by the sum of taxable-equivalent net interest income and noninterest income. Amortization of goodwill and other intangibles, distributions on capital securities and mortgage banking risk management activities are excluded for purposes of computing this ratio. Excluding the impact of charges in 2001 related to strategic initiatives and additions to reserves related to insured residual value exposures, the efficiency ratios from continuing operations and from net income were 58.14% and 58.07%, respectively. 3-b. DISCUSSION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE AND RECONCILIATION TO GAAP: The ratio of noninterest income to total revenue is computed as total noninterest income divided by the sum of net interest income and noninterest income. The ratios in 3-a. above for all periods presented were calculated using taxable-equivalent net interest income. See Item 1-b. of this Exhibit 99.1 for a description of taxable-equivalent net interest income and a reconciliation to net interest income on a GAAP basis. The ratio of noninterest income to total revenue using net interest income on a GAAP basis is as follows: 3
See note (b) to the table under 3-a. above regarding the efficiency ratio as calculated for the 2002 Annual Report. The efficiency ratio calculated on a GAAP basis as noninterest expense divided by the sum of net interest income and noninterest income is as follows: 4-a. EXCERPT FROM PAGE 28, FIRST PARAGRAPH OF "OVERVIEW - SUMMARY FINANCIAL RESULTS," OF THE 2002 ANNUAL REPORT: Consolidated net income for 2002 was $1.184 billion or $4.15 per diluted share compared with $377 million or $1.26 per diluted share for 2001. Results for 2002 reflected the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," under which goodwill is no longer amortized to expense. Results for 2001 reflected the cost of actions taken during the year to accelerate the repositioning of PNC's lending business and other strategic initiatives. These charges totaled $1.2 billion pretax and reduced 2001 net income by $768 million or $2.65 per diluted share. Excluding the effects of the strategic repositioning charges and goodwill amortization expense, net income for 2001 would have been $1.238 billion, or $4.23 per diluted share. 4-b. DISCUSSION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE AND RECONCILIATION TO GAAP: The last sentence of the excerpt in 4-a. above does not quantify the impact of 2001 goodwill amortization expense. However, this information is disclosed in Note 14 Goodwill And Other Intangible Assets in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements included in the 2002 Annual Report and incorporated by reference in the 2002 Form 10-K. A reconciliation of 2001 net income and earnings per diluted share on a GAAP basis to the corresponding amounts excluding the effects of the strategic repositioning charges and goodwill amortization expense follows: 4

DISCUSSION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE AND RECONCILIATION TO GAAP: The table below presents the income statement information included in 7-a. above in a format consistent with that used on a GAAP basis and includes in note (a) to the table a reconciliation of net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis to net interest income on a GAAP basis. In addition, the noninterest income to total revenue and efficiency ratios have been recomputed on a GAAP basis, consistent with the approach described at 3-b. above, and the return on assigned capital ratio reflects the other reclassifications made to the income statement information. (a) A reconciliation of net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis to net interest income on a GAAP basis follows: 7
8-a. EXCERPT FROM PAGE 34, "REVIEW OF BUSINESSES," OF THE 2002 ANNUAL REPORT: WHOLESALE BANKING PNC BUSINESS CREDIT 8-b. DISCUSSION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE AND RECONCILIATION TO GAAP: The table below presents the income statement information included in 8-a. above in a format consistent with that used on a GAAP basis. In addition, the noninterest income to total revenue and efficiency ratios have been recomputed on a GAAP basis, consistent with the approach described at 3-b. above. (a) Net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis equaled net interest income on a GAAP basis for each period presented. 8
9-a. EXCERPT FROM PAGE 35, "REVIEW OF BUSINESSES," OF THE 2002 ANNUAL REPORT: PNC ADVISORS 9-b. DISCUSSION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE AND RECONCILIATION TO GAAP: The table below presents the income statement information included in 9-a. above in a format consistent with that used on a GAAP basis. In addition, the noninterest income to total revenue and efficiency ratios have been recomputed on a GAAP basis, consistent with the approach described at 3-b. above. (a) Net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis equaled net interest income on a GAAP basis for each period presented. 9
10-a. EXCERPT FROM PAGE 36, "REVIEW OF BUSINESSES," OF THE 2002 ANNUAL REPORT: BLACKROCK (a) Excludes the impact of fund administration and servicing costs - affiliates. 10-b. DISCUSSION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE AND RECONCILIATION TO GAAP: The table below presents the income statement information included in 10-a. above in a format consistent with that used on a GAAP basis. In addition, the operating margin ratio as presented in the table has been reconciled to the ratio calculated on a GAAP basis as described in note (b) to the table below. (a) Net of nonoperating expense. (b) (b) Calculated as operating income divided by total revenue less fund administration and servicing costs. A reconciliation of this presentation to operating margin calculated on a GAAP basis (operating income divided by total revenue) follows: PNC believes that operating margin, as reported, is an effective indicator of management's ability to effectively employ BlackRock's resources. Fund administration and servicing costs have been excluded from the operating margin calculation because these costs are a fixed, asset-based expense which can fluctuate based on the discretion of a third party. 10
11-a. EXCERPT FROM PAGE 37, "REVIEW OF BUSINESSES," OF THE 2002 ANNUAL REPORT: PFPC (a) Net of nonoperating expense. 11-b. DISCUSSION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE AND RECONCILIATION TO GAAP: The table below presents the income statement information included in 11-a. above in a format consistent with that used on a GAAP basis. (a) Net of nonoperating expense. 11
12-a. EXCERPT FROM PAGE 64, FROM THE FIRST PARAGRAPH OF "2001 VERSUS 2000, CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT REVIEW, SUMMARY RESULTS," OF THE 2002 ANNUAL REPORT: Consolidated net income for 2001 was $377 million or $1.26 per diluted share. Excluding the effect of adopting the new accounting standard for financial derivatives, net income was $382 million or $1.28 per diluted share compared with $1.279 billion or $4.31 per diluted share for 2000. 12-b. DISCUSSION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE AND RECONCILIATION TO GAAP: The second sentence from the excerpt in 12-a. above does not quantify the impact of the adoption of the new accounting standard for financial derivatives, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 133. However, the after-tax charge of $5 million that the Corporation recognized upon adoption of SFAS No. 133 in 2001 is disclosed in "Selected Consolidated Financial Data" and under "Financial And Other Derivatives" in the Risk Management portion of the Financial Review section of the 2002 Annual Report. A reconciliation of 2001 net income (in millions) and the corresponding earnings per diluted share amounts as described in 12-a. above to the GAAP amounts follows: 13-a. EXCERPT FROM PAGE 64, "2001 VERSUS 2000, CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT REVIEW, NET INTEREST INCOME," OF THE 2002 ANNUAL REPORT: Taxable-equivalent net interest income of $2.278 billion for 2001 increased 4% compared with 2000 net interest income of $2.182 billion. 13-b. DISCUSSION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE AND RECONCILIATION TO GAAP: See 1-b. of this Exhibit 99.1 for a description of taxable-equivalent net interest income and a reconciliation of 2001 and 2000 taxable-equivalent net interest income amounts to the corresponding amounts calculated in accordance with GAAP. 12
