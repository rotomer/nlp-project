Exhibit 1.1 PNC Funding Corp, Issuer and The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc., Guarantor Underwriting Agreement New York, New York October 27, 2003 To the Representatives named in Schedule I hereto of the Underwriters named in Schedule II hereto Dear Ladies and Gentlemen: PNC Funding Corp, a Pennsylvania corporation (the "Company"), proposes to sell to the underwriters named in Schedule II hereto (the "Underwriters"), for whom you are acting as representatives (the "Representatives"), the principal amount of its securities identified in Schedule I hereto (together with the guarantees mentioned below, the "Securities") to be guaranteed by The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc., a Pennsylvania corporation (the "Guarantor"), and to be issued under an indenture dated as of December 1, 1991, among the Company, the Guarantor and JPMorgan Chase Bank (formerly known as The Chase Manhattan Bank, which was formerly known as Chemical Bank, successor by merger to Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company), as trustee (the "Trustee"), as amended by a Supplemental Indenture dated as of February 15, 1993, among the Company, the Guarantor and the Trustee, and as further amended by a Second Supplemental Indenture dated as of February 15, 2000 (as amended, the "Indenture"). If the firm or firms listed in Schedule II hereto include only the firm or firms listed in Schedule I hereto, then the terms "Underwriters" and "Representatives," as used herein, shall each be deemed to refer to such firm or firms. Section 1. Representations and Warranties. The Company and the Guarantor represent and warrant to, and agree with, each Underwriter as set forth below in this Section 1. Certain terms used in this Section 1 are defined in paragraph (c) hereof. (a) If the offering of the Securities is a Delayed Offering (as specified in Schedule I hereto), paragraph (i) below is applicable and, if the offering of the Securities is a Non-Delayed Offering (as so specified), paragraph (ii) below is applicable. (i) The Company and the Guarantor meet the requirements for the use of Form S-3 under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Act") and have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") a registration statement (the file number of which is set
forth in Schedule I hereto), on such Form, including a basic prospectus, for registration under the Act of the offering and sale of the Securities. The Company and the Guarantor may have filed one or more amendments thereto, and may have used a Preliminary Final Prospectus, each of which has previously been furnished to you. Such registration statement, as so amended, has become effective. The offering of the Securities is a Delayed Offering and, although the Basic Prospectus may not include all information with respect to the Securities and the offering thereof required by the Act and the rules thereunder to be included in the Final Prospectus, the Basic Prospectus includes all such information required by the Act and the rules thereunder to be included therein as of the Effective Date. The Company and the Guarantor will next file with the Commission pursuant to Rules 415 and 424(b)(2) or (5) a final supplement to the form of prospectus included in such registration statement relating to the Securities and the offering thereof. As filed, such final prospectus supplement shall include all required information with respect to the Securities and the offering thereof and, except to the extent the Representatives shall agree in writing to a modification, shall be in all substantive respects in the form furnished to you prior to the Execution Time or, to the extent not completed at the Execution Time, shall contain only such specific additional information and other changes (beyond that contained in the Basic Prospectus and any Preliminary Final Prospectus) as the Company has advised you, prior to the Execution Time, will be included or made therein. (ii) The Company and the Guarantor meet the requirements for the use of Form S-3 under the Act and have filed with the Commission a registration statement (the file number of which is set forth in Schedule I hereto) on such Form, including a basic prospectus, for registration under the Act of the offering and sale of the Securities. The Company and the Guarantor may have filed one or more amendments thereto, including a Preliminary Final Prospectus, each of which has previously been furnished to you. The Company and the Guarantor will next file with the Commission either (x) a final prospectus supplement relating to the Securities in accordance with Rules 430A and 424(b)(1) or (4), or (y) prior to the effectiveness of such registration statement, an amendment to such registration statement, including the form of final prospectus supplement. In the case of clause (x), the Company and the Guarantor included in such registration statement, as amended at the Effective Date, all information (other than Rule 430A Information) required by the Act and the rules thereunder to be included in the Final Prospectus with respect to the Securities and the offering thereof. As filed, such final prospectus supplement or such amendment and form of final prospectus supplement shall contain all Rule 430A Information, together with all other such required information, with respect to the Securities and the offering thereof and, except to the extent the 2
Representatives shall agree in writing to a modification, shall be in all substantive respects in the form furnished to you prior to the Execution Time or, to the extent not completed at the Execution Time, shall contain only such specific additional information and other changes (beyond that contained in the Basic Prospectus and any Preliminary Final Prospectus) as the Company has advised you, prior to the Execution Time, will be included or made therein. (b) On the Effective Date, the Registration Statement did or will, and when the Final Prospectus is first filed (if required) in accordance with Rule 424(b) and on the Closing Date, the Final Prospectus (and any supplement thereto) will, comply in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Act and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") and the respective rules thereunder; on the Effective Date, the Registration Statement did not or will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading; and, on the Effective Date, the Final Prospectus, if not filed pursuant to Rule 424(b), did not or will not, and on the date of any filing pursuant to Rule 424(b) and on the Closing Date, the Final Prospectus (together with any supplement thereto) will not, include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; provided, however, that the Company and the Guarantor make no representations or warranties as to (i) that part of the Registration Statement which shall constitute the Statement of Eligibility and Qualification (Form T-1) under the Trust Indenture Act of the Trustee or (ii) the information contained in or omitted from the Registration Statement or the Final Prospectus (or any supplement thereto) in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company or the Guarantor by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for use in connection with the preparation of the Registration Statement or the Final Prospectus (or any supplement thereto). (c) The terms that follow, when used in this Agreement, shall have the meanings indicated. The term "the Effective Date" shall mean each date that the Registration Statement and any post effective amendment or amendments thereto became or become effective. "Execution Time" shall mean the date and time that this Agreement is executed and delivered by the parties hereto. "Basic Prospectus" shall mean the prospectus referred to in paragraph (a) above contained in the Registration Statement at the Effective Date including, in the case of a Non-Delayed Offering, any Preliminary Final Prospectus. "Preliminary Final Prospectus" shall mean any preliminary prospectus supplement to the Basic Prospectus which describes the Securities and the offering thereof and is used prior to filing of the Final Prospectus. "Final Prospectus" shall mean the prospectus supplement relating to the Securities that is first filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) after the Execution Time, together with the Basic Prospectus or, if, in the case of a Non-Delayed Offering, no filing pursuant to Rule 424(b) is required, 3
shall mean the form of final prospectus relating to the Securities, including the Basic Prospectus, included in the Registration Statement at the Effective Date. "Registration Statement" shall mean the registration statement referred to in paragraph (a) above, including incorporated documents, exhibits and financial statements, as amended at the Execution Time (or, if not effective at the Execution Time, in the form in which it shall become effective) and, in the event any post effective amendment thereto becomes effective prior to the Closing Date (as hereinafter defined), shall also mean such registration statement as so amended. Such term shall include any Rule 430A Information deemed to be included therein at the Effective Date as provided by Rule 430A. "Rule 415," "Rule 424," "Rule 430A" and "Regulation S-K" refer to such rules or regulation under the Act. "Rule 430A Information" means information with respect to the Securities and the offering thereof permitted to be omitted from the Registration Statement when it becomes effective pursuant to Rule 430A. Any reference herein to the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Final Prospectus or the Final Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 which were filed under the Exchange Act on or before the Effective Date of the Registration Statement or the issue date of the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Final Prospectus or the Final Prospectus, as the case may be; and any reference herein to the terms "amend," "amendment" or "supplement" with respect to the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Final Prospectus or the Final Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the filing of any document under the Exchange Act after the Effective Date of the Registration Statement or the issue date of the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Final Prospectus or the Final Prospectus, as the case may be, deemed to be incorporated therein by reference. A "Non-Delayed Offering" shall mean an offering of securities which is intended to commence promptly after the effective date of a registration statement, with the result that, pursuant to Rules 415 and 430A, all information (other than Rule 430A Information) with respect to the securities so offered must be included in such registration statement at the effective date thereof. A "Delayed Offering" shall mean an offering of securities pursuant to Rule 415 which does not commence promptly after the effective date of a registration statement, with the result that only information required pursuant to Rule 415 need be included in such registration statement at the effective date thereof with respect to the securities so offered. Whether the offering of the Securities is a Non-Delayed Offering or a Delayed Offering shall be set forth in Schedule I hereto. Section 2. Purchase and Sale. Subject to the terms and conditions and in reliance upon the representations and warranties herein set forth, the Company agrees to, and the Guarantor agrees to cause the Company to, sell to each Underwriter, and each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to purchase from the Company, at the purchase price set forth in Schedule I hereto the principal amount of the Securities set forth opposite such Underwriter's name in Schedule II hereto, except that, if Schedule I hereto provides for the sale of Securities pursuant to delayed delivery arrangements, the respective principal amounts of Securities to be purchased by the Underwriters shall be as 4
set forth in Schedule II hereto less the respective amounts of Contract Securities determined as provided below. Securities to be purchased by the Underwriters are herein sometimes called the "Underwriters' Securities" and Securities to be purchased pursuant to Delayed Delivery Contracts as hereinafter provided are herein called "Contract Securities." If so provided in Schedule I hereto, the Underwriters are authorized to solicit offers to purchase Securities from the Company pursuant to delayed delivery contracts ("Delayed Delivery Contracts"), substantially in the form of Schedule III hereto but with such changes therein as the Company and the Guarantor may authorize or approve. The Underwriters will endeavor to make such arrangements and, as compensation therefor, the Company will pay, and the Guarantor will cause the Company to pay, to the Representatives, for the account of the Underwriters, on the Closing Date, the percentage set forth in Schedule I hereto of the principal amount of the Securities for which Delayed Delivery Contracts are made. Delayed Delivery Contracts are to be with institutional investors, including commercial and savings banks, insurance companies, pension funds, investment companies and educational and charitable institutions. The Company will enter into, and the Guarantor will cause the Company to enter into, Delayed Delivery Contracts in all cases where sales of Contract Securities arranged by the Underwriters have been approved by the Company but, except as the Company may otherwise agree, each such Delayed Delivery Contract must be for not less than the minimum principal amount set forth in Schedule I hereto and the aggregate principal amount of Contract Securities may not exceed the maximum aggregate principal amount set forth in Schedule I hereto. The Underwriters will not have any responsibility in respect of the validity or performance of Delayed Delivery Contracts. The principal amount of Securities to be purchased by each Underwriter as set forth in Schedule II hereto shall be reduced by an amount which shall bear the same proportion to the total principal amount of Contract Securities as the principal amount of Securities set forth opposite the name of such Underwriter bears to the aggregate principal amount set forth in Schedule II hereto, except to the extent that you determine that such reduction shall be otherwise than in such proportion and so advise the Company in writing; provided, however, that the total principal amount of Securities to be purchased by all Underwriters shall be the aggregate principal amount set forth in Schedule II hereto less the aggregate principal amount of Contract Securities. Section 3. Delivery and Payment. Delivery of and payment for the Underwriters' Securities shall be made on the date and at the time specified in Schedule I hereto (or such later date not later than five business days after such specified date as the Representatives shall designate), which date and time may be postponed by agreement among the Representatives, the Company and the Guarantor or as provided in Section 8 hereof (such date and time of delivery and payment for the Underwriters' Securities being herein called the "Closing Date"). Delivery of the Underwriters' Securities shall be made to the Representatives for the respective accounts of the several Underwriters against payment by the several Underwriters through the Representatives of the purchase price thereof to or upon the order of the Company by wire transfer of immediately available funds. Delivery of the Underwriters' Securities shall be made at such location in The City of New York as the Representatives shall reasonably designate at least one 5
business day in advance of the Closing Date and payment for the Securities shall be made at the office specified in Schedule I hereto. Certificates for the Underwriters' Securities shall be registered in such names (including the nominee for any depositary which will hold Securities to be established for "book entry" issuance and transfer) and in such denominations as the Representatives may request not less than two full business days in advance of the Closing Date. The Company and the Guarantor agree to have the Underwriters' Securities available for inspection, checking and packaging by the Representatives in New York, New York, not later than 1:00 p.m. on the business day prior to the Closing Date. Section 4. Agreements. The Company and the Guarantor jointly and severally agree with the several Underwriters that: (a) The Company and the Guarantor will use their best efforts to cause the Registration Statement, if not effective at the Execution Time, and any amendment thereto, to become effective. Prior to the termination of the offering of the Securities, the Company and the Guarantor will not file any amendment to the Registration Statement or supplement (including the Final Prospectus or any Preliminary Final Prospectus) to the Basic Prospectus unless the Company and the Guarantor have furnished you a copy for your review prior to filing and will not file any such proposed amendment or supplement to which you reasonably object. Subject to the foregoing sentence, the Company and the Guarantor will cause the Final Prospectus, properly completed, and any supplement thereto to be filed with the Commission pursuant to the applicable paragraph of Rule 424(b) within the time period prescribed and will provide evidence satisfactory to the Representatives of such timely filing. The Company and the Guarantor will promptly advise the Representatives (i) when the Registration Statement, if not effective at the Execution Time, and any amendment thereto, shall have become effective, (ii) when the Final Prospectus, and any supplement thereto, shall have been filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b), (iii) when, prior to termination of the offering of the Securities, any amendment to the Registration Statement shall have been filed or become effective, (iv) of any request by the Commission for any amendment of the Registration Statement or supplement to the Final Prospectus or for any additional information, (v) of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or the institution or threatening of any proceeding for that purpose and (vi) of the receipt by the Company or the Guarantor of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of the Securities for sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose. The Company and the Guarantor will use their best efforts to prevent the issuance of any such stop order and, if issued, to obtain as soon as possible the withdrawal thereof. (b) If, at any time when a prospectus relating to the Securities is required to be delivered under the Act, any event occurs as a result of which the Final Prospectus as then supplemented would include any untrue statement of a 6
material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein in the light of the circumstances under which they were made not misleading, or if it shall be necessary to amend the Registration Statement or supplement the Final Prospectus to comply with the Act or the Exchange Act or the respective rules thereunder, the Company and the Guarantor promptly will prepare and file with the Commission, subject to the second sentence of paragraph (a) of this Section 4, an amendment or supplement which will correct such statement or omission or effect such compliance. (c) As soon as practicable, the Guarantor will make generally available to its security holders and to the Representatives an earnings statement or statements of the Guarantor and its subsidiaries which will satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Act and Rule 158 under the Act. (d) The Company and the Guarantor will furnish to the Representatives and counsel for the Underwriters, without charge, copies of the Registration Statement (including exhibits thereto) and, so long as delivery of a prospectus by an Underwriter or dealer may be required by the Act, as many copies of any Preliminary Final Prospectus and the Final Prospectus and any supplement thereto as the Representatives may reasonably request. The Company and the Guarantor will pay the expenses of printing or other production of all documents relating to the offering. (e) The Company and the Guarantor will use their best efforts to arrange for the qualification of the Securities for sale under the laws of such jurisdictions as the Representatives may designate, will maintain such qualifications in effect so long as required for the distribution of the Securities and will arrange for the determination of the legality of the Securities for purchase by institutional investors; provided, however, that neither the Company nor the Guarantor shall be required to qualify to do business in any jurisdiction where it is not now qualified or to take any action which would subject it to general or unlimited service of process in any jurisdiction where they are not now subject. (f) Until the business day following the Closing Date, the Company and the Guarantor will not, without the consent of the Representatives, offer, sell or contract to sell, or announce the offering of, any debt securities covered by the Registration Statement or any other registration statement filed under the Act. Section 5. Conditions to the Obligations of the Underwriters. The obligations of the Underwriters to purchase the Underwriters' Securities shall be subject to the accuracy of the representations and warranties on the part of the Company and the Guarantor contained herein as of the Execution Time and the Closing Date, to the accuracy of the statements of the Company and the Guarantor made in any certificates pursuant to the provisions hereof, to the performance by the Company and the Guarantor of their obligations hereunder and to the following additional conditions: 7

(iv) the Guarantor's authorized equity capitalization, if set forth in the Final Prospectus, is as set forth in the Final Prospectus; the Securities conform in all material respects to the description thereof contained in the Final Prospectus; and, if the Securities are to be listed on any stock exchange, authorization therefor has been given, subject to official notice of issuance and evidence of satisfactory distribution, or the Company and the Guarantor have filed a preliminary listing application with respect to the Securities with such stock exchange and nothing has caused such counsel to believe that the Securities will not be authorized for listing, subject to official notice of issuance and evidence of satisfactory distribution and the satisfaction of other requirements which counsel reasonably believes will be satisfied in due course; (v) the Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered, has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act, and constitutes a legal, valid and binding instrument enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, readjustment of debt, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally or general equitable principles (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law); and the Securities have been duly authorized and, when executed and authenticated in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture and delivered to and paid for by the Underwriters pursuant to this Agreement, in the case of the Underwriters' Securities, or by the purchasers thereof pursuant to Delayed Delivery Contracts, in the case of any Contract Securities, will constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company and the Guarantor entitled to the benefits of the Indenture; (vi) to the best knowledge of such counsel, there is no pending or threatened action, suit or proceeding before any court or governmental agency, authority or body or any arbitrator involving the Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries, of a character required to be disclosed in the Registration Statement which is not adequately disclosed in the Final Prospectus, and there is no franchise, contract or other document of a character required to be described in the Registration Statement or Final Prospectus, or to be filed as an exhibit, which is not described or filed as required; and the statements included or incorporated in the Final Prospectus describing any legal proceedings or material contracts or agreements relating to the Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries fairly summarize such matters in all material respects; (vii) the Registration Statement has become effective under the Act; any required filing of the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Final Prospectus and the Final Prospectus, and any supplements thereto, 9
pursuant to Rule 424(b) has been made in the manner and within the time period required by Rule 424(b); to the best knowledge of such counsel, no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued, no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or threatened, and the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus (other than the financial statements and other financial and statistical information contained or incorporated therein, and that part of the Registration Statement which constitutes the Statement of Eligibility and Qualification (Form T-1) of the Trustee under the Trust Indenture Act, as to which such counsel need express no opinion) comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of that Act and the Exchange Act and the respective rules thereunder; and nothing has come to the attention of such counsel that has caused such counsel to believe that at the Effective Date the Registration Statement contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or that the Final Prospectus as of its date and as of the date hereof included or includes any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading except that such counsel does not express any opinion or belief as to the financial statements or schedules or other data of a statistical or financial nature included or incorporated therein or as to that part of the Registration Statement which constitutes the Statement of Eligibility and Qualification (Form T-1) of the Trustee under the Trust Indenture Act; (viii) this Agreement and any Delayed Delivery Contracts have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and the Guarantor; (ix) no consent, approval, authorization or order of any court or governmental agency or body is required for the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein or in any Delayed Delivery Contracts, except such as have been obtained under the Act and such as may be required under the blue sky laws of any jurisdiction in connection with the purchase and distribution of the Securities by the Underwriters and such other approvals (specified in such opinion) as have been obtained; (x) neither the issue and sale of the Securities, nor the consummation of any other of the transactions herein contemplated nor the fulfillment of the terms hereof or of any Delayed Delivery Contracts will (A) violate the charter or by-laws of the Company or the Guarantor, or (B) violate, result in a breach of, or constitute a default under the terms of any material indenture or other material agreement or instrument known to such counsel and to which the Company, the Guarantor or PNC Bank, N.A. is a party or bound, or (C) violate any 10
material order or regulation known to such counsel to be applicable to the Company, the Guarantor or PNC Bank, N.A. of any court, regulatory body, administrative agency, governmental body or arbitrator having jurisdiction over the Company, or the Guarantor or PNC Bank, N.A.; and (xi) no holders of securities of the Company have rights to the registration of such securities under the Registration Statement. In rendering such opinion, such counsel will opine only as to matters involving the application of the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania or the United States and may rely (A) as to matters involving the application of laws of any jurisdiction other than the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania or the United States, to the extent deemed proper and specified in such opinion, upon the opinion of other counsel of good standing believed to be reliable and who are reasonably satisfactory to counsel for the Underwriters, except that it will not be required that such counsel obtain an opinion of New York counsel as to matters of New York law in order to render such opinion or that such counsel express an opinion as to matters arising under the laws of any jurisdiction other than the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and matters of federal law arising under the laws of the United States of America, and (B) as to matters of fact, to the extent he or she may deem proper, on certificates, or representations of responsible officers of the Company or the Guarantor and public officials.

and satisfied all the conditions on its part to be performed or satisfied at or prior to the Closing Date; (ii) no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or, to the Guarantor's knowledge, threatened; and (iii) since the date of the most recent financial statements included in the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto), there has been no material adverse change in the condition (financial or other), earnings, business or properties of the Guarantor and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, whether or not arising from transactions in the ordinary course of business, except as set forth in or contemplated in the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto). (e) (A) At the Closing Date, Deloitte and Touche LLP shall have furnished to the Representatives a letter or letters (which may refer to letters previously delivered to one or more of the Representatives), dated as of the Closing Date, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives, confirming that they are independent accountants within the meaning of the Act and the Exchange Act and the respective applicable published rules and regulations thereunder and stating in effect that: (i) in their opinion the audited consolidated financial statements included or incorporated in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus and reported on by them comply in form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Act and the Exchange Act and the related published rules and regulations; (ii) on the basis of a reading of the latest unaudited consolidated financial statements made available by the Guarantor and its subsidiaries; carrying out certain specified procedures (but not an audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards) which would not necessarily reveal matters of significance with respect to the comments set forth in such letter; a reading of the minutes of the meetings of the shareholders and directors of the Guarantor and the audit and executive committees thereof and inquiries of certain officials of the Guarantor who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters of the Guarantor and its subsidiaries as to transactions and events subsequent to the date of the most recent audited consolidated financial statements in or incorporated in the Final Prospectus, nothing came to their attention which caused them to believe that: (1) any unaudited consolidated financial statements included or incorporated in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus do not comply in form in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and with the published rules and regulations of the Commission with 12
respect to the financial statements included or incorporated in quarterly reports on Form 10-Q under the Exchange Act; and said unaudited consolidated financial statements are not in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a basis substantially consistent with that of the audited consolidated financial statements included or incorporated in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus; or (2) with respect to the period subsequent to the date of the most recent audited or unaudited consolidated financial statements incorporated in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus, there were, at a specified date not more than five business days prior to the date of the letter, any increases in borrowed funds of the Guarantor and its subsidiaries or any decreases in the capital stock (defined as each of the individual dollar amounts of preferred stock, common stock, and capital surplus) of the Guarantor or the stockholders' equity of the Guarantor as compared with the amounts shown on the most recent consolidated balance sheet incorporated in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus, or for the period from the date of the most recent audited or unaudited consolidated financial statements incorporated in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus to such specified date there were any decreases, as compared with the corresponding period in the preceding year, in total or per share amounts of consolidated net income of the Guarantor or consolidated net interest income except in all instances for changes or decreases set forth in such letter, in which case the letter shall be accompanied by an explanation by the Guarantor as to the significance thereof unless said explanation is not deemed necessary by the Representatives; and (iii) they have performed certain other specified procedures as a result of which they determined that certain information of an accounting, financial or statistical nature (which is limited to accounting, financial or statistical information derived from the general accounting records of the Guarantor and its subsidiaries) set forth in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus, including the information included or incorporated in Items 1, 5, 6 and 7 of the Guarantor's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the most recent fiscal year incorporated in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus, and the information included in the "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" included or incorporated in the Guarantor's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, incorporated in the Registration Statement and Final Prospectus, agrees with the accounting records of the Guarantor and its subsidiaries, excluding any questions of legal interpretation. (B) At the Closing Date, Ernst & Young LLP shall have furnished to the Representatives a letter or letters (which may refer to letters previously delivered to one or more of the Representatives), dated as of the Closing Date, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives, confirming that they were 13
independent accountants within the meaning of the Act and the Exchange Act and the respective applicable published rules and regulations thereunder and stating in effect that: (i) in their opinion the audited consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules included or incorporated in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus and reported on by them comply in form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Act and the Exchange Act and the related published rules and regulations; and (ii) they have performed certain other specified procedures as a result of which they determined that certain information of an accounting, financial or statistical nature (which is limited to accounting, financial or statistical information derived from the general accounting records of the Guarantor and its subsidiaries) set forth in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus with respect to periods covered by consolidated financial statements reported on by them, including the information included or incorporated in Items 1, 5, 6 and 7 of the Guarantor's Annual Report on Form 10-K incorporated in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus, agrees with the accounting records of the Guarantor and its subsidiaries, excluding any questions of legal interpretation. References to the Final Prospectus in this paragraph (e) include any supplement thereto at the date of the letter. (C) If provided for in Schedule I hereto, at the Execution Time, Ernst & Young LLP and Deloitte and Touche LLP shall have furnished to the Representatives a letter or letters, dated as of the Execution Time, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives, to the effects set forth above. (f) Subsequent to the Execution Time or, if earlier, the dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement (exclusive of any amendment thereof) and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto), there shall not have been (i) any change or decrease specified in the letter or letters referred to in paragraph (e) of this Section 5 or (ii) any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the business or properties of the Guarantor and its subsidiaries the effect of which, in any case referred to in clause (i) or (ii) above, is, in the judgment of the Representatives, so material and adverse as to make it impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or the delivery of the Securities as contemplated by the Registration Statement (exclusive of any amendment thereof) and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto). (g) Subsequent to the Execution Time, there shall not have been any decrease in the ratings of any of the Guarantor's debt securities by Moody's Investors Service, Inc., or Standard & Poor's Corporation, or any public 14
announcement that any such organization has under surveillance or review their ratings of any of the Guarantor's debt securities (other than an announcement with positive implications of a possible upgrading, and no implication of a possible downgrading, of such rating), and if, in any such case, the effect thereof in the judgment of the Representatives makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the purchase of the Securities. (h) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company and the Guarantor shall have furnished to the Representatives such further information, certificates and documents as the Representatives may reasonably request in connection with the offering of the Securities. (i) The Company and the Guarantor shall have accepted Delayed Delivery Contracts in any case where sales of Contract Securities arranged by the Underwriters have been approved by the Company. If any of the conditions specified in this Section 5 shall not have been fulfilled when and as provided in this Agreement, or if any of the opinions and certificates mentioned above or elsewhere in this Agreement shall not be reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Representatives and counsel for the Underwriters, this Agreement and all obligations of the Underwriters hereunder may be canceled at, or at any time prior to, the Closing Date by the Representatives. Notice of such cancellation shall be given to the Company in writing or by telephone or telegraph confirmed in writing. Section 6. Reimbursement of Underwriters' Expenses. If the sale of the Securities provided for herein is not consummated because any condition to the obligations of the underwriters set forth in Section 5 hereof is not satisfied, because of any termination pursuant to Section 9 hereof or because of any refusal, inability or failure on the part of the Company or the Guarantor to perform any agreement herein or comply with any provision hereof other than by reason of a default by any of the Underwriters, the Company and the Guarantor will reimburse the Underwriters severally upon demand for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) that shall have been incurred by them in connection with the proposed purchase and sale of the Securities. In no event shall the Company or the Guarantor be liable to the Underwriters for loss of anticipated profits from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Section 7. Indemnification and Contribution. (a) The Company and the Guarantor jointly and severally agree to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter and each person who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or other Federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the registration statement for the registration of the 15
Securities as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or in the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Final Prospectus or the Final Prospectus, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; provided, however, that (i) the Company and the Guarantor will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company and the Guarantor by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for use in connection with the preparation thereof, or that part of the Registration Statement constituting the "Statement of Eligibility and Qualification" (Form T-1) of the Trustee under the Trust Indenture Act, and (ii) such indemnity with respect to the Basic Prospectus or any Preliminary Final Prospectus shall not inure to the benefit of any Underwriter (or any person controlling such Underwriter) from whom the person asserting any such loss, claim, damage or liability purchased the Securities which are the subject thereof if such person did not receive a copy of the Final Prospectus (or the Final Prospectus as supplemented) excluding documents incorporated therein by reference at or prior to the confirmation of the sale of such Securities, if any, to such person in any case where such delivery is required by the Act and the untrue statement or omission of a material fact contained in the Basic Prospectus or any Preliminary Final Prospectus was corrected in the Final Prospectus (or the Final Prospectus as supplemented). This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company and the Guarantor may otherwise have. (b) Each Underwriter severally agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company and the Guarantor, each of their respective directors, each of their respective officers who signs the Registration Statement, and each person who controls the Company or the Guarantor within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company and the Guarantor to each Underwriter, but only with reference to written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company and the Guarantor by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for use in the preparation of the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which any Underwriter may otherwise have. The Company and the Guarantor acknowledge that the statements set forth in the last paragraph of the cover page, and, under the heading "Underwriting" or "Plan of Distribution" (i) the list of Underwriters and their respective participation in the sale of the Securities, (ii) the sentences related to concessions and reallowances and (iii) the paragraphs related to stabilization and syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids, and, if Schedule I hereto provides for sales of Securities pursuant to delayed delivery arrangements, in the last sentence under the heading "Delayed Delivery Arrangements" in any Preliminary Final Prospectus or the Final Prospectus constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the several Underwriters for inclusion in the documents 16
referred to in the foregoing indemnity, and you, as the Representatives, confirm that such statements are correct. (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 7 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 7, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 7. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein, and to the extent that it may elect by written notice delivered to the indemnified party promptly after receiving the aforesaid notice from such indemnified party, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party; provided, however, that if the defendants in any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, the indemnified party or parties shall have the right to select separate counsel to assert such legal defenses and to otherwise participate in the defense of such action on behalf of such indemnified party or parties. Upon receipt of notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense of such action and approval by the indemnified party of such counsel, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section 7 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof unless (i) the indemnified party shall have employed separate counsel in accordance with the proviso to the next preceding sentence (it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel (plus any local counsel), approved by the Representatives in the case of paragraph (a) of this Section 7, representing the indemnified parties under such paragraph (a) who are parties to such action), (ii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of commencement of the action or (iii) the indemnifying party has authorized the employment of counsel for the indemnified party at the expense of the indemnifying party; and except that, if clause (i) or (iii) is applicable, such liability shall be only in respect of the counsel referred to in such clause (i) or (iii). (d) In order to provide for just and equitable contribution in circumstances in which the indemnification provided for in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 7 is unavailable, the Company and the Guarantor, on the one hand, and the Underwriters severally, on the other hand, shall contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending same) to which the Company, the Guarantor and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject in proportion to the relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantor on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities, such that the Underwriters are responsible for 17
that portion represented by the percentage that the underwriting discount bears to the sum of such discount and the purchase price of the Securities specified in Schedule I hereto and the Company and the Guarantor are responsible for the balance; provided, however, that in no case shall any Underwriter (except as may be provided in any agreement among underwriters relating to the offering of the Securities) be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount applicable to the Securities purchased by such Underwriter hereunder. If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Company and the Guarantor, on the one hand, and the Underwriters severally, on the other, shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits as described in the immediately preceding sentence but also the relative fault of the Company and the Guarantor on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages and liabilities as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the Company or the Guarantor on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Company, the Guarantor and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 7, each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of the Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of the Company and the Guarantor who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Company and the Guarantor shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company and the Guarantor, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (d). Any party entitled to contribution will, promptly after receipt of notice of commencement of any action, suit or proceeding against such party in respect of which a claim for contribution may be made against another party or parties under this paragraph (d), notify such party or parties from whom contribution may be sought, but the omission to so notify such party or parties shall not relieve the party or parties from whom contribution may be sought from any other obligation it or they may have hereunder or otherwise than under this paragraph (d). Section 8. Default by an Underwriter. If any one or more Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Securities agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter or Underwriters hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the amount of Securities set forth opposite their names in Schedule II hereto bears to the aggregate amount of Securities set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the Securities which the defaulting 18
Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase; provided, however, that in the event that the aggregate amount of Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate amount of Securities set forth in Schedule II hereto, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Securities, and if such non-defaulting Underwriters do not purchase all the Securities, this Agreement will terminate without liability to any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company or the Guarantor. In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 8, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding seven days, as the Representatives shall determine in order that the required changes in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Company and any non-defaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder. Section 9. Termination. This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Representatives, by notice given to the Company and the Guarantor prior to delivery of and payment for the Securities, if prior to such time (i) trading in the Guarantor's Common Stock shall have been suspended by the Commission or The New York Stock Exchange or trading in securities generally on The New York Stock Exchange shall have been suspended or limited or minimum prices shall have been established on such exchange, (ii) a banking moratorium shall have been declared either by Federal, New York State or Pennsylvania authorities or (iii) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war or other calamity or crisis, economic or otherwise, the effect of which on the financial markets of the United States or any foreign jurisdiction in which the Securities are to be marketed is such as to make it, in the judgment of the Representatives, impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offering, sale or delivery of the Securities. Section 10. Representations and Indemnities to Survive. The respective agreements, representations, warranties, indemnities and other statements of the Company, the Guarantor or their respective officers and of the Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or the Company or the Guarantor or any of the officers, directors or controlling persons referred to in Section 7 hereof, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Securities. The provisions of Sections 6 and 7 hereof shall survive the termination or cancellation of this Agreement. Section 11. Notices. All communications hereunder will be in writing and effective only on receipt, and, if sent to the Representatives, will be mailed, delivered or transmitted by any standard form of telecommunication, at the address specified in Schedule I hereto; or, if sent to the Company or the Guarantor, will be mailed, delivered or transmitted by any standard form of telecommunication to it at One PNC Plaza, 249 Fifth Avenue, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15222-2707, attention of the Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer of the Guarantor. 19
Section 12. Successors. This Agreement will inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective successors and the officers and directors and controlling persons referred to in Section 7 hereof, and no other person will have any right or obligation hereunder. Section 13. Applicable Law. This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York. -- end of page - [signatures appear on following page] 20

NEITHER THIS NOTE NOR THE GUARANTEE INCLUDED HEREIN IS A BANK DEPOSIT OR INSURED BY THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION OR BY ANY OTHER INSURER OR GOVERNMENTAL AGENCY. THE INDENTURE, DATED AS OF DECEMBER 1, 1991, RELATING TO THIS SECURITY, HAS BEEN AMENDED BY A SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURE, DATED AS OF FEBRUARY 15, 1993, AND FURTHER AMENDED BY A SECOND SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURE, DATED AS OF FEBRUARY 15, 2000.
Exhibit 4.1 PNC FUNDING CORP 5 1/4% SUBORDINATED NOTES DUE 2015 REGISTERED CUSIP: 693476AT0 No. ISIN: US693476AT04 --- $ -------- PNC FUNDING CORP, a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of Pennsylvania (herein called the "Company," which term includes any successor corporation under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), for value received, hereby promises to pay to CEDE & Co., or registered assigns, the principal sum of Hundred Million Dollars on November 15, 2015, and to pay interest thereon from November 3, 2003, or from the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, semiannually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 in each year, commencing May 15, 2004, and at maturity, at the rate of 5 1/4% per annum, until the principal hereof is paid or made available for payment, and (to the extent that the payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable) at the same rate per annum on any overdue principal and premium and on any overdue installment of interest. The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date, subject to certain exceptions, will, as provided in such Indenture, be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest, which shall be May 1 or November 1 (whether or not a Business Day), as the case may be, next preceding such Interest Payment Date. However, interest payable on the maturity date will be paid to the person to whom the principal will be payable. Any such interest not so punctually paid or duly provided for will forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on such Regular Record Date and may either be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the Trustee, notice whereof shall be given to holders of the Securities not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date, or be paid at any time in any other lawful manner acceptable to the Trustee and not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Securities may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in said Indenture. This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (herein called the "Securities" or "Notes"), issued and to be issued in one or more series under an Indenture, dated as of December 1, 1991, among the Company, PNC Financial Corp (also known as "PNC Bank Corp." and now known as "The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.") (the "Guarantor") and JPMorgan Chase Bank (formerly known as The Chase Manhattan Bank and Chemical Bank, successor by merger to Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company), as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee," which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture) as amended by a Supplemental Indenture dated as of February 15, 1993 by and among the Company, the Guarantor and the Trustee, and as further amended by a Second Supplemental Indenture dated as of February 15, 2000 by and among the Company, the Guarantor and the Trustee (such Indenture as amended being herein called the "Indenture"), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Security is one of the series designated above, initially issued in the aggregate principal amount of $600,000,000, and is subject to additional issuances as the Company may determine or as provided for in the Indenture.
The Securities of this series are not redeemable prior to their stated maturity and are not subject to any sinking fund. If an Event of Default (as defined in the Indenture) with respect to the Securities shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Securities may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture. Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee hereinafter referred to, by manual signature, this Security shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose. The indebtedness of the Company evidenced by the Securities of this series, including the principal thereof and interest thereon, is, to the extent and in the manner set forth in the Indenture, subordinate and junior in right of payment to its obligations to holders of Senior Company Indebtedness (as defined in the Indenture) and subject to the obligations of the holders of the Securities to pay over any Excess Proceeds to holders of Other Company Obligations, as provided in the Indenture, and shall rank pari passu in right of payment with each other and with all other unsecured subordinated indebtedness of the Company. Each Holder of this Security, by the acceptance hereof, agrees to and shall be bound by such provisions of the Indenture and authorizes and directs the Trustee on his behalf to take such actions as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the subordination so provided. The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the Guarantor and the rights of the holders of the Securities of any series under the Indenture at any time by the Company, the Guarantor and the Trustee with the consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Securities of all series (voting as one class) to be affected by such amendment or modification. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the holders of specified percentages in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series, on behalf of the holders of all Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company or the Guarantor with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such holder and upon all future holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security. No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Security at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed. The Securities are issuable only in registered form without coupons in denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiple thereof. This Security is a global security, represented by one or more permanent global certificates registered in the name of the nominee of The Depository Trust Company (each a "Global Note" and collectively, the "Global Notes"). Accordingly, unless and until it is exchanged in whole or in part for individual certificates evidencing the Securities represented hereby, this Security may not be transferred except as a whole by The Depositary Trust Company (the "Depositary") to a nominee of such Depositary or by a nominee of such Depositary or by the Depositary or any nominee to a successor Depositary or any nominee of such successor. Ownership of beneficial interests in this Security will be shown on, and the transfer of that ownership will be effected only through, records maintained by the applicable Depositary or its nominee (with respect to interest of persons that have accounts with the Depositary ("Participants") and the records of Participants (with respect to -2-
interests of persons other than Participants)). Beneficial interests in Securities by persons that hold through Participants will be evidenced only by, and transfers of such beneficial interests with such Participants will be effected only through, records maintained by such Participants. The laws of some states require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of such securities in definitive form. Such limits and such laws may impair the ability to transfer beneficial interests in this Security. Except as provided below, owners of beneficial interests in this Security will not be entitled to have any individual certificates and will not be considered the owners or Holders thereof under the Indenture. Except in the limited circumstances set forth herein, Participants and owners of beneficial interests in the Global Notes will not be entitled to receive Securities in definitive form and will not be considered holders of Securities. If the Depositary is at any time unwilling, unable or ineligible to continue as Depositary and a successor Depositary is not appointed by the Company within 90 days, or an event of default has occurred and is continuing, and the Depositary requests the issuance of certificated notes, the Company will issue individual certificates evidencing the Securities represented hereby in definitive form in exchange for this Security in registered form to each person that the Depositary identifies as the beneficial owner of the Securities represented by the Global Notes upon surrender by the Depositary of the Global Notes. In addition, the Company may at any time and in its sole discretion determine not to have any Securities represented by one or more global securities and, in such event, will issue individual certificates evidencing Securities in definitive form in exchange for this Security. In any such instance, an owner of a beneficial interest in a Security will be entitled to physical delivery in certificated form of Securities equal in principal amount to such beneficial interest and to have such Securities registered in its name. Securities so issued in certificated form will be issued in denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiple thereof and will be issued in registered form only, without coupons. Neither the Company nor the principal paying agent will be liable for any delay by the Depositary, its nominee or any direct or indirect participant in identifying the beneficial owners of the related Securities. The Company and the principal payment agent may conclusively rely on, and will be protected in relying on, instructions from the Depositary or its nominee for all purposes, including with respect to the registration and delivery, and the respective principal amounts, of the Securities to be issued. Except as provided herein, beneficial owners of Global Notes will not be entitled to receive physical delivery of Securities in definitive form and no Global Note will be exchangeable except for another Global Note of like denomination and tenor to be registered in the name of the Depositary or its nominee. Accordingly, each person owning a beneficial interest in a Global Note must rely on the procedures of the Depositary and, if such person is not a Participant, on the procedures of the Participant through which such person owns its interest, to exercise any rights of a holder under the Securities. Beneficial interests in the Global Notes will be represented through book-entry accounts of financial institutions acting on behalf of beneficial owners as direct and indirect participants in the Depositary. Investors may elect to hold interests in the Global Notes through the Depositary, either directly if they are Participants of such system or indirectly through organizations that are Participants in such system. The laws of some jurisdictions may require that purchasers of securities take physical delivery of those securities in definitive form. Accordingly, the ability to transfer interests in the Securities represented by a Global Note to those persons may be limited. In addition, because the Depositary can act only on behalf of its Participants, who in turn act on behalf of persons who hold interests through Participants, the ability of a person having an interest in Securities represented by a Global Note to pledge or transfer such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the Depositary's system, or otherwise to take actions in -3-
respect of such interest, may be affected by the lack of a physical definitive security in respect of such interest. Neither the Company, the Trustee, the principal paying agent nor any Security Registrar will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of Securities by the Depositary, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records of the Depositary relating to the Securities. JPMorgan Chase Bank will act as the Company's principal paying agent with respect to the Securities through its offices presently located at 4 New York Plaza, New York, New York 10004. The Company may at any time rescind the designation of a paying agent, appoint a successor paying agent, or approve a change in the office through which any paying agent acts. Payments of interest and principal may be made by wire-transfer in immediately available funds for Securities held in book-entry form or, at the Company's option in the event the Securities are not represented by Global Notes, by check mailed to the address of the person entitled to the payment as it appears in the Security register. Payment of principal will be made upon the surrender of the relevant Securities at the offices of the principal paying agent. Notices to the holders of registered Securities will be mailed to them at their respective addresses in the register of the Securities and will be deemed to have been given on the fourth weekday (being a day other than Saturday or Sunday) after the date of mailing. The Indenture contains provisions setting forth certain conditions to the institution of proceedings by the holders of Securities with respect to the Indenture or for any remedy under the Indenture. All terms used in this Security which are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture. -- END OF PAGE -- [signatures appear on following page] -4-

This Guarantee shall not be valid or become obligatory for any purpose until the certificate of authentication on the Security on which this Guarantee is endorsed shall have been signed manually by the Trustee under the Indenture referred to in said Security.
