In addition, based on guidance included in FIN 46R, the Corporation deconsolidated the assets and liabilities of PNC Institutional Capital Trust A, B, C and D effective December 31, 2003.

The Corporation's line of business information is based on management information systems, assumptions and methodologies that are under review on an ongoing basis. (b) Business revenue is presented on a taxable-equivalent basis except for BlackRock and PFPC, which are presented on a book (GAAP) basis. The interest income earned on certain assets is completely or partially exempt from federal income tax. As such, these tax-exempt instruments typically yield lower returns than a taxable investment. In order to provide accurate comparisons of yields and margins for all earning assets, the interest income earned on tax-exempt assets has been increased to make them fully equivalent to other taxable interest income investments. A reconciliation of total consolidated revenue on a book basis to total consolidated revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis is as follows (in millions):
