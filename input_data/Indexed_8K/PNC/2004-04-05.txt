The factors previously disclosed in the Corporation's SEC reports (accessible on PNC's website at www.pnc.com and on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov) and the following factors, among others, could cause actual results or future events to differ materially from those anticipated in forward-looking statements or from historical performance:

(2) the impact of legal and regulatory developments (including (a) the resolution of legal proceedings or regulatory and other governmental inquiries; (b) increased litigation risk from recent regulatory and other governmental developments; (c) the results of regulatory examination process, PNC's failure to satisfy the requirements of agreements with governmental agencies, and regulators' future use of supervisory and enforcement tools; (d) legislative and regulatory reforms; and (e) changes in accounting policies and principles), with the impact of any such developments possibly affecting the ability of PNC to operate its businesses, PNC's financial condition, results of operations, or reputation, which in turn could have an impact on such matters as business generation and retention, the ability to attract and retain management, liquidity and funding;
(3) the impact of changes in the nature or extent of competition;
(4) the introduction, withdrawal, success and timing of business initiatives and strategies;
 
Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information (continued)

(7) the ability to identify and effectively manage risks inherent in PNC's business;
(8) how PNC chooses to redeploy available capital, including the extent and timing of any share repurchases and acquisitions or other investments in PNC businesses;

(10) the timing and pricing of any sales of loans or other financial assets held for sale;
(11) the ability of PNC to obtain desirable levels of insurance and whether or not insurance coverage for claims by PNC is denied;
(12) relative and absolute investment performance of assets under management; and
(13) the extent of terrorist activities and international hostilities, increases or continuations of which may adversely affect the economy and financial and capital markets generally or PNC specifically.

Any future mergers, acquisitions, restructurings, divestitures or related transactions will also be subject to similar risks and uncertainties related to the ability to realize expected cost savings or revenue enhancements or to implement integration plans.

PNC believes that operating margin, as reported, is an effective indicator of management's ability to effectively employ BlackRock's resources.
 
Fund administration and servicing costs have been excluded from the operating margin calculation because these costs are a fixed, asset-based expense which can fluctuate based on the discretion of a third party.
