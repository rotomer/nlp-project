Glossary of Terms
 
- Net domestic and foreign fund investment assets for which PNC provides accounting and administration services. These assets are not included on PNC's Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Accounting/administration net assets
 
- Primarily comprised of total average quarterly assets plus (less) unrealized losses (gains) on available-for-sale debt securities, less goodwill and certain other intangible assets.
Adjusted average total assets
 
- Adjusted to reflect a full year of activity.
Annualized
 
- Assets over which PNC has sole or shared investment authority for its customers/clients. These assets are not included on PNC's Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Assets under management
 
- Represents the amount of resources that a business segment should hold to guard against potentially large losses that could cause insolvency. It is based on a measurement of economic risk, as opposed to risk as defined by regulatory bodies or generally accepted accounting principles. The economic capital assessment process involves converting a risk distribution to the capital that is required to support the risk, commensurate with an institution's target credit rating. As such, economic risk serves as a "common currency" of risk that allows an institution to compare disparate risks on a similar basis.
Capital
 
- Process of removing a loan or portion of a loan from a bank's balance sheet because the loan is considered uncollectible. A charge-off also is recorded when a loan is transferred to held for sale and the loan's market value is less than its carrying amount. This difference is a charge-off.
Charge-off
 
- Common shareholders' equity divided by total assets. Common shareholders' equity equals total shareholders' equity less preferred stock and the portion of capital surplus and retained interest related to the preferred stock.
Common shareholders' equity to total assets
 
- All fund assets held on behalf of clients under safekeeping arrangements. Such assets are not reported on PNC's Consolidated Balance Sheet. Assets held in custody at other institutions on behalf of PNC are included in the appropriate asset categories on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as if held physically by PNC.
Custody assets
 
- Assets that generate income, which include: short-term investments; loans held for sale; loans, net of unearned income; securities; federal funds sold, resale agreements, purchased customer receivables and certain other assets.
Earning assets
 
- The present value of the expected cash flows of the Corporation's existing assets less the present value of the expected cash flows of the Corporation's existing liabilities, plus the present value of the net cash flows of the Corporation's existing off-balance sheet positions.
Economic value of equity ("EVE")
 
- Noninterest expense divided by the sum of net interest income and noninterest income.
Efficiency
 
- A management accounting methodology designed to recognize the net interest income effects of sources and uses of funds provided by the assets and liabilities of business segments. These balances are assigned funding rates that represent the interest cost for PNC to raise/invest funds with similar maturity and repricing structures, using least-cost funding sources available.
Funds transfer pricing
 
- Tier 1 risk-based capital divided by adjusted average total assets.
Leverage ratio
 
- Annualized taxable-equivalent net interest income divided by average earning assets.
Net interest margin
 
- Assets held by PNC for customers/clients in a non-discretionary, custodial capacity. These assets are not included on PNC's Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Nondiscretionary assets under administration
 
- Total noninterest income divided by total revenue. Total revenue includes total noninterest income plus net interest income.
Noninterest income to total revenue
 
- Nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans, troubled debt restructured loans, nonaccrual loans held for sale, foreclosed and other assets. Interest income does not accrue on assets classified as nonperforming.
Nonperforming assets
 
- Nonperforming loans include loans to commercial, lease financing, consumer, commercial real estate and residential mortgage customers as well as troubled debt restructured loans. Nonperforming loans do not include nonaccrual loans held for sale or foreclosed and other assets. Interest income does not accrue on loans classified as nonperforming.
Nonperforming loans
 
- Cash proceeds received on a loan that had previously been charged off. The amount received is credited to the allowance for credit losses.
Recovery
 
- Annualized net income divided by average capital.
Return on capital
 
- Annualized net income divided by average assets.
Return on average assets
 
- Annualized net income divided by average shareholders' equity.
Return on average equity
 
- Primarily computed by the assignment of specific risk-weights, as defined by The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, to assets and off-balance sheet instruments.
Risk-weighted assets
 
- The process by which financial assets are legally transformed into securities.
Securitization
 
- Period-end total shareholders' equity divided by period-end total assets.
Shareholders' equity to total assets
 
- The interest income earned on certain assets is completely or partially exempt from federal income tax. As such, these tax-exempt instruments typically yield lower returns than a taxable investment. In order to provide accurate comparisons of yields and margins for all earning assets, the interest income earned on tax-exempt assets is increased to make them fully equivalent to other taxable interest income investments.
Taxable-equivalent interest
 
- Tier 1 capital equals: total shareholders' equity, plus trust preferred capital securities, plus certain minority interests that are held by others; less goodwill and certain intangible assets, less equity investments in nonfinancial companies and less net unrealized holding losses on available-for-sale equity securities. Net unrealized holding gains on available-for-sale equity securities, net unrealized holding gains (losses) on available-for-sale debt securities and net unrealized holding gains (losses) on cash flow hedge derivatives are excluded from total shareholders' equity for tier 1 capital purposes.
Tier 1 risk-based capital
 
- Tier 1 risk-based capital divided by period-end risk-weighted assets.
Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio
 
- Total domestic and foreign fund investment assets for which PNC provides related processing services. These assets are not included on PNC's Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Total assets serviced
 
- The sum of total transaction deposits, savings accounts, certificates of deposit, other time deposits and deposits in foreign offices.

- Tier 1 risk-based capital plus qualifying senior and subordinated debt, other minority interest not qualified as tier 1, and the allowance for credit losses, subject to certain limitations.
