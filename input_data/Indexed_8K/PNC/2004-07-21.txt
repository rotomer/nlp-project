During a conference call with investors on July 21, 2004, management commented on the outlook for noninterest expense for the remainder of the year. The outlook expressed in those comments did not take into account the impact of initiatives supporting growth in business activity. Giving effect to the impact of those initiatives, we anticipate that noninterest expense for the second half of 2004 would be lower than in the first half of 2004 but not to the extent indicated in the conference call.
