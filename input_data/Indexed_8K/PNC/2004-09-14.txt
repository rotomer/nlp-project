Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information
We make statements in this presentation, and we may from time to time make other statements, regarding our outlook or expectations for earnings, revenues, expenses, capital levels, asset quality or other future financial or business performance, strategies or expectations, or the impact of legal, regulatory or supervisory matters on our business operations or performance, that are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are typically identified by words or phrases such as "believe," "feel," "expect," "anticipate," "intend," "outlook," "estimate," "forecast," "project," "position," "target," "assume," "achievable," "potential," "strategy," "goal," "objective," "plan," "aspiration," "outcome," "continue," "remain," "maintain," "seek," "strive," "trend," and variations of such words and similar expressions, or future or conditional verbs such as "will," "would," "should," "could," "might," "can," "may" or similar expressions.
Forward-looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties, which change over time. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made. We do not assume any duty and do not undertake to update our forward-looking statements. Actual results or future events could differ, possibly materially, from those that we anticipated in our forward-looking statements, and future results could differ materially from our historical performance.
The factors that we have previously disclosed in our SEC reports (accessible on our corporate website at www.pnc.com and on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov) and the following factors, among others, could cause actual results or future events to differ materially from those that we anticipated in our forward-looking statements or from our historical performance:
(1) changes in political, economic or industry conditions, the interest rate environment or financial and capital markets (including as a result of actions of the Federal Reserve Board affecting interest rates, money supply or otherwise reflecting changes in monetary policy), which could affect: (a) credit quality and the extent of our credit losses; (b) the extent of funding of our unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit; (c) our allowances for loan and lease losses and unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit; (d) demand for our credit or fee-based products and services; (e) our net interest income; (f) the value of assets under management and assets serviced, of private equity investments, of other debt and equity investments, of loans held for sale, or of other on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet assets; or (g) the availability and terms of funding necessary to meet our liquidity needs;
(2) the impact on us of legal and regulatory developments (including the following: (a) the resolution of legal proceedings or regulatory and other governmental inquiries; (b) increased litigation risk from recent regulatory and other governmental developments; (c) the results of the regulatory examination process, our failure to satisfy the requirements of agreements with governmental agencies, and regulators' future use of supervisory and enforcement tools; (d) legislative and regulatory reforms, including changes to tax law; and (e) changes in accounting policies and principles), with the impact of any such developments possibly affecting our ability to operate our businesses or our financial condition or results of operations or our reputation, which in turn could have an impact on such matters as business generation and retention, our ability to attract and retain management, liquidity and funding;
(3) the impact on us of changes in the nature or extent of our competition;
(4) the introduction, withdrawal, success and timing of our business initiatives and strategies;
(5) customer acceptance of our products and services, and our customers' borrowing, repayment, investment and deposit practices;
(6) the impact on us of changes in the extent of customer or counterparty delinquencies, bankruptcies or defaults that could affect, among other things, credit and asset quality risk and our provision for credit losses;
(7) the ability to identify and effectively manage risks inherent in our business;
 
Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information (continued)
(8) how we choose to redeploy available capital, including the extent and timing of any share repurchases and acquisitions or other investments in our businesses;
(9) the impact, extent and timing of technological changes, the adequacy of intellectual property protection, and costs associated with obtaining rights in intellectual property claimed by others;
(10) the timing and pricing of any sales of loans or other financial assets held for sale;
(11) our ability to obtain desirable levels of insurance, and whether or not insurance coverage for claims by PNC is denied;
(12) the relative and absolute investment performance of assets under management; and
(13) the extent of terrorist activities and international hostilities, increases or continuations of which may adversely affect the economy and financial and capital markets generally or us specifically.
In addition, our forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties related to our pending acquisition of Riggs National Corporation and the expected consequences of the integration of the remaining Riggs businesses at closing into PNC, including the following: (a) completion of the transaction is dependent on, among other things, receipt of stockholder and regulatory approvals, and we cannot at this point predict with precision when those approvals may be obtained or if they will be received at all; (b) successful completion of the transaction and our ability to realize the benefits that we anticipate from the acquisition also depend on the nature of any future developments with respect to Riggs' regulatory issues, the ability to comply with the terms of all current or future regulatory requirements (including any related action plan) resulting from these issues, and the extent of future costs and expenses arising as a result of these issues, including the impact of increased litigation risk and any claims for indemnification or advancement of costs; (c) the transaction may be materially more expensive to complete than we anticipate as a result of unexpected factors or events; (d) the integration into PNC of the Riggs business and operations that we acquire, which will include conversion of Riggs' different systems and procedures, may take longer than we anticipate, may be more costly than we anticipate, or may have unanticipated adverse results relating to Riggs' or PNC's existing businesses; (e) it may take longer that we expect to realize the anticipated cost savings of the acquisition, and those anticipated cost savings may not be achieved or may not be achieved in their entirety; and (f) the anticipated strategic and other benefits of the acquisition to us are dependent in part on the future performance of Riggs' business, and there can be no assurance as to actual future results, which could be impacted by various factors, including the risks and uncertainties generally related to the performance of PNC's and Riggs' businesses (with respect to Riggs, see Riggs' SEC reports, also accessible on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov) or due to factors related to the acquisition of Riggs and the process of integrating Riggs' business at closing into ours.
Other mergers, acquisitions, restructurings, divestitures, business alliances or similar transactions, including our recently completed acquisition of United National Bancorp and our pending acquisition of SSRM Holdings Inc., will also be subject to similar risks and uncertainties related to our ability to complete the transaction, in the case of pending and future transactions, and our ability to realize expected cost savings or revenue enhancements or to implement integration and strategic plans.
In addition, risks and uncertainties that could affect the results anticipated in forward-looking statements or from historical performance that involve BlackRock are discussed in more detail and additional factors are identified in BlackRock's SEC reports, accessible on the SEC's website or on BlackRock's website at www.blackrock.com.
Any annualized, proforma, estimated, third party or consensus numbers in this presentation are used for illustrative or comparative purposes only and may not reflect actual results. Any consensus earnings estimates are calculated based on the earnings projections made by analysts who cover that company. The analysts' opinions, estimates or forecasts (and therefore the consensus earnings estimates) are theirs alone, are not those of PNC or its management, and may not reflect PNC's actual or anticipated results.
