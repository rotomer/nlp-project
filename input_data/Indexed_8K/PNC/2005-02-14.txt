Item 1.01. ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT. On February 10, 2005, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. ("PNC") and Riggs National Corporation ("Riggs") amended and restated the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated July 16, 2004, between PNC and Riggs. A copy of the Amended and Restated Agreement and Plan of Merger is attached hereto as Exhibit 2.1. The Amended and Restated Agreement and Plan of Merger, which is substantially similar to the original agreement, values each share of Riggs common stock at approximately $20.00 based on PNC's closing NYSE stock price of $54.58 on February 7, 2005. The aggregate consideration is composed of a fixed number of approximately 6.4 million shares of PNC common stock and $286 million in cash in exchange for all 31.8 million Riggs common shares outstanding, subject to adjustment. Riggs stock options, currently with an aggregate in-the-money value of approximately $16 million, will be cashed out prior to closing, if not exercised. The transaction is expected to close as soon as possible, and either party may terminate the agreement after May 31, 2005 if the transaction has not closed. The merger remains subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals, the approval of Riggs shareholders, and the receipt of exemptions from the Department of Labor and the SEC to mitigate the potential business impact of Riggs Bank's plea agreement with the Department of Justice. The exemption sought from the Department of Labor would allow Riggs and PNC to retain "qualified professional asset manager" status. The exemption sought from the Securities and Exchange Commission would allow PNC to continue to advise registered mutual funds under Section 9 of the Investment Company Act of 1940, notwithstanding Riggs Bank's guilty plea with the Department of Justice. Mr. Joe L. Allbritton's agreement to vote 24.6% of the outstanding shares of Riggs in favor of the transaction remains applicable. A press release regarding the foregoing is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1. Item 9.01. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS.

Company Common Stock in favor of the Original Plan and the transactions contemplated thereby. As a condition and inducement to PNC's willingness to enter into this Plan, such stockholder has sent PNC a letter confirming that such Voting Agreement shall be applicable to this Plan. NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of their mutual promises and obligations, the parties hereto amend and restate the Original Plan in its entirety as follows: ARTICLE I THE MERGER 1.1 THE MERGER.(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Plan, at the Effective Time (as hereinafter defined), the Company shall merge with and into PNC (the "MERGER"), and the separate corporate existence of the Company shall thereupon cease. PNC shall be the surviving corporation in the Merger (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the "SURVIVING CORPORATION") and shall continue to be governed by the laws of the State of Pennsylvania. (b) The Merger shall have the effects specified in this Plan, the Delaware General Corporation Law (the "DGCL") and the Business Corporation Law of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (the "PBCL").

ARTICLE II CONVERSION OR CANCELLATION OF SHARES 2.1 CONVERSION OR CANCELLATION OF SHARES. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any stockholder: (a) COMPANY COMMON STOCK.

(b) CERTAIN DEFINITIONS. For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms shall have the following meanings: (1) "AGGREGATE CASH AMOUNT" means, subject to Section 2.1(e), 45% of the product of (x) the Aggregate Company Share Amount (as hereinafter defined) less the number of Exception Shares cancelled pursuant to Section 2.1(d) hereof (but excluding from such reduction the 3,341,521 treasury shares as of the date hereof) and (y) $20.00, rounded to the nearest whole cent; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if, at the Effective Time, the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon exercise of then outstanding Company Options (as defined under Section 5.10(a)) exceeds the difference between (A) 3,169,314 less (B) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock issued upon exercise of Company Options after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time (such excess being referred to herein as the "EXCESS OPTION SHARES"), then the "AGGREGATE CASH AMOUNT" shall be reduced by the product of (A) the Excess Option Shares and (B) an amount equal to the excess of $20.00 over the weighted average exercise price of the options related to the Excess Option Shares at the Effective Time, in each case rounded to the nearest whole cent. (2) "AGGREGATE COMPANY SHARE AMOUNT" shall equal 31,799,270 shares of Company Common Stock; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Aggregate Company Share Amount shall be increased by virtue of the issuance of any shares of Company Common Stock upon (i) the exercise from and after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time of Company Options outstanding on the date hereof, (ii) the funding of the trust under the Company Amended and Restated Deferred Compensation Plan, in each case, after February 9, 2005 and prior to the Effective Time, (iii) the distribution of interests under the Riggs National Corporation and Riggs Bank N.A. Deferred Compensation Plan for Directors in accordance with the terms of such plan and (iv) the vesting of deferred share awards or performance share awards under the Riggs National Corporation 2002 Long-Term Incentive Plan (including by reason of Section 5.12(c)) to the extent not outstanding on the date hereof. (3) "AGGREGATE PNC SHARE AMOUNT" shall, subject to Section 2.1(e), be equal to 6,408,790 shares of PNC Common Stock; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the "AGGREGATE PNC SHARE AMOUNT" shall be (x) increased by virtue of the issuance of any shares of Company Common Stock upon (i) the exercise from and after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time of Company Stock Options outstanding on the date hereof, (ii) the funding of the trust under the Company Amended and Restated Deferred Compensation Plan, in each case, after February 9, 2005 and prior to the Effective Time, (iii) the distribution of interests under the Riggs National Corporation and Riggs Bank N.A. Deferred 3
Compensation Plan for Directors in accordance with the terms of such plan or (iv) the vesting of deferred share awards or performance share awards under the Riggs National Corporation 2002 Long-Term Incentive Plan (including by reason of Section 5.12(c)) to the extent not outstanding on the date hereof and (y) shall be decreased in the event any shares of Company Common Stock are cancelled pursuant to Section 2.1(d) hereof, other than the 3,341,521 treasury shares as of the date hereof, in each case on a basis of 0.2015 additional shares of PNC Common Stock for each share of Company Common Stock so issued or cancelled. (4) "MEASUREMENT PRICE" means the average of the daily high and low per share sales prices of PNC Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE"), as reported in the New York City edition of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL or, if not reported therein, in another authoritative source mutually agreed by PNC and the Company, for the five (5) full consecutive NYSE trading days ending on the trading day immediately prior to the Closing Date.

(6) "PER SHARE AMOUNT" means the amount obtained by dividing the Closing Transaction Value by the number of Exchangeable Shares, rounded to the nearest whole cent. (7) "EXCHANGE RATIO" means that fraction of a share of PNC Common Stock as shall be obtained by dividing the Per Share Amount by the Measurement Price, rounded to the nearest one-ten-thousandth. (8) "EXCHANGEABLE SHARES" means the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, rounded to the nearest whole share. (c) ADJUSTMENTS TO PRESERVE TAX TREATMENT. (i) In the event that the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product of (i) the Aggregate PNC Share Amount and (ii) the Final PNC Share Value by (y) the sum of (A) the Aggregate Cash Amount, (B) the Other Cash Consideration (as defined below), and (C) the product of (i) the Aggregate PNC Share Amount and (ii) the Final PNC Share Value is less than 0.425, the Aggregate PNC Share Amount shall be increased by the Share Adjustment Amount (as defined in this Section 2.1(e)) and the Aggregate Cash Amount shall be decreased by the product of (x) the Final PNC Share Value and (y) the Share Adjustment Amount. The "SHARE ADJUSTMENT AMOUNT" shall be equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the difference obtained by subtracting (i) the product of (a) the Aggregate PNC Share Amount and (b) the Final PNC Share Value from (ii) the product of (a) 0.425 and (b) the sum of (1) the Aggregate Cash Amount, (2) Other Cash Consideration and (3) the product of the Aggregate PNC Share Amount and the Final PNC Share Value by (y) the Final PNC Share Value. (ii) In the event that the Aggregate PNC Share Amount and the Aggregate Cash Amount are adjusted as provided for in this Section 2.1(e), all references in this Agreement to the "Aggregate PNC Share Amount" and the "Aggregate Cash Amount" shall refer to the Aggregate PNC Share Amount and the Aggregate Cash Amount as adjusted in this Section 2.1(e). (iii) For purposes of this Agreement, "FINAL PNC SHARE VALUE" means the arithmetic average of the daily high and low per share sales prices of PNC Common Stock on the NYSE on the Closing Date or if the Closing Date is not a trading day, the trading day prior to the Closing Date; and "OTHER CASH CONSIDERATION" means the sum of (i) the product of the number of Dissenting Shares (except to the extent that the holder of such Dissenting Shares, as of the Closing Date, has effectively withdrawn or 4
lost his right to dissent from the Merger under the DGCL) and the Per Share Cash Consideration and (ii) any other amounts received by a holder of Company stock prior to the Merger, either in a redemption of Company stock or in a distribution with respect to Company stock (but only to the extent such amount is treated as other property or money received in the exchange for purposes of Section 356 of the Internal Revenue Code, or would be so treated if the Company shareholder also had received stock of PNC in exchange for stock owned by the shareholder in the Company). (c) PNC COMMON STOCK. Each share of PNC Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding and shall be unaffected by the Merger. (d) CANCELLATION OF OLD SHARES. Each Exception Share shall cease to be outstanding, shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than Exception Shares, is hereinafter defined as an "OLD SHARE". Old Shares shall cease to be outstanding, shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate (an "OLD CERTIFICATE") formerly representing Old Shares shall thereafter cease to have any rights with respect to such shares, except the right to receive, without interest, upon exchange of such Old Certificate in accordance with Section 2.3, the Consideration. "EXCEPTION SHARES" means shares of Company Common Stock owned or held by PNC or by the Company, other than shares owned or held in a bona fide fiduciary or agency capacity or in satisfaction of a debt previously contracted in good faith. (e) Subject to the allocation procedures set forth in Section 2.1(e), each record holder of Company Common Stock will be entitled (i) to elect to receive shares of PNC Common Stock for all or some of the shares of Company Common Stock ("STOCK ELECTION SHARES") held by such record holder, (ii) to elect to receive cash for all or some of the shares of Company Common Stock ("CASH ELECTION SHARES") held by such record holder or (iii) to indicate that such holder makes no such election for all or some of the shares of Company Common Stock ("NO-ELECTION SHARES") held by such record holder. All such elections (each, an "ELECTION") shall be made on a form designed for that purpose and agreed to by PNC and the Company (an "ELECTION FORM"). Any shares of Company Common Stock for which the record holder has not, as of the Election Deadline (as defined below), properly submitted to the Exchange Agent a properly completed Election Form will be deemed No-Election Shares. A record holder acting in different capacities or acting on behalf of other persons in any way will be entitled to submit an Election Form for each capacity in which such record holder so acts with respect to each person for which it so acts. The exchange agent (the "EXCHANGE AGENT") will be a bank or trust company in the United States selected by PNC and reasonably acceptable to the Company. In order to make a valid election, the properly completed Election Form must be accompanied by certificates of the shares of Company Common Stock to which such Form of Election relates or by an appropriate customary guarantee of delivery of such certificates, as set forth in such Form of Election, from a member of any registered national securities exchange or a commercial bank or trust company in the United States (provided that such certificates are in fact delivered to the Exchange Agent by the time required in such guarantee of delivery; failure to deliver shares of Company Common Stock covered by such a guarantee of delivery within the time set forth on such guarantee shall be deemed to invalidate any otherwise properly made Election, unless otherwise determined by PNC, in its sole discretion). Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, each share of Company Common Stock owned by a subsidiary of PNC or by a subsidiary of the Company (in each case, other than those shares held by any such subsidiary in a bona fide fiduciary or agency capacity) shall be converted in the Merger solely into PNC Common Stock. (f) The allocation among the holders of shares of Company Common Stock of rights to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration or the Per Share Cash Consideration will be made as follows: (1) NUMBER OF STOCK ELECTIONS LESS THAN THE STOCK CONVERSION NUMBER. If the aggregate number of Stock Election Shares (on the basis of valid Election Forms received as of the Election 5
Deadline) is less than the number obtained by dividing the Aggregate PNC Share Amount by the Exchange Ratio (the "STOCK CONVERSION NUMBER"), then (A) each Stock Election Share will be, as of the Effective Time, converted into the right to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration, (B) the Exchange Agent will allocate from among the No-Election Shares, pro rata to the holders of No-Election Shares in accordance with their respective numbers of No-Election Shares, a sufficient number of No-Election Shares so that the sum of such number and the number of Stock Election Shares equals as closely as practicable the Stock Conversion Number, and each such allocated No-Election Share (each, a "STOCK-SELECTED NO-ELECTION SHARE") will be, as of the Effective Time, converted into the right to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration, PROVIDED that if the sum of all No-Election Shares and Stock Election Shares is equal to or less than the Stock Conversion Number, all No-Election Shares will be Stock-Selected No-Election Shares, (C) if the sum of Stock Election Shares and No-Election Shares is less than the Stock Conversion Number, the Exchange Agent will allocate from among the Cash Election Shares, pro rata to the holders of Cash Election Shares in accordance with their respective numbers of Cash Election Shares, a sufficient number of Cash Election Shares so that the sum of such number, the number of all Stock Election Shares and the number of all No-Election Shares equals as closely as practicable the Stock Conversion Number, and each such allocated Cash Election Share (each, a "CONVERTED CASH ELECTION SHARE") will be, as of the Effective Time, converted into the right to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration, and (D) each No-Election Share and Cash Election Share that is not a Stock-Selected No-Election Share or a Converted Cash Election Share (as the case may be) will be, as of the Effective Time, converted into the right to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration; or (2) NUMBER OF STOCK ELECTIONS GREATER THAN THE STOCK CONVERSION NUMBER. If the aggregate number of Stock Election Shares (on the basis of valid Election Forms received by the Election Deadline) is greater than the Stock Conversion Number, then (A) each Cash Election Share and No-Election Share will be, as of the Effective Time, converted into the right to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration, (B) the Exchange Agent will allocate from among the Stock Election Shares, pro rata to the holders of Stock Election Shares in accordance with their respective numbers of Stock Election Shares, a sufficient number of Stock Election Shares ("CONVERTED STOCK ELECTION SHARES") so that the difference of (x) the number of Stock Election Shares less (y) the number of the Converted Stock Election Shares equals as closely as practicable the Stock Conversion Number, and each Converted Stock Election Share will be, as of the Effective Time, converted into the right to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration; provided that if an Election Form designates by stock certificate number the priority in which the Stock Election Shares governed by such Election Form are to be reallocated pursuant to this clause (B), such Stock Election Shares shall be deemed reallocated in accordance with such priority, and (C) each Stock Election Share that is not a Converted Stock Election Share will be, as of the Effective Time, converted into the right to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration. (3) NUMBER OF STOCK ELECTIONS IS EQUAL TO THE STOCK CONVERSION NUMBER. If the aggregate number of Stock Election Shares (on the basis of Election Forms received by the Election Deadline) is equal to the Stock Conversion Number, then 6
(A) each Stock Election Share will be, as of the Effective Time, converted into the right to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration, and (B) each Cash Election Share and No-Election Share will be, as of the Effective Time, converted into the right to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration. 2.2 FRACTIONAL SHARES. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article II, no fractional shares of PNC Common Stock will be issued pursuant to the Merger. Instead, PNC will pay or cause to be paid to the holder of any Old Shares that would, pursuant to paragraph 2.1, otherwise be entitled to receive fractional shares of PNC Common Stock an amount in cash, rounded to the nearest cent and without interest, equal to the product of (i) the fraction of a share to which such holder would otherwise have been entitled and (ii) the Measurement Price. 2.3 EXCHANGE OF OLD CERTIFICATES FOR NEW CERTIFICATES. (a) EXCHANGE AGENT. Until the first anniversary of the Effective Time, PNC shall make available or cause to be made available to the Exchange Agent certificates (each, a "NEW CERTIFICATE") representing the shares of PNC Common Stock (each, a "NEW SHARE") and cash in amounts sufficient to allow the Exchange Agent to make all deliveries of New Certificates and payments that may be required in exchange for Old Certificates pursuant to this Article II. Upon such anniversary, any such New Certificates and cash remaining in the possession of the Exchange Agent (together with any dividends or earnings in respect thereof) shall be delivered to PNC. Any holder of Old Certificates who has not theretofore exchanged his or her Old Certificates for New Certificates and/or cash pursuant to this Article II shall thereafter be entitled to look exclusively to PNC, and only as a general creditor thereof in the case of cash, for the shares of PNC Common Stock and/or cash to which he or she may be entitled upon exchange of such Old Certificates pursuant to this Article II. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Exchange Agent nor any party hereto, shall be liable to any holder of Old Certificates for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. (b) EXCHANGE PROCEDURES. At least twenty business days prior to the expected Election Deadline, and thereafter from time to time as the Company may reasonably request until the Election Deadline, PNC shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail or deliver to each individual, bank, corporation, partnership, trust, association or other entity or organization (any of the foregoing, a "PERSON") who is a holder of record of Company Common Stock an Election Form and a form of letter of transmittal in form reasonably satisfactory to PNC and the Company containing instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Old Certificates in exchange for New Certificates and any payments pursuant to this Article II. To be effective, the Election Form must be properly completed, signed and actually received by the Exchange Agent not later than 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the business day that is ten (10) trading days prior to the Closing Date (which date shall be publicly announced by PNC as soon as practicable prior to such date) (the "ELECTION DEADLINE") and accompanied by the Old Certificates as to which such Election Form is being made, duly endorsed in blank or otherwise in a form acceptable for transfer on the books of Company (or accompanied by an appropriate guarantee of delivery by an eligible organization) in the case of shares that are not held in book entry form. For shares that are held in book entry form, PNC shall establish procedures for the delivery of such shares, which procedures shall be reasonably acceptable to Company. The Exchange Agent shall make all computations contemplated by Section 2.1 hereof, and after consultation with PNC and the Company, all such computations will be conclusive and binding on the former holders of Company Common Stock absent manifest error. Any shares of Company Common Stock for which the record holder has not, as of the Election Deadline, properly submitted to the Exchange Agent a properly completed Election Form will be deemed No-Election Shares. Any Election Form may be revoked, by the stockholder who submitted such Election Form to the Exchange Agent, only by written notice received by the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline. In addition, all Election Forms shall automatically be revoked if the Exchange Agent is notified in writing by PNC and the Company that the Merger has been abandoned. Promptly after the Effective Time, each holder who has surrendered to the 7
Exchange Agent an Old Certificate for cancellation together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a New Certificate representing the New Shares and/or a check in the amount to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this Article II, and the Old Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. No interest will accrue or be paid with respect to any property to be delivered upon surrender of Old Certificates. If any New Certificate is to be issued, or cash payment made, in a name other than that in which the Old Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of such exchange that the Person requesting such exchange shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the issuance of such New Certificate or the making of such cash payment in a name other than that of the registered holder of the Old Certificate surrendered, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the PNC and the Exchange Agent that any such taxes have been paid or are not applicable. (c) DISTRIBUTIONS WITH RESPECT TO UNEXCHANGED SHARES. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, no dividends or other distributions in respect of New Shares with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to any Person holding an Old Certificate until such Old Certificate has been surrendered for exchange as provided herein. Subject to the effect of applicable laws and the immediately preceding sentence, following surrender of any such Old Certificates, there shall be paid to the holder of the New Certificates issued in exchange therefor, without interest, at the time of such surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date on or after the Effective Time theretofore payable with respect to the New Shares represented thereby, as well as any dividends with respect to Company Common Stock declared prior to the Effective time but unpaid. (d) TRANSFERS. At or after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of PNC or the Company of Old Shares. (e) LOST, STOLEN OR DESTROYED CERTIFICATES. If any Old Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Old Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by PNC or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as PNC or the Exchange Agent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Old Certificate, PNC or the Exchange Agent shall, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Old Certificate, issue or cause to be issued a New Certificate and/or pay or cause to be paid the amounts, if any, deliverable in respect to the Old Shares formerly represented by such Old Certificate pursuant to this Article II. 2.4 ADJUSTMENT OF CONSIDERATION. In the event that, subsequent to the date of this Plan but prior to the Effective Time, the shares of PNC Common Stock issued and outstanding shall, through a reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split or other similar change in the capitalization of PNC, increase or decrease in number or be changed into or exchanged for a different kind or number of securities, then an appropriate and proportionate adjustment shall be made to the Per Share Cash Consideration and the Per Share Stock Consideration. 2.5 SHARES OF DISSENTING STOCKHOLDERS. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time and that are held by a stockholder who has properly exercised his appraisal rights under the DGCL (the "DISSENTING SHARES") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Consideration unless and until the holder shall have failed to perfect, or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost, his right to dissent from the Merger under the DGCL and to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due with respect to such Dissenting Shares pursuant to and subject to the requirements of the DGCL. If any such holder shall have so failed to perfect or have effectively withdrawn or lost such right after the Election Deadline, each share of such holder's Company Common Stock shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into and to have become, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive, without any interest thereon, the Per Share Stock Consideration or the Per Share Cash Consideration, or a combination thereof, as determined by PNC in its sole discretion. The Company shall give PNC (i) prompt notice of any notice or demands for appraisal or payment for shares of Company Common Stock received by the Company and (ii) the opportunity to 8
participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demands or notices. The Company shall not, without the prior written consent of PNC, make any payment with respect to, or settle, offer to settle or otherwise negotiate, any such demands. 2.7 WITHHOLDING RIGHTS. PNC shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Consideration such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold under the Internal Revenue Code and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by PNC, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Plan as having been paid to the Company stockholder in respect to which such deduction and withholding was made by PNC.

(a) For all purposes of this Plan, no representation of PNC or the Company contained in Section 4.3 (other than the representations contained in Section 4.3(b), which shall be true and correct in all material respects, and in Section 4.3(g)(3), which shall be true and correct in all respects) shall be deemed untrue and no party hereto shall be deemed to have breached a representation, as a consequence of the existence of any fact, event or circumstance unless such fact, circumstance or event, individually or taken together with all other facts, events or circumstances inconsistent with any representation contained in Section 4.3 (read for this purpose without regard to any individual reference to "materiality" or "Material Adverse Effect" set forth therein) has had or is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to PNC or the Company, as the case may be.

5.10 OPTIONS. (a) CASHOUT OF OPTIONS. Immediately after the Effective Time, each option granted by the Company to purchase shares of Company Common Stock that is outstanding and unexercised under any employee stock option or equity compensation plan or arrangement of the Company (any such option to purchase Company Common Stock being referred to as a "COMPANY OPTION" or the "COMPANY OPTIONS"), whether or not vested or exercisable, shall be terminated and the holder shall be paid by PNC as soon as reasonably possible following the Effective Time, an amount in cash determined by multiplying (i) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Cash Consideration over the applicable per share exercise price of that option by (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock that the holder could have purchased (assuming full vesting of all options) had that holder exercised that option immediately before the Effective Time, less applicable tax withholding. (b) ACTIONS. Prior to the Effective Time, (1) the Company shall take such actions as PNC may reasonably request (but without expenditure of any funds) to give effect to the transactions contemplated by Section 5.10(a), including, without limitation, the provision of any notices to option holders as may be provided for in the Company's stock option and equity compensation arrangements, and (2) the Board of Directors of the Company or the Compensation Committee thereof, as applicable, will use its reasonable best efforts to adopt any resolutions and/or plan amendments necessary to effectuate the provisions of Section 5.10(a). 5.11 INDEMNIFICATION AND INSURANCE. (a) Following the Effective Time, PNC shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless and advance expenses to the present and former directors, officers, employees and agents of the Company or any of its subsidiaries (including the Company Bank), and any person presently or formerly serving at the request of the Company or any of its subsidiaries as a director, officer, employee, agent, trustee or fiduciary of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise or under or with respect to any employee benefit plan (each, an "INDEMNIFIED PARTY" and collectively, the "INDEMNIFIED PARTIES") against all costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, penalties, amounts paid in settlement or other liabilities (collectively, "INDEMNIFIED LIABILITIES") incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated by this Plan), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time (x) to the same extent as such persons are indemnified or have the right to advancement of expenses pursuant to the Governing Documents and indemnification agreements, if any, in effect on the date of this Plan with the Company or any of its subsidiaries and (y) without limitation of, and in addition to, clause (x), to the fullest extent permitted by law. In the event of any such Indemnified Liabilities, (i) PNC shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel selected by an Indemnified Party promptly after statements therefor are received and shall otherwise advance to such Indemnified Party upon request reimbursement of documented expenses reasonably incurred and (ii) PNC shall cooperate in the defense of such matter.

(b) For a period of six years from the Effective Time, PNC shall use its reasonable best efforts to provide directors' and officers' liability insurance (including excess coverage) and fiduciary liability insurance in respect of any Company Benefit Plans that serves to reimburse the present and former officers and directors of the Company or any of its subsidiaries (including the Company Bank) with respect to claims against such directors and officers arising from facts or events occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including, without limitation, the transactions contemplated by this Plan) which insurance shall contain at least the same coverage and amounts, and contain terms and conditions no less advantageous, as that coverage currently provided by the Company, PROVIDED, that if PNC is unable to 24
maintain or obtain the insurance called for by this Section 5.11(b), PNC will use its reasonable best efforts to obtain as much comparable insurance as is reasonably available. (c) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under Section 5.11(a), upon learning of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation described above, shall notify PNC thereof; PROVIDED that the failure to so notify shall not affect the obligations of PNC under Section 5.11(a) unless and to the extent that PNC is actually and materially prejudiced as a result of such failure. PNC hereby acknowledges notice of all matters Previously Disclosed. (d) If PNC or any of its successors or assigns shall consolidate with or merge into any other entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving entity of such consolidation or merger or shall transfer all or substantially all of its assets or deposits to any other entity, or engage in any similar transaction, then and in each case, PNC shall cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of PNC shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.11. (e) The provisions of this Section 5.11 are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives.

Deferred Compensation Plan for Directors that are in the Company stock fund to be converted into a dollar amount equal to the Per Share Cash Consideration that could be invested in the same way interests that are not in the Company stock fund can be invested at the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take any actions that are necessary to cause all unvested deferred share awards and all unvested performance share awards which are outstanding under the Riggs National Corporation 2002 Long-Term Incentive Plan to be terminated immediately prior to the Effective Time and simultaneously therewith will issue one share of Company Common Stock for each underlying share that is so terminated to the grantee of such award. 5.13 NOTIFICATION OF CERTAIN MATTERS. Each of PNC and the Company shall give prompt notice to the other of any fact, event or circumstance known to it that (1) is reasonably likely, individually or taken together with all other facts, events and circumstances known to it, to result in any Material Adverse Effect with respect to it or (2) would cause or constitute a material breach of any of its representations, covenants or agreements contained herein. 5.14 EXEMPTION FROM LIABILITY UNDER SECTION 16(B). PNC and the Company agree that, in order to most effectively compensate and retain the Company Insiders (as defined below) in connection with the Merger, both prior to and after the Effective Time, it is desirable that the Company Insiders not be subject to a risk of liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law in connection with the conversion of shares of Company Common Stock and Company Options into shares or options of PNC in the Merger, and for that compensatory and retentive purpose agree to the provisions of this Section 5.14.

"COMPANY INSIDERS" shall mean those present or former officers and directors of the Company who are subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act and who are listed in the Company Section 16 Information.

EXHIBIT 99.1 CONTACTS: MEDIA: PNC Riggs Brian E. Goerke Mark Hendrix (412) 762-4550 (202) 835-5162 corporate.communications@pnc.com mark_hendrix@riggsbank.com INVESTORS: William H. Callihan (412) 762-8257 investor.relations@pnc.com PNC AND RIGGS ANNOUNCE REVISED MERGER AGREEMENT PITTSBURGH AND WASHINGTON, D.C., FEBRUARY 10, 2005 - The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (NYSE: PNC) and Riggs National Corporation (NASDAQ: RIGS) today announced that, as a result of their renewed negotiations, they have amended and restated the agreement for PNC to acquire Riggs. Under the terms of the amended agreement, PNC will acquire Riggs for $20.00 per common share, or approximately $652 million. "We are looking forward to our entry into the extremely appealing Washington, D.C. marketplace, and we are confident that the Riggs franchise will provide us with an excellent platform from which to grow," said James E. Rohr, chairman and chief executive officer of The PNC Financial Services Group. "We have assessed the remaining risks to Riggs, and we believe we have reached a revised agreement that is fair to all parties." PNC expects the financial impact of the transaction, including the anticipated internal rate of return and the impact on PNC's earnings per share, not to differ materially from previously announced expectations regarding the original transaction structure. Under the restated terms of the merger agreement, which has been approved by the boards of directors of both companies, Riggs National Corporation will merge into The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. and PNC Bank N.A. will acquire the assets of Riggs Bank N.A. This change in structure was effected to mitigate the potential business impact of Riggs Bank's plea agreement with the Department of Justice. The amended agreement, which is substantially similar to the original agreement, values each share of Riggs common stock at approximately $20.00 based on PNC's closing NYSE stock price of $54.58 on February 7, 2005. The aggregate consideration is composed of a fixed number of approximately 6.4 million shares of PNC common stock and $286 million in cash in exchange for all 31.8 million Riggs common shares outstanding, subject to adjustment. Riggs stock options, currently with an aggregate in-the-money value of approximately $16 million, will be cashed out prior to closing, if not exercised. Riggs has agreed to dismiss its recently filed lawsuit against PNC. The transaction is expected to close as soon as possible, and either party may terminate the agreement after May 31, 2005 if the transaction has not closed. The merger remains subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals and the approval of Riggs shareholders, the receipt of exemptions from the Department of Labor and the SEC to mitigate the potential business impact of Riggs Bank's plea agreement with the Department of Justice and the absence of an undisclosed material adverse effect after December 31, 2004. Mr. Joe L. Allbritton's agreement to vote 24.6% of the outstanding shares of Riggs in favor of the transaction remains applicable.
