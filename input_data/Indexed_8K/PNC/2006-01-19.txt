Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
 
On January 19, 2006, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. ("the Corporation") issued a press release and held a conference call for investors regarding the Corporation's earnings and business results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2005. The Corporation also provided supplementary financial information on its web site, including financial information disclosed in connection with its earnings press release, and provided electronic presentation slides on its web site used in connection with the related investor conference call. Copies of the supplementary financial information and electronic presentation slides are included in this Report as Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2, respectively, and are furnished herewith.
 
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits.
 
(c) Exhibits. The exhibits listed on the Exhibit Index accompanying this Form 8-K are furnished herewith.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 
 

EXHIBIT 99.1
 
 
 
 
 
The information contained in this Financial Supplement is preliminary, unaudited and based on data available at January 19, 2006. We have reclassified certain prior period amounts included in this Financial Supplement to be consistent with the current period presentation.
 
See our Current Reports on Form 8-K dated September 30, 2005 and December 28, 2005 regarding changes to the presentation of results for our business segments based on our decision to reorganize our banking businesses during third quarter 2005 into two units and to align our reporting accordingly. Since that date, we have renamed our two banking business segments. Retail Banking was formerly reported as Consumer Banking, while Corporate & Institutional Banking was formerly reported as Institutional Banking. The organization of these businesses did not change in the fourth quarter of 2005.
 
As previously reported in our third quarter 2005 Report on Form 10-Q, in early October 2005, Market Street Funding Corporation ("Market Street"), a multi-seller asset-backed commercial paper conduit owned by an independent third party, was restructured. As a result, Market Street was deconsolidated from our Consolidated Balance Sheet effective October 17, 2005. This deconsolidation is reflected in the information contained in this Financial Supplement. We had previously consolidated Market Street under the provisions of FIN 46R effective July 1, 2003.
 
This information speaks only as of the particular date or dates included in the schedules. We do not undertake any obligation to, and disclaim any duty to, correct or update any of the information provided in this Financial Supplement. Our future financial performance is subject to risks and uncertainties as described in our SEC filings.
 
The period-end headcount statistics disclosed in this Financial Supplement for each business segment reflect staff directly employed by the respective business segment and exclude corporate and shared services employees.

Consolidated Income Statement
 
 
The decrease in the effective tax rate in 2004 compared with 2003 reflected reduced state and local tax expense due to tax benefits of $18 million recorded in 2004 in connection with New York state and city audits (principally associated with BlackRock), and a $14 million reduction in income tax expense following our determination in the third quarter of 2004 that we no longer required an income tax reserve related to bank-owned life insurance.
 
(Unaudited)
Consolidated Income Statement
 
 
The decrease in the third quarter 2005 effective tax rate was principally caused by a decrease in the tax rate at PFPC resulting from changes in the way income is apportioned for state tax purposes; the effect of contributing BlackRock stock to the PNC Foundation; and adjustments related to the completion of PNC's 2004 federal income tax return.
 
The second quarter 2005 effective tax rate reflects a $6 million increase in deferred taxes related to the Riggs acquisition.
 
The first quarter 2005 effective tax rate reflects the $45 million impact of the reversal of certain deferred tax liabilities in connection with the transfer of our ownership interest in BlackRock from PNC Bank, National Association to our intermediate bank holding company, PNC Bancorp, Inc. See our first quarter 2005 Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information.
 
The fourth quarter 2004 effective tax rate reflects a $10 million income tax benefit resulting from the release of reserves allocated to BlackRock's New York City tax liability due to the receipt of a favorable preliminary audit finding for the tax years 1998 through 2000 and $10 million in other tax benefits resulting from resolving refund claims and other miscellaneous items.

BlackRock
 
 
We believe that operating margin, as adjusted, is an effective indicator of management's ability to, and useful to management in deciding how to, effectively employ BlackRock's resources and, as such, provides useful disclosure to investors. The portion of the LTIP expense associated with awards to be met by the distribution to the LTIP participants of shares of BlackRock stock currently held by PNC has been excluded from operating income because, exclusive of the impact related to LTIP participants' options, these charges will not impact BlackRock's book value. SSRM acquisition costs consist of certain compensation costs and professional fees. Compensation cost reflected in this amount represents direct incentives related to alternative product performance fees generated in 2004 by SSRM employees, assumed in conjunction with the acquisition and settled by BlackRock with no future service requirement. Compensation expense associated with appreciation on assets related to BlackRock's deferred compensation plans has been excluded because investment returns on these assets reported in nonoperating income results in a nominal impact on net income. We have excluded fund administration and servicing costs from the operating margin calculation because these costs fluctuate based on the discretion of a third party. Reimbursable property management compensation represents compensation and benefits paid to certain BlackRock Realty Advisors, Inc. ("Realty") personnel. These employees are retained on Realty's payroll when properties are acquired by Realty's clients. The related compensation and benefits are fully reimbursed by Realty's clients and have been excluded from revenue used for operating margin measurement, as adjusted, because they bear no economic cost to BlackRock. We have excluded the impact on operating margin of the incentive compensation recognized during the second quarter of 2004 related to the gain on the sale of BlackRock's interest in Trepp LLC as such expense is not indicative of the ongoing level of incentive compensation for BlackRock.

Glossary of Terms
 
- Net domestic and foreign fund investment assets for which we provide accounting and administration services. We do not include these assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Accounting/administration net fund assets
 
- Primarily comprised of total average quarterly (or annual) assets plus (less) unrealized losses (gains) on available-for-sale debt securities, less goodwill and certain other intangible assets.
Adjusted average total assets
 
- Adjusted to reflect a full year of activity.
Annualized
 
- Assets over which we have sole or shared investment authority for our customers/clients. We do not include these assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Assets under management
 
- Process of removing a loan or portion of a loan from a bank's balance sheet because the loan is considered uncollectible. A charge-off is also recorded when a loan is transferred to held for sale and the loan's market value is less than its carrying amount.
Charge-off
 
- Common shareholders' equity divided by total assets. Common shareholders' equity equals total shareholders' equity less the liquidation value of preferred stock.
Common shareholders' equity to total assets
 
- All investment assets held on behalf of clients under safekeeping arrangements. We do not include these assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Investment assets held in custody at other institutions on our behalf are included in the appropriate asset categories on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as if physically held by us.
Custody fund assets
 
- Financial contracts whose value is derived from publicly traded securities, interest rates, currency exchange rates or market indices. Derivatives cover a wide assortment of financial contracts, including forward contracts, futures, options and swaps.
Derivatives
 
 An estimate of the rate sensitivity of a firm's economic value of equity. A negative duration of equity is associated with asset sensitivity (i.e., positioned for rising interest rates), while a positive value implies liability sensitivity (i.e., vulnerable to rising rates). For example, if the duration of equity is +1.5 years, the economic value of equity declines by 1.5% for each 100 basis point increase in interest rates.
Duration of equity
 
- Assets that generate interest income, which include: federal funds sold; resale agreements; other short-term investments, including trading securities; loans held for sale; loans, net of unearned income; securities; and certain other assets.
Earning assets
 
- Represents the amount of resources that a business segment should hold to guard against potentially large losses that could cause insolvency. It is based on a measurement of economic risk, as opposed to risk as defined by regulatory bodies or generally accepted accounting principles. The economic capital measurement process involves converting a risk distribution to the capital that is required to support the risk, consistent with an institution's target credit rating. As such, economic risk serves as a "common currency" of risk that allows an institution to compare different risks on a similar basis.
Economic capital
 
- The present value of the expected cash flows of our existing assets less the present value of the expected cash flows of our existing liabilities, plus the present value of the net cash flows of our existing off-balance sheet positions.
Economic value of equity ("EVE")
 
- A measurement, expressed in years, that, when multiplied by a change in interest rates, would approximate the percentage change in value of on- and off-balance sheet positions.
Effective duration
 
- Noninterest expense divided by the sum of net interest income and noninterest income.
Efficiency
 
- A management accounting methodology designed to recognize the net interest income effects of sources and uses of funds provided by the assets and liabilities of business segments. These balances are assigned funding rates that represent the interest cost for us to raise/invest funds with similar maturity and repricing structures, using the least-cost funding sources available.
Funds transfer pricing
 
 Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
GAAP
 
- Tier 1 risk-based capital divided by adjusted average total assets.
Leverage ratio
 
- Annualized taxable-equivalent net interest income divided by average earning assets.
Net interest margin
 
- Assets we hold for our customers/clients in a non-discretionary, custodial capacity. We do not include these assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Nondiscretionary assets under administration
 
- - Noninterest income divided by the sum of net interest income and noninterest income.
Noninterest income to total revenue
 
- Nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans, troubled debt restructured loans, nonaccrual loans held for sale, and foreclosed and other assets. Interest income does not accrue on assets classified as nonperforming.
Nonperforming assets
 
- Nonperforming loans include loans to commercial, lease financing, consumer, commercial real estate and residential mortgage customers as well as troubled debt restructured loans. Nonperforming loans do not include nonaccrual loans held for sale or foreclosed and other assets. Interest income does not accrue on loans classified as nonperforming.
Nonperforming loans
 
 The period to period percentage change in total revenue less the percentage change in noninterest expense. A positive percentage indicates that revenue growth exceeded expense growth (i.e., positive operating leverage) while a negative percentage implies expense growth exceeded revenue growth (i.e., negative operating leverage).
Operating leverage
 
- Cash proceeds received on a loan that had previously been charged off. The amount received is credited to the allowance for loan and lease losses.
Recovery
 
- Annualized net income divided by average capital.
Return on average capital
 
- Annualized net income divided by average assets.
Return on average assets
 
- Annualized net income divided by average common shareholders' equity.
Return on average common equity
 
- Primarily computed by the assignment of specific risk-weights (as defined by The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System) to assets and off-balance sheet instruments.
Risk-weighted assets
 
- The process of legally transforming financial assets into securities.
Securitization
 
- Common shareholders' equity less goodwill and other intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights) divided by assets less goodwill and other intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights).
Tangible common capital ratio
 
- The interest income earned on certain assets is completely or partially exempt from federal income tax. As such, these tax-exempt instruments typically yield lower returns than a taxable investment. To provide more meaningful comparisons of yields and margins for all earning assets, the interest income earned on tax-exempt assets is increased to make it fully equivalent to interest income on other taxable investments. This adjustment is not permitted under GAAP on the Consolidated Income Statement.
Taxable-equivalent interest
 
- Tier 1 risk-based capital equals: total shareholders' equity, plus trust preferred capital securities, plus certain minority interests that are held by others; less goodwill and certain other intangible assets, less equity investments in nonfinancial companies and less net unrealized holding losses on available-for-sale equity securities. Net unrealized holding gains on available-for-sale equity securities, net unrealized holding gains (losses) on available-for-sale debt securities and net unrealized holding gains (losses) on cash flow hedge derivatives are excluded from total shareholders' equity for tier 1 risk-based capital purposes.
Tier 1 risk-based capital
 
- Tier 1 risk-based capital divided by period-end risk-weighted assets.
Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio
 
- Total domestic and offshore fund investment assets for which we provide related processing services. We do not include these assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Total fund assets serviced
 
- Tier 1 risk-based capital plus qualifying senior and subordinated debt, other minority interest not qualified as tier 1, and the allowance for loan and lease losses, subject to certain limitations.
Total risk-based capital
 
- Total risk-based capital divided by period-end risk-weighted assets.
Total risk-based capital ratio
 
- The sum of money market and interest-bearing demand deposits and demand and other noninterest-bearing deposits.
Transaction deposits
 
- A graph showing the relationship between the yields on financial instruments or market indices of the same credit quality with different maturities. For example, a "normal" or "positive" yield curve exists when long-term bonds have higher yields than short-term bonds. A "flat" yield curve exists when yields are the same for short-term and long-term bonds. A "steep" yield curve exists when yields on long-term bonds are significantly higher than on short-term bonds.
Yield curve (shape of the yield curve, flat yield curve)
