Exhibit 99.1
 
The information contained in this Financial Supplement is preliminary, unaudited and based on data available on April 18, 2007. We have reclassified certain prior period amounts included in this Financial Supplement to be consistent with the current period presentation. This information speaks only as of the particular date or dates included in the schedules. We do not undertake any obligation to, and disclaim any duty to, correct or update any of the information provided in this Financial Supplement. Our future financial performance is subject to risks and uncertainties as described in our SEC filings.
Mercantile Acquisition
We completed our acquisition of Mercantile Bankshares Corporation ("Mercantile") on March 2, 2007 and our financial results include Mercantile from that date. PNC issued approximately 53 million shares of PNC common stock and paid approximately $2.1 billion in cash as consideration for the acquisition, and accounted for the transaction under the purchase method of accounting.
BlackRock/MLIM Transaction
As further described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2006, during 2006 BlackRock, Inc. ("BlackRock"), formerly a majority-owned subsidiary of The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc., and Merrill Lynch entered into a definitive agreement pursuant to which Merrill Lynch agreed to contribute its investment management business ("MLIM") to BlackRock in exchange for 65 million shares of newly issued BlackRock common and preferred stock. This transaction closed on September 29, 2006.
For the quarters ended September 30, 2006, June 30, 2006 and March 31, 2006 presented in this Financial Supplement, our Consolidated Income Statement reflects our former majority ownership interest in BlackRock. However, our Consolidated Income Statement for the quarters ended March 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006 and our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2007, December 31, 2006 and September 30, 2006 reflect the deconsolidation of BlackRock's balance sheet amounts and recognize our approximately 34% ownership interest in BlackRock as of those dates as an investment accounted for under the equity method.
We have also provided, for information purposes only, adjusted results in this document to reflect BlackRock as if it had been accounted for under the equity method for all periods presented.

Glossary of Terms
- Net domestic and foreign fund investment assets for which we provide accounting and administration services. We do not include these assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Accounting/administration net fund assets
- Primarily comprised of total average quarterly (or annual) assets plus (less) unrealized losses (gains) on available-for-sale debt securities, less goodwill and certain other intangible assets (net of eligible deferred taxes).
Adjusted average total assets
- Adjusted to reflect a full year of activity.
Annualized
- Assets over which we have sole or shared investment authority for our customers/clients. We do not include these assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Assets under management
- One hundredth of a percentage point.
Basis point
- Process of removing a loan or portion of a loan from our balance sheet because it is considered uncollectible. We also record a charge-off when a loan is transferred to held for sale by reducing the loan's carrying amount by the allowance for loan losses associated with such loan or if the loan's market value is less than its carrying amount.
Charge-off
- Common shareholders' equity divided by total assets. Common shareholders' equity equals total shareholders' equity less the liquidation value of preferred stock.
Common shareholders' equity to total assets
- Investment assets held on behalf of clients under safekeeping arrangements. We do not include these assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Investment assets held in custody at other institutions on our behalf are included in the appropriate asset categories on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as if physically held by us.
Custody assets
- Financial contracts whose value is derived from publicly traded securities, interest rates, currency exchange rates or market indices. Derivatives cover a wide assortment of financial contracts, including forward contracts, futures, options and swaps.
Derivatives
- An estimate of the rate sensitivity of our economic value of equity. A negative duration of equity is associated with asset sensitivity ( positioned for rising interest rates), while a positive value implies liability sensitivity ( positioned for declining interest rates). For example, if the duration of equity is +1.5 years, the economic value of equity declines by 1.5% for each 100 basis point increase in interest rates.
Duration of equity
i.e.,
i.e.,
- Assets that generate income, which include: federal funds sold; resale agreements; other short-term investments, including trading securities; loans held for sale; loans, net of unearned income; securities; and certain other assets.
Earning assets
- Represents the amount of resources that our business segments should hold to guard against potentially large losses that could cause insolvency. It is based on a measurement of economic risk, as opposed to risk as defined by regulatory bodies. The economic capital measurement process involves converting a risk distribution to the capital that is required to support the risk, consistent with our target credit rating. As such, economic risk serves as a "common currency" of risk that allows us to compare different risks on a similar basis.
Economic capital
- The present value of the expected cash flows of our existing assets less the present value of the expected cash flows of our existing liabilities, plus the present value of the net cash flows of our existing off-balance sheet positions.
Economic value of equity ("EVE")
- A measurement, expressed in years, that, when multiplied by a change in interest rates, would approximate the percentage change in value of on- and off- balance sheet positions.
Effective duration
 
- Noninterest expense divided by the sum of net interest income and noninterest income.
Efficiency
- A management accounting methodology designed to recognize the net interest income effects of sources and uses of funds provided by the assets and liabilities of our business segments. We assign these balances LIBOR-based funding rates at origination that represent the interest cost for us to raise/invest funds with similar maturity and repricing structures.
Funds transfer pricing
- Contracts in which the buyer agrees to purchase and the seller agrees to deliver a specific financial instrument at a predetermined price or yield. May be settled either in cash or by delivery of the underlying financial instrument.
Futures and forward contracts
- Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
GAAP
-Tier 1 risk-based capital divided by adjusted average total assets.
Leverage ratio
- Annualized taxable-equivalent net interest income divided by average earning assets.
Net interest margin
- Assets we hold for our customers/clients in a non-discretionary, custodial capacity. We do not include these assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Nondiscretionary assets under administration
- Noninterest income divided by the sum of net interest income and noninterest income.
Noninterest income to total revenue
- Nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans, troubled debt restructured loans, foreclosed assets and other assets. We do not accrue interest income on assets classified as nonperforming.
Nonperforming assets
- Nonperforming loans include loans to commercial, commercial real estate, equipment lease financing, consumer, and residential mortgage customers as well as troubled debt restructured loans. Nonperforming loans do not include nonperforming loans held for sale or foreclosed and other assets. We do not accrue interest income on loans classified as nonperforming.
Nonperforming loans
- A number of currency units, shares, or other units specified in a derivatives contract.
Notional amount
- The period to period percentage change in total revenue less the percentage change in noninterest expense. A positive percentage indicates that revenue growth exceeded expense growth ( positive operating leverage) while a negative percentage implies expense growth exceeded revenue growth ( negative operating leverage).
Operating leverage
i.e.,
i.e.,
- Cash proceeds received on a loan that we had previously charged off. We credit the amount received to the allowance for loan and lease losses.
Recovery
- Annualized net income divided by average capital.
Return on average capital
- Annualized net income divided by average assets.
Return on average assets
- Annualized net income divided by average common shareholders' equity.
Return on average common equity
- Primarily computed by the assignment of specific risk-weights (as defined by The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System) to assets and off-balance sheet instruments.
Risk-weighted assets
- The process of legally transforming financial assets into securities.
Securitization
- Period-end common shareholders' equity less goodwill and other intangible assets (net of eligible deferred taxes), and excluding mortgage servicing rights, divided by period-end assets less goodwill and other intangible assets (net of eligible deferred taxes), and excluding mortgage servicing rights.
Tangible common equity ratio
 
- The interest income earned on certain assets is completely or partially exempt from federal income tax. As such, these tax-exempt instruments typically yield lower returns than taxable investments. To provide more meaningful comparisons of yields and margins for all interest-earning assets, we also provide revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis by increasing the interest income earned on tax-exempt assets to make it fully equivalent to interest income on taxable investments. This adjustment is not permitted under GAAP on the Consolidated Income Statement.
Taxable-equivalent interest
- Tier 1 risk-based capital equals: total shareholders' equity, plus trust preferred capital securities, plus certain minority interests that are held by others; less goodwill and certain other intangible assets (net of eligible deferred taxes), less equity investments in nonfinancial companies and less net unrealized holding losses on available-for-sale equity securities. Net unrealized holding gains on available-for-sale equity securities, net unrealized holding gains (losses) on available-for-sale debt securities and net unrealized holding gains (losses) on cash flow hedge derivatives are excluded from total shareholders' equity for tier 1 risk-based capital purposes.
Tier 1 risk-based capital
- Tier 1 risk-based capital divided by period-end risk-weighted assets.
Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio
- Total domestic and offshore fund investment assets for which we provide related processing services. We do not include these assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Total fund assets serviced
- A non-traditional swap where one party agrees to pay the other the "total return" of a defined underlying asset (., a loan), usually in return for receiving a stream of LIBOR-based cash flows. The total returns of the asset, including interest and any default shortfall, are passed through to the counterparty. The counterparty is therefore assuming the credit and economic risk of the underlying asset.
Total return swap
e.g
- Tier 1 risk-based capital plus qualifying subordinated debt and trust preferred securities, other minority interest not qualified as tier 1, and the allowance for loan and lease losses, subject to certain limitations.
Total risk-based capital
- Total risk-based capital divided by period-end risk-weighted assets.
Total risk-based capital ratio
- The sum of money market and interest-bearing demand deposits and demand and other noninterest-bearing deposits.
Transaction deposits
- A graph showing the relationship between the yields on financial instruments or market indices of the same credit quality with different maturities. For example, a "normal" or "positive" yield curve exists when long-term bonds have higher yields than short-term bonds. A "flat" yield curve exists when yields are the same for short-term and long-term bonds. A "steep" yield curve exists when yields on long-term bonds are significantly higher than on short-term bonds. An "inverted" or "negative" yield curve exists when short-term bonds have higher yields than long-term bonds.
Yield curve
