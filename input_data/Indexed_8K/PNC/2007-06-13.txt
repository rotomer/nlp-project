Free Writing Prospectus pursuant to Rule 433(d) has been made in the manner and within the time period required by Rule 433; to the best knowledge of such counsel, no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued, no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or threatened, and the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus (other than the financial statements and other financial information contained or incorporated therein, and that part of the Registration Statement that constitutes the Statement of Eligibility and Qualification (Form T-1) of the Trustee under the Trust Indenture Act, as to which such counsel need express no opinion) comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of that Act and the Exchange Act and the respective rules and regulations thereunder; and nothing has come to the attention of such counsel that has caused such counsel to believe that at the Effective Date the Registration Statement contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; that the Pricing Disclosure Package as of the Applicable Time contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading or that the Final Prospectus as of its date and as of the Closing Date included or includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading except that such counsel does not express any opinion or belief as to (a) the financial statements or schedules or other data of a financial nature, (b) that part of the Registration Statement that constitutes the Statement of Eligibility and Qualification (Form T-1) of the Trustee under the Trust Indenture Act, and (c) regulatory actions of the applicable regulatory authorities that are not otherwise disclosed by such regulatory authorities. In connection with the foregoing, the Underwriters acknowledge and understand that the character of determinations involved in the process of preparing the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus (including any documents incorporated by reference) are such that such counsel need not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement or the Final Prospectus (including any documents incorporated by reference) except as expressly set forth herein.
(viii) This Agreement and any Delayed Delivery Contracts have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and the Guarantor;
(ix) No consent, approval, authorization or order of any court or governmental agency or body is required for the consummation of the
 
transactions contemplated herein or in any Delayed Delivery Contracts, except such as have been obtained under the Act and such as may be required under the blue sky laws of any jurisdiction in connection with the purchase and distribution of the Securities by the Underwriters and such other approvals (specified in such opinion) as have been obtained;
(x) Neither the issuance and sale of the Securities nor consummation of any other of the transactions contemplated herein nor the fulfillment of the terms hereof or of any Delayed Delivery Contracts will: (A) violate any provision of the charter or by-laws of the Company or the Guarantor or (B) constitute a violation or breach of or default under any material provision of any material indenture or other material agreement or instrument known to such counsel and to which the Company, the Guarantor or PNC Bank, N.A. is a party, or (C) violate any judgment, order or decree applicable to the Company, the Guarantor or PNC Bank, N.A. of any court or federal or state regulatory or governmental agency having jurisdiction over the Company, the Guarantor or PNC Bank, N.A.; except in (A), (B), or (C) above, with respect to violations, breaches or defaults that would not have a material adverse effect on the Company, the Guarantor and its consolidated subsidiaries taken as a whole or PNC Bank, N.A.;
(xi) The Company is not and, after giving effect to the offering and sale of the Securities and the application of the proceeds thereof as described in the Pricing Disclosure Package, will not be an "investment company" or an entity "controlled" by an "investment company", as such terms are defined in the Investment Company Act.
(xii) The Securities and the Indenture conform in all material respects to the descriptions thereof in the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus; and
(xiii) No holders of securities of the Company have rights to the registration of such securities under the Registration Statement.
In rendering such opinion, such counsel will opine only as to matters involving the application of the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania or the United States and may rely (A) as to matters involving the application of laws of any jurisdiction other than the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania or the United States, to the extent deemed proper and specified in such opinion, upon the opinion of other counsel of good standing believed to be reliable and who are reasonably satisfactory to counsel for the Underwriters, except that it will not be required that such counsel obtain an opinion of New York counsel as to matters of New York law in order to render such opinion or that such counsel express an opinion as to matters arising under the laws of any jurisdiction other than the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and matters of federal law arising under the laws of the United States of America, and (B) as to matters of fact, to the extent he or
 
she may deem proper, on certificates, or representations of responsible officers of the Company or the Guarantor and public officials. References to the Final Prospectus in this paragraph (b) include any supplements thereto at the Closing Date.
(c) The Representative shall have received from Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP, counsel for the Underwriters, such opinion and statement, dated the Closing Date, with respect to the issuance and sale of the Securities, any Delayed Delivery Contracts, the Registration Statement, the Final Prospectus (together with any supplement thereto), the Pricing Disclosure Package and other related matters as the Representative may reasonably require, and the Company shall have furnished to such counsel such documents as they reasonably request for the purpose of enabling them to pass upon such matters.
(d) The Guarantor shall have furnished to the Representative a certificate of the Guarantor, signed by the Chairman of the Board, the President, a Vice Chairman of the Board or any Executive or Senior Vice President and the principal financial or accounting officer of the Guarantor, dated the Closing Date, to the effect that the signers of such certificate have carefully examined the Registration Statement, Pricing Disclosure Package, the Final Prospectus, any supplement to the Final Prospectus and this Agreement and that:
(i) the representations and warranties of the Company and the Guarantor in this Agreement are true and correct on and as of the Closing Date with the same effect as if made on the Closing Date and the Company and the Guarantor have complied with all the agreements and satisfied all the conditions on its part to be performed or satisfied at or prior to the Closing Date;
(ii) no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or, to the Guarantor's knowledge, threatened; and
(iii) since the date of the most recent financial statements incorporated by reference in the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto), there has been no material adverse change in the condition (financial or other), earnings, business or properties of the Guarantor and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, whether or not arising from transactions in the ordinary course of business, except as set forth in or contemplated in the Pricing Disclosure Package (exclusive of any supplement thereto) and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto).
(e) At the Closing Date, Deloitte and Touche LLP shall have furnished to the Representative a letter or letters (which may refer to letters previously delivered to the Representative), dated as of the Closing Date, in form and
 
substance satisfactory to the Representative, confirming that they are independent accountants within the meaning of the Act and the Exchange Act and the respective applicable published rules and regulations thereunder and stating in effect that:
(i) in their opinion the audited consolidated financial statements included or incorporated in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus and reported on by them comply in form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Act and the Exchange Act and the related published rules and regulations; and
(ii) they have performed certain other specified procedures as a result of which they determined that certain information of an accounting, financial or statistical nature (which is limited to accounting, financial or statistical information derived from the general accounting records of the Guarantor and its subsidiaries) set forth in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus, including the information included or incorporated in Items 1, 5, 6 and 7 of the Guarantor's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the most recent fiscal year incorporated in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus, incorporated in the Registration Statement and Final Prospectus, agrees with the accounting records of the Guarantor and its subsidiaries, excluding any questions of legal interpretation.
References to the Final Prospectus in this paragraph (e) include any supplement thereto at the date of the letter.
If provided for in Schedule I hereto, at the Execution Time, Deloitte and Touche LLP shall have furnished to the Representative a letter or letters, dated as of the Execution Time, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representative, to the effect set forth above.
(f) At the Closing Date, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP shall have furnished to the Representative a letter or letters (which may refer to letters previously delivered to the Representative), dated as of the Closing Date, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representative, confirming that they are independent accountants within the meaning of the Act and the Exchange Act and the respective applicable published rules and regulations thereunder and stating in effect that:
(i) on the basis of a reading of the latest unaudited consolidated financial statements made available by the Guarantor and its subsidiaries; carrying out certain specified procedures (but not an audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards) which would not necessarily reveal matters of significance with respect to the comments set forth in such letter; a reading of the minutes of the
 
meetings of the shareholders and directors of the Guarantor and the audit and executive committees thereof and inquiries of certain officials of the Guarantor who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters of the Guarantor and its subsidiaries as to transactions and events subsequent to the date of the most recent audited consolidated financial statements in or incorporated in the Final Prospectus, nothing came to their attention which caused them to believe that: (1) any unaudited consolidated financial statements included or incorporated in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus do not comply in form in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and with the published rules and regulations of the Commission with respect to the financial statements included or incorporated in quarterly reports on Form 10-Q under the Exchange Act; and said unaudited consolidated financial statements are not in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a basis substantially consistent with that of the audited consolidated financial statements included or incorporated in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus; or (2) with respect to the period subsequent to the date of the most recent audited or unaudited consolidated financial statements incorporated in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus, there were, at a specified date not more than five business days prior to the date of the letter, any increases in borrowed funds of the Guarantor and its subsidiaries or any decreases in the capital stock (defined as each of the individual dollar amounts of preferred stock, common stock, and capital surplus) of the Guarantor or the stockholders' equity of the Guarantor as compared with the amounts shown on the most recent consolidated balance sheet incorporated in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus, or for the period from the date of the most recent audited or unaudited consolidated financial statements incorporated in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus to such specified date there were any decreases, as compared with the corresponding period in the preceding year, in total or per share amounts of consolidated net income of the Guarantor or consolidated net interest income except in all instances for changes or decreases set forth in such letter, in which case the letter shall be accompanied by an explanation by the Guarantor as to the significance thereof unless said explanation is not deemed necessary by the Representative; and
(ii) they have performed certain other specified procedures as a result of which they determined that certain information of an accounting, financial or statistical nature (which is limited to accounting, financial or statistical information derived from the general accounting records of the Guarantor and its subsidiaries) set forth in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus, including the information included in the "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" included or incorporated in the Guarantor's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q,
 
incorporated in the Registration Statement and Final Prospectus, agrees with the accounting records of the Guarantor and its subsidiaries, excluding any questions of legal interpretation.
References to the Final Prospectus in this paragraph (f) include any supplement thereto at the date of the letter.
If provided for in Schedule I hereto, at the Execution Time, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP shall have furnished to the Representative a letter or letters, dated as of the Execution Time, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representative, to the effect set forth above.
(g) On or subsequent to the Applicable Time or, if earlier, the dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement (exclusive of any amendment thereof), the Pricing Disclosure Package (exclusive of any supplement thereof) and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto), there shall not have been (i) any change or decrease specified in the letter or letters referred to in paragraph (e) of this Section 5 or (ii) any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the business or properties of the Guarantor and its subsidiaries the effect of which, in any case referred to in clause (i) or (ii) above, is, in the judgment of the Representative, so material and adverse as to make it impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or the delivery of the Securities as contemplated by the Registration Statement (exclusive of any amendment thereof), the Pricing Disclosure Package (exclusive of any supplement thereto) and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto).
(h) On or subsequent to the Applicable Time, there shall not have been any decrease in the ratings of any of the Guarantor's debt securities by Moody's Investors Service, Inc., or Standard & Poor's Corporation, or any public announcement that any such organization has under surveillance or review their ratings of any of the Guarantor's debt securities (other than an announcement with positive implications of a possible upgrading, and no implication of a possible downgrading, of such rating), and if, in any such case, the effect thereof in the judgment of the Representative makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the purchase of the Securities.
(i) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company and the Guarantor shall have furnished to the Representative such further information, certificates and documents as the Representative may reasonably request in connection with the offering of the Securities.
(j) The Company and the Guarantor shall have accepted Delayed Delivery Contracts in any case where sales of Contract Securities arranged by the Underwriters have been approved by the Company.
 
If any of the conditions specified in this Section 6 shall not have been fulfilled when and as provided in this Agreement, or if any of the opinions and certificates mentioned above or elsewhere in this Agreement shall not be reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Representative and counsel for the Underwriters, this Agreement and all obligations of the Underwriters hereunder may be canceled at, or at any time prior to, the Closing Date by the Representative. Notice of such cancellation shall be given to the Company in writing or by telephone or telegraph confirmed in writing.
Section 7. . If the sale of the Securities provided for herein is not consummated because any condition to the obligations of the underwriters set forth in Section 6 hereof is not satisfied, because of any termination pursuant to Section 10 hereof or because of any refusal, inability or failure on the part of the Company or the Guarantor to perform any agreement herein or comply with any provision hereof other than by reason of a default by any of the Underwriters, the Company and the Guarantor will reimburse the Underwriters severally upon demand for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) that shall have been incurred by them in connection with the proposed purchase and sale of the Securities. In no event shall the Company or the Guarantor be liable to the Underwriters for loss of anticipated profits from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Reimbursement of Underwriters' Expenses
Section 8. . (a) The Company and the Guarantor jointly and severally agree to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter and each person who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or other Federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the registration statement for the registration of the Securities as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or in the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Final Prospectus, the Pricing Disclosure Package or the Final Prospectus, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or any "issuer information" filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; , , that the Company and the Guarantor will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company and the Guarantor by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representative specifically for use in connection with the preparation thereof, or that part of the Registration Statement constituting the "Statement of Eligibility and Qualification" (Form T-1) of the Trustee under the Trust Indenture Act. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company and the Guarantor may otherwise have.
Indemnification and Contribution
provided
however
 
(b) Each Underwriter severally agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company and the Guarantor, each of their respective directors, each of their respective officers who signs the Registration Statement, and each person who controls the Company or the Guarantor within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company and the Guarantor to each Underwriter, but only with reference to written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company and the Guarantor by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representative specifically for use in the preparation of the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which any Underwriter may otherwise have. The Company and the Guarantor acknowledge that the statements set forth in the last paragraph of the cover page, and, under the heading "Underwriting" or "Plan of Distribution" (i) the list of Underwriters and their respective participation in the sale of the Securities, (ii) the sentence related to discounts and commissions and (iii) the paragraphs related to stabilization and syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids, and, if Schedule I hereto provides for sales of Securities pursuant to delayed delivery arrangements, in the last sentence under the heading "Delayed Delivery Arrangements" in any Preliminary Final Prospectus or the Final Prospectus constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the several Underwriters for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity, and you, as the Representative, confirm that such statements are correct.
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 8 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 8, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 8. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein, and to the extent that it may elect by written notice delivered to the indemnified party promptly after receiving the aforesaid notice from such indemnified party, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party; , , that if the defendants in any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, the indemnified party or parties shall have the right to select separate counsel to assert such legal defenses and to otherwise participate in the defense of such action on behalf of such indemnified party or parties. Upon receipt of notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense of such action and approval by the indemnified party of such counsel, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section 8 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the
provided
however
 
defense thereof unless (i) the indemnified party shall have employed separate counsel in accordance with the proviso to the next preceding sentence (it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel (plus any local counsel), approved by the Representative in the case of paragraph (a) of this Section 8, representing the indemnified parties under such paragraph (a) who are parties to such action), (ii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of commencement of the action or (iii) the indemnifying party has authorized the employment of counsel for the indemnified party at the expense of the indemnifying party; and except that, if clause (i) or (iii) is applicable, such liability shall be only in respect of the counsel referred to in such clause (i) or (iii).
(d) In order to provide for just and equitable contribution in circumstances in which the indemnification provided for in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 8 is unavailable, the Company and the Guarantor, on the one hand, and the Underwriters severally, on the other hand, shall contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending same) to which the Company, the Guarantor and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject in proportion to the relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantor on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities, such that the Underwriters are responsible for that portion represented by the percentage that the underwriting discount bears to the sum of such discount and the purchase price of the Securities specified in Schedule I hereto and the Company and the Guarantor are responsible for the balance; , , that in no case shall any Underwriter (except as may be provided in any agreement among underwriters relating to the offering of the Securities) be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount applicable to the Securities purchased by such Underwriter hereunder. If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Company and the Guarantor, on the one hand, and the Underwriters severally, on the other, shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits as described in the immediately preceding sentence but also the relative fault of the Company and the Guarantor on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages and liabilities as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the Company or the Guarantor on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Company, the Guarantor and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
provided
however
 
For purposes of this Section 8, each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of the Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of the Company and the Guarantor who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Company and the Guarantor shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company and the Guarantor, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (d). Any party entitled to contribution will, promptly after receipt of notice of commencement of any action, suit or proceeding against such party in respect of which a claim for contribution may be made against another party or parties under this paragraph (d), notify such party or parties from whom contribution may be sought, but the omission to so notify such party or parties shall not relieve the party or parties from whom contribution may be sought from any other obligation it or they may have hereunder or otherwise than under this paragraph (d).
Section 9. . If any one or more Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Securities agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter or Underwriters hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the amount of Securities set forth opposite their names in Schedule II hereto bears to the aggregate amount of Securities set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase; , , that in the event that the aggregate amount of Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate amount of Securities set forth in Schedule II hereto, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Securities, and if such non-defaulting Underwriters do not purchase all the Securities, this Agreement will terminate without liability to any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company or the Guarantor. In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 9, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding seven days, as the Representative shall determine in order that the required changes in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Company and any non-defaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder.
Default by an Underwriter
provided
however
Section 10. . This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Representative, by notice given to the Company and the Guarantor prior to delivery of and payment for the Securities, if prior to such time (i) trading in the Guarantor's Common Stock shall have been suspended by the Commission or The New York Stock Exchange or trading in securities generally on The New York Stock Exchange shall have been suspended or limited or minimum prices shall have been established on such exchange, (ii) a banking moratorium shall have been declared either by Federal, New York State or Pennsylvania authorities or (iii) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war or other calamity or crisis, economic or otherwise, the effect

of which on the financial markets of the United States or any foreign jurisdiction in which the Securities are to be marketed is such as to make it, in the judgment of the Representative, impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offering, sale or delivery of the Securities.
Section 11. . The respective agreements, representations, warranties, indemnities and other statements of the Company, the Guarantor or their respective officers and of the Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or the Company or the Guarantor or any of the officers, directors or controlling persons referred to in Section 8 hereof, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Securities. The provisions of Sections 7 and 8 hereof shall survive the termination or cancellation of this Agreement.

OR SUCH OTHER NAME AS REQUESTED BY AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DEPOSITORY TRUST COMPANY AND ANY PAYMENT IS MADE TO CEDE & CO., ANY TRANSFER, PLEDGE OR OTHER USE HEREOF FOR VALUE OR OTHERWISE BY OR TO ANY PERSON IS WRONGFUL SINCE THE REGISTERED OWNER HEREOF, CEDE & CO., HAS AN INTEREST HEREIN.
NEITHER THIS NOTE NOR THE GUARANTEE INCLUDED HEREIN IS A BANK DEPOSIT OR INSURED BY THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION OR BY ANY OTHER INSURER OR GOVERNMENTAL AGENCY.
THE INDENTURE, DATED AS OF DECEMBER 1, 1991, RELATING TO THIS SECURITY, HAS BEEN AMENDED BY A SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURE, DATED AS OF FEBRUARY 15, 1993, AND FURTHER AMENDED BY A SECOND SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURE, DATED AS OF FEBRUARY 15, 2000.
 
PNC FUNDING CORP, a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of Pennsylvania (herein called the "Company," which term includes any successor corporation under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), for value received, hereby promises to pay to CEDE & Co., or registered assigns, the principal sum of Five Hundred Million Dollars on June 12, 2009, and to pay interest thereon from June 12, 2007, or from the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, monthly in arrears on the 12th day of each month, commencing July 12, 2007 (each an "Interest Payment Date"), and at maturity, at a floating rate of LIBOR plus 0.02%, until the principal hereof is paid or made available for payment, and (to the extent that the payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable) at the same rate per annum on any overdue principal and premium and on any overdue installment of interest. Interest shall accrue from June 12, 2007 to, but excluding the first Interest Payment Date and then from, and including, the immediately preceding Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for to, but excluding, the next Interest Payment Date or the maturity date, as the case may be. Each of these periods is referred to as in "interest period." Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year for the actual number of days elapsed. The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date, subject to certain exceptions, will, as provided in such Indenture, be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest, which shall be the fifteenth calendar day, whether or not a Business day, as the case may be, next preceding such Interest Payment Date. However, interest payable on the maturity date will be paid to the person to whom the principal will be payable. Any such interest not so punctually paid or duly provided for will forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on such Regular Record Date and may either be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the Trustee, notice whereof shall be given to holders of the Securities not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date, or be paid at any time in any other lawful manner acceptable to the Trustee and not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Securities may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in said Indenture.
The interest rate on the Notes will be calculated by the calculation agent, except that the interest rate in effect for the period from June 12, 2007 to July 12, 2007 (the "initial interest rate") will be established by the Company as the rate for deposits in U.S. dollars having a maturity of one month commencing on June 12, 2007 that appears on Bloomberg Page BBAM1 as of 11:00 a.m., London time, on June 8, 2007, plus 0.02%. If no rate appears on Bloomberg Page BBAM1, as specified in the preceding sentence, then the initial interest rate will be determined by PNC Funding in the manner described in clause (ii) below, except that the banks referred to in such clause will be selected by PNC Funding rather than the calculation agent.
The calculation agent will reset the interest rate with respect to the Notes on each interest payment date, each of which is referred to as an "interest reset date." The second London business day preceding an interest reset date will be the "interest determination date" for that interest reset date. The interest rate in effect on each date that is not an interest reset date will be
 
the interest rate determined as of the interest determination date pertaining to the immediately preceding interest reset date. The interest rate in effect on any day that is an interest reset date will be the interest rate determined as of the interest determination date pertaining to that interest reset date, except that the interest rate in effect for the period from and including June 12, 2007 to July 12, 2007, the initial interest reset date, will be the initial interest rate.
If an interest payment date and an interest reset date for the Notes (other than an interest payment date at maturity) falls on a day that is not a business day, that interest payment date and interest reset date will be postponed to the following business day, except that if the following business day is in the following calendar month, that interest payment date and interest reset date will be the preceding business day.
If an interest payment date at maturity or a maturity date for the Notes falls on a day that is not a business day, PNC Funding will postpone the maturity date and corresponding interest payment date at maturity to the next succeeding business day, but the payments made on such dates will be treated as being made on the date that the payment was first due and the holders of the Notes will not be entitled to any future interest or other payments with respect to such postponements.
"LIBOR" will be determined by the calculation agent in accordance with the following provisions:
 
 
 
"Bloomberg Page BBAM1" means the display designated as "Page BBAM1" on the Bloomberg Service or any successor service, for the purpose of displaying the London interbank offered rates for U.S. dollar deposits.
"Business day" means any day on which dealings in the United States dollars are transacted in the London interbank market (a "London business day"), except a Saturday, a Sunday, or a legal holiday in The City of New York or The City of Pittsburgh on which banking institutions are authorized or obligated by law, regulation, or executive order to close.
This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (herein called the "Securities" or "Notes"), issued and to be issued in one or more series under an Indenture, dated as of December 1, 1991, among the Company, PNC Financial Corp (also known as "PNC Bank Corp." and now known as "The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.") (the "Guarantor") and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (formerly known as The Chase Manhattan Bank and Chemical Bank, successor by merger to Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company), as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee," which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture) as amended by a Supplemental Indenture dated as of February 15, 1993 by and among the Company, the Guarantor and the Trustee, and as further amended by a Second Supplemental Indenture dated as of February 15, 2000 by and among the Company, the Guarantor and the Trustee (such Indenture as amended being herein called the "Indenture"), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Security is one of the series designated above, initially issued in the aggregate principal amount of $500,000,000, and is subject to additional issuances as the Company may determine or as provided for in the Indenture.
The Securities of this series are not redeemable prior to their stated maturity and are not subject to any sinking fund.
If an Event of Default (as defined in the Indenture) with respect to the Securities shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Securities may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee hereinafter referred to, by manual signature, this Security shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.
The indebtedness of the Company evidenced by the Securities of this series, including the principal thereof and interest thereon, is, to the extent and in the manner set forth in the Indenture, senior in right of payment to its obligations to holders of Subordinated Debt Securities and Existing Company Subordinated Indebtedness (each as defined in the Indenture) and shall rank in right of payment with each other and with Senior Company Indebtedness (as defined in the Indenture), as provided in the Indenture, and each Holder of Securities, by the acceptance hereof, agrees to and shall be bound by such provisions of the Indenture.
pari passu
The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the Guarantor and the rights of the holders of the Securities of any series under the Indenture at any
 
time by the Company, the Guarantor and the Trustee with the consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Securities of all series (voting as one class) to be affected by such amendment or modification. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the holders of specified percentages in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series, on behalf of the holders of all Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company or the Guarantor with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such holder and upon all future holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Security at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
The Securities are issuable only in registered form without coupons in denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiple thereof. This Security is a global security, represented by one or more permanent global certificates registered in the name of the nominee of The Depository Trust Company (each a "Global Note" and collectively, the "Global Notes"). Accordingly, unless and until it is exchanged in whole or in part for individual certificates evidencing the Securities represented hereby, this Security may not be transferred except as a whole by The Depositary Trust Company (the "Depositary") to a nominee of such Depositary or by a nominee of such Depositary or by the Depositary or any nominee to a successor Depositary or any nominee of such successor. Ownership of beneficial interests in this Security will be shown on, and the transfer of that ownership will be effected only through, records maintained by the applicable Depositary or its nominee (with respect to interest of persons that have accounts with the Depositary ("Participants") and the records of Participants (with respect to interests of persons other than Participants)). Beneficial interests in Securities by persons that hold through Participants will be evidenced only by, and transfers of such beneficial interests with such Participants will be effected only through, records maintained by such Participants. The laws of some states require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of such securities in definitive form. Such limits and such laws may impair the ability to transfer beneficial interests in this Security. Except as provided below, owners of beneficial interests in this Security will not be entitled to have any individual certificates and will not be considered the owners or Holders thereof under the Indenture.
Except in the limited circumstances set forth herein, Participants and owners of beneficial interests in the Global Notes will not be entitled to receive Securities in definitive form and will not be considered holders of Securities. If the Depositary is at any time unwilling, unable or ineligible to continue as Depositary and a successor Depositary is not appointed by the Company within 90 days, or an event of default has occurred and is continuing, and the Depositary requests the issuance of certificated notes, the Company will issue individual certificates evidencing the Securities represented hereby in definitive form in exchange for this Security in registered form to each person that the Depositary identifies as the beneficial owner of the Securities represented by the Global Notes upon surrender by the Depositary of the Global Notes. In addition, the Company may at any time and in its sole discretion determine not to have any Securities represented by one or more global securities and, in such event, will issue individual certificates evidencing Securities in definitive form in exchange for this Security. In any such instance, an owner of a beneficial interest in a Security will be entitled to physical delivery in certificated form of Securities equal in principal amount to such beneficial interest and to have such Securities registered in its name. Securities so issued in certificated form will be issued in denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiple thereof and will be issued in
 
registered form only, without coupons. Neither the Company nor the principal paying agent will be liable for any delay by the Depositary, its nominee or any direct or indirect participant in identifying the beneficial owners of the related Securities. The Company and the principal payment agent may conclusively rely on, and will be protected in relying on, instructions from the Depositary or its nominee for all purposes, including with respect to the registration and delivery, and the respective principal amounts, of the Securities to be issued.
Except as provided herein, beneficial owners of Global Notes will not be entitled to receive physical delivery of Securities in definitive form and no Global Note will be exchangeable except for another Global Note of like denomination and tenor to be registered in the name of the Depositary or its nominee. Accordingly, each person owning a beneficial interest in a Global Note must rely on the procedures of the Depositary and, if such person is not a Participant, on the procedures of the Participant through which such person owns its interest, to exercise any rights of a holder under the Securities.
Beneficial interests in the Global Notes will be represented through book-entry accounts of financial institutions acting on behalf of beneficial owners as direct and indirect participants in the Depositary. Investors may elect to hold interests in the Global Notes through the Depositary, either directly if they are Participants of such system or indirectly through organizations that are Participants in such system.
The laws of some jurisdictions may require that purchasers of securities take physical delivery of those securities in definitive form. Accordingly, the ability to transfer interests in the Securities represented by a Global Note to those persons may be limited. In addition, because the Depositary can act only on behalf of its Participants, who in turn act on behalf of persons who hold interests through Participants, the ability of a person having an interest in Securities represented by a Global Note to pledge or transfer such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the Depositary's system, or otherwise to take actions in respect of such interest, may be affected by the lack of a physical definitive security in respect of such interest.
Neither the Company, the Trustee, the principal paying agent nor any Security Registrar will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of Securities by the Depositary, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records of the Depositary relating to the Securities.
The Bank of New York will act as the Company's principal paying agent with respect to the Securities through its offices presently located at 101 Barclay Street8W, New York, New York 10286. The Company may at any time rescind the designation of a paying agent, appoint a successor paying agent, or approve a change in the office through which any paying agent acts. Payments of interest and principal may be made by wire-transfer in immediately available funds for Securities held in book-entry form or, at the Company's option in the event the Securities are not represented by Global Notes, by check mailed to the address of the person entitled to the payment as it appears in the Security register. Payment of principal will be made upon the surrender of the relevant Securities at the offices of the principal paying agent.
Notices to the holders of registered Securities will be mailed to them at their respective addresses in the register of the Securities and will be deemed to have been given on the fourth weekday (being a day other than Saturday or Sunday) after the date of mailing.
The Indenture contains provisions setting forth certain conditions to the institution of proceedings by the holders of Securities with respect to the Indenture or for any remedy under the Indenture.
 
All terms used in this Security which are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, PNC Funding Corp has caused this Note to be signed in its name by its Chairman of the Board, President or any Executive or Senior Vice President, and by its Secretary or an Assistant Secretary, or by facsimiles of any of their signatures, and its corporate seal, or a facsimile thereof, to be hereto affixed.
