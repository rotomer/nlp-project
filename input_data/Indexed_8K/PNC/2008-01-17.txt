Glossary of Terms
Net domestic and foreign fund investment assets for which we provide accounting and administration services. We do not include these assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Accounting/administration net fund assets
Primarily comprised of total average quarterly (or annual) assets plus (less) unrealized losses (gains) on available-for-sale debt securities, less goodwill and certain other intangible assets (net of eligible deferred taxes).
Adjusted average total assets
Adjusted to reflect a full year of activity.
Annualized
Assets over which we have sole or shared investment authority for our customers/clients. We do not include these assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Assets under management
One hundredth of a percentage point.
Basis point
Process of removing a loan or portion of a loan from our balance sheet because it is considered uncollectible. We also record a charge-off when a loan is transferred to held for sale by reducing the carrying amount by the allowance for loan losses associated with such loan or if the market value is less than its carrying amount.
Charge-off
Common shareholders' equity divided by total assets. Common shareholders' equity equals total shareholders' equity less the liquidation value of preferred stock.
Common shareholders' equity to total assets
The difference in yield between debt issues of similar maturity. The excess of yield attributable to credit spread is often used as a measure of relative creditworthiness, with a reduction in the credit spread reflecting an improvement in the borrower's perceived creditworthiness.
Credit spread
Investment assets held on behalf of clients under safekeeping arrangements. We do not include these assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Investment assets held in custody at other institutions on our behalf are included in the appropriate asset categories on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as if physically held by us.
Custody assets
Financial contracts whose value is derived from publicly traded securities, interest rates, currency exchange rates or market indices. Derivatives cover a wide assortment of financial contracts, including forward contracts, futures, options and swaps.
Derivatives
An estimate of the rate sensitivity of our economic value of equity. A negative duration of equity is associated with asset sensitivity ( positioned for rising interest rates), while a positive value implies liability sensitivity ( positioned for declining interest rates). For example, if the duration of equity is +1.5 years, the economic value of equity declines by 1.5% for each 100 basis point increase in interest rates.
Duration of equity
i.e.,
i.e.,
Assets that generate income, which include: federal funds sold; resale agreements; other short-term investments, including trading securities; loans held for sale; loans, net of unearned income; securities; and certain other assets.
Earning assets
Represents the amount of resources that a business segment should hold to guard against potentially large losses that could cause insolvency. It is based on a measurement of economic risk, as opposed to risk as defined by regulatory bodies. The economic capital measurement process involves converting a risk distribution to the capital that is required to support the risk, consistent with our target credit rating. As such, economic risk serves as a "common currency" of risk that allows us to compare different risks on a similar basis.
Economic capital
A measurement, expressed in years, that, when multiplied by a change in interest rates, would approximate the percentage change in value of on- and off-balance sheet positions.
Effective duration
 
Glossary of Terms (continued)
Noninterest expense divided by the sum of net interest income (GAAP basis) and noninterest income.
Efficiency
A management accounting methodology designed to recognize the net interest income effects of sources and uses of funds provided by the assets and liabilities of a business segment. We assign these balances LIBOR-based funding rates at origination that represent the interest cost for us to raise/invest funds with similar maturity and repricing structures.
Funds transfer pricing
Contracts in which the buyer agrees to purchase and the seller agrees to deliver a specific financial instrument at a predetermined price or yield. May be settled either in cash or by delivery of the underlying financial instrument.
Futures and forward contracts
Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
GAAP
Tier 1 risk-based capital divided by adjusted average total assets.
Leverage ratio
A management accounting assessment, using funds transfer pricing methodology, of the net interest contribution from loans and deposits.
Net interest income from loans and deposits
Annualized taxable-equivalent net interest income divided by average earning assets.
Net interest margin
Assets we hold for our customers/clients in a non-discretionary, custodial capacity. We do not include these assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Nondiscretionary assets under administration
Noninterest income divided by the sum of net interest income (GAAP basis) and noninterest income.
Noninterest income to total revenue
Nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans, troubled debt restructured loans, foreclosed assets and other assets. We do not accrue interest income on assets classified as nonperforming.
Nonperforming assets
Nonperforming loans include loans to commercial, commercial real estate, equipment lease financing, consumer, and residential mortgage customers as well as troubled debt restructured loans. Nonperforming loans do not include loans held for sale or foreclosed and other assets. We do not accrue interest income on loans classified as nonperforming.
Nonperforming loans
 A number of currency units, shares, or other units specified in a derivatives contract.
Notional amount
The period to period percentage change in total revenue (GAAP basis) less the percentage change in noninterest expense. A positive percentage indicates that revenue growth exceeded expense growth ( positive operating leverage) while a negative percentage implies expense growth exceeded revenue growth ( negative operating leverage).
Operating leverage
i.e.,
i.e.,
Cash proceeds received on a loan that we had previously charged off. We credit the amount received to the allowance for loan and lease losses.
Recovery
Annualized net income divided by average capital.
Return on average capital
Annualized net income divided by average assets.
Return on average assets
Annualized net income divided by average common shareholders' equity.
Return on average common equity
Primarily computed by the assignment of specific risk-weights (as defined by The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System) to assets and off-balance sheet instruments.
Risk-weighted assets
The process of legally transforming financial assets into securities.
Securitization
 
Glossary of Terms (continued)
Period-end common shareholders' equity less goodwill and other intangible assets (net of eligible deferred taxes), and excluding loan servicing rights, divided by period-end assets less goodwill and other intangible assets (net of eligible deferred taxes), and excluding loan servicing rights.
Tangible common equity ratio
The interest income earned on certain assets is completely or partially exempt from federal income tax. As such, these tax-exempt instruments typically yield lower returns than taxable investments. To provide more meaningful comparisons of yields and margins for all interest-earning assets, we also provide revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis by increasing the interest income earned on tax-exempt assets to make it fully equivalent to interest income earned on other taxable investments. This adjustment is not permitted under GAAP on the Consolidated Income Statement.
Taxable-equivalent interest
Tier 1 risk-based capital equals: total shareholders' equity, plus trust preferred capital securities, plus certain minority interests that are held by others; less goodwill and certain other intangible assets (net of eligible deferred taxes), less equity investments in nonfinancial companies and less net unrealized holding losses on available-for-sale equity securities. Net unrealized holding gains on available-for-sale equity securities, net unrealized holding gains (losses) on available-for-sale debt securities and net unrealized holding gains (losses) on cash flow hedge derivatives are excluded from total shareholders' equity for Tier 1 risk-based capital purposes.
Tier 1 risk-based capital
Tier 1 risk-based capital divided by period-end risk-weighted assets.
Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio
Total domestic and offshore fund investment assets for which we provide related processing services. We do not include these assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Total fund assets serviced
A non-traditional swap where one party agrees to pay the other the "total return" of a defined underlying asset (., a loan), usually in return for receiving a stream of LIBOR-based cash flows. The total returns of the asset, including interest and any default shortfall, are passed through to the counterparty. The counterparty is therefore assuming the credit and economic risk of the underlying asset.
Total return swap
e.g
Tier 1 risk-based capital plus qualifying subordinated debt and trust preferred securities, other minority interest not qualified as Tier 1, and the allowance for loan and lease losses, subject to certain limitations.
Total risk-based capital
Total risk-based capital divided by period-end risk-weighted assets.
Total risk-based capital ratio
The sum of money market and interest-bearing demand deposits and demand and other noninterest-bearing deposits.
Transaction deposits
A graph showing the relationship between the yields on financial instruments or market indices of the same credit quality with different maturities. For example, a "normal" or "positive" yield curve exists when long-term bonds have higher yields than short-term bonds. A "flat" yield curve exists when yields are the same for short-term and long-term bonds. A "steep" yield curve exists when yields on long-term bonds are significantly higher than on short-term bonds. An "inverted" or "negative" yield curve exists when short-term bonds have higher yields than long-term bonds.
Yield curve

Adjusted Condensed Consolidated Income Statement Reconciliations
 
 
Our payment services business issues and acquires credit and debit card transactions through Visa U.S.A. Inc. card association or its affiliates ("Visa"). In October 2007, Visa completed a restructuring and issued shares of Visa Inc. common stock to its financial institution members in contemplation of its initial public offering ("IPO") currently anticipated in the first quarter of 2008 (the "Visa Reorganization"). As part of the Visa Reorganization, we received our proportionate share of a class of Visa Inc. common stock allocated to the U.S. members. Visa expects that a portion of these shares will be redeemed for cash out of the proceeds of the IPO. The U.S. members are obligated to indemnify Visa for judgments and settlements related to specified litigation. Visa will set aside a portion of the proceeds from the IPO in an escrow account for the benefit of the U.S. member financial institutions to fund the expenses of the litigation as well as the members' proportionate share of any judgments or settlements that may arise out of the litigation. In accordance with GAAP, we recorded a liability and operating expense totaling $82 million before taxes in the fourth quarter of 2007 representing our estimate of the fair value of our indemnification obligation for potential losses arising from this litigation. Our estimate is based on publicly available information and other information made available to all of the affected Visa members and does not reflect any direct knowledge of the relative strengths and weaknesses of the litigation still pending or the status of any on-going settlement discussions. We believe that the IPO will be completed and cash will be available through the escrow to satisfy litigation settlements. In addition, based on estimates provided by Visa regarding its planned IPO, we believe that our ownership interest in Visa has a value significantly in excess of our indemnification liability. Our Visa shares will not generally be transferable until they can be converted into shares of the publicly traded class of stock, which cannot happen until the later of three years after the IPO or settlement of all of the specified litigation.
Adjusted information supplements our results as reported in accordance with GAAP and should not be viewed in isolation from, or as a substitute for, our GAAP results. Our 2006 Form 10-K includes additional information regarding our accounting for the BlackRock/MLIM transaction and the BlackRock LTIP shares obligation. Our 2007 Form 10-Qs provide additional information regarding integration costs. The absence of other adjustments is not intended to imply that there could not have been other similar types of adjustments, but any such adjustments would not have been similar in magnitude to the amount of the adjustments shown.
