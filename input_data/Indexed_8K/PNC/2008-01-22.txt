2006 Incentive Award Plan  2008 Performance Unit Grants
On January 15, 2008, the Personnel and Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors granted incentive performance unit award opportunities to certain senior PNC officers. The named executive officers from last year's proxy statement all received grants.
The Committee authorized these grants under our shareholder-approved 2006 Incentive Award Plan. The Committee made similar grants under this plan in 2007.
The grants of performance units are denominated in shares, not dollars. Each grantee receives a target number of "share units." Any final payout will be expressed as a percentage of target and may exceed target. A grantee will not receive a final payout unless PNC achieves corporate performance goals. The performance period for the grants begins on January 1, 2008 and ends on December 31, 2010. In early 2011, the Committee will determine whether any final payouts will occur. The Committee retains the ability to reduce payouts.
In the first quarter of 2008, the Committee will approve the corporate performance goals and a comparison peer group. The Committee will also approve additional terms and conditions for these grants, including how a change in control would impact these grants.
The target share units granted to each of the five executive officers named in last year's proxy statement are:
James E. Rohr  Principal Executive Officer (40,000)
Richard J. Johnson  Principal Financial Officer (9,000)
Joseph C. Guyaux (16,000)
William S. Demchak (16,000)
Timothy G. Shack (13,000)
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
