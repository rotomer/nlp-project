The Corporation and the Trust will use their best efforts to prevent the issuance of any such stop order and, if issued, to obtain as soon as possible the withdrawal thereof.
(b) If, at any time when a prospectus relating to the Securities is required to be delivered (or in lieu thereof, the notice referred to in Rule 173(a) under the Act) under the Act, any event occurs as a result of which the Final Prospectus as then supplemented would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein in the light of the circumstances under which they were made not misleading, or if it shall be necessary to amend the Registration Statement or supplement the Final Prospectus to comply with the Act or the Exchange Act or the respective rules thereunder, the Corporation and the Trust promptly will (i) advise the Underwriters promptly of the happening of such event, (ii) prepare and file with the Commission, at the Corporation's expense, subject to the first sentence of paragraph (a) of this Section 3, an amendment or supplement which will correct such statement or omission or effect such compliance.

(f) During the period beginning on the date hereof and continuing to and including the date 30 days after the date hereof, the Corporation and the Trust will not, without the consent of the Representatives, offer, sell, contract to sell, announce the offering or otherwise dispose of any Preferred Securities, any other beneficial interests in the assets of the Trust, or any preferred securities or any other securities of the Trust, the Corporation or any other trust which are substantially similar to the Preferred Securities, including any guarantee of any such securities, or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for or representing the right to receive any such securities.
(g) During the period when the Preferred Securities are outstanding, the Corporation will not be or become an open-end investment company, unit investment trust or face-amount certificate company that is or is required to be registered under Section 8 of the Investment Company Act.

Preferred Securities, (vi) any filing for review of the public offering of the Preferred Securities by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority and (vii) the fees and disbursements of the Trustee. It is understood, however, that, except as provided in (iii) above and Section 6 hereof, the Underwriters will pay all of their own costs and expenses, including the fees of their counsel, any transfer taxes, and any advertising expenses connected with any offers they may make. In no event shall the Corporation or the Trust be liable to the Underwriters for loss of anticipated profits from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(i) on the basis of a reading of the latest unaudited consolidated financial statements made available by the Corporation and its subsidiaries; carrying out certain specified procedures (but not an audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards) which would not necessarily reveal matters of significance with respect to the comments set forth in such letter; a reading of the minutes of the meetings of the shareholders and directors of the Corporation and the audit and executive committees thereof and inquiries of certain officials of the Corporation who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters of the Corporation and its subsidiaries as to transactions and events subsequent to the date of the most recent audited consolidated financial statements in or incorporated in the Final Prospectus, nothing came to their attention which caused them to believe that: (1) any unaudited consolidated financial statements included or incorporated in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus do not comply in form in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and with the published rules and regulations of the Commission with respect to the financial statements included or incorporated in quarterly reports on Form 10-Q
under the Exchange Act; and said unaudited consolidated financial statements are not in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a basis substantially consistent with that of the audited consolidated financial statements included or incorporated in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus; or (2) with respect to the period subsequent to the date of the most recent audited or unaudited consolidated financial statements incorporated in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus, there were, at a specified date not more than five business days prior to the date of the letter, any increases in borrowed funds of the Corporation and its subsidiaries or any decreases in the capital stock (defined as each of the individual dollar amounts of preferred stock, common stock, and capital surplus) of the Corporation or the stockholders' equity of the Corporation as compared with the amounts shown on the most recent consolidated balance sheet incorporated in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus, or for the period from the date of the most recent audited or unaudited consolidated financial statements incorporated in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus to such specified date there were any decreases, as compared with the corresponding period in the preceding year, in total or per share amounts of consolidated net income of the Corporation or consolidated net interest income except in all instances for changes or decreases set forth in such letter, in which case the letter shall be accompanied by an explanation by the Corporation as to the significance thereof unless said explanation is not deemed necessary by the Representatives; and
(ii) they have performed certain other specified procedures as a result of which they determined that certain information of an accounting, financial or statistical nature (which is limited to accounting, financial or statistical information derived from the general accounting records of the Corporation and its subsidiaries) set forth in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus, including the information included in the "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" included or incorporated in the Corporation's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, incorporated in the Registration Statement and Final Prospectus, agrees with the accounting records of the Corporation and its subsidiaries, excluding any questions of legal interpretation.

change or decrease specified in the letter or letters referred to in paragraphs (h) and (i) of this Section 5 or (ii) any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the business or properties of the Corporation and its subsidiaries the effect of which, in any case referred to in clause (i) or (ii) above, is, in the judgment of the Representatives, so material and adverse as to make it impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or the delivery of the Preferred Securities as contemplated by the Registration Statement (exclusive of any amendment thereof), the Pricing Disclosure Package (exclusive of any supplement thereto) and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto).
(k) The Preferred Securities shall have received a rating from each of Moody's Investor Service, Inc. and Standard & Poor's Rating Services.

(m) At the Closing Date, the Preferred Securities shall have been approved for listing on The New York Stock Exchange, subject only to official notice of issuance, or the Corporation and the Trust shall have filed a preliminary listing application and all required supporting documents with respect to the Preferred Securities with The New York Stock Exchange.

provided
however

officers who signs the Registration Statement, and each person who controls the Corporation or the Trust within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Corporation and the Trust to each Underwriter, but only with reference to written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Corporation and the Trust by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for use in the preparation of the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which any Underwriter may otherwise have. The Corporation and the Trust acknowledge that the statements set forth in the last paragraph of the cover page, and under the heading "Underwriting" (i) the list of Underwriters and their respective participation in the sale of the Securities, (ii) the sentences related to concessions and reallowances and (iii) the paragraphs related to stabilization and syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids in any Preliminary Final Prospectus or the Final Prospectus constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the several Underwriters for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity, and you, as the Representatives, confirm that such statements are correct.
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 7 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 7, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve it from any liability hereunder to the extent it is not materially prejudiced as a result thereof and in any event shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 7. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein, and to the extent that it may elect by written notice delivered to the indemnified party promptly after receiving the aforesaid notice from such indemnified party, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party; , , that if the defendants in any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, the indemnified party or parties shall have the right to select separate counsel to assert such legal defenses and to otherwise participate in the defense of such action on behalf of such indemnified party or parties. Upon receipt of notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense of such action and approval by the indemnified party of such counsel, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section 7 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof unless (i) the indemnified party shall have employed separate counsel in accordance with the proviso to the next preceding sentence (it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel (plus any local counsel), approved by the Representatives in the case of paragraph (a) of this Section 7, representing the indemnified parties under such paragraph (a) who are parties to such action), (ii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party
provided
however
to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of commencement of the action or (iii) the indemnifying party has authorized the employment of counsel for the indemnified party at the expense of the indemnifying party; and except that, if clause (i) or (iii) is applicable, such liability shall be only in respect of the counsel referred to in such clause (i) or (iii). No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution could be sought under this Section 7 (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
(d) In order to provide for just and equitable contribution in circumstances in which the indemnification provided for in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 7 is unavailable, the Corporation and the Trust, on the one hand, and the Underwriters severally, on the other hand, shall contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending same) to which the Corporation, the Trust and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject in proportion to the relative benefits received by the Corporation and the Trust on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities, such that the Underwriters are responsible for that portion represented by the percentage that the underwriting commission bears to the sum of such commission and the purchase price of the Preferred Securities specified in Schedule I hereto and the Corporation and the Trust are responsible for the balance; provided, however, that in no case shall any Underwriter (except as may be provided in any agreement among underwriters relating to the offering of the Preferred Securities) be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting commission applicable to the Preferred Securities purchased by such Underwriter hereunder. If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Corporation and the Trust, on the one hand, and the Underwriters severally, on the other, shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits as described in the immediately preceding sentence but also the relative fault of the Corporation and the Trust on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages and liabilities as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the Corporation or the Trust on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Corporation, the Trust and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no person guilty of fraudulent
misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 7, each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of the Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person who controls the Corporation within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of the Corporation and the Trust who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Corporation and the Trust shall have the same rights to contribution as the Corporation and the Trust, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (d). Any party entitled to contribution will, promptly after receipt of notice of commencement of any action, suit or proceeding against such party in respect of which a claim for contribution may be made against another party or parties under this paragraph (d), notify such party or parties from whom contribution may be sought, but the omission to so notify such party or parties shall not relieve the party or parties from whom contribution may be sought from any other obligation it or they may have hereunder or otherwise than under this paragraph (d).
Section 8. . If any one or more Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Preferred Securities agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter or Underwriters hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the amount of Preferred Securities set forth opposite their names in Schedule II hereto bears to the aggregate amount of Preferred Securities set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the Preferred Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase; , , that in the event that the aggregate amount of Preferred Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate liquidation amount of Preferred Securities set forth in Schedule II hereto, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Preferred Securities, and if such non defaulting Underwriters do not purchase all the Preferred Securities, this Agreement will terminate without liability to any non defaulting Underwriter or the Corporation or the Trust. In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 8, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding seven days, as the Representatives shall determine in order that the required changes in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Trust and any non defaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder.

(f) If no Successor Property Trustee or Successor Delaware Trustee shall have been appointed, as the case may be, and accepted appointment as provided in this Section 5.6 within 60 days after delivery to the Sponsor and the Trust of an instrument of resignation or removal, the resigning or removed Property Trustee or Delaware Trustee, as applicable, may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for appointment of a Successor Property Trustee or Successor Delaware Trustee.

Vacancies among Trustees
If a Trustee ceases to hold office for any reason and the number of Trustees is not reduced pursuant to Section 5.1, or if the number of Trustees is increased pursuant to Section 5.1, a vacancy shall occur.

Notices shall contain a brief statement of the time, place and anticipated purposes of the meeting. The presence (whether in person or by telephone or other communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in such meeting can hear each other) of a Regular Trustee at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting except where a Regular Trustee attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting to the transaction of any activity on the ground that the meeting has not been lawfully called or convened. Unless provided otherwise in this Declaration, any action of the Regular Trustees may be taken at a meeting by vote of a majority of the Regular Trustees present (whether in person or by telephone or other communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in such meeting can hear each other) and eligible to vote with respect to such matter, provided that a Quorum is present, or without a meeting by the unanimous written consent of the Regular Trustees.

Annex I
Annex I
 
The Certificates shall be signed on behalf of the Trust by a Regular Trustee. Such signature shall be the manual or facsimile signature of any present or any future Regular Trustee. In case any Regular Trustee of the Trust who shall have signed any of the Securities shall cease to be such Regular Trustee before the Certificates so signed shall be delivered by the Trust, such Certificates nevertheless may be delivered as though the person who signed such Certificates had not ceased to be such Regular Trustee; and any Certificate may be signed on behalf of the Trust by such persons who, at the actual date of execution of such Security, shall be the Regular Trustees of the Trust, although at the date of the execution and delivery of the Declaration any such person was not such a Regular Trustee. The Certificates so executed shall be delivered to the Property Trustee and upon such delivery the Property Trustee shall, upon receipt of a Company Order, authenticate either manually or by facsimile of the Sponsor such Certificates and deliver such Certificates upon the written order of the Sponsor, executed by an Authorized Officer thereof, without further corporate action by the Sponsor, in authorized denominations. Certificates shall be printed, lithographed or engraved or may be produced in any other manner as is reasonably acceptable to the Regular Trustees, as evidenced by their execution thereof, and may have such letters, numbers or other marks of identification or designation and such legends or endorsements as the Regular Trustees may deem (but which do not affect the rights, duties or responsibilities of the Property Trustee), or as may be required to comply with any law or with any rule or regulation of any stock exchange on which Securities may be listed, or to conform to usage. A Certificate representing Securities shall not be valid until authenticated by the manual or facsimile signature of an authorized officer of the Property Trustee. Such signature shall be conclusive evidence that such Certificate has been authenticated under this Declaration.
The Property Trustee may appoint an authenticating agent acceptable to the Trust to authenticate Certificates. An authenticating agent may authenticate Certificates whenever the Property Trustee may do so. Each reference in this Declaration to authentication by the Property Trustee includes authentication by such agent. An authenticating agent has the same rights as the Property Trustee to deal with the Sponsor or an Affiliate of the Sponsor.
(b) The consideration received by the Trust for the issuance of the Securities shall constitute a contribution to the capital of the Trust and shall not constitute a loan to the Trust.
(c) Upon issuance of the Securities as provided in this Declaration, the Securities so issued shall be deemed to be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable.
(d) Every Person, by virtue of having become a Holder or a Trust Preferred Security Beneficial Owner in accordance with the terms of this Declaration, shall be deemed to have expressly assented and agreed to the terms of, and shall be bound by, this Declaration.

(iv) subject to obtaining any required regulatory approval, when all of the Securities have been called for redemption and the amounts necessary for redemption thereof have been paid to the Holders in accordance with the terms of the Securities;
(v) subject to obtaining any required regulatory approval, when the Trust shall have been dissolved in accordance with the terms of the Securities upon election by the Sponsor of its right to terminate the Trust and distribute all of the JSNs to the Holders of Securities in exchange for all of the Securities and all of the JSNs shall have been distributed to the Holders of Securities in accordance with such election; or
(vi) before the issuance of any Securities, with the consent of all of the Regular Trustees and the Sponsor.
(b) Except as contemplated by Section 8.2, as soon as is practicable after the occurrence of an event referred to in Section 8.1(a), and after satisfaction of liabilities to creditors of the Trust as required by applicable law, including Section 3808 of the Statutory Trust Act, and subject to the terms set forth in Annex I, the Property Trustee, when notified in writing of the completion of the winding up of the Trust in accordance with the Statutory Trust Act, shall terminate the Trust by filing, at the expense and direction of the Sponsor, a certificate of cancellation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware.
(c) The provisions of Section 3.13 and Article X shall survive the termination of the Trust.
SECTION 8.2 .
Liquidation
(a) If an event specified in clauses (a)(i), (a)(ii), (a)(iii) or (a)(v) of Section 8.1 occurs, the Trust shall be wound up and liquidated by the Property Trustee as expeditiously as the Property Trustee determines to be possible by distributing, after paying or making reasonable provision to pay all claims and obligations of the Trust in accordance with Section 3808(e) of the Delaware Statutory Trust Act, to each Holder a number of JSNs (the "Like Amount") with an aggregate stated principal amount equal to the aggregate Liquidation Amount of the outstanding Securities and bearing accrued and unpaid interest in an amount equal to the accrued and unpaid Distributions on such Securities, subject to Section 8.2(d). Notice of liquidation shall be provided by the Sponsor to the Property Trustee at least five Business Days prior to the date the Property Trustee proposes to mail the notice of liquidation. Notice of liquidation shall be given by the Property Trustee by first-class mail, postage prepaid, mailed not later than 15 nor more than 45 days prior to the Liquidation Date to each Holder of Trust Securities at such Holder's address appearing in the Securities Register. All notices of liquidation shall:
(i) state the Liquidation Date;
 
(ii) state that, from and after the Liquidation Date, the Securities will no longer be deemed to be outstanding and any Certificates not surrendered for exchange will be deemed to represent a Like Amount of JSNs; and
(iii) provide such information with respect to the mechanics by which Holders may exchange Certificates for JSNs, or if Section 8.2(d) applies, receive a Liquidation Distribution, as the Administrators or the Property Trustee shall deem appropriate.
(b) Except where Section 8.2(d) applies, in order to effect the liquidation of the Trust and distribution of the JSNs to Holders, the Property Trustee shall establish a record date for such distribution (which shall be not more than 30 days prior to the Liquidation Date) and, either itself acting as exchange agent or through the appointment of a separate exchange agent, shall establish such procedures as it shall deem appropriate to effect the distribution of JSNs in exchange for the outstanding Certificates.
(c) Except where Section 8.2(d) applies, after the Liquidation Date, (i) the Trust Preferred Securities and Trust Common Securities will no longer be deemed to be outstanding, (ii) the Clearing Agency for the Trust Preferred Securities or its nominee, as the registered holder of the Global Certificates, shall receive a registered Global Certificate or Global Certificates representing the JSNs to be delivered upon such distribution with respect to Trust Preferred Securities held by the Clearing Agency or its nominee, (iii) any Trust Preferred Securities Certificates not held by the Clearing Agency for the Trust Preferred Securities or its nominee as specified in clause (ii) above will be deemed to represent JSNs having a principal amount equal to the stated Liquidation Amount of the Trust Preferred Securities represented thereby and bearing accrued and unpaid interest in an amount equal to the accumulated and unpaid Distributions on such Trust Preferred Securities until such certificates are presented to the Securities Registrar for transfer or reissuance, and (iv) all rights of the Holders will cease, except the right to receive JSNs pursuant to Section 8.2(a).
(d) If, notwithstanding the other provisions of this Section 8.2 distribution of the JSNs is not practical (whether because of an order for dissolution entered by a court of competent jurisdiction or otherwise), or if any dissolution event specified in clause (a)(iv) of Section 8.1 occurs, the Trust shall be dissolved and wound up and the Trust Property shall be liquidated by the Property Trustee in such manner as the Property Trustee determines subject to the requirements of applicable law. In such event, on the date of the dissolution of the Trust, unless the Securities have been redeemed or are to be redeemed on such date pursuant to Article VI, Holders will be entitled to receive out of the assets of the Trust available for distribution to Holders, after paying or making reasonable provision to pay all claims and obligations of the Trust in accordance with Section 3808(e) of the Statutory Trust Act, an amount equal to the aggregate of Liquidation Amount per Security plus accumulated and unpaid Distributions thereon to but excluding the date of payment (such amount being the "Liquidation Distribution"). If, upon any such dissolution, the Liquidation Distribution can be paid only in part because the Trust has insufficient assets available to pay in full the aggregate Liquidation Distribution, then, subject to the next succeeding sentence, the amounts payable by the Trust on the Securities shall be paid on a basis (based upon Liquidation Amounts). The Holders of the Trust Common Securities will be entitled to receive Liquidation Distributions upon any such dissolution (determined as aforesaid) with
pro rata
pro rata
 
Holders of Trust Preferred Securities except that the Trust Preferred Securities shall have a priority over the Trust Common Securities.
(e) If Section 8.2(d) applies, then after the date of dissolution of the Trust pursuant to Section 8.2(d), (i) the Trust Preferred Securities and Trust Common Securities will no longer be deemed to be outstanding, and (ii) all rights of the Holders will cease, except the right to receive the Liquidation Distribution in accordance with Section 8.2(d).
(f) If JSNs are distributed to the Holders of Securities, the Sponsor shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the JSNs to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange or on such other exchange as the Trust Preferred Securities were listed immediately prior to distribution of the JSNs.
SECTION 9.1 .
Transfer of Securities
(a) The Property Trustee shall designate, with the consent of the Regular Trustees, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, an office or offices or agency or agencies where Trust Preferred Security Certificates may be surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange and where notices and demands to or upon the Trustees in respect of the Trust Preferred Security Certificates and the Trust Common Security Certificates may be served (the "Corporate Trust Office"). The Property Trustee initially designates its Corporate Trust Office at 101 Barclay Street, Floor 8 West, New York, NY 10286, Attention: Corporate Trust Administration, as its Corporate Trust Office for such purposes, which Corporate Trust Office the Regular Trustees hereby consent to. The Property Trustee shall give prompt written notice to the Sponsor, the Regular Trustees and to the Holders of any change in the location of any such office or agency. The Sponsor may at any time rescind or approve a change in the designation of or the location of the Corporate Trust Office. However, the Trust will be required to maintain a Corporate Trust Office.
(b) The Property Trustee shall act as the registrar and transfer agent (the "Securities Registrar") for the purpose of registering the Securities and transfers and exchanges of the Securities. The Property Trustee shall keep or cause to be kept at its Corporate Trust Office a register or registers for the purpose of registering Trust Preferred Security Certificates and transfers and exchanges of Trust Preferred Security Certificates in which the registrar and transfer agent with respect to the Trust Preferred Securities (the "Securities Register"), subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, shall provide for the registration of Trust Preferred Security Certificates and Trust Common Security Certificates and registration of transfers and exchanges of Trust Preferred Security Certificates as herein provided.
(c) Securities may only be transferred, in whole or in part, in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in this Declaration and in the terms of the Securities. Any transfer or purported transfer of any Security not made in accordance with this Declaration shall be null and void to the fullest extent permitted by law.
 
(d) Securities may be exchanged for other Securities of the same type and with the same aggregate Liquidation Amount and same terms as the Securities surrendered for exchange.
(e) Subject to this Article IX, Trust Preferred Securities shall be freely transferable.
(f) Subject to this Article IX, the Sponsor and any Related Party may only transfer Trust Common Securities to the Sponsor or a Related Party of the Sponsor; , that any such transfer is subject to the condition precedent that the transferor obtain the written opinion of nationally recognized counsel experienced in such matters that such transfer would not cause more than an insubstantial risk that:
provided
(i) the Trust would not be classified for United States federal income tax purposes as a grantor trust; and
(ii) the Trust would be an Investment Company or the transferee would become an Investment Company.
To the fullest extend permitted by law, any attempted transfer of the Trust Common Securities, other than as set forth in this clause (e), shall be void. The Regular Trustees shall cause each Trust Common Securities Certificate issued to the Sponsor to contain the following legend:
"THIS CERTIFICATE IS NOT TRANSFERABLE EXCEPT TO THE SPONSOR OR AN AFFILIATE OF THE SPONSOR IN COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAW AND SECTION 9.1 OF THE DECLARATION."
(g) Upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Certificate, the Property Trustee shall cause one or more new Certificates to be issued in the name of the designated transferee or transferees. Every Certificate surrendered for registration of transfer shall be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Property Trustee duly executed by the Holder or such Holder's attorney duly authorized in writing. Each Certificate surrendered for registration of transfer shall be canceled by the Property Trustee. A transferee of a Certificate shall be entitled to the rights and subject to the obligations of a Holder hereunder upon the receipt by such transferee of a Certificate. By acceptance of a Certificate, each transferee shall be deemed to have agreed to be bound by this Declaration.
(h) No service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer of Securities or any exchange, but the Trust may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other charge that may be imposed in connection with any registration or transfer of Securities.
(i) All Securities issued upon any transfer or exchange of Securities shall be the valid obligations of the Trust, evidencing the same debt, and entitled to the same benefits under this Declaration, as the Securities surrendered upon such transfer or exchange.
(j) Neither the Trust nor the Property Trustee shall be required to register the transfer of or exchange any Security during a period beginning at the opening of business 15 days
 
before the day of selection for redemption of Securities and ending at the close of business on the day of mailing of a notice of redemption or to transfer or exchange any Security so selected for redemption in whole or in part, except, in the case of any Security to be redeemed in part, any portion thereof not to be redeemed.
SECTION 9.2 .
Deemed Security Holders
The Trustees may treat the Person in whose name any Certificate shall be registered on the books and records of the Trust as the sole holder of such Certificate and of the Securities represented by such Certificate for purposes of receiving Distributions and for all other purposes whatsoever and, accordingly, shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest in such Certificate or in the Securities represented by such Certificate on the part of any Person, whether or not the Trust shall have actual or other notice thereof.
SECTION 9.3 .

(c) to the extent that the provisions of this Section 9.3 conflict with any other provisions of this Declaration, the provisions of this Section 9.3 shall control; and
(d) the rights of the Trust Preferred Security Beneficial Owners shall be exercised only through the Clearing Agency and shall be limited to those established by law and agreements between such Trust Preferred Security Beneficial Owners and the Clearing Agency and/or the Clearing Agency Participants.
SECTION 9.4 .

(b) the Regular Trustees elect after consultation with the Sponsor to terminate the book entry system through the Clearing Agency with respect to the Trust Preferred Securities,
then:
(c) Definitive Trust Preferred Security Certificates shall be prepared by the Regular Trustees on behalf of the Trust with respect to such Trust Preferred Securities; and
(d) upon surrender of the Global Certificates by the Clearing Agency, accompanied by registration instructions, the Regular Trustees shall cause Definitive Trust Preferred Security Certificates to be delivered to Trust Preferred Security Beneficial Owners in accordance with the instructions of the Clearing Agency.

The Definitive Trust Preferred Security Certificates shall be printed, lithographed or engraved or may be produced in any other manner as is reasonably acceptable to the Regular Trustees, as evidenced by their execution thereof, and may have such letters, numbers or other marks of identification or designation and such legends or endorsements as the Regular Trustees may deem appropriate (but in no event will such legends or other endorsements affect the rights, duties or immunities of the Trustees), or as may be required to comply with any law or with any rule or regulation made pursuant thereto or with any rule or regulation of any stock exchange on which Trust Preferred Securities may be listed, or to conform to usage.
SECTION 9.7 .

(b) there shall be delivered to the Property Trustee such evidence of loss and such security or indemnity as may be required by it to keep each of the Trustees, the Sponsor and the Trust harmless;
then, in the absence of notice that such Certificate shall have been acquired by a protected purchaser, the Property Trustee on behalf of the Trust shall execute and deliver, in exchange for or in lieu of any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Certificate, a new Certificate of like denomination. In connection with the issuance of any new Certificate under this Section 9.8, the Property Trustee may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection therewith. Any duplicate Certificate issued pursuant to this Section 9.8 shall constitute conclusive evidence of an ownership interest in the relevant Securities, as if originally issued, whether or not the lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate shall be found at any time.

Exculpation
(a) No Indemnified Person shall be liable, responsible or accountable in damages or otherwise to the Trust or any Covered Person for any loss, damage or claim incurred by reason of any act or omission performed or omitted by such Indemnified Person in good faith on behalf of the Trust and in a manner such Indemnified Person reasonably believed to be within the scope of the authority conferred on such Indemnified Person by this Declaration or by law, except that an Indemnified Person shall be liable for any such loss, damage or claim incurred by reason of such Indemnified Person's gross negligence or willful misconduct with respect to such acts or omissions.
(b) An Indemnified Person shall be fully protected in relying in good faith upon the records of the Trust and upon such information, opinions, reports or statements presented to the Trust by any Person as to matters the Indemnified Person reasonably believes are within such other Person's professional or expert competence and who has been selected with reasonable care by or on behalf of the Trust, including information, opinions, reports or statements as to the value and amount of the assets, liabilities, profits, losses, or any other facts pertinent to the existence and amount of assets from which Distributions to Holders of Securities might properly be paid.
SECTION 10.3 .
Fiduciary Duty
(a) To the extent that, at law or in equity, an Indemnified Person has duties (including fiduciary duties) and liabilities relating thereto to the Trust or to any other Covered Person, an Indemnified Person acting under this Declaration shall not be liable to the Trust or to any other Covered Person for its good faith reliance on the provisions of this Declaration. The provisions of this Declaration, to the extent that they restrict or eliminate the duties and liabilities of an Indemnified Person otherwise existing at law or in equity (other than the duties imposed on the Property Trustee under the Trust Indenture Act), are agreed by the parties hereto to replace such other duties and liabilities of such Indemnified Person.
(b) Unless otherwise expressly provided herein:

In the absence of bad faith by the Indemnified Person, the resolution, action or term so made, taken or provided by the Indemnified Person shall not constitute a breach of this Declaration or any other agreement contemplated herein or of any duty or obligation of the Indemnified Person at law or in equity or
 
otherwise. In the event the Indemnified Person believes any ambiguity or uncertainty exists hereunder, the Indemnified Person may, in its sole discretion, refrain from taking any action, and shall be fully protected and not liable in any way to any person or entity for refraining from taking such action, unless the Indemnified Person receives written instructions signed by an Authorized Officer of the Sponsor which eliminates such ambiguity or uncertainty to the satisfaction of the Indemnified Person.
(c) Whenever in this Declaration an Indemnified Person is permitted or required to make a decision:
(i) in its "discretion" or under a grant of similar authority, the Indemnified Person shall be entitled to consider such interests and factors as it desires, including its own interests, and shall have no duty or obligation to give any consideration to any interest of or factors affecting the Trust or any other Person; or
(ii) in its "good faith" or under another express standard, the Indemnified Person shall act under such express standard and shall not be subject to any other or different standard imposed by this Declaration or by applicable law.

(a) (i) The JSN Issuer shall indemnify, to the full extent permitted by law, any Company Indemnified Person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the Trust) by reason of the fact that he is or was a Company Indemnified Person against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Trust, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the Company Indemnified Person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Trust, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful.
nolo contendere
(ii) The JSN Issuer shall indemnify, to the full extent permitted by law, any Company Indemnified Person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Trust to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he is or was a Company Indemnified Person against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Trust and except that no such indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such Company Indemnified Person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Trust unless and only to the extent that the Court of
 
Chancery of Delaware or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which such Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper.
(iii) To the extent that a Company Indemnified Person shall be successful on the merits or otherwise (including dismissal of an action without prejudice or the settlement of an action without admission of liability) in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in paragraphs (i) and (ii) of this Section 10.4(a), or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, he shall be indemnified, to the full extent permitted by law, against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection therewith.
(iv) Any indemnification under paragraphs (i) and (ii) of this Section 10.4(a) (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the JSN Issuer only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the Company Indemnified Person is proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in paragraphs (i) and (ii). Such determination shall be made (1) by the Regular Trustees by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of such Regular Trustees who were not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, (2) if such a quorum is not obtainable, or, even if obtainable, if a quorum of disinterested Regular Trustees so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (3) by the Trust Common Security Holder of the Trust.
(v) Expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by a Company Indemnified Person in defending a civil, criminal, administrative or investigative action, suit or proceeding referred to in paragraphs (i) and (ii) of this Section 10.4(a) shall be paid by the JSN Issuer in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such Company Indemnified Person to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he is not entitled to be indemnified by the JSN Issuer as authorized in this Section 10.4(a). Notwithstanding the foregoing, no advance shall be made by the JSN Issuer if a determination is reasonably and promptly made (i) by the Regular Trustees by a majority vote of a quorum of disinterested Regular Trustees, (ii) if such a quorum is not obtainable, or, even if obtainable, if a quorum of disinterested Regular Trustees so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion or (iii) the Trust Common Security Holder of the Trust, that, based upon the facts known to the Regular Trustees, counsel or the Trust Common Security Holder at the time such determination is made, such Company Indemnified Person acted in bad faith or in a manner that such person did not believe to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Trust, or, with respect to any criminal proceeding, that such Company Indemnified Person believed or had reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. In no event shall any advance be made in instances where the Regular Trustees, independent legal counsel or Trust Common Security Holder reasonably determine that such person deliberately breached his duty to the Trust or its Common or Trust Preferred Security Holders.
(vi) The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, the other paragraphs of this Section 10.4(a) shall not be deemed
 
exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification and advancement of expenses may be entitled under any agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors of the JSN Issuer or Holders of the Trust Preferred Securities or otherwise, both as to action in his official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office. All rights to indemnification under this Section 10.4(a) shall be deemed to be provided by a contract between the JSN Issuer and each Company Indemnified Person who serves in such capacity at any time while this Section 10.4(a) is in effect. Any repeal or modification of this Section 10.4(a) shall not affect any rights or obligations then existing.
(vii) The JSN Issuer may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a Company Indemnified Person against any liability asserted against him and incurred by him in any such capacity, or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the JSN Issuer would have the power to indemnify him against such liability under the provisions of this Section 10.4(a).
(viii) For purposes of this Section 10.4(a), references to "the Trust" shall include, in addition to the resulting or surviving entity, any constituent entity (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger, so that any person who is or was a director, trustee, officer or employee of such constituent entity, or is or was serving at the request of such constituent entity as a director, trustee, officer, employee or agent of another entity, shall stand in the same position under the provisions of this Section 10.4(a) with respect to the resulting or surviving entity as he would have with respect to such constituent entity if its separate existence had continued.
(ix) The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, this Section 10.4(a) shall, unless otherwise provided when authorized or ratified, continue as to a person who has ceased to be a Company Indemnified Person and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.
(b) The Sponsor agrees to pay (i) all debts and other obligations of the Trust (other than with respect to the Securities), (ii) all costs and expenses of the Trust (including costs and expenses relating to the organization and operation of the Trust), (iii) the Property Trustee and the Delaware Trustee from time to time such reasonable compensation for services rendered by each hereunder (which compensation shall not be limited by any provision of law in regard to the compensation of a trustee of an express trust); (iv) except as otherwise expressly provided herein, to reimburse the Property Trustee and the Delaware Trustee, as the case may be, upon their request for all reasonable costs and expenses, disbursements and advances incurred or made by the Property Trustee or the Delaware Trustee incurred or made by any provision of this Declaration (including the reasonable costs of collection, and the reasonable compensation, expenses, advances and disbursements of their counsel, accountants and experts), except any such expense, disbursements or advance as may be attributable to its negligence or bad faith; (v) to indemnify (A) the Property Trustee, (B) the Delaware Trustee, (C) any Affiliate of the Property Trustee and the Delaware Trustee, and (D) any officers, directors, stockholders, members, partners, employees, representatives, custodians, nominees or agents of the Property Trustee and the Delaware Trustee (each of the Persons in (A) through (D) being referred to as a "Fiduciary Indemnified Person") for, and to hold each Fiduciary Indemnified Person harmless against, any loss, damage, claim, liability or expense (including the reasonable compensation, expenses and disbursements of the Property
 
Trustee's and the Delaware Trustee's agents and counsel) of any kind and nature incurred without negligence or bad faith on their part, arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of the Trust or the performance of their duties hereunder, including but not limited to the costs and expenses (including the reasonable compensation, expenses and disbursements of the Property Trustee's and the Delaware Trustee's agents and counsel) of defending itself against or investigating any claim or liability in connection with the exercise or performance of any of their powers or duties hereunder ; and (vi) any and all taxes and costs and expenses with respect thereto (other than United States withholding taxes) which the Trust becomes subject to. The obligations of the JSN Issuer as set forth in this Section 10.4(b) shall survive the resignation or removal of the Property Trustee or the Delaware Trustee, as the case may be, and the satisfaction and discharge of this Declaration.

Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to prevent the Trustee from setting a new record date for any action for which a record date has previously been set pursuant to this paragraph (whereupon the record date previously set shall automatically and with no action by any Person be cancelled and of no effect), and nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to render ineffective any action taken by Holders of the requisite principal amount of Outstanding Securities of the relevant series on the date such action is taken.

In any case where notice to Holders is given by mail, neither the failure to mail such notice, nor any defect in any notice so mailed, to any particular Holder shall affect the sufficiency of such notice with respect to other Holders. In case, by reason of the suspension of or irregularities in regular mail service or for any other reason, it shall be impossible or impracticable to mail notice of any event to Holders when said notice is required to be given pursuant to any provision of this Indenture or of the relevant Securities, then any manner of giving such notice as shall be satisfactory to the Trustee shall be deemed to be a sufficient giving of such notice. Where this Indenture provides for notice in any manner, such notice may be waived in writing by the Person entitled to receive such notice, either before or after the event, and such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice.

In addition, the Company's obligation to redeem the JSNs on the Scheduled Redemption Date is limited in the following respects. The Company shall use its Commercially Reasonable Efforts (except as described below) to raise sufficient net proceeds from the issuance of Replacement Capital Securities to repay the JSNs on the Scheduled Redemption Date, only to the extent that the Company has raised sufficient net proceeds within the 180-day period prior to the Scheduled Redemption Date, subject to the occurrence of a Market Disruption Event. The Company shall notify holders of the JSNs and the Trust Preferred Securities and the Trustee not more than 60 and not less than 30 days prior to the Scheduled Redemption Date of its expectation to redeem the JSNs. If the Company has not raised sufficient proceeds to permit repayment of all principal and accrued and unpaid interest on the JSNs on the Scheduled Redemption Date, the Company will apply any available proceeds so raised:
(i) to pay accrued and unpaid interest in chronological order; and
 
(ii) to repay all principal outstanding on the JSNs.

(iii) an Event of Default resulting in acceleration of the JSNs under the Indenture.
Except under the circumstances described below, the Company's failure to use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to raise sufficient proceeds would be a breach of covenant under the Indenture. However, in no event will such failure be an Event of Default thereunder.
The Company may amend or supplement the Replacement Capital Obligation with the consent of the holders of a majority by liquidation preference of the Trust Preferred Securities or, if the JSNs have been distributed by the property trustee, the holders of a majority by principal amount of the JSNs. The Company may, acting alone and without the consent of the such holders, amend or supplement the Replacement Capital Obligation:
(i) to eliminate Common Stock, Debt Exchangeable for Common Equity, rights to acquire Common Stock, and/or Mandatorily Convertible Preferred Stock as Replacement Capital Securities if, after the date of the Replacement Capital Obligation, the Company has been advised in writing by a nationally recognized independent accounting firm or an accounting standard or interpretive guidance of an existing accounting standard issued by an organization or regulator that has

(ii) if the amendment or supplement is not adverse to such holders and one of the Company's officers has delivered a written certificate to such holders to this effect; or
(iii) if the effect of such amendment or supplement is solely to impose additional restrictions on, or eliminate certain of, the types of securities qualifying as Replacement Capital Securities (other than the securities covered by (i) above), and one of the Company's officers has delivered a written certificate to such holders stating that, in his or her determination, such amendment or supplement would not adversely affect them.
Any principal amount of the JSNs remaining outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest, will be due and payable on the Final Maturity Date (or if this day is not a Business Day, the following Business Day, without adjustment), regardless of the amount of Replacement Capital Securities the Company has issued and sold by that time.
The Company shall not be required to redeem the JSNs on or after the Scheduled Redemption Date to the extent the Company provides written certification to the Trustee (which the Trustee will forward upon receipt to the Property Trustee which will in turn forward upon receipt to each holder of record of the Trust Preferred Securities) no more than 15 and no less than 10 Business Days in advance of the required repayment date certifying that:
(i) a Market Disruption Event was existing during the 180-day period preceding the date of the certificate or, in the case of any required repayment after the Scheduled Redemption Date, the 90-day period preceding the date of the certificate; and
(ii) either (a) the Market Disruption Event continued for the entire 180-day period or 90-day period, as the case may be, or (b) the Market Disruption Event continued for only part of the period, but the Company was unable, after Commercially Reasonable Efforts, to raise sufficient net proceeds during the rest of that period to permit repayment of the JSNs in full.
Net proceeds that the Company is permitted to apply to repayment of the JSNs on and after the Scheduled Redemption Date will be applied:
(i) first, to pay deferred interest to the extent of eligible proceeds under the Alternative Payment Mechanism;
 
(ii) second, to pay current interest that the Company is not paying from other sources; and
(iii) third, to repay the principal of JSNs, subject to a minimum principal amount of $5 million to be repaid on the Scheduled Redemption Date or any subsequent Interest Payment Date;
that if the Company is obligated to sell Replacement Capital Securities in accordance with the Replacement Capital Obligation and apply the net proceeds to payments of principal of or interest on any outstanding securities in addition to the JSNs, then on any date and for any period the amount of net proceeds received by the Company from those sales and available for such payments shall be applied to the JSNs and those other securities having the same scheduled repayment date or Scheduled Redemption Date as the JSNs pro rata in accordance with their respective outstanding principal amounts and none of such net proceeds shall be applied to any other securities having a later scheduled repayment date or Scheduled Redemption Date until the principal of and all accrued and unpaid interest on the JSNs has been paid in full. If the Company raises less than $5 million of proceeds from the sale of Replacement Capital Securities during the relevant 180-day or 90-day period, the Company shall not be required to repay any JSNs on the Scheduled Redemption Date or the next Interest Payment Date, as applicable, but will use those net proceeds to repay the JSNs on the next Interest Payment Date as of which the Company has raised at least $5 million of net proceeds.
