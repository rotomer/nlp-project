(ii) the Depositary Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Corporation, and constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Corporation, enforceable against the Corporation in accordance with its terms (except as such enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, readjustment of debt, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or similar laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally, or general equity principles (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) and an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing);
(iii) the statements set forth in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus under the captions "Description pf Series K Preferred Stock" and "Description of Depositary Shares", insofar as they purport to describe the provisions of the laws and documents referred to therein, fairly summarize in all material respects the matters described therein; and

In rendering such opinion, counsel may state that they are passing only on matters of New York, Pennsylvania and United States Federal law. In rendering such opinion, counsel may rely upon an opinion or opinions, each dated the Closing Date, of other counsel retained by them or the Corporation as to laws of any jurisdiction other than the United States or the State of New York, provided that (i) such reliance is expressly authorized by each opinion so relied upon and a copy of each such opinion is delivered to the Representatives, and (ii) counsel shall state in their opinion that they and the Representatives are justified in relying thereon. Insofar as such opinions involve factual matters, such counsel may rely, to the extent such counsel deems proper, upon certificates of officers of the Corporation or its subsidiaries and certificates of public officials.
(d) The Representatives shall have received from Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP, counsel for the Underwriters, such opinion or opinions, dated the Closing Date, with respect to the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package, the Final Prospectus (together with any supplement thereto) and other related matters as the Representatives may reasonably require, and the Corporation shall have furnished to such counsel such documents as they reasonably request for the purpose of enabling them to pass upon such matters.
In rendering such opinion, counsel may rely upon an opinion or opinions, each dated the Closing Date, of other counsel retained by them or the Corporation as to laws of any jurisdiction other than the United States or the State of New York, provided that (A) such reliance is expressly authorized by each opinion so relied upon and a copy of each such opinion is delivered to the Representatives, and (B) counsel shall state in their opinion that they believe that they and the Representatives are justified in relying thereon. Insofar as such opinions involve factual matters, such counsel may rely, to the extent such counsel deems proper, upon certificates of officers of the Corporation and its subsidiaries and certificates of public officials.
(e) The Corporation shall have furnished to the Representatives a certificate of the Corporation, signed by the Chairman of the Board, the President, a Vice Chairman of the Board or any Executive or Senior Vice President and the principal financial or accounting officer of the Corporation, dated the Closing Date, to the effect that the signers of such certificate have carefully examined the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package, the Final Prospectus, any supplement to the Final Prospectus and this Agreement and that:
(i) the representations and warranties of the Corporation in this Agreement are true and correct on and as of the Closing Date with the same effect as if made on the Closing Date and the Corporation has complied with all the agreements and satisfied all the conditions on its part to be performed or satisfied at or prior to the Closing Date;
(ii) no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or, to the Corporation's knowledge, threatened; and
 
(iii) since the date of the most recent financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto), there has been no material adverse change in the condition (financial or other), earnings, business or properties of the Corporation and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, whether or not arising from transactions in the ordinary course of business, except as set forth in or contemplated in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package (exclusive of any supplement thereto) and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto).
(f) At the Closing Date, Deloitte and Touche LLP shall have furnished to the Representatives a letter or letters (which may refer to letters previously delivered to the Representatives), dated as of the Closing Date, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives, confirming that they are independent accountants within the meaning of the Act and the Exchange Act and the respective applicable published rules and regulations thereunder and stating in effect that:
(i) in their opinion the audited consolidated financial statements included or incorporated in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus and reported on by them comply in form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Act and the Exchange Act and the related published rules and regulations; and
(ii) they have performed certain other specified procedures as a result of which they determined that certain information of an accounting, financial or statistical nature (which is limited to accounting, financial or statistical information derived from the general accounting records of the Corporation and its subsidiaries) set forth in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus, including the information included or incorporated in Items 1, 5, 6 and 7 of the Corporation's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the most recent fiscal year incorporated in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus, incorporated in the Registration Statement and Final Prospectus, agrees with the accounting records of the Corporation and its subsidiaries, excluding any questions of legal interpretation.

(g) At the Closing Date, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP shall have furnished to the Representatives a letter or letters (which may refer to letters previously delivered to the Representatives), dated as of the Closing Date, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives, confirming that they are independent accountants
 
within the meaning of the Act and the Exchange Act and the respective applicable published rules and regulations thereunder and stating in effect that:
(i) on the basis of a reading of the latest unaudited consolidated financial statements made available by the Corporation and its subsidiaries; carrying out certain specified procedures (but not an audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards) which would not necessarily reveal matters of significance with respect to the comments set forth in such letter; a reading of the minutes of the meetings of the shareholders and directors of the Corporation and the audit and executive committees thereof and inquiries of certain officials of the Corporation who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters of the Corporation and its subsidiaries as to transactions and events subsequent to the date of the most recent audited consolidated financial statements in or incorporated in the Final Prospectus, nothing came to their attention which caused them to believe that: (1) any unaudited consolidated financial statements included or incorporated in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus do not comply in form in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and with the published rules and regulations of the Commission with respect to the financial statements included or incorporated in quarterly reports on Form 10-Q under the Exchange Act; and said unaudited consolidated financial statements are not in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a basis substantially consistent with that of the audited consolidated financial statements included or incorporated in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus; or (2) with respect to the period subsequent to the date of the most recent audited or unaudited consolidated financial statements incorporated in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus, there were, at a specified date not more than five business days prior to the date of the letter, any increases in borrowed funds of the Corporation and its subsidiaries or any decreases in the capital stock (defined as each of the individual dollar amounts of preferred stock, common stock, and capital surplus) of the Corporation or the stockholders' equity of the Corporation as compared with the amounts shown on the most recent consolidated balance sheet incorporated in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus, or for the period from the date of the most recent audited or unaudited consolidated financial statements incorporated in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus to such specified date there were any decreases, as compared with the corresponding period in the preceding year, in total or per share amounts of consolidated net income of the Corporation or consolidated net interest income except in all instances for changes or decreases set forth in such letter, in which case the letter shall be accompanied by an explanation by the Corporation as to the significance thereof unless said explanation is not deemed necessary by the Representatives; and
(ii) they have performed certain other specified procedures as a result of which they determined that certain information of an accounting, financial or statistical nature (which is limited to accounting, financial or statistical information derived from the general accounting records of the Corporation and its subsidiaries) set forth in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus,
 
including the information included in the "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" included or incorporated in the Corporation's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, incorporated in the Registration Statement and Final Prospectus, agrees with the accounting records of the Corporation and its subsidiaries, excluding any questions of legal interpretation.
References to the Final Prospectus in this paragraph (g) include any supplement thereto at the date of the letter.
If provided for in Schedule I hereto, at the Execution Time, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP shall have furnished to the Representatives a letter or letters, dated as of the Execution Time, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives, to the effect set forth above.
(h) On or subsequent to the Applicable Time or, if earlier, the dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement (exclusive of any amendment thereof), the Pricing Disclosure Package (exclusive of any supplement thereof) and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto), there shall not have been (i) any change or decrease specified in the letter or letters referred to in paragraph (g) of this Section 6 or (ii) any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the business or properties of the Corporation and its subsidiaries the effect of which, in any case referred to in clause (i) or (ii) above, is, in the judgment of the Representatives, so material and adverse as to make it impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or the delivery of the Securities as contemplated by the Registration Statement (exclusive of any amendment thereof), the Pricing Disclosure Package (exclusive of any supplement thereto) and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto).
(i) On or subsequent to the Applicable Time, there shall not have been any decrease in the rating of any of the Corporation's debt securities by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" (as that term is defined by the Commission for the purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Securities Act), or any public announcement that any such organization has under surveillance or review the ratings of any of the Corporation's debt securities (other than an announcement with positive implications of a possible upgrading, and no implication of a possible downgrading, of such rating), and if, in any such case, the effect thereof in the judgment of the Representatives makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the purchase of the Securities.
(j) Prior to the Closing Date the Corporation shall have furnished to the Representatives such further information, certificates and documents as the Representatives may reasonably request in connection with the offering of the Securities.
If any of the conditions specified in this Section 6 shall not have been fulfilled when and as provided in this Agreement, or if any of the opinions and certificates mentioned above or elsewhere in this Agreement shall not be reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Representatives and counsel for the
 
Underwriters, this Agreement and all obligations of the Underwriters hereunder may be canceled at, or at any time prior to, the Closing Date by the Representatives. Notice of such cancellation shall be given to the Corporation in writing or by telephone or telegraph confirmed in writing.
Section 7. . If the sale of the Securities provided for herein is not consummated because any condition to the obligations of the Underwriters set forth in Section 6 hereof is not satisfied, because of any termination pursuant to Section 10 hereof or because of any refusal, inability or failure on the part of the Corporation to perform any agreement herein or comply with any provision hereof other than by reason of a default by any of the Underwriters, the Corporation will reimburse the Underwriters severally upon demand for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) that shall have been incurred by them in connection with the proposed purchase and sale of the Securities. In no event shall the Corporation be liable to the Underwriters for loss of anticipated profits from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Reimbursement of Underwriters' Expenses
Section 8. . (a) The Corporation agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter and each person who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or other Federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the registration statement for the registration of the Securities as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or in the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Final Prospectus, the Pricing Disclosure Package or the Final Prospectus, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or any "issuer information" filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; , , that the Corporation will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Corporation by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for use in connection with the preparation thereof, or that part of the Registration Statement constituting the "Statement of Eligibility and Qualification" (Form T-1) under the Trust Indenture Act. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Corporation may otherwise have.
Indemnification and Contribution
provided
however
(b) Each Underwriter severally agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Corporation, each of its directors, each of its officers who signs the Registration Statement, and each person who controls the Corporation within the meaning of either the
 
Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Corporation to each Underwriter, but only with reference to written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Corporation by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for use in the preparation of the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which any Underwriter may otherwise have. The Corporation acknowledges that the statements set forth in the last paragraph of the cover page, and under the heading "Underwriting" (i) the list of Underwriters and their respective participation in the sale of the Securities, (ii) the sentences related to concessions and reallowances and (iii) the paragraphs related to stabilization and syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids in any Preliminary Final Prospectus or the Final Prospectus constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the several Underwriters for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity, and you, as the Representatives, confirm that such statements are correct.
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 8 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 8, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve it from any liability hereunder to the extent it is not materially prejudiced as a result thereof and in any event shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 8. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein, and to the extent that it may elect by written notice delivered to the indemnified party promptly after receiving the aforesaid notice from such indemnified party, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party; , , that if the defendants in any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, the indemnified party or parties shall have the right to select separate counsel to assert such legal defenses and to otherwise participate in the defense of such action on behalf of such indemnified party or parties. Upon receipt of notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense of such action and approval by the indemnified party of such counsel, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section 8 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof unless (i) the indemnified party shall have employed separate counsel in accordance with the proviso to the next preceding sentence (it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel (plus any local counsel), approved by the Representatives in the case of paragraph (a) of this Section 8, representing the indemnified parties under such paragraph (a) who are parties to such action), (ii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of commencement of the action or (iii) the indemnifying party has authorized the
provided
however
 
employment of counsel for the indemnified party at the expense of the indemnifying party; and except that, if clause (i) or (iii) is applicable, such liability shall be only in respect of the counsel referred to in such clause (i) or (iii). No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution could be sought under this Section 8 (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
(d) In order to provide for just and equitable contribution in circumstances in which the indemnification provided for in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 8 is unavailable, the Corporation, on the one hand, and the Underwriters severally, on the other hand, shall contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending same) to which the Corporation and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject in proportion to the relative benefits received by the Corporation on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities, such that the Underwriters are responsible for that portion represented by the percentage that the underwriting discount bears to the sum of such discount and the purchase price of the Securities specified in Schedule I hereto and the Corporation is responsible for the balance; provided, however, that in no case shall any Underwriter (except as may be provided in any agreement among underwriters relating to the offering of the Securities) be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount applicable to the Securities purchased by such Underwriter hereunder. If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Corporation, on the one hand, and the Underwriters severally, on the other, shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits as described in the immediately preceding sentence but also the relative fault of the Corporation on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages and liabilities as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the Corporation on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Corporation and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 8, each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of the Act shall have the same rights to contribution
 
as such Underwriter, and each person who controls the Corporation within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of the Corporation who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Corporation shall have the same rights to contribution as the Corporation, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (d). Any party entitled to contribution will, promptly after receipt of notice of commencement of any action, suit or proceeding against such party in respect of which a claim for contribution may be made against another party or parties under this paragraph (d), notify such party or parties from whom contribution may be sought, but the omission to so notify such party or parties shall not relieve the party or parties from whom contribution may be sought from any other obligation it or they may have hereunder or otherwise than under this paragraph (d).
Section 9. . If any one or more Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Depositary Shares agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter or Underwriters hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the number of Depositary Shares set forth opposite their names in Schedule II hereto bears to the total number of Depositary Shares set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the Depositary Shares which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase; , , that in the event that the total number of Depositary Shares which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the total number of Depositary Shares set forth in Schedule II hereto, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Depositary Shares, and if such non defaulting Underwriters do not purchase all the Depositary Shares, this Agreement will terminate without liability to any non defaulting Underwriter or the Corporation. In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 9, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding seven days, as the Representatives shall determine in order that the required changes in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Corporation and any non defaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder.
Default by an Underwriter
provided
however
Section 10. . This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Representatives, by notice given to the Corporation prior to delivery of and payment for the Securities, if prior to such time (i) trading in the Corporation's Common Stock shall have been suspended by the Commission or The New York Stock Exchange or trading in securities generally on The New York Stock Exchange shall have been suspended or limited or minimum prices shall have been established on such exchange, (ii) a banking moratorium shall have been declared either by Federal, New York State or Pennsylvania authorities, (iii) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war or other calamity or crisis, economic or otherwise or (iv) a material disruption has occurred in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States, the effect of which on the financial markets of the United
Termination
