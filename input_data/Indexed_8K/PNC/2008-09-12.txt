Replacement Change of Control Employment Agreements
In connection with the Company's review of its executive compensation arrangements in order to comply with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), on September 9, 2008, the Personnel and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (the "Company") approved a form of Change of Control Employment Agreements to be entered into with each of the Company's named executive officers (the "Replacement Agreements").
In connection with entering into the Replacement Agreements, the Change in Control Severance Agreements described in the Company's proxy statement for its annual meeting of shareholders dated March 28, 2008 (the "Prior Agreements") will be terminated.
The Replacement Agreements generally provide for similar termination protections and severance pay and benefits as the Prior Agreements. However, the Replacement Agreements differ from the Prior Agreements in the following material respects:
(1) the Replacement Agreements eliminate or reduce some of the payments and benefits provided under the Prior Agreements,
(2) the Replacement Agreements are written as employment agreements, the terms of which become operative upon a change of control, instead of severance agreements, to provide greater specificity regarding the parties' rights and obligations following a change of control,
(3) the Replacement Agreements modify the manner in which certain types of benefits are provided in order to comply with Section 409A of the Code, and
(4) the Replacement Agreements provide that the severance pay multiple will be reduced to one and one-half (1.5) when an executive attains age 65 instead of providing that the three-times severance pay multiple will be reduced to the number of years from the date of termination until the date the executive attains age 65 (with the agreement expiring when the executive reaches age 65) under the Prior Agreement.
Similar to the Prior Agreements, the Replacement Agreements provide for the following payments and benefits upon a qualifying termination of employment following a change of control:
 
 
 
Like the Prior Agreements, the Replacement Agreements provide each executive with an additional payment for any excise tax and related taxes on change of control payments or benefits that are considered "excess parachute payments" under the Code. Unlike the Prior Agreements, the Replacement Agreements only provide for this additional payment if the parachute value of all such payments exceeds 105% of the maximum amount that the executive could receive without being subject to the excise tax, and if this threshold is not met, the executive's payments are cut back so that no excise tax is imposed.
 
Based on the same assumptions and compensation information used for purposes of calculating the payments of severance and benefits under the Prior Agreements for purposes of the Company's proxy statement for its annual meeting of shareholders dated March 28, 2008, if the Replacement Agreements had been in place on December 31, 2007, the aggregate amount of the Total Benefits for the five named executive officers upon a qualifying termination following a change of control would have been decreased by $18.2 million as compared to the amounts shown under that heading in the table on page 71 of the annual meeting proxy statement, of which $11.0 million would represent a decrease in the aggregate amounts shown as Excise Tax Gross-Up.
Like the Prior Agreements, each of the Replacement Agreements prohibits the executive from using or disclosing any of the Company's confidential business or technical information or trade secrets. The executive may also not employ or solicit any of the Company's officers during the one-year period following termination.
The foregoing description of the Replacement Agreements does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the form of Replacement Agreements, which is filed as Exhibit 99.1 hereto, and is incorporated herein by reference.

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") has determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to assure that the Company will have the continued dedication of the Executive, notwithstanding the possibility, threat or occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined herein). The Board believes it is imperative to diminish the inevitable distraction of the Executive by virtue of the personal uncertainties and risks created by a pending or threatened Change of Control, to encourage the Executive's full attention and dedication to the Company in the event of any threatened or pending Change of Control and to provide the Executive with compensation and benefits arrangements upon a Change of Control that ensure that the compensation and benefits expectations of the Executive will be satisfied and that provide the Executive with compensation and benefits arrangements that are competitive with those of other corporations.

Section 2. .
Employment Period
(a)  (i) During the Employment Period, (A) the Executive's position (including status, offices, titles and reporting requirements), authority, duties and responsibilities shall be at least commensurate in all material respects with the most significant of those held, exercised and assigned at any time during the 120-day period immediately preceding the Effective Date, (B) the Executive's services shall be performed at the office where the Executive was employed immediately preceding the Effective Date or at any other location less than 50 miles from such office and (C) the Executive shall not be required to travel on Company business to a substantially greater extent than required during the 120-day period immediately prior to the Effective Date.
Section 3. .
Terms of Employment
.
Position and Duties
(ii) During the Employment Period, and excluding any periods of vacation and sick leave to which the Executive is entitled, the Executive agrees to devote reasonable attention and time during normal business hours to the business and affairs of the Company and, to the extent necessary to discharge the responsibilities assigned to the Executive hereunder, to use the Executive's reasonable best efforts to perform faithfully and efficiently such responsibilities. During the Employment Period, it shall not be a violation of this Agreement for the Executive to (A) serve on corporate, civic or charitable boards or
 
committees, (B) deliver lectures, fulfill speaking engagements or teach at educational institutions and (C) manage personal investments, so long as such activities do not significantly interfere with the performance of the Executive's responsibilities as an employee of the Company in accordance with this Agreement. It is expressly understood and agreed that, to the extent that any such activities have been conducted by the Executive prior to the Effective Date, the continued conduct of such activities (or the conduct of activities similar in nature and scope thereto) subsequent to the Effective Date shall not thereafter be deemed to interfere with the performance of the Executive's responsibilities to the Company.
(b) (i) During the Employment Period, the Executive shall receive an annual base salary (the "Annual Base Salary") at an annual rate at least equal to 12 times the highest monthly base salary paid or payable, including any base salary that has been earned but deferred, to the Executive by the Company and the Affiliated Companies in respect of the 12-month period immediately preceding the month in which the Effective Date occurs. The Annual Base Salary shall be paid at such intervals as the Company pays executive salaries generally. During the Employment Period, the Annual Base Salary shall be reviewed at least annually, beginning no more than 12 months after the last salary increase awarded to the Executive prior to the Effective Date. Any increase in the Annual Base Salary shall not serve to limit or reduce any other obligation to the Executive under this Agreement. The Annual Base Salary shall not be reduced after any such increase and the term "Annual Base Salary" shall refer to the Annual Base Salary as so increased.
.
Compensation
.
Base Salary
(ii) In addition to the Annual Base Salary, the Executive shall be awarded, for each fiscal year of the Company ending during the Employment Period, an annual bonus (the "Annual Bonus") in cash at least equal the product of (A) the Executive's Annual Base Salary and (B) the Executive's average Bonus Percent (as defined below) for the three fiscal years (or such shorter period during which the Executive has been employed by the Company) immediately preceding the Effective Date (such average, the "Minimum Annual Bonus Percent"). Notwithstanding the foregoing and not in contravention of the foregoing, to the extent that, during the Employment Period, the committee administering the applicable annual incentive plan establishes specific Annual Bonus targets with respect to an applicable fiscal year of the Company ending during the Employment Period for peer executives of the Company, the Annual Bonus target established by such committee for the Executive shall be no less favorable to the Executive than the annual bonus target established for such peer executives of the Company, and any performance criteria established with respect to the Executive's Annual Bonus target shall be (and shall be evaluated on a basis that is) no less favorable to the Executive than the performance criteria (and the basis for evaluation) applicable to peer executives of the Company. For purposes of this Agreement, the "Bonus Percent" shall mean, with respect to a particular fiscal year of the Company, the amount expressed as a percentage equal to (1) the Executive's annual bonus (including any amounts deferred by the Executive and the cash value (measured in accordance with the immediately following sentence) of any portion of any annual bonus amounts paid in stock, restricted stock or other equity-based consideration and of any additional stock, restricted stock or other equity-based awards granted to the Executive with respect to the portion of such bonus amounts paid in stock, restricted stock or an equity-based award) earned under the Company's
.
Annual Bonus
 
annual incentive plans, or any comparable bonus under any predecessor or successor plan, during such fiscal year, divided by (2) the Executive's annual base salary paid or payable to the Executive for such fiscal year. For purposes of the preceding sentences, shares of stock or other consideration will be valued without regard to any vesting, transfer or other restrictions applicable to such stock or other consideration, and the cash value of any stock-based portion of such annual bonus will be determined based on a per share value equal to the closing price of the stock, as of the date the shares were awarded, on the principal stock exchange on which the stock is traded, and, with respect to awards that are stock options, based on the grant date value determined based on the Company's valuation methodology as in effect on the date of grant. Each such Annual Bonus shall be paid no later than two and a half months after the end of the fiscal year of the Company for which the Annual Bonus is awarded, unless the Executive shall elect to defer the receipt of such Annual Bonus pursuant to an arrangement that meets the requirements of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").
(iii) During the Employment Period, the Executive shall be entitled to participate in all long-term cash incentive, equity incentive, savings and retirement plans, practices, policies and programs applicable generally to other peer executives of the Company and the Affiliated Companies, but in no event shall such plans, practices, policies and programs provide the Executive with incentive opportunities (measured with respect to both regular and special incentive opportunities, to the extent, if any, that such distinction is applicable), savings opportunities and retirement benefit opportunities, in each case, less favorable, in the aggregate, than the most favorable of those provided by the Company and the Affiliated Companies for the Executive under such plans, practices, policies and programs as in effect at any time during the 120-day period immediately preceding the Effective Date or, if more favorable to the Executive, those provided generally at any time after the Effective Date to other peer executives of the Company and the Affiliated Companies.

.
Vacation
(a)  The Executive's employment shall terminate automatically if the Executive dies during the Employment Period. If the Company determines in good faith that the Disability (as defined herein) of the Executive has occurred during the Employment Period (pursuant to the definition of "Disability"), it may give to the Executive written notice in accordance with Section 11(b) of its intention to terminate the Executive's employment. In such event, the Executive's employment with the Company shall terminate effective on the 30th day after receipt of such notice by the Executive (the "Disability Effective Date"), ,, that, within the 30 days after such receipt, the Executive shall not have returned to full-time performance of the Executive's duties. "Disability" means the absence of the Executive from the Executive's duties with the Company on a full-time basis for 180 consecutive business days as a result of incapacity due to mental or physical illness that is determined to be total and permanent by a physician selected by the Company or its insurers and acceptable to the Executive or the Executive's legal representative (such agreement as to acceptability not to be unreasonably withheld).
Section 4. .

Death or Disability
provided

(b) The Company may terminate the Executive's employment during the Employment Period with or without Cause. "Cause" means:
.
Cause
 
(i) the willful and continued failure of the Executive to perform substantially the Executive's duties (as contemplated by Section 3(a)(i)(A)) with the Company or any Affiliated Company (other than any such failure resulting from incapacity due to physical or mental illness or following the Executive's delivery of a Notice of Termination for Good Reason), after a written demand for substantial performance is delivered to the Executive by the Board or the Chief Executive Officer of the Company that specifically identifies the manner in which the Board or the Chief Executive Officer of the Company believes that the Executive has not substantially performed the Executive's duties; or
(ii) the willful engaging by the Executive in illegal conduct or gross misconduct that is materially and demonstrably injurious to the Company.
For purposes of this Section 4(b), no act, or failure to act, on the part of the Executive shall be considered "willful" unless it is done, or omitted to be done, by the Executive in bad faith or without reasonable belief that the Executive's action or omission was in the best interests of the Company. Any act, or failure to act, based upon (A) authority given pursuant to a resolution duly adopted by the Board, or if the Company is not the ultimate parent corporation of the Affiliated Companies and is not publicly-traded, the board of directors of the ultimate parent of the Company (the "Applicable Board"), (B) the instructions of the Chief Executive Officer of the Company or a senior officer of the Company or (C) the advice of counsel for the Company shall be conclusively presumed to be done, or omitted to be done, by the Executive in good faith and in the best interests of the Company. The cessation of employment of the Executive shall not be deemed to be for Cause unless and until there shall have been delivered to the Executive a copy of a resolution duly adopted by the affirmative vote of not less than three-quarters of the entire membership of the Applicable Board (excluding the Executive, if the Executive is a member of the Applicable Board) at a meeting of the Applicable Board called and held for such purpose (after reasonable notice is provided to the Executive and the Executive is given an opportunity, together with counsel for the Executive, to be heard before the Applicable Board), finding that, in the good faith opinion of the Applicable Board, the Executive is guilty of the conduct described in Section 4(b)(i) or 4(b)(ii), and specifying the particulars thereof in detail.
(c) The Executive's employment may be terminated during the Employment Period by the Executive for Good Reason or by the Executive voluntarily without Good Reason. "Good Reason" means:
.
Good Reason
(i) the assignment to the Executive of any duties inconsistent in any respect with the Executive's position (including status, offices, titles and reporting requirements), authority, duties or responsibilities as contemplated by Section 3(a), or any other diminution in such position, authority, duties or responsibilities, excluding for this purpose an isolated, insubstantial and inadvertent action not taken in bad faith and that is remedied by the Company promptly after receipt of notice thereof given by the Executive;
(ii) any failure by the Company to comply with any of the provisions of Section 3(b), other than an isolated, insubstantial and inadvertent failure not occurring in bad faith and that is remedied by the Company promptly after receipt of notice thereof given by the Executive;
 
(iii) the Company's requiring the Executive to be based at any office or location other than as provided in Section 3(a)(i)(B) of this Agreement;
(iv) any action or inaction that constitutes a material breach by the Company of this Agreement; or
(v) any failure by the Company to comply with and satisfy Section 10(c).
For purposes of this Section 4(c) of this Agreement, any good faith determination of Good Reason made by the Executive shall be conclusive.The Executive's mental or physical incapacity following the occurrence of an event described above in clauses (i) through (v) shall not affect the Executive's ability to terminate employment for Good Reason, and the Executive's death following delivery of a Notice of Termination for Good Reason shall not affect the Executive's estate's entitlement to severance payments benefits provided hereunder upon a termination of employment for Good Reason.
(d) Any termination by the Company for Cause, or by the Executive for Good Reason, shall be communicated by Notice of Termination to the other party hereto given in accordance with Section 11(b). "Notice of Termination" means a written notice that (i) indicates the specific termination provision in this Agreement relied upon, (ii) to the extent applicable, sets forth in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances claimed to provide a basis for termination of the Executive's employment under the provision so indicated and (iii) if the Date of Termination (as defined herein) is other than the date of receipt of such notice, specifies the Date of Termination (which Date of Termination shall be not more than 60 days after the giving of such notice). The failure by the Executive or the Company to set forth in the Notice of Termination any fact or circumstance that contributes to a showing of Good Reason or Cause shall not waive any right of the Executive or the Company, respectively, hereunder or preclude the Executive or the Company, respectively, from asserting such fact or circumstance in enforcing the Executive's or the Company's respective rights hereunder. If within 30 days of receiving the Notice of Termination the party receiving such notice notifies the other party that a dispute exists concerning the provisions of the Agreement that apply to such termination, the dispute shall be resolved either (A) by mutual written agreement of the parties or (B) by a final judgment, order or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction (which is not appealable or with respect to which the time for appeal therefrom has expired and no appeal has been perfected). The parties shall pursue the resolution of such dispute with reasonable diligence. Following the final resolution of such dispute, any party owing any payments under this Agreement pursuant to such resolution shall make all such payments, together with interest at the applicable federal rate provided for in Section 7872(f)(2)(A) of the Code ("Interest") determined as of the Date of Termination (and in the case of compensatory amounts payable to the Executive under this Agreement, accrued from the Date of Termination) through the date such payments are actually made. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Executive's mental or physical incapacity following the receipt of a Notice of Termination by the Company terminating the Executive's employment other than for Cause shall not affect the obligation of the Company to pay, or the Executive's entitlement to, the payments and benefits to which the Executive is entitled to under this Agreement upon a termination of employment other than for Cause, regardless of whether the Company terminates the Executive's employment as a result of such mental or physical incapacity prior to the date set forth in the Notice of Termination.
.
Notice of Termination
 
(e) "Date of Termination" means (i) if the Executive's employment is terminated by the Company for Cause, or by the Executive for Good Reason, the date of receipt of the Notice of Termination or such later date specified in the Notice of Termination, as the case may be, (ii) if the Executive's employment is terminated by the Company other than for Cause or Disability, the date on which the Company notifies the Executive of such termination or such later date specified in the Notice of Termination, as the case may be, (iii) if the Executive resigns without Good Reason, the date on which the Executive notifies the Company of such termination and (iv) if the Executive's employment is terminated by reason of death or Disability, the date of death of the Executive or the Disability Effective Date, as the case may be. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the Date of Termination occur until the Executive experiences a "separation from service" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, and notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the date on which such separation from service takes place shall be the "Date of Termination."

provided
(B) the amount equal to the product of (x) the Classification Factor and (y) the sum of the following amounts:
(1) the Annual Base Salary; and
(2) the product of (x) the higher of (I) the Minimum Annual Bonus Percent and (II) the average Bonus Percent for the three fiscal years (or such shorter period during which the Executive has been employed by the Company) immediately preceding the Date of Termination, and (y) the Annual Base Salary (such product, the "Highest Annual Bonus"); , however, that the Highest Annual Bonus shall be calculated for purposes of this Section 5(a)(i)(B)(2) assuming the Bonus Percent with respect to the fiscal year of the Company immediately preceding the Effective Date is not less than the Executive's Target Bonus Percent for such fiscal year, but only to the extent such a Target Bonus Percent was established for the Executive; and
provided
(C) an amount equal to the sum of the Company or an Affiliated Company's (as applicable) contributions under The PNC Financial Services
 
Group, Inc. Incentive Savings Plan and the Supplemental Savings Plan (or similar qualified defined contribution plans and any excess or supplemental defined contribution plans sponsored by an Affiliated Company, if applicable to Executive) in which the Executive participates as of the Date of Termination (or, if more favorable to the Executive, the plans as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Date) (collectively, the "Savings Plans") that the Executive would receive if the Executive's employment continued during the Benefits Period, assuming for this purpose that (1) the Executive's benefits under such plans are fully vested; (2) the Executive's compensation during each year of the Benefits Period is equal to the Annual Base Salary and the Highest Annual Bonus, and such amounts are paid in equal installments ratably over each year of the Benefits Period; (3) the Executive received (x) an Annual Bonus with respect to the year in which the Date of Termination occurs equal to the amount payable pursuant to Section 5(a)(i)(A)(5) and (y) an Annual Bonus with respect to the fiscal year of the Company preceding the Date of Termination equal to the amount payable pursuant to Section 5(a)(i)(A)(3), in each case, only to the extent that an accrual in respect of the compensation described in this clause (3) has not already been credited to the Executive under the Savings Plans; (4) the amount of any such employer contributions is equal to the maximum amount that could be provided under the terms of the applicable Saving Plans for the year in which the Date of Termination occurs (or, if more favorable to the Executive, or in the event that as of the Date of Termination the amount of any such contributions for such year is not determinable, the amount of contribution that could be provided under the Savings Plans for the plan year ending immediately prior to the Effective Date) for a participant whose compensation is as provided in clauses (2) and (3) above; and (5) to the extent that the Company's contributions are determined based on the contributions or deferrals of the Executive, disregarding the Executive's actual contributions or deferral elections as of the Date of Termination and assuming that the Executive had elected to participate in the Savings Plans and to defer that percentage of Annual Base Salary and/or Annual Bonuses under the Savings Plans that would result in the maximum possible Company contribution.

In order to comply with Section 409A of the Code, in no event shall the payments by the Company under this Section 7 be made later than the end of the calendar year next following the calendar year in which such fees and expenses were incurred (or, in connection with a contest related to an Anticipatory Termination, following the calendar year in which such contest is finally resolved), , , that the Executive shall have submitted an

invoice for such fees and expenses at least 10 days before the end of the calendar year next following the calendar year in which such fees and expenses were incurred (or, in connection with a contest related to an Anticipatory Termination, following the calendar year in which such contest is finally resolved).

(a) Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in the event it shall be determined that any Payment would be subject to the Excise Tax, then the Executive shall be entitled to receive an additional payment (the "Gross-Up Payment") in an amount such that, after payment by the Executive of all taxes (and any interest or penalties imposed with respect to such taxes), including, without limitation, any income taxes (and any interest and penalties imposed with respect thereto) and Excise Tax imposed upon the Gross-Up Payment, but excluding any income taxes and penalties imposed pursuant to Section 409A of the Code, the Executive retains an amount of the Gross-Up Payment equal to the Excise Tax imposed upon the Payments. The Company's obligation to make Gross-Up Payments under this Section 8 shall not be conditioned upon the Executive's termination of employment. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 8(a), if it shall be determined that the Executive is entitled to the Gross-Up Payment, but that the Parachute Value of all Payments does not exceed 105% of the Safe Harbor Amount, then no Gross-Up Payment shall be made to the Executive and the amounts payable under this Agreement shall be reduced so that the Parachute Value of all Payments, in the aggregate, equals the Safe Harbor Amount. The reduction of the amounts payable hereunder, if applicable, shall be made by reducing the payments under the following sections in the following order: (i) Section 5(a)(iii)(B)(2); (ii) Section 5(a)(iv); (iii) Section 5(a)(i)(C); (iv) Section 5(a)(i)(B); and (v) Section 5(a)(i)(A)(5). For purposes of reducing the Payments to the Safe Harbor Amount, only amounts payable under this Agreement (and no other Payments) shall be reduced. If the reduction of the amount payable under this Agreement would not result in a reduction of the Parachute Value of all Payments to the Safe Harbor Amount, no amounts payable under the Agreement shall be reduced pursuant to this Section 8(a) and the Executive shall be entitled to the Gross-Up Payment.

The Accounting Firm shall provide detailed supporting calculations both to the Company and the Executive within 15 business days of the receipt of notice from the Executive that there has been a Payment or such earlier time as is requested by the Company. In the event that the Accounting Firm is serving as accountant or auditor for the individual, entity or group effecting the Change of Control, the Executive may appoint another nationally recognized accounting firm to make the determinations required hereunder (which accounting firm shall then be referred to as the Accounting Firm hereunder). All fees and
 
expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne solely by the Company. Any determination by the Accounting Firm shall be binding upon the Company and the Executive. As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 of the Code at the time of the initial determination by the Accounting Firm hereunder, it is possible that Gross-Up Payments that will not have been made by the Company should have been made (the "Underpayment"), consistent with the calculations required to be made hereunder. In the event the Company exhausts its remedies pursuant to Section 8(c) and the Executive thereafter is required to make a payment of any Excise Tax, the Accounting Firm shall determine the amount of the Underpayment that has occurred and any such Underpayment shall be promptly paid by the Company to or for the benefit of the Executive.
(c) The Executive shall notify the Company in writing of any claim by the Internal Revenue Service that, if successful, would require the payment by the Company of the Gross-Up Payment. Such notification shall be given as soon as practicable, but no later than 10 business days after the Executive is informed in writing of such claim. The Executive shall apprise the Company of the nature of such claim and the date on which such claim is requested to be paid. The Executive shall not pay such claim prior to the expiration of the 30-day period following the date on which the Executive gives such notice to the Company (or such shorter period ending on the date that any payment of taxes with respect to such claim is due). If the Company notifies the Executive in writing prior to the expiration of such period that the Company desires to contest such claim, the Executive shall:
(i) give the Company any information reasonably requested by the Company relating to such claim,
(ii) take such action in connection with contesting such claim as the Company shall reasonably request in writing from time to time, including, without limitation, accepting legal representation with respect to such claim by an attorney reasonably selected by the Company,
(iii) cooperate with the Company in good faith in order effectively to contest such claim; and
(iv) permit the Company to participate in any proceedings relating to such claim;

Without limitation on the foregoing provisions of this Section 8(c), the Company shall control all proceedings taken in connection with such contest, and, at its sole discretion, may pursue or forgo any and all administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings and conferences with the applicable taxing authority in respect of such claim and may, at its sole discretion, either pay the tax claimed to the appropriate taxing authority on behalf of the Executive and direct the Executive to sue for a refund or to contest the claim in any permissible manner, and the Executive agrees to prosecute such contest to a determination before any

Furthermore, the Company's control of the contest shall be limited to issues with respect to which the Gross-Up Payment would be payable hereunder, and the Executive shall be entitled to settle or contest, as the case may be, any other issue raised by the Internal Revenue Service or any other taxing authority.

If, after payment by the Company of an amount on the Executive's behalf pursuant to Section 8(c), a determination is made that the Executive shall not be entitled to any refund with respect to such claim and the Company does not notify the Executive in writing of its intent to contest such denial of refund prior to the expiration of 30 days after such determination, then the amount of such payment shall offset, to the extent thereof, the amount of Gross-Up Payment required to be paid.
