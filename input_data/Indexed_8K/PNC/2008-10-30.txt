Item 1.01     Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
     
On October 24, 2008, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. ("
PNC
") and National City Corporation ("
National City
"), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of October 24, 2008 (the "
Merger Agreement
"), pursuant to which National City will, subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, merge (the "
Merger
") with and into PNC, with PNC continuing as the surviving company.
     
Subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, which has been approved by the Boards of Directors of both companies, if the Merger is completed, each share of National City common stock will be converted into 0.0392 (the "
Exchange Ratio
") of a share of PNC common stock. Preferred stock of National City will be exchanged for preferred stock of PNC having substantially identical terms. In addition, as of the consummation of the Merger, outstanding National City stock options and other stock-based awards will be converted into stock options and other stock-based awards with respect to shares of PNC common stock, with adjustments to reflect the Exchange Ratio.
     
The Merger Agreement, included in this Report as Exhibit 2.1, contains (a) customary representations and warranties of National City and PNC, including, among others, with respect to: corporate organization, capitalization, corporate authority, third party and governmental consents and approvals, reports and regulatory matters, financial statements, broker's fees, absence of certain changes, compliance with law and information to be supplied for inclusion in the joint proxy statement/prospectus; and additional customary representations by National City, including with respect to: inapplicability of state takeover laws, employee matters, and receipt of a fairness opinion with respect to the merger consideration; (b) covenants of National City and PNC to conduct their respective businesses in the ordinary course until the Merger is completed; and (c) covenants of National City and PNC not to take certain actions during such period. National City has also agreed not to (i) solicit proposals relating to alternative business combination transactions or (ii) subject to certain exceptions, enter into discussions concerning, or provide confidential information in connection with, any proposals for alternative business combination transactions.
     
The representations and warranties of each party set forth in the Merger Agreement have been made solely for the benefit of the other party to the Merger Agreement. In addition, such representations and warranties (a) have been qualified by confidential disclosures made to the other party in connection with the Merger Agreement, (b) will not survive consummation of the Merger and cannot be the basis for any claims under the Merger Agreement by the other party after termination of the Merger Agreement except as a result of a knowing breach as of the date of the Merger Agreement, (c) are subject to the certain materiality qualifications which may differ from what may be viewed as material by investors, (d) were made only as of the date of the Merger Agreement or such other date as is specified in the Merger Agreement, and (e) may have been included in the Merger Agreement for the purpose of allocating risk be tween PNC and National City
rather than establishing matters as facts. Accordingly, the Merger Agreement is included with this filing only to provide investors with information regarding the terms of the Merger Agreement, and not to provide investors with any other factual information regarding the parties or their respective businesses. The Merger Agreement should not be read alone, but should instead be read in conjunction with the other information regarding the companies and the Merger that will be contained in, or incorporated by reference into, the joint proxy statement/prospectus that the parties will be filing in connection with the Merger, as well as in the Forms 10-K, Forms 10-Q and other filings that each of PNC and National City make with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("
SEC
").
     
The Board of Directors of PNC has adopted a resolution recommending approval of the issuance of PNC common stock in the Merger by its shareholders and PNC has agreed to submit a proposal for such issuance to its shareholders for consideration. The Board of Directors of National City has adopted a resolution recommending approval of the Merger and adoption by its stockholders and National City has agreed to submit the Merger Agreement to its stockholders for consideration.
     
Consummation of the Merger is subject to certain customary conditions, including, among others, approval of the stockholders of both PNC and National City, governmental filings and regulatory approvals and expiration of applicable waiting periods, accuracy of the representations and warranties of the other party (generally subject to a material adverse effect standard), and material compliance by the other party with its obligations under the Merger Agreement.
     
The Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights for National City and PNC, as the case may be, applicable upon: final, non-appealable denial of required regulatory approvals; the first anniversary of the date of the Merger Agreement if the Merger has not been completed by that time; a breach by the other party that is not or cannot be cured within 60 days' notice of such breach if such breach would result in a failure of the conditions to closing set forth in the Merger Agreement; by either PNC or National City if the other's shareholders fail to approve the transaction by the required vote and the terminating party's Board of Directors determines in good faith by a majority vote that the other party has substantially engaged in bad faith in breach of its obligations under the Merger Agreement to negotiate a restructuring of the transaction (it being understood that neither party sha ll have any obligation to alter or change the amount or kind of the merger consideration) and to resubmit the transaction to such party's shareholders for approval; or a failure by the Board of Directors of National City to recommend the Merger to its stockholders or a recommendation by the Board of Directors of National City to National City's stockholders of an alternative business combination transaction.
     
The foregoing description of the Merger and the Merger Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Merger Agreement, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 2.1, and is incorporated into this report by reference.

To the extent the amounts are so withheld by the Exchange Agent or Purchaser, as the case may be, and timely paid over to the appropriate Governmental Entity, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of shares of Company Common Stock in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made by the Exchange Agent or Purchaser, as the case may be.
     
(e)   After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of Company of the shares of Company Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time other than to settle transfers of Company Common Stock that occurred prior to the Effective Time.

(f)   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no fractional shares of Purchaser Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender of Certificates for exchange, no dividend or distribution with respect to Purchaser Common Stock shall be payable on or with respect to any fractional share, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of Purchaser. In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional share, Purchaser shall pay to each former stockholder of Company who otherwise would be entitled to receive such fractional share an amount in cash (rounded to the nearest cent) determined by multiplying (i) the average, rounded to the nearest one ten thousandth, of the closing sale prices of Purchaser Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange (the "
NYSE
") as reported by The Wall Street Journal for the five trading days immediately preceding the date of the Effective Time by (ii) the fraction of a share (after taking into account all shares of Company Common Stock held by such holder at the Effective Time and rounded to the nearest thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of Purchaser Common Stock to which such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to Section 1.4.
     
(g)   Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the stockholders of Company as of the first anniversary of the Effective Time may be paid to Purchaser. In such event, any former stockholders of Company who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Purchaser with respect to the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of any fractional shares and any unpaid dividends and distributions on the Purchaser Common Stock deliverable in respect of each share of Company Common Stock such stockholder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Purchaser, the Surviving Company, the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any amount delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to applicable aba ndoned property, escheat or similar laws.
     
(h)   In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by Purchaser or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as Purchaser may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.
     
Except as (i) Previously Disclosed or (ii) disclosed in any report, schedule, form or other document filed with, or furnished to, the SEC by Company prior to the date hereof and on or after the date on which the Company filed with the SEC its Annual Report on Form 10-K for its fiscal year ended December 31, 2006 (but excluding any risk factor disclosures contained under the heading "Risk Factors," any disclosure of risks included in any "forward-looking statements" disclaimer or any other statements that are similarly non-specific or predictive or forward-looking in nature), Company hereby represents and warrants to Purchaser as follows:

otherwise would run pursuant to this sentence shall run instead from the date on which any required notification periods have expired or been terminated or such approvals have been obtained and any requisite waiting period or periods shall have passed. Any exercise of the Option shall be deemed to occur on the Notice Date relating thereto.
     
(h)   At the closing referred to in subsection (g) of this Section 2, the Holder shall pay to Issuer the aggregate purchase price for the shares of Common Stock purchased pursuant to the exercise of the Option in immediately available funds by wire transfer to a bank account designated by Issuer,
provided

A copy of such agreement is on file at the principal office of Issuer and will be provided to the holder hereof without charge upon receipt by Issuer of a written request therefor."
It is understood and agreed that: (i) the reference to the resale restrictions of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "
1933 Act
"), in the above legend shall be removed by delivery of substitute certificate(s) without such reference if the Holder shall have delivered to Issuer a copy of a letter from the staff of the SEC, or an opinion of counsel, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Issuer, to the effect that such legend is not required for purposes of the 1933 Act; (ii) the reference to the provisions of this Agreement in the above legend shall be removed by delivery of substitute certificate(s) without such reference if the shares have been sold or transferred in compliance with the provisions of this Agreement and under circumstances that do not require the retention of such reference; and (iii) the legend shall be removed in its entirety if the conditions in the preceding clauses (i) and (ii) are both satisfied. In addition, such certificate(s) shall bear any other legend as may be required by law.

Common Stock shall not then be actually delivered to the Holder. Issuer shall pay all expenses, and any and all United States federal, state and local taxes and other charges, that may be payable in connection with the preparation, issuance and delivery of stock certificates under this Section 2 in the name of the Holder or its assignee, transferee or designee.

4.  
Exchange and Division of Option.
This Agreement (and the Option granted hereby) are exchangeable, without expense, at the option of the Holder, upon presentation and surrender of this Agreement at the principal office of Issuer, for other Agreements providing for Options of different denominations entitling the holder thereof to purchase, on the same terms and subject to the same conditions as are set forth herein, in the aggregate the same number of shares of Common Stock purchasable hereunder, in which event, the "Maximum Profit" in each agreement resulting from such exchange shall be allocated among the several agreements in proportion to the number of Option Shares issuable pursuant thereto so that the "Maximum Profit 48; for all such agreements shall equal $224,000,000, and (ii) such other adjustments, if any, shall be made as are necessary to preserve the overall economic impact and intent of this Agreement (including Section 16 hereof). The terms "
Agreement
" and "
Option
" as used herein include any Stock Option Agreements and related Options for which this Agreement (and the Option granted hereby) may be exchanged, and the term "
Grantee
", with respect to any such Stock Option Agreement and related Option, shall include the Holder of such Option resulting from such exchang e.

Any such new Agreement executed and delivered shall constitute an additional contractual obligation on the part of Issuer, whether or not the Agreement so lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated shall at any time be enforceable by anyone.
     
5.  
Certain Adjustment
s. In addition to the adjustment in the number of shares of Common Stock that are purchasable upon exercise of the Option pursuant to Section 1 of this Agreement, the number of shares of Common Stock purchasable upon the exercise of the Option and the Option Price shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as provided in this
Section 5. In the event of any change in, or distributions in respect of, the Common Stock by reason of stock dividends, split-ups, mergers, recapitalizations, combinations, subdivisions, conversions, exchanges of shares, distributions on or in respect of the Common Stock that would be prohibited under the terms of the Merger Agreement, or the like, the type and number of shares of Common Stock purchasable upon exercise hereof and the Option Price shall be appropriately adjusted in such manner as shall fully preserve the economic benefits provided hereunder and proper provision shall be made in any agreement governing any such transaction to provide for such proper adjustment and the full satisfaction of the Issuer's obligations hereunder.
     
6.  
Registration Rights
. Upon the occurrence of a Subsequent Triggering Event that occurs prior to an Exercise Termination Event, Issuer shall, at the request of Grantee delivered within 180 days of such Subsequent Triggering Event (whether on its own behalf or on behalf of any subsequent holder of this Option (or part thereof) or any of the shares of Common Stock issued pursuant hereto), promptly prepare, file and keep current a shelf registration statement under the 1933 Act covering this Option and any shares issued and issuable pursuant to this Option and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such registration statement to become effective and remain current in order to permit the sale or other disposition of this Option and any s hares of Common Stock issued upon total or partial exercise of this Option ("
Option Shares
") in accordance with any plan of disposition requested by Grantee. Issuer will use its reasonable best efforts to cause such registration statement first to become effective and then to remain effective for such period not in excess of 180 days from the day such registration statement first becomes effective or such shorter time as may be reasonably necessary to effect such sales or other dispositions. Grantee shall have the right to demand two such registrations. The Issuer shall bear the costs of such registrations (including, but not limited to, Issuer's attorneys' fees, printing costs and filing fees, except for the fees and disbursements of Grantee's counsel related thereto). The foregoing notwithstanding, if, at the time of any request by Gra ntee for registration of the Option or Option Shares as provided above, Issuer is in registration with respect to an underwritten public offering of shares of Common Stock, and if in the good faith judgment of the managing underwriter or managing underwriters, or, if none, the sole underwriter or underwriters, of such offering the inclusion of the Holder's Option or Option Shares would interfere with the successful marketing of the shares of Common Stock offered by Issuer, the number of Option Shares otherwise to be covered in the registration statement contemplated hereby may be reduced;
provided
,
however
, that after any such required reduction the number of Option Shares to be included in such offering for the account of the Holder shall constitute at least 25% of the total number of shares to be sold by the Holder and Issuer in the aggregate; and
provided further
,
however
, that if such reduction occurs, then the Issuer shall file a registration statement for the balance as promptly as practicable and no reduction shall thereafter occur. Each such Holder shall provide all information reasonably requested by Issuer for inclusion in any registration statement to be filed hereunder. If requested by any such Holder in connection with such registration, Issuer shall become a party to any underwriting agreement relating to the sale of such shares, but only to the extent of obligating itself in respect of representations, warranties, indemnities and other agreements customarily included in secondary offering underwriting agreements for the Issuer. Upon receiving any request under this Section 6 from any Holder, Issuer agrees to send a copy thereof to any other person known to Issuer to be entitled to registration rights under this Section 6, in each case by promptly mailing the same, postage prepaid, to the address of record of the persons entitled to receive such copies.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in no event shall Issuer be obligated to effect more than two registrations pursuant to this Section 6 by reason of the fact that there shall be more than one Grantee as a result of any assignment or division of this Agreement.
     
7.

Option Repurchase Price
") equal to the product of the number of shares for which this Option may then be exercised multiplied by the amount by which (A) the Market/Offer Price (as hereinafter defined) exceeds (B) the Option Price, and (ii) at the request of the owner of Option Shares fro m time to time (the "
Owner
"), delivered prior to an Exercise Termination Event and within 90 days after the occurrence of a Repurchase Event, Issuer (or any successor thereto) shall repurchase immediately after such request from the Owner such number of the Option Shares from the Owner as the Owner shall designate at a price (the "
Option Share Repurchase Price
") equal to the Market/Offer Price multiplied by the number of Option Shares so designated. The term "
Market/Offer Price
" shall mean the highest of (i) the price per share of Common Stock at which a tender offer or exchange offer therefor has been made, (ii) the price per share of Common Stock to be paid by any third party pursuant to an agreement with Issuer, (iii) the highest closing price for shares of Common Stock within the six-month period immediately preceding the date the Holder gives notice of the required repurchase of this Option or the Owner gives notice of the required repurchase of Option Shares, as the case may be, and (iv) in the event of a sale of all or a substantial portion of Issuer's assets, the sum of the price paid in such sale for such assets and the current market value of the remaining assets of Issuer as determined by a nationally recognized investment banking firm selected by the Holder or the Owner, as the case may be, and reasonably acceptable to Issuer, divided by the number of shares of Common Stock of Issuer outstanding at the time of such sale. In determining the Market/Offer Price, the value of consideration other than cash shall be determined by a nationally recognized investme nt banking firm selected by the Holder or Owner, as the case may be, and reasonably acceptable to the Issuer.

Within five business days after the surrender of the Option and/or certificates representing Option Shares and the receipt of such notice or notices relating thereto, Issuer shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the Holder the Option Repurchase Price and/or to the Owner the Option Share Repurchase Price therefor or the portion thereof, if any, that Issuer is not then prohib ited under applicable law and regulation from so delivering.
     
(c)   To the extent that Issuer is prohibited under applicable law or regulation from repurchasing the Option and/or the Option Shares to the full extent requested by the Holder or Owner, as the case may be, Issuer shall immediately so notify the Holder and/or the Owner and thereafter deliver or cause to be delivered, from time to time, to the Holder and/or the Owner, as appropriate, the portion of the Option Repurchase Price and the Option Share
Repurchase Price, respectively, that it is no longer prohibited from delivering, within five business days after the date on which Issuer is no longer so prohibited;
provided
,
however
, that if Issuer at any time after delivery of a notice of repurchase pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section 7 is prohibited under applicable law or regulation from delivering to the Holder and/or the Owner, as appropriate, the Option Repurchase Price and the Option Share Repurchase Price, respectively, to said full extent (and Issuer hereby undertakes to use its reasonable best efforts to obtain all required regulatory and legal approvals and to file any required notices, in each case as promptly as practicable in order to accomplish such repurchase), the Holder or Owner may revoke its notice of repurchase of the Option or the Option Shares either in whole or to the extent of the prohibition, whereupon, in the latter case, Issuer shall promptly (i) deliver to the Holder and/or the Owner, as appropriate, that portion of the Option Repurchase Price or the Option Share Repurchase Price that Issuer is not prohibited from delivering; and (ii) deliver, as appropriate, either (A) to the Holder, a new Stock Option Agreement evidencing the right of the Holder to purchase that number of shares of Common Stock obtained by multiplying the number of shares of Common Stock for which the surrendered Stock Option Agreement was exercisable at the time of delivery of the notice of repurchase by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Option Repurchase Price less the portion thereof theretofore delivered to the Holder and the denominator of which is the Option Repurchase Price, or (B) to the Owner, a certificate for the Option Shares it is then so prohibited from repurchasing.
     
(d)   For purposes of this Section 7, a "
Repurchase Event
" shall be deemed to have occurred upon the consummation of (i) a merger, consolidation, reorganization or other transaction involving Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries as a result of which the holders of the Issuer Common Stock prior to such transaction (by virtue of their ownership of such stock) cease to own, in the aggregate, at least 50% of the total voting power of the entity surviving or resulting from such transaction (or, if applicable, the ultimate parent thereof), (ii) any sale of more than 50% of the consolidated assets (including stock of its Subsidiaries) of Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (iii) any issuance or sale of, or tender or exchange offer for, voting secu rities of Issuer resulting in the ownership by any Person of more than 50% of the total voting power of Issuer (unless the stockholders of Issuer immediately prior to such transaction would own in the aggregate more than 50% of such acquiring Person).
     
8.   
Substitute Option.   
(a) In the event that, prior to an Exercise Termination Event, Issuer shall enter into an agreement (i) to consolidate with or merge into any person, other than Grantee or a Grantee Subsidiary, and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation of such consolidation or merger, (ii) to permit any person, other than Grantee or a Grantee Subsidiary, to merge into Issuer and Issuer shall be the continuing or surviving corporation, but, in connection with such merger, the then outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be changed into or exchanged for stock or other securities of any other person or cash or any other property or the then outstanding shares of Common Stock shall after such merger represent less than 50% of the outstanding voting shares and voting share equivalents of the merged company, or (iii) to sell or otherwise transfer all or substantially all of its assets to any person, other than Grantee or a Grantee Subsidiary, then, and in each such case, the agreement governing such transaction shall make proper provision so that the Option shall, upon the consummation of any such transaction and upon the terms and conditions set forth herein, be converted into, or exchanged for, an option (the "
Substitute Option
"), at the election of the Holder, of either (x) the Acquiring Corporation (as hereinafter defined) or (y) any person that controls the Acquiring Corporation.

The issuer of the Substitute Option shall also ent er into an agreement with the then Holder or Holders of the Substitute Option in substantially the same form as this Agreement, which shall be applicable to the Substitute Option.
     
(d)   The Substitute Option shall be exercisable for such number of shares of Substitute Common Stock as is equal to the Assigned Value multiplied by the number of shares of Common Stock for which the Option is then exercisable, divided by the Average Price. The exercise price of the Substitute Option per share of Substitute Common Stock shall then be equal to the Option Price multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock for which the Option is then exercisable and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Substitute Common Stock for which the Substitute Option is exercisable.
     
(e)   In no event, pursuant to any of the foregoing paragraphs, shall the Substitute Option be exercisable for more than 19.9% of the shares of Substitute Common Stock outstanding prior to exercise of the Substitute Option. In the event that the Substitute Option
