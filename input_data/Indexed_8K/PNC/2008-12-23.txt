(ii) the statements set forth in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus under the caption "Certain Terms of the Senior Notes" and "Certain Terms of the Senior NotesFDIC Guarantee under the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program", insofar as they purport to describe the provisions of the laws and documents referred to therein, fairly and accurately summarize in all material respects the matters described therein;

(e) The Guarantor shall have furnished to the Representatives a certificate of the Guarantor, signed by the Chairman of the Board, the President, a Vice Chairman of the Board or any Executive or Senior Vice President and the principal financial or accounting officer of the Guarantor, dated the Closing Date, to the effect that the signers of such certificate have carefully examined the Registration Statement, Pricing Disclosure Package, the Final Prospectus, any supplement to the Final Prospectus and this Agreement and that:
(i) the representations and warranties of the Company and the Guarantor in this Agreement are true and correct on and as of the Closing Date with the same effect as if made on the Closing Date and the Company and the Guarantor have complied with all the agreements and satisfied all the conditions on its part to be performed or satisfied at or prior to the Closing Date;
 
(ii) no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or, to the Guarantor's knowledge, threatened; and
(iii) since the date of the most recent financial statements incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto), there has been no material adverse change in the condition (financial or other), earnings, business or properties of the Guarantor and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, whether or not arising from transactions in the ordinary course of business, except as set forth in or contemplated in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package (exclusive of any supplement thereto) and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto).
(f) On or subsequent to the Applicable Time or, if earlier, the dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement (exclusive of any amendment thereof), the Pricing Disclosure Package (exclusive of any supplement thereof) and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto), there shall not have been (i) with respect to the period subsequent to the date of the most recent audited or unaudited consolidated financial statements incorporated in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus, at December 16, 2008, any increases in borrowed funds of the Guarantor and its subsidiaries or any decreases in the capital stock (defined as each of the individual dollar amounts of preferred stock, common stock, and capital surplus) of the Guarantor or the shareholders' equity of the Guarantor as compared with the amounts shown on the most recent consolidated balance sheet incorporated in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus, or for the period from the date of the most recent audited or unaudited consolidated financial statements incorporated in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus to December 16, 2008 any decreases, as compared with the corresponding period in the preceding year, in consolidated net interest income or in total or per-share amounts of income before extraordinary items or of net income of the Guarantor, except in all instances for changes or decreases disclosed to the Underwriters in a letter from the Guarantor, which letter shall be accompanied by an explanation by the Guarantor as to the significance thereof unless said explanation is not deemed necessary by the Representatives, or (ii) any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the business or properties of the Guarantor and its subsidiaries the effect of which, in any case referred to in clause (i) or (ii) above, is, in the judgment of the Representatives, so material and adverse as to make it impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or the delivery of the Securities as contemplated by the Registration Statement (exclusive of any amendment thereof), the Pricing Disclosure Package (exclusive of any supplement thereto) and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto).
 
(g) On or subsequent to the Applicable Time, there shall not have been any decrease in the ratings of any of the Guarantor's debt securities by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" (as such term is defined by the Commission for the purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Act), or any public announcement that any such organization has under surveillance or review the ratings of any of the Guarantor's debt securities (other than an announcement with positive implications of a possible upgrading, and no implication of a possible downgrading, of such rating), and if, in any such case, the effect thereof in the judgment of the Representatives makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the purchase of the Securities.
(h) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company and the Guarantor shall have furnished to the Representatives such further information, certificates and documents as the Representatives may reasonably request in connection with the offering of the Securities.
If any of the conditions specified in this Section 6 shall not have been fulfilled when and as provided in this Agreement, or if any of the opinions and certificates mentioned above or elsewhere in this Agreement shall not be reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Representatives and counsel for the Underwriters, this Agreement and all obligations of the Underwriters hereunder may be canceled at, or at any time prior to, the Closing Date by the Representatives. Notice of such cancellation shall be given to the Company in writing or by telephone or telegraph confirmed in writing.
Section 7. . If the sale of the Securities provided for herein is not consummated because any condition to the obligations of the Underwriters set forth in Section 6 hereof is not satisfied, because of any termination pursuant to Section 10 hereof or because of any refusal, inability or failure on the part of the Company or the Guarantor to perform any agreement herein or comply with any provision hereof other than by reason of a default by any of the Underwriters, the Company and the Guarantor will reimburse the Underwriters severally upon demand for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) that shall have been incurred by them in connection with the proposed purchase and sale of the Securities. In no event shall the Company or the Guarantor be liable to the Underwriters for loss of anticipated profits from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Reimbursement of Underwriters' Expenses

(a) The Company and the Guarantor jointly and severally agree to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter and each person who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or other Federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or
Indemnification and Contribution
 
otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the registration statement for the registration of the Securities as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or in the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Final Prospectus, the Pricing Disclosure Package or the Final Prospectus, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or any "issuer information" filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; , , that the Company and the Guarantor will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company and the Guarantor by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for use in connection with the preparation thereof, or that part of the Registration Statement constituting the "Statement of Eligibility and Qualification" (Form T-1) of the Trustee under the Trust Indenture Act. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company and the Guarantor may otherwise have.
provided
however
(b) Each Underwriter severally agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company and the Guarantor, each of their respective directors, each of their respective officers who signs the Registration Statement, and each person who controls the Company or the Guarantor within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company and the Guarantor to each Underwriter, but only with reference to written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company and the Guarantor by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for use in the preparation of the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which any Underwriter may otherwise have. The Company and the Guarantor acknowledge that the statements set forth in the last paragraph of the cover page, and, under the heading "Underwriting" (i) the list of Underwriters and their respective participation in the sale of the Securities, (ii) the sentences related to discounts and commissions and (iii) the paragraphs related to stabilization and syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids in any Preliminary Final Prospectus or the Final Prospectus constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the several Underwriters for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity, and you, as the Representatives, confirm that such statements are correct.
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 8 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 8, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve it from any liability hereunder to the extent it is not materially prejudiced as a result thereof and in any event
 
shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 8. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein, and to the extent that it may elect by written notice delivered to the indemnified party promptly after receiving the aforesaid notice from such indemnified party, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party; , , that if the defendants in any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, the indemnified party or parties shall have the right to select separate counsel to assert such legal defenses and to otherwise participate in the defense of such action on behalf of such indemnified party or parties. Upon receipt of notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense of such action and approval by the indemnified party of such counsel, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section 8 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof unless (i) the indemnified party shall have employed separate counsel in accordance with the proviso to the next preceding sentence (it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel (plus any local counsel), approved by the Representatives in the case of paragraph (a) of this Section 8, representing the indemnified parties under such paragraph (a) who are parties to such action), (ii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of commencement of the action or (iii) the indemnifying party has authorized the employment of counsel for the indemnified party at the expense of the indemnifying party; and except that, if clause (i) or (iii) is applicable, such liability shall be only in respect of the counsel referred to in such clause (i) or (iii). No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution could be sought under this Section 8 (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.

however
(d) In order to provide for just and equitable contribution in circumstances in which the indemnification provided for in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 8 is unavailable, the Company and the Guarantor, on the one hand, and the Underwriters severally, on the other hand, shall contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending same) to which the Company, the Guarantor and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject in proportion to the relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantor on the one hand and the Underwriters on the
 
other from the offering of the Securities, such that the Underwriters are responsible for that portion represented by the percentage that the underwriting discount bears to the sum of such discount and the purchase price of the Securities specified in Schedules I-A and I-B hereto and the Company and the Guarantor are responsible for the balance; , , that in no case shall any Underwriter (except as may be provided in any agreement among underwriters relating to the offering of the Securities) be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount applicable to the Securities purchased by such Underwriter hereunder. If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Company and the Guarantor, on the one hand, and the Underwriters severally, on the other, shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits as described in the immediately preceding sentence but also the relative fault of the Company and the Guarantor on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages and liabilities as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the Company or the Guarantor on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Company, the Guarantor and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 8, each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of the Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of the Company and the Guarantor who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Company and the Guarantor shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company and the Guarantor, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (d). Any party entitled to contribution will, promptly after receipt of notice of commencement of any action, suit or proceeding against such party in respect of which a claim for contribution may be made against another party or parties under this paragraph (d), notify such party or parties from whom contribution may be sought, but the omission to so notify such party or parties shall not relieve the party or parties from whom contribution may be sought from any other obligation it or they may have hereunder or otherwise than under this paragraph (d).

however
Section 9. . If any one or more Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Securities agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter or Underwriters hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the amount of Securities set forth opposite their names in Schedule II hereto bears to the aggregate amount of Securities set forth opposite
Default by an Underwriter
 
the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase; , , that in the event that the aggregate amount of Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate amount of Securities set forth in Schedule II hereto, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Securities, and if such non-defaulting Underwriters do not purchase all the Securities, this Agreement will terminate without liability to any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company or the Guarantor. In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 9, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding seven days, as the Representatives shall determine in order that the required changes in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Company and any non-defaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder.
provided
however
Section 10. . This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Representatives, by notice given to the Company and the Guarantor prior to delivery of and payment for the Securities, if prior to such time (i) trading in the Guarantor's Common Stock shall have been suspended by the Commission or The New York Stock Exchange or trading in securities generally on The New York Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ Global Market shall have been suspended or limited or minimum prices shall have been established on such exchange, (ii) a banking moratorium shall have been declared either by Federal, New York State or Pennsylvania authorities, (iii) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war or other calamity or crisis, economic or otherwise or (iv) a material disruption has occurred in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States, the effect of which on the financial markets of the United States or any foreign jurisdiction in which the Securities are to be marketed is such as to make it, in the judgment of the Representatives, impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offering, sale or delivery of the Securities.
Termination
Section 11. . The respective agreements, representations, warranties, indemnities and other statements of the Company, the Guarantor or their respective officers and of the Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or the Company or the Guarantor or any of the officers, directors or controlling persons referred to in Section 8 hereof, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Securities. The provisions of Sections 7 and 8 hereof shall survive the termination or cancellation of this Agreement.
Representations and Indemnities to Survive
Section 12. .

PNC FUNDING CORP, a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of Pennsylvania (herein called the "Company," which term includes any successor corporation under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), for value received, hereby promises to pay to CEDE & Co., or registered assigns, the principal sum of Dollars on June 22, 2011, and to pay interest thereon from and including December 22, 2008 or from the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, semiannually in arrears on June 22 and December 22 of each year, commencing June 22, 2009 (each an "Interest Payment Date") and at maturity, at the rate of 1.875% per annum, until the principal hereof is paid or made available for payment, and (to the extent that the payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable) at the same rate per annum on any overdue principal and premium and on any overdue installment of interest. Interest shall accrue from and including December 22, 2008, to, but excluding the first Interest Payment Date and then from, and including, the immediately preceding Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, to, but excluding, the next Interest Payment Date or the maturity date, as the case may be. Each of these periods is referred to as an "interest period." Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date, subject to certain exceptions, will, as provided in such Indenture, be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest, which shall be June 7 or December 7 (whether or not a Business Day), as the case may be, immediately preceding such Interest Payment Date. However, interest payable on the maturity date will be paid to the person to whom the principal will be payable. Any such interest not so punctually paid or duly provided for will forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on such Regular Record Date and may either be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the Trustee, notice whereof shall be given to Holders of this Security not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date, or be paid at any time in any other lawful manner acceptable to the Trustee and not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which this Security may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in said Indenture.
            
If an interest payment date or the maturity date for this Security falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the Company will postpone the interest payment or the payment of principal and interest at maturity to the next succeeding Business Day, but the payments made on such dates will be treated as being made on the date that the payment was first due and the Holder will not be entitled to any further interest or other payments with respect to such postponements.
 
"Business Day" means any day except a Saturday, a Sunday or a legal holiday in the City of New York or the City of Pittsburgh on which banking institutions are authorized or obligated by law, regulation or executive order to close.
This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (herein called the "Securities" or "Notes"), issued and to be issued in one or more series under an Indenture, dated as of December 1, 1991, among the Company, PNC Financial Corp (also known as "PNC Bank Corp." and now known as "The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.") (the "Guarantor") and The Bank of New York Mellon (formerly known as The Bank of New York) as successor in interest to JPMorgan Chase Bank (formerly known as The Chase Manhattan Bank), as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee," which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture) as amended by a Supplemental Indenture dated as of February 15, 1993 by and among the Company, the Guarantor and the Trustee, as further amended by a Second Supplemental Indenture dated as of February 15, 2000 by and among the Company, the Guarantor and the Trustee, as further amended by a Third Supplemental Indenture dated as of December 19, 2008 by and among the Company, the Guarantor and the Trustee (the "Third Supplemental Indenture") (such Indenture as amended being herein called the "Indenture"), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Security is one of the series designated above, initially issued in the aggregate principal amount of $500,000,000, which principal amount may be increased from time to time through the issuance of additional Notes as the Company may determine or as provided for in the Indenture.
If the beneficial owner of this Security is not a United States Alien (as defined below), payments of principal and interest in respect of this Security shall be made free and clear of, and without withholding or deduction for, any taxes, duties, assessments or government charges of whatever nature imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed by or within the United States (as defined below) or any authority therein or thereof having power to tax, unless such withholding or deduction is required by law.
If the beneficial owner of this Security is a United States Alien and the Company is required by law to make any such withholding or deduction, the Company will pay all additional amounts that may be necessary so that every Net Payment (as defined below) of the principal of or interest on this Security to such beneficial owner will not be less than the amount provided for in this Security to be then due and payable ("Additional Amounts"); , , that the Company shall have no obligation to pay Additional Amounts for or on account of any one or more of the following:
provided
however
(i) any tax, assessment or other governmental charge imposed solely because at any time there is or was a connection between such beneficial owner (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary or member of such beneficial owner, if such beneficial owner is an estate, trust or partnership) and the United States (other than the mere receipt of a payment on, or the ownership or holding of, a Security), including because such beneficial owner (or such fiduciary,
 
settlor, beneficiary or member) at any time, for U.S. federal income tax purposes: (a) is or was a citizen or resident, or is or was treated as a resident, of the United States, (b) is or was present in the United States, (c) is or was engaged in a trade or business in the United States, (d) has or had a permanent establishment in the United States, (e) is or was a domestic or foreign personal holding company, a passive foreign investment company or a controlled foreign corporation, (f) is or was a corporation that accumulates earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax or (g) is or was a "10-percent shareholder" of the Company as defined in section 871(h)(3) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code or any successor provision;
(ii) any tax, assessment or governmental charge imposed solely because of a change in applicable law or regulation, or in any official interpretation or application of applicable law or regulation, that becomes effective more than 15 days after the day on which the payment becomes due or is made available, whichever occurs later;
(iii) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, excise, transfer, wealth or personal property tax or any similar tax, assessment or other governmental charge;
(iv) any tax, assessment or other governmental charge imposed solely because such beneficial owner or any other Person fails to comply with any certification, identification or other reporting requirement concerning the nationality, residence, identity or connection with the United States of the Holder or any beneficial owner of this Security, if compliance is required by statute, by regulation of the U.S. Treasury Department or by an applicable income tax treaty to which the United States is a party, as a precondition to exemption from such tax, assessment or other governmental charge;
(v) any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that can be paid other than by deduction or withholding from a payment on this Security;
(vi) any tax, assessment or other governmental charge imposed solely because the payment is to be made by a particular Paying Agent (which term may include the Company) and would not be imposed if made by another Paying Agent (which term may include the Company);
(vii) by or on behalf of a Holder who would be able to avoid such withholding or deduction by presenting this Security to another Paying Agent in a Member State of the European Union;
(viii) any tax, assessment or other governmental charge imposed solely because the Holder (1) is a bank purchasing this Security in the ordinary course of its lending business or (2) is a bank that is neither (A) buying this Security for investment purposes only nor (B) buying this Security for resale to a third party that either is not a bank or holding the note for investment purposes only; or
(ix) any combination of the taxes, assessments or other governmental charges described in items (i) through (viii) of this paragraph.
Additional Amounts also will not be paid with respect to any payment of principal of or interest on this Security to any United States Alien who is a fiduciary or a partnership, or who is not the sole beneficial owner of any such payment, to the extent that the Company would
 
not be required to pay Additional Amounts to any beneficiary or settlor of such fiduciary or any member of such a partnership, or to any beneficial owner of the payment, if that Person had been treated as the beneficial owner of this Security for this purpose.
Except as specifically provided herein, the Company shall not be required to make any payment with respect to any tax, assessment or other governmental charge imposed by any government or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein.
Whenever in this Security (or in the Indenture, including in Sections 701(a)(1) and 701(a)(2) thereof, insofar as applicable to this Security) there is a reference, in any context, to the payment of the principal of or interest on this Security, such mention shall be deemed to include mention of any payment of Additional Amounts to United States Aliens in respect of such payment of principal or interest to the extent that, in such context, such Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof. Express mention of the payment of Additional Amounts in this Security shall not be construed as excluding Additional Amounts in the provisions of this Security where such express mention is not made.
This Security may be redeemed, as a whole but not in part, at the option of the Company, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Security to be redeemed, together with interest accrued to the date fixed for redemption, if, as a result of any amendment to, or change in, the laws or regulations of any U.S. Taxing Authority (as defined below), or any amendment to or change in any official interpretation or application of such laws or regulations, which amendment or change becomes effective or is announced on or after December 22, 2008, the Company will become obligated to pay, on the next interest payment date, Additional Amounts in respect of this Security. If the Company becomes entitled to redeem this Security, it may do so on any day thereafter pursuant to the Indenture; provided, however, that (1) the Company gives the Holder of this Security notice of such redemption not more than 60 days nor less than 30 days prior to the date fixed for redemption as provided in the Original Indenture, (2) no such notice of redemption may be given earlier than 90 days prior to the next interest payment date on which the Company would be obligated to pay such Additional Amounts and (3) at the time such notice is given, such obligation to pay such Additional Amounts remains in effect. Immediately prior to the giving of any notice of redemption of this Security pursuant to this paragraph, the Company will deliver to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate stating that the Company is entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth in reasonable detail a statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to the right of the Company to so redeem this Security have occurred. Interest installments due on or prior to a Redemption Date will be payable to the Holder of this Security or one or more Predecessor Securities, of record at the close of business on the relevant record date, all as provided in the Indenture.

The term "United
 
States" means the United States of America (including the states thereof and the District of Columbia), together with the territories, possessions and all other areas subject to the jurisdiction of the United States of America. The term "U.S. Taxing Authority" means the United States of America or any state, other jurisdiction or taxing authority in the United States. The term "Net Amount" means the amount the Company or its Paying Agent pays on this Security after deduction or withholding for or on account of any present or future tax, assessment or governmental charge imposed with respect to such payment by any U.S. Taxing Authority.
There shall not be deemed to be an Event of Default under this Security which would permit or result in the acceleration of amounts due under this Security, if such an Event of Default is due solely to the failure of the Company to make timely payment on this Security provided that the FDIC is making timely guarantee payments with respect to this Security in accordance with the Debt Guarantee Program (as defined below). Subject to the foregoing, under no circumstances shall an Event of Default specified in Sections 7.01(a)(3) or 7.01(a)(4) of the Indenture result in any acceleration of the amounts due under this Security.
If an Event of Default concerning: (1) default (a) by the Company in the payment of interest, if any, upon any Security of this series when it becomes due and payable and continuance of such default for a period of 30 days and (b) by the FDIC in the payment of interest, if any, upon any Security of this series in accordance with the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (12 C.F.R. Part 370); or (2) default (a) by the Company in the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any, on) any Security of this series at its Maturity and (b) by the FDIC in the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any, on) any Security of this series in accordance with the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (12 C.F.R. Part 370) shall occur and is continuing, the principal of this Security may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture. Upon payment (i) of the amount of principal so declared due and payable and (ii) of interest on any overdue principal and overdue interest (in each case to the extent that the payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable), all of the Company's obligations in respect of the payment of the principal of and interest, if any, on this Security shall terminate.
Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee hereinafter referred to, by manual signature, this Security shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.
The indebtedness of the Company evidenced by this Security, including the principal thereof and interest thereon, is, to the extent and in the manner set forth in the Indenture, senior in right of payment to its obligations to Holders of Subordinated Debt Securities and Existing Company Subordinated Indebtedness (each as defined in the Indenture) and shall rank in right of payment with each other and with Senior Company Indebtedness (as defined in the Indenture), as provided in the Indenture, and each Holder of this Security, by the acceptance hereof, agrees to and shall be bound by such provisions of the Indenture.

The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the
 
Guarantor and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of any series under the Indenture at any time by the Company, the Guarantor and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Securities of all series (voting as one class) to be affected by such amendment or modification; provided, however, that the express written consent of the FDIC will be required to amend, modify or waive any provision of this Security or the provisions of the Indenture relating to principal, interest, default or ranking provisions of such Securities; any provisions of this Security or the Indenture required to be included by a "Master Agreement" between the Company and the FDIC relating to the Company's participation in the "Debt Guarantee Program" component of the FDIC's Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program; or any other provision that would require the consent of all Holders of the Securities. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company or the Guarantor with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest (if any) on this Security at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
This Security is issuable only in registered form without coupons in denominations of $2,000 and any integral multiples of $1,000 thereof. This Security is a global security, represented by one or more permanent global certificates registered in the name of the nominee of The Depository Trust Company (each a "Global Note" and collectively, the "Global Notes"). Accordingly, unless and until it is exchanged in whole or in part for individual certificates evidencing the Securities represented hereby, this Security may not be transferred except as a whole by The Depositary Trust Company (the "Depositary") to a nominee of such Depositary or by a nominee of such Depositary or by the Depositary or any nominee to a successor Depositary or any nominee of such successor. Ownership of beneficial interests in this Security will be shown on, and the transfer of that ownership will be effected only through, records maintained by the applicable Depositary or its nominee (with respect to interest of persons that have accounts with the Depositary ("Participants") and the records of Participants (with respect to interests of persons other than Participants)). Beneficial interests in Securities by persons that hold through Participants will be evidenced only by, and transfers of such beneficial interests with such Participants will be effected only through, records maintained by such Participants. Except as provided below, owners of beneficial interests in this Security will not be entitled to have any individual certificates and will not be considered the owners or Holders thereof under the Indenture.
Except in the limited circumstances set forth herein, Participants and owners of beneficial interests in the Global Notes will not be entitled to receive Securities in definitive form and will not be considered Holders of Securities. If the Depositary is at any time unwilling,
 
unable or ineligible to continue as Depositary and a successor Depositary is not appointed by the Company within 90 days, or an event of default has occurred and is continuing, and the Depositary requests the issuance of certificated notes, the Company will issue individual certificates evidencing the Securities represented hereby in definitive form in exchange for this Security in registered form to each person that the Depositary identifies as the beneficial owner of the Securities represented by the Global Notes upon surrender by the Depositary of the Global Notes. In addition, the Company may at any time and in its sole discretion determine not to have any Securities represented by one or more global securities and, in such event, will issue individual certificates evidencing Securities in definitive form in exchange for this Security. In any such instance, an owner of a beneficial interest in a Security will be entitled to physical delivery in certificated form of Securities equal in principal amount to such beneficial interest and to have such Securities registered in its name. This Security shall be issued in certificated form, will be issued in denominations of $2,000 and any integral multiples of $1,000 thereof and will be issued in registered form only, without coupons. Neither the Company nor the principal paying agent will be liable for any delay by the Depositary, its nominee or any direct or indirect participant in identifying the beneficial owners of the related Securities. The Company and the principal payment agent may conclusively rely on, and will be protected in relying on, instructions from the Depositary or its nominee for all purposes, including with respect to the registration and delivery, and the respective principal amounts, of the Securities to be issued.
Except as provided herein, beneficial owners of Global Notes will not be entitled to receive physical delivery of Securities in definitive form and no Global Note will be exchangeable except for another Global Note of like denomination and tenor to be registered in the name of the Depositary or its nominee. Accordingly, each person owning a beneficial interest in a Global Note must rely on the procedures of the Depositary and, if such person is not a Participant, on the procedures of the Participant through which such person owns its interest, to exercise any rights of a Holder under the Securities.
Beneficial interests in the Global Notes will be represented through book-entry accounts of financial institutions acting on behalf of beneficial owners as direct and indirect participants in the Depositary. Investors may elect to hold interests in the Global Notes through the Depositary, either directly if they are Participants of such system or indirectly through organizations that are Participants in such system.
The laws of some jurisdictions may require that purchasers of securities take physical delivery of those securities in definitive form. Accordingly, the ability to transfer interests in the Securities represented by a Global Note to those persons may be limited. In addition, because the Depositary can act only on behalf of its Participants, who in turn act on behalf of persons who hold interests through Participants, the ability of a person having an interest in Securities represented by a Global Note to pledge or transfer such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the Depositary's system, or otherwise to take actions in respect of such interest, may be affected by the lack of a physical definitive security in respect of such interest.
Neither the Company, the Trustee, the principal paying agent nor any Security Registrar will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of Securities by the Depositary, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records of the Depositary relating to the Securities.
 
The Bank of New York Mellon will act as the Company's principal paying agent with respect to the Securities through its offices presently located at 101 Barclay Street8W, New York, New York 10286. The Company may at any time rescind the designation of a paying agent, appoint a successor paying agent, or approve a change in the office through which any paying agent acts. Payments of interest and principal may be made by wire-transfer in immediately available funds for Securities held in book-entry form or, at the Company's option in the event the Securities are not represented by Global Notes, by check mailed to the address of the person entitled to the payment as it appears in the Security register. Payment of principal will be made upon the surrender of the relevant Securities at the offices of the principal paying agent.
Notices to the Holders of registered Securities will be mailed to them at their respective addresses in the register of the Securities and will be deemed to have been given on the fourth weekday (being a day other than Saturday or Sunday) after the date of mailing.
The Indenture contains provisions setting forth certain conditions to the institution of proceedings by the Holders of Securities with respect to the Indenture or for any remedy under the Indenture.
All terms used in this Security which are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.
The Trustee is hereby designated and the Holder of this Security, by its acceptance hereof, shall be deemed to have appointed the Trustee, as the duly authorized representative of the Holder for purposes of making claims and taking other permitted or required actions under the Debt Guarantee Program (the "Representative"). The Holder hereby authorizes and directs the Representative, at such time as the FDIC shall commence making any guarantee payments to the Representative for the benefit of such Holder pursuant to the Debt Guarantee Program (as defined below), to make an assignment of such Holder's right, title and interest in this Security to the FDIC and to effect the transfer to the FDIC of the Holder's claim in any insolvency proceeding, including but not limited to, by executing an assignment in the form attached to the Third Supplemental Indenture. Any Holder may elect not to be represented by the Representative by providing written notice of such election to the Representative.
The Company, the Guarantor and the Trustee acknowledge that the Company has not opted out of the debt guarantee program (the "Debt Guarantee Program") established by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") under its Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program. As a result, .
this debt is guaranteed under the FDIC Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program and is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. The details of the FDIC guarantee are provided in the FDIC's regulations, 12 CFR Part 370, and at the FDIC's website, www.fdic.gov/tlgp. The expiration date of the FDIC's guarantee is the earlier of the maturity date of this debt or June 30, 2012

OR SUCH OTHER NAME AS REQUESTED BY AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DEPOSITORY TRUST COMPANY AND ANY PAYMENT IS MADE TO CEDE & CO., ANY TRANSFER, PLEDGE OR OTHER USE HEREOF FOR VALUE OR OTHERWISE BY OR TO ANY PERSON IS WRONGFUL SINCE THE REGISTERED OWNER HEREOF, CEDE & CO., HAS AN INTEREST HEREIN.
THE INDENTURE, DATED AS OF DECEMBER 1, 1991, RELATING TO THIS SECURITY, HAS BEEN AMENDED BY A SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURE, DATED AS OF FEBRUARY 15, 1993, A SECOND SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURE, DATED AS OF FEBRUARY 15, 2000, AND A THIRD SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURE DATED AS OF DECEMBER 19, 2008.
NEITHER THIS SECURITY NOR THE GUARANTEE INCLUDED HEREIN IS A BANK DEPOSIT OR INSURED BY THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION OR BY ANY OTHER INSURER OR GOVERNMENTAL AGENCY. THIS SECURITY IS GUARANTEED BY THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION, AND THE RIGHTS OF THE HOLDER OF THIS SECURITY ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN RIGHTS OF THE FDIC, AS AND TO THE EXTENT SET FORTH IN THIS SECURITY AND THE THIRD SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURE DATED AS OF DECEMBER 19, 2008.
 
 
PNC FUNDING CORP, a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of Pennsylvania (herein called the "Company," which term includes any successor corporation under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), for value received, hereby promises to pay to CEDE & Co., or registered assigns, the principal sum of Dollars on June 22, 2012 and to pay interest thereon from and including December 22, 2008 or from the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, semiannually in arrears on June 22 and December 22 of each year, commencing June 22, 2009 (each an "Interest Payment Date") and at maturity, at the rate of 2.300% per annum, until the principal hereof is paid or made available for payment, and (to the extent that the payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable) at the same rate per annum on any overdue principal and premium and on any overdue installment of interest. Interest shall accrue from and including December 22, 2008, to, but excluding the first Interest Payment Date and then from, and including, the immediately preceding Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, to, but excluding, the next Interest Payment Date or the maturity date, as the case may be. Each of these periods is referred to as an "interest period." Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date, subject to certain exceptions, will, as provided in such Indenture, be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest, which shall be June 7 or December 7 (whether or not a Business Day), as the case may be, immediately preceding such Interest Payment Date. However, interest payable on the maturity date will be paid to the person to whom the principal will be payable. Any such interest not so punctually paid or duly provided for will forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on such Regular Record Date and may either be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the Trustee, notice whereof shall be given to Holders of this Security not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date, or be paid at any time in any other lawful manner acceptable to the Trustee and not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which this Security may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in said Indenture.
                    
If an interest payment date or the maturity date for this Security falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the Company will postpone the interest payment or the payment of principal and interest at maturity to the next succeeding Business Day, but the payments made on such dates will be treated as being made on the date that the payment was first due and the Holder will not be entitled to any further interest or other payments with respect to such postponements.
 
"Business Day" means any day except a Saturday, a Sunday or a legal holiday in the City of New York or the City of Pittsburgh on which banking institutions are authorized or obligated by law, regulation or executive order to close.
This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (herein called the "Securities" or "Notes"), issued and to be issued in one or more series under an Indenture, dated as of December 1, 1991, among the Company, PNC Financial Corp (also known as "PNC Bank Corp." and now known as "The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.") (the "Guarantor") and The Bank of New York Mellon (formerly known as The Bank of New York) as successor in interest to JPMorgan Chase Bank (formerly known as The Chase Manhattan Bank), as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee," which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture) as amended by a Supplemental Indenture dated as of February 15, 1993 by and among the Company, the Guarantor and the Trustee, as further amended by a Second Supplemental Indenture dated as of February 15, 2000 by and among the Company, the Guarantor and the Trustee, as further amended by a Third Supplemental Indenture dated as of December 19, 2008 by and among the Company, the Guarantor and the Trustee (the "Third Supplemental Indenture") (such Indenture as amended being herein called the "Indenture"), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Security is one of the series designated above, initially issued in the aggregate principal amount of $2,000,000,000, which principal amount may be increased from time to time through the issuance of additional Notes as the Company may determine or as provided for in the Indenture.
If the beneficial owner of this Security is not a United States Alien (as defined below), payments of principal and interest in respect of this Security shall be made free and clear of, and without withholding or deduction for, any taxes, duties, assessments or government charges of whatever nature imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed by or within the United States (as defined below) or any authority therein or thereof having power to tax, unless such withholding or deduction is required by law.
If the beneficial owner of this Security is a United States Alien and the Company is required by law to make any such withholding or deduction, the Company will pay all additional amounts that may be necessary so that every Net Payment (as defined below) of the principal of or interest on this Security to such beneficial owner will not be less than the amount provided for in this Security to be then due and payable ("Additional Amounts"); , , that the Company shall have no obligation to pay Additional Amounts for or on account of any one or more of the following:
provided
however
(i) any tax, assessment or other governmental charge imposed solely because at any time there is or was a connection between such beneficial owner (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary or member of such beneficial owner, if such beneficial owner is an estate, trust or partnership) and the United States (other than the mere receipt of a payment on, or the ownership or holding of, a Security), including because such beneficial owner (or such fiduciary,
 
settlor, beneficiary or member) at any time, for U.S. federal income tax purposes: (a) is or was a citizen or resident, or is or was treated as a resident, of the United States, (b) is or was present in the United States, (c) is or was engaged in a trade or business in the United States, (d) has or had a permanent establishment in the United States, (e) is or was a domestic or foreign personal holding company, a passive foreign investment company or a controlled foreign corporation, (f) is or was a corporation that accumulates earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax or (g) is or was a "10-percent shareholder" of the Company as defined in section 871(h)(3) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code or any successor provision;
(ii) any tax, assessment or governmental charge imposed solely because of a change in applicable law or regulation, or in any official interpretation or application of applicable law or regulation, that becomes effective more than 15 days after the day on which the payment becomes due or is made available, whichever occurs later;
(iii) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, excise, transfer, wealth or personal property tax or any similar tax, assessment or other governmental charge;
(iv) any tax, assessment or other governmental charge imposed solely because such beneficial owner or any other Person fails to comply with any certification, identification or other reporting requirement concerning the nationality, residence, identity or connection with the United States of the Holder or any beneficial owner of this Security, if compliance is required by statute, by regulation of the U.S. Treasury Department or by an applicable income tax treaty to which the United States is a party, as a precondition to exemption from such tax, assessment or other governmental charge;
(v) any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that can be paid other than by deduction or withholding from a payment on this Security;
(vi) any tax, assessment or other governmental charge imposed solely because the payment is to be made by a particular Paying Agent (which term may include the Company) and would not be imposed if made by another Paying Agent (which term may include the Company);
(vii) by or on behalf of a Holder who would be able to avoid such withholding or deduction by presenting this Security to another Paying Agent in a Member State of the European Union;
(viii) any tax, assessment or other governmental charge imposed solely because the Holder (1) is a bank purchasing this Security in the ordinary course of its lending business or (2) is a bank that is neither (A) buying this Security for investment purposes only nor (B) buying this Security for resale to a third party that either is not a bank or holding the note for investment purposes only; or
(ix) any combination of the taxes, assessments or other governmental charges described in items (i) through (viii) of this paragraph.
Additional Amounts also will not be paid with respect to any payment of principal of or interest on this Security to any United States Alien who is a fiduciary or a partnership, or who is not the sole beneficial owner of any such payment, to the extent that the Company would
 
not be required to pay Additional Amounts to any beneficiary or settlor of such fiduciary or any member of such a partnership, or to any beneficial owner of the payment, if that Person had been treated as the beneficial owner of this Security for this purpose.
Except as specifically provided herein, the Company shall not be required to make any payment with respect to any tax, assessment or other governmental charge imposed by any government or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein.
Whenever in this Security (or in the Indenture, including in Sections 701(a)(1) and 701(a)(2) thereof, insofar as applicable to this Security) there is a reference, in any context, to the payment of the principal of or interest on this Security, such mention shall be deemed to include mention of any payment of Additional Amounts to United States Aliens in respect of such payment of principal or interest to the extent that, in such context, such Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof. Express mention of the payment of Additional Amounts in this Security shall not be construed as excluding Additional Amounts in the provisions of this Security where such express mention is not made.
This Security may be redeemed, as a whole but not in part, at the option of the Company, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Security to be redeemed, together with interest accrued to the date fixed for redemption, if, as a result of any amendment to, or change in, the laws or regulations of any U.S. Taxing Authority (as defined below), or any amendment to or change in any official interpretation or application of such laws or regulations, which amendment or change becomes effective or is announced on or after December 22, 2008, the Company will become obligated to pay, on the next interest payment date, Additional Amounts in respect of this Security. If the Company becomes entitled to redeem this Security, it may do so on any day thereafter pursuant to the Indenture; provided, however, that (1) the Company gives the Holder of this Security notice of such redemption not more than 60 days nor less than 30 days prior to the date fixed for redemption as provided in the Original Indenture, (2) no such notice of redemption may be given earlier than 90 days prior to the next interest payment date on which the Company would be obligated to pay such Additional Amounts and (3) at the time such notice is given, such obligation to pay such Additional Amounts remains in effect. Immediately prior to the giving of any notice of redemption of this Security pursuant to this paragraph, the Company will deliver to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate stating that the Company is entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth in reasonable detail a statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to the right of the Company to so redeem this Security have occurred. Interest installments due on or prior to a Redemption Date will be payable to the Holder of this Security or one or more Predecessor Securities, of record at the close of business on the relevant record date, all as provided in the Indenture.

The term "United
 
States" means the United States of America (including the states thereof and the District of Columbia), together with the territories, possessions and all other areas subject to the jurisdiction of the United States of America. The term "U.S. Taxing Authority" means the United States of America or any state, other jurisdiction or taxing authority in the United States. The term "Net Amount" means the amount the Company or its Paying Agent pays on this Security after deduction or withholding for or on account of any present or future tax, assessment or governmental charge imposed with respect to such payment by any U.S. Taxing Authority.
There shall not be deemed to be an Event of Default under this Security which would permit or result in the acceleration of amounts due under this Security, if such an Event of Default is due solely to the failure of the Company to make timely payment on this Security provided that the FDIC is making timely guarantee payments with respect to this Security in accordance with the Debt Guarantee Program (as defined below). Subject to the foregoing, under no circumstances shall an Event of Default specified in Sections 7.01(a)(3) or 7.01(a)(4) of the Indenture result in any acceleration of the amounts due under this Security.
If an Event of Default concerning: (1) default (a) by the Company in the payment of interest, if any, upon any Security of this series when it becomes due and payable and continuance of such default for a period of 30 days and (b) by the FDIC in the payment of interest, if any, upon any Security of this series in accordance with the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (12 C.F.R. Part 370); or (2) default (a) by the Company in the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any, on) any Security of this series at its Maturity and (b) by the FDIC in the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any, on) any Security of this series in accordance with the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (12 C.F.R. Part 370) shall occur and is continuing, the principal of this Security may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture. Upon payment (i) of the amount of principal so declared due and payable and (ii) of interest on any overdue principal and overdue interest (in each case to the extent that the payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable), all of the Company's obligations in respect of the payment of the principal of and interest, if any, on this Security shall terminate.
Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee hereinafter referred to, by manual signature, this Security shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.
The indebtedness of the Company evidenced by this Security, including the principal thereof and interest thereon, is, to the extent and in the manner set forth in the Indenture, senior in right of payment to its obligations to Holders of Subordinated Debt Securities and Existing Company Subordinated Indebtedness (each as defined in the Indenture) and shall rank in right of payment with each other and with Senior Company Indebtedness (as defined in the Indenture), as provided in the Indenture, and each Holder of this Security, by the acceptance hereof, agrees to and shall be bound by such provisions of the Indenture.
pari

The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the
 
Guarantor and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of any series under the Indenture at any time by the Company, the Guarantor and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Securities of all series (voting as one class) to be affected by such amendment or modification; provided, however, that the express written consent of the FDIC will be required to amend, modify or waive any provision of this Security or the provisions of the Indenture relating to principal, interest, default or ranking provisions of such Securities; any provisions of this Security or the Indenture required to be included by a "Master Agreement" between the Company and the FDIC relating to the Company's participation in the "Debt Guarantee Program" component of the FDIC's Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program; or any other provision that would require the consent of all Holders of the Securities. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company or the Guarantor with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest (if any) on this Security at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
This Security is issuable only in registered form without coupons in denominations of $2,000 and any integral multiples of $1,000 thereof. This Security is a global security, represented by one or more permanent global certificates registered in the name of the nominee of The Depository Trust Company (each a "Global Note" and collectively, the "Global Notes"). Accordingly, unless and until it is exchanged in whole or in part for individual certificates evidencing the Securities represented hereby, this Security may not be transferred except as a whole by The Depositary Trust Company (the "Depositary") to a nominee of such Depositary or by a nominee of such Depositary or by the Depositary or any nominee to a successor Depositary or any nominee of such successor. Ownership of beneficial interests in this Security will be shown on, and the transfer of that ownership will be effected only through, records maintained by the applicable Depositary or its nominee (with respect to interest of persons that have accounts with the Depositary ("Participants") and the records of Participants (with respect to interests of persons other than Participants)). Beneficial interests in Securities by persons that hold through Participants will be evidenced only by, and transfers of such beneficial interests with such Participants will be effected only through, records maintained by such Participants. Except as provided below, owners of beneficial interests in this Security will not be entitled to have any individual certificates and will not be considered the owners or Holders thereof under the Indenture.
Except in the limited circumstances set forth herein, Participants and owners of beneficial interests in the Global Notes will not be entitled to receive Securities in definitive form and will not be considered Holders of Securities. If the Depositary is at any time unwilling,
 
unable or ineligible to continue as Depositary and a successor Depositary is not appointed by the Company within 90 days, or an event of default has occurred and is continuing, and the Depositary requests the issuance of certificated notes, the Company will issue individual certificates evidencing the Securities represented hereby in definitive form in exchange for this Security in registered form to each person that the Depositary identifies as the beneficial owner of the Securities represented by the Global Notes upon surrender by the Depositary of the Global Notes. In addition, the Company may at any time and in its sole discretion determine not to have any Securities represented by one or more global securities and, in such event, will issue individual certificates evidencing Securities in definitive form in exchange for this Security. In any such instance, an owner of a beneficial interest in a Security will be entitled to physical delivery in certificated form of Securities equal in principal amount to such beneficial interest and to have such Securities registered in its name. This Security shall be issued in certificated form, will be issued in denominations of $2,000 and any integral multiples of $1,000 thereof and will be issued in registered form only, without coupons. Neither the Company nor the principal paying agent will be liable for any delay by the Depositary, its nominee or any direct or indirect participant in identifying the beneficial owners of the related Securities. The Company and the principal payment agent may conclusively rely on, and will be protected in relying on, instructions from the Depositary or its nominee for all purposes, including with respect to the registration and delivery, and the respective principal amounts, of the Securities to be issued.
Except as provided herein, beneficial owners of Global Notes will not be entitled to receive physical delivery of Securities in definitive form and no Global Note will be exchangeable except for another Global Note of like denomination and tenor to be registered in the name of the Depositary or its nominee. Accordingly, each person owning a beneficial interest in a Global Note must rely on the procedures of the Depositary and, if such person is not a Participant, on the procedures of the Participant through which such person owns its interest, to exercise any rights of a Holder under the Securities.
Beneficial interests in the Global Notes will be represented through book-entry accounts of financial institutions acting on behalf of beneficial owners as direct and indirect participants in the Depositary. Investors may elect to hold interests in the Global Notes through the Depositary, either directly if they are Participants of such system or indirectly through organizations that are Participants in such system.
The laws of some jurisdictions may require that purchasers of securities take physical delivery of those securities in definitive form. Accordingly, the ability to transfer interests in the Securities represented by a Global Note to those persons may be limited. In addition, because the Depositary can act only on behalf of its Participants, who in turn act on behalf of persons who hold interests through Participants, the ability of a person having an interest in Securities represented by a Global Note to pledge or transfer such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the Depositary's system, or otherwise to take actions in respect of such interest, may be affected by the lack of a physical definitive security in respect of such interest.
Neither the Company, the Trustee, the principal paying agent nor any Security Registrar will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of Securities by the Depositary, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records of the Depositary relating to the Securities.
 
The Bank of New York Mellon will act as the Company's principal paying agent with respect to the Securities through its offices presently located at 101 Barclay Street8W, New York, New York 10286. The Company may at any time rescind the designation of a paying agent, appoint a successor paying agent, or approve a change in the office through which any paying agent acts. Payments of interest and principal may be made by wire-transfer in immediately available funds for Securities held in book-entry form or, at the Company's option in the event the Securities are not represented by Global Notes, by check mailed to the address of the person entitled to the payment as it appears in the Security register. Payment of principal will be made upon the surrender of the relevant Securities at the offices of the principal paying agent.
Notices to the Holders of registered Securities will be mailed to them at their respective addresses in the register of the Securities and will be deemed to have been given on the fourth weekday (being a day other than Saturday or Sunday) after the date of mailing.
The Indenture contains provisions setting forth certain conditions to the institution of proceedings by the Holders of Securities with respect to the Indenture or for any remedy under the Indenture.
All terms used in this Security which are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.
The Trustee is hereby designated and the Holder of this Security, by its acceptance hereof, shall be deemed to have appointed the Trustee, as the duly authorized representative of the Holder for purposes of making claims and taking other permitted or required actions under the Debt Guarantee Program (the "Representative"). The Holder hereby authorizes and directs the Representative, at such time as the FDIC shall commence making any guarantee payments to the Representative for the benefit of such Holder pursuant to the Debt Guarantee Program (as defined below), to make an assignment of such Holder's right, title and interest in this Security to the FDIC and to effect the transfer to the FDIC of the Holder's claim in any insolvency proceeding, including but not limited to, by executing an assignment in the form attached to the Third Supplemental Indenture. Any Holder may elect not to be represented by the Representative by providing written notice of such election to the Representative.
The Company, the Guarantor and the Trustee acknowledge that the Company has not opted out of the debt guarantee program (the "Debt Guarantee Program") established by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") under its Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program. As a result, .
this debt is guaranteed under the FDIC Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program and is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. The details of the FDIC guarantee are provided in the FDIC's regulations, 12 CFR Part 370, and at the FDIC's website, www.fdic.gov/tlgp. The expiration date of the FDIC's guarantee is the earlier of the maturity date of this debt or June 30, 2012

SECTION 310
No Event of Default During Time of Timely FDIC Guarantee Payments.

Any demand under this Section 312 shall be made in writing and directed to the Director, Division of Resolution and Receiverships, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Washington, D.C., and shall include all supporting evidences as provided in this Section 312, and shall certify to the accuracy thereof.

UNLESS THIS CERTIFICATE IS PRESENTED BY AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DEPOSITORY TRUST COMPANY (55 WATER STREET, NEW YORK, NEW YORK) TO THE ISSUER OR ITS AGENT FOR REGISTRATION OF TRANSFER, EXCHANGE OR PAYMENT, AND ANY CERTIFICATE ISSUED IS REGISTERED IN THE NAME OF CEDE & CO. OR SUCH OTHER NAME AS REQUESTED BY AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DEPOSITORY TRUST COMPANY AND ANY PAYMENT IS MADE TO CEDE & CO., ANY TRANSFER, PLEDGE OR OTHER USE HEREOF FOR VALUE OR OTHERWISE BY OR TO ANY PERSON IS WRONGFUL SINCE THE REGISTERED OWNER HEREOF, CEDE & CO., HAS AN INTEREST HEREIN.
THE INDENTURE, DATED AS OF DECEMBER 1, 1991, RELATING TO THIS SECURITY, HAS BEEN AMENDED BY A SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURE, DATED AS OF FEBRUARY 15, 1993, A SECOND SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURE, DATED AS OF FEBRUARY 15, 2000, A THIRD SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURE DATED AS OF DECEMBER 19, 2008 AND A FOURTH SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURE DATED AS OF DECEMBER 19, 2008.
NEITHER THIS SECURITY NOR THE GUARANTEE INCLUDED HEREIN IS A BANK DEPOSIT OR INSURED BY THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION OR BY ANY OTHER INSURER OR GOVERNMENTAL AGENCY. THIS SECURITY IS GUARANTEED BY THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION, AND THE RIGHTS OF THE HOLDER OF THIS SECURITY ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN RIGHTS OF THE FDIC, AS AND TO THE EXTENT SET FORTH IN THIS SECURITY AND THE FOURTH SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURE DATED AS OF DECEMBER 19, 2008.
 
 
PNC FUNDING CORP, a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of Pennsylvania (herein called the "Company," which term includes any successor corporation under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), for value received, hereby promises to pay to CEDE & Co., or registered assigns, the principal sum of Dollars on June 22, 2011 and to pay interest thereon from and including December 22, 2008, or from the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, quarterly in arrears on the 22nd of each March, June, September and December of each year, commencing March 22, 2009 (each an "Interest Payment Date"), and at maturity, at a floating rate of three-month London Interbank offered rate ("LIBOR") plus 0.28%, until the principal hereof is paid or made available for payment, and (to the extent that the payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable) at the same rate per annum on any overdue principal and premium and on any overdue installment of interest. Interest shall accrue from and including December 22, 2008 to, but excluding the first Interest Payment Date and then from, and including, the immediately preceding Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for to, but excluding, the next Interest Payment Date or the maturity date, as the case may be. Each of these periods is referred to as an "interest period." Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year for the actual number of days elapsed. The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date, subject to certain exceptions, will, as provided in such Indenture, be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest, which shall be the 15
            
th
calendar day, whether or not a Business Day, as the case may be, immediately preceding such Interest Payment Date. However, interest payable on the maturity date will be paid to the person to whom the principal will be payable. Any such interest not so punctually paid or duly provided for will forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on such Regular Record Date and may either be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the Trustee, notice whereof shall be given to Holders of this Security not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date, or be paid at any time in any other lawful manner acceptable to the Trustee and not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which this Security may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in said Indenture.
The interest rate on this Security will be calculated by PNC Bank, National Association, as calculation agent, except that the interest rate in effect for the period from and including December 22, 2008 to but excluding March 22, 2009 (the "initial interest rate") will be established by the Company as the rate for deposits in U.S. dollars having a maturity of three months commencing on December 22, 2008 that appears on the Reuters Screen LIBOR01 Page
 
as of 11:00 a.m., London time, on December 22, 2008. If no rate appears on the Reuters Screen LIBOR01 Page, as specified in the preceding sentence, then the initial interest rate will be determined by the Company in the manner described in clause (ii) of the definition of the calculation of LIBOR below, except that the banks referred to in such clause will be selected by the Company rather than the calculation agent.
The calculation agent will reset the interest rate with respect to this Security on each interest payment date, each of which is referred to as an "interest reset date." The second London Business Day preceding an interest reset date will be the "interest determination date" for that interest reset date. The interest rate in effect on each date that is not an interest reset date will be the interest rate determined as of the interest determination date pertaining to the immediately preceding interest reset date. The interest rate in effect on any date that is an interest reset date will be the interest rate determined as of the interest determination date pertaining to that interest reset date, except that the interest rate in effect for the period from and including December 22, 2008 to but excluding March 22, 2009, the initial interest reset date, will be the initial interest rate.
If an interest payment date and an interest reset date for this Security (other than an interest payment date at maturity) falls on a day that is not a Business Day, that interest payment date and interest reset date will be postponed to the following Business Day, except that if the following Business Day is in the following calendar month, that interest payment date and interest reset date will be the preceding Business Day.
If an interest payment date or the maturity date for this Security falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the Company will postpone the interest payment or the payment of principal and interest at maturity to the next succeeding Business Day, but the payments made on such dates will be treated as being made on the date that the payment was first due and the Holders of this Security will not be entitled to any further interest or other payments with respect to such postponements.
"LIBOR" will be determined by the calculation agent in accordance with the following provisions:
 
 
 
"Business Day" means any London Business Day, except a Saturday, a Sunday, or a legal holiday in the City of New York or the City of Pittsburgh on which banking institutions are authorized or obligated by law, regulation, or executive order to close.

(the "Guarantor") and The Bank of New York Mellon (formerly known as The Bank of New York) as successor in interest to JPMorgan Chase Bank (formerly known as The Chase Manhattan Bank), as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee," which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture) as amended by a Supplemental Indenture dated as of February 15, 1993 by and among the Company, the Guarantor and the Trustee, as further amended by a Second Supplemental Indenture dated as of February 15, 2000 by and among the Company, the Guarantor and the Trustee, as further amended by a Third Supplemental Indenture dated as of December 19, 2008 by and among the Company, the Guarantor and the Trustee, as further amended by a Fourth Supplemental Indenture dated as of December 19, 2008 by and among the Company, the Guarantor and the Trustee (the "Fourth Supplemental Indenture") (such Indenture as amended being herein called the "Indenture"), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered.

If the beneficial owner of this Security is a United States Alien and the Company is required by law to make any such withholding or deduction, the Company will pay all additional amounts that may be necessary so that every Net Payment (as defined below) of the principal of or interest on this Security to such beneficial owner will not be less than the amount provided for in this Security to be then due and payable ("Additional Amounts"); , , that the Company shall have no obligation to pay Additional Amounts for or on account of any one or more of the following:
provided
however
(i) any tax, assessment or other governmental charge imposed solely because at any time there is or was a connection between such beneficial owner (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary or member of such beneficial owner, if such beneficial owner is an estate, trust or partnership) and the United States (other than the mere receipt of a payment on, or the ownership or holding of, a Security), including because such beneficial owner (or such fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary or member) at any time, for U.S. federal income tax purposes: (a) is or was a citizen or resident, or is or was treated as a resident, of the United States, (b) is or was present in the United States, (c) is or was engaged in a trade or business in the United States, (d) has or had a permanent establishment in the United States, (e) is or was a domestic or foreign personal holding company, a passive foreign investment company or a controlled foreign corporation, (f) is or was a corporation that accumulates earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax or (g) is or was a "10-percent shareholder" of the Company as defined in section 871(h)(3) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code or any successor provision;
(ii) any tax, assessment or governmental charge imposed solely because of a change in applicable law or regulation, or in any official interpretation or application of applicable law or regulation, that becomes effective more than 15 days after the day on which the payment becomes due or is made available, whichever occurs later;
(iii) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, excise, transfer, wealth or personal property tax or any similar tax, assessment or other governmental charge;
(iv) any tax, assessment or other governmental charge imposed solely because such beneficial owner or any other Person fails to comply with any certification, identification or other reporting requirement concerning the nationality, residence, identity or connection with the United States of the Holder or any beneficial owner of this Security, if compliance is required by statute, by regulation of the U.S. Treasury Department or by an applicable income tax treaty to which the United States is a party, as a precondition to exemption from such tax, assessment or other governmental charge;
 
(v) any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that can be paid other than by deduction or withholding from a payment on this Security;
(vi) any tax, assessment or other governmental charge imposed solely because the payment is to be made by a particular Paying Agent (which term may include the Company) and would not be imposed if made by another Paying Agent (which term may include the Company);
(vii) by or on behalf of a Holder who would be able to avoid such withholding or deduction by presenting this Security to another Paying Agent in a Member State of the European Union;
(viii) any tax, assessment or other governmental charge imposed solely because the Holder (1) is a bank purchasing this Security in the ordinary course of its lending business or (2) is a bank that is neither (A) buying this Security for investment purposes only nor (B) buying this Security for resale to a third party that either is not a bank or holding the note for investment purposes only; or
(ix) any combination of the taxes, assessments or other governmental charges described in items (i) through (viii) of this paragraph.
Additional Amounts also will not be paid with respect to any payment of principal of or interest on this Security to any United States Alien who is a fiduciary or a partnership, or who is not the sole beneficial owner of any such payment, to the extent that the Company would not be required to pay Additional Amounts to any beneficiary or settlor of such fiduciary or any member of such a partnership, or to any beneficial owner of the payment, if that Person had been treated as the beneficial owner of this Security for this purpose.
Except as specifically provided herein, the Company shall not be required to make any payment with respect to any tax, assessment or other governmental charge imposed by any government or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein.
Whenever in this Security (or in the Indenture, including in Sections 701(a)(1) and 701(a)(2) thereof, insofar as applicable to this Security) there is a reference, in any context, to the payment of the principal of or interest on this Security, such mention shall be deemed to include mention of any payment of Additional Amounts to United States Aliens in respect of such payment of principal or interest to the extent that, in such context, such Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof. Express mention of the payment of Additional Amounts in this Security shall not be construed as excluding Additional Amounts in the provisions of this Security where such express mention is not made.
This Security may be redeemed, as a whole but not in part, at the option of the Company, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Security to be redeemed, together with interest accrued to the date fixed for redemption, if, as a result of any amendment to, or change in, the laws or regulations of any U.S. Taxing Authority (as defined below), or any amendment to or change in any official interpretation or application of such laws or regulations, which amendment or change becomes effective or is announced on or after December 22, 2008, the Company will become obligated to pay, on the next interest payment
 
date, Additional Amounts in respect of this Security. If the Company becomes entitled to redeem this Security, it may do so on any day thereafter pursuant to the Indenture; provided, however, that (1) the Company gives the Holder of this Security notice of such redemption not more than 60 days nor less than 30 days prior to the date fixed for redemption as provided in the Original Indenture, (2) no such notice of redemption may be given earlier than 90 days prior to the next interest payment date on which the Company would be obligated to pay such Additional Amounts and (3) at the time such notice is given, such obligation to pay such Additional Amounts remains in effect. Immediately prior to the giving of any notice of redemption of this Security pursuant to this paragraph, the Company will deliver to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate stating that the Company is entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth in reasonable detail a statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to the right of the Company to so redeem this Security have occurred. Interest installments due on or prior to a Redemption Date will be payable to the Holder of this Security or one or more Predecessor Securities, of record at the close of business on the relevant record date, all as provided in the Indenture.

The term "United States" means the United States of America (including the states thereof and the District of Columbia), together with the territories, possessions and all other areas subject to the jurisdiction of the United States of America. The term "U.S. Taxing Authority" means the United States of America or any state, other jurisdiction or taxing authority in the United States. The term "Net Amount" means the amount the Company or its Paying Agent pays on this Security after deduction or withholding for or on account of any present or future tax, assessment or governmental charge imposed with respect to such payment by any U.S. Taxing Authority.
There shall not be deemed to be an Event of Default under this Security which would permit or result in the acceleration of amounts due under this Security, if such an Event of Default is due solely to the failure of the Company to make timely payment on this Security provided that the FDIC is making timely guarantee payments with respect to this Security in accordance with the Debt Guarantee Program (as defined below). Subject to the foregoing, under no circumstances shall an Event of Default specified in Sections 7.01(a)(3) or 7.01(a)(4) of the Indenture result in any acceleration of the amounts due under this Security.
If an Event of Default concerning: (1) default (a) by the Company in the payment of interest, if any, upon any Security of this series when it becomes due and payable and continuance of such default for a period of 30 days and (b) by the FDIC in the payment of interest, if any, upon any Security of this series in accordance with the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (12 C.F.R. Part 370); or (2) default (a) by the Company in the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any, on) any Security of this series at its Maturity and (b) by the FDIC in the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any, on) any Security of this series in accordance with the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (12 C.F.R. Part 370) shall occur

Upon payment (i) of the amount of principal so declared due and payable and (ii) of interest on any overdue principal and overdue interest (in each case to the extent that the payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable), all of the Company's obligations in respect of the payment of the principal of and interest, if any, on this Security shall terminate.
Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee hereinafter referred to, by manual signature, this Security shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.
The indebtedness of the Company evidenced by this Security, including the principal thereof and interest thereon, is, to the extent and in the manner set forth in the Indenture, senior in right of payment to its obligations to Holders of Subordinated Debt Securities and Existing Company Subordinated Indebtedness (each as defined in the Indenture) and shall rank in right of payment with each other and with Senior Company Indebtedness (as defined in the Indenture), as provided in the Indenture, and each Holder of this Security, by the acceptance hereof, agrees to and shall be bound by such provisions of the Indenture.
pari passu
The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the Guarantor and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of any series under the Indenture at any time by the Company, the Guarantor and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Securities of all series (voting as one class) to be affected by such amendment or modification; provided, however, that the express written consent of the FDIC will be required to amend, modify or waive any provision of this Security or the provisions of the Indenture relating to principal, interest, default or ranking provisions of such Securities; any provisions of this Security or the Indenture required to be included by a "Master Agreement" between the Company and the FDIC relating to the Company's participation in the "Debt Guarantee Program" component of the FDIC's Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program; or any other provision that would require the consent of all Holders of the Securities. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company or the Guarantor with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest (if any) on this Security at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
 
This Security is issuable only in registered form without coupons in denominations of $2,000 and any integral multiples of $1,000 thereof. This Security is a global security, represented by one or more permanent global certificates registered in the name of the nominee of The Depository Trust Company (each a "Global Note" and collectively, the "Global Notes"). Accordingly, unless and until it is exchanged in whole or in part for individual certificates evidencing the Securities represented hereby, this Security may not be transferred except as a whole by The Depositary Trust Company (the "Depositary") to a nominee of such Depositary or by a nominee of such Depositary or by the Depositary or any nominee to a successor Depositary or any nominee of such successor. Ownership of beneficial interests in this Security will be shown on, and the transfer of that ownership will be effected only through, records maintained by the applicable Depositary or its nominee (with respect to interest of persons that have accounts with the Depositary ("Participants") and the records of Participants (with respect to interests of persons other than Participants)). Beneficial interests in Securities by persons that hold through Participants will be evidenced only by, and transfers of such beneficial interests with such Participants will be effected only through, records maintained by such Participants. Except as provided below, owners of beneficial interests in this Security will not be entitled to have any individual certificates and will not be considered the owners or Holders thereof under the Indenture.
Except in the limited circumstances set forth herein, Participants and owners of beneficial interests in the Global Notes will not be entitled to receive Securities in definitive form and will not be considered Holders of Securities. If the Depositary is at any time unwilling, unable or ineligible to continue as Depositary and a successor Depositary is not appointed by the Company within 90 days, or an event of default has occurred and is continuing, and the Depositary requests the issuance of certificated notes, the Company will issue individual certificates evidencing the Securities represented hereby in definitive form in exchange for this Security in registered form to each person that the Depositary identifies as the beneficial owner of the Securities represented by the Global Notes upon surrender by the Depositary of the Global Notes. In addition, the Company may at any time and in its sole discretion determine not to have any Securities represented by one or more global securities and, in such event, will issue individual certificates evidencing Securities in definitive form in exchange for this Security. In any such instance, an owner of a beneficial interest in a Security will be entitled to physical delivery in certificated form of Securities equal in principal amount to such beneficial interest and to have such Securities registered in its name. This Security shall be issued in certificated form, will be issued in denominations of $2,000 and any integral multiples of $1,000 thereof and will be issued in registered form only, without coupons. Neither the Company nor the principal paying agent will be liable for any delay by the Depositary, its nominee or any direct or indirect participant in identifying the beneficial owners of the related Securities. The Company and the principal payment agent may conclusively rely on, and will be protected in relying on, instructions from the Depositary or its nominee for all purposes, including with respect to the registration and delivery, and the respective principal amounts, of the Securities to be issued.
Except as provided herein, beneficial owners of Global Notes will not be entitled to receive physical delivery of Securities in definitive form and no Global Note will be exchangeable except for another Global Note of like denomination and tenor to be registered in the name of the Depositary or its nominee. Accordingly, each person owning a beneficial
 
interest in a Global Note must rely on the procedures of the Depositary and, if such person is not a Participant, on the procedures of the Participant through which such person owns its interest, to exercise any rights of a Holder under the Securities.
Beneficial interests in the Global Notes will be represented through book-entry accounts of financial institutions acting on behalf of beneficial owners as direct and indirect participants in the Depositary. Investors may elect to hold interests in the Global Notes through the Depositary, either directly if they are Participants of such system or indirectly through organizations that are Participants in such system.
The laws of some jurisdictions may require that purchasers of securities take physical delivery of those securities in definitive form. Accordingly, the ability to transfer interests in the Securities represented by a Global Note to those persons may be limited. In addition, because the Depositary can act only on behalf of its Participants, who in turn act on behalf of persons who hold interests through Participants, the ability of a person having an interest in Securities represented by a Global Note to pledge or transfer such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the Depositary's system, or otherwise to take actions in respect of such interest, may be affected by the lack of a physical definitive security in respect of such interest.
Neither the Company, the Trustee, the principal paying agent nor any Security Registrar will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of Securities by the Depositary, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records of the Depositary relating to the Securities.
The Bank of New York Mellon will act as the Company's principal paying agent with respect to the Securities through its offices presently located at 101 Barclay Street8W, New York, New York 10286. The Company may at any time rescind the designation of a paying agent, appoint a successor paying agent, or approve a change in the office through which any paying agent acts. Payments of interest and principal may be made by wire-transfer in immediately available funds for Securities held in book-entry form or, at the Company's option in the event the Securities are not represented by Global Notes, by check mailed to the address of the person entitled to the payment as it appears in the Security register. Payment of principal will be made upon the surrender of the relevant Securities at the offices of the principal paying agent.
Notices to the Holders of registered Securities will be mailed to them at their respective addresses in the register of the Securities and will be deemed to have been given on the fourth weekday (being a day other than Saturday or Sunday) after the date of mailing.
The Indenture contains provisions setting forth certain conditions to the institution of proceedings by the Holders of Securities with respect to the Indenture or for any remedy under the Indenture.
All terms used in this Security which are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.
 
The Trustee is hereby designated and the Holder of this Security, by its acceptance hereof, shall be deemed to have appointed the Trustee, as the duly authorized representative of the Holder for purposes of making claims and taking other permitted or required actions under the Debt Guarantee Program (the "Representative"). The Holder hereby authorizes and directs the Representative, at such time as the FDIC shall commence making any guarantee payments to the Representative for the benefit of such Holder pursuant to the Debt Guarantee Program (as defined below), to make an assignment of such Holder's right, title and interest in this Security to the FDIC and to effect the transfer to the FDIC of the Holder's claim in any insolvency proceeding, including but not limited to, by executing an assignment in the form attached to the Fourth Supplemental Indenture. Any Holder may elect not to be represented by the Representative by providing written notice of such election to the Representative.
The Company, the Guarantor and the Trustee acknowledge that the Company has not opted out of the debt guarantee program (the "Debt Guarantee Program") established by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") under its Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program. As a result, .
this debt is guaranteed under the FDIC Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program and is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. The details of the FDIC guarantee are provided in the FDIC's regulations, 12 CFR Part 370, and at the FDIC's website, www.fdic.gov/tlgp. The expiration date of the FDIC's guarantee is the earlier of the maturity date of this debt or June 30, 2012

pari
passu
The Guarantor shall be subrogated to all rights of the Holder of said Security against the Company in respect of any amounts paid by the Guarantor pursuant to the provisions of this Guarantee; , , that the Guarantor shall not be entitled to enforce, or to receive any payments arising out of or based upon, such right of subrogation until the principal of and premium, if any, and interest then due on all Securities issued under the Indenture shall have been paid in full.
