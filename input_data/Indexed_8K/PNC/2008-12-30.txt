Overview
On December 26, 2008, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. entered into an Exchange Agreement with BlackRock, Inc. The transactions contemplated by this agreement will restructure PNC's ownership of BlackRock equity without altering, to any meaningful extent, PNC's economic interest in BlackRock. PNC will continue to be subject to the limitations on its voting rights in its existing agreements with BlackRock. These transactions will also allow PNC to reduce its net income volatility associated with the quarterly marking-to-market of obligations related to PNC's delivery of BlackRock stock under the BlackRock Long-Term Incentive Plan ("LTIP").
In connection with the completion of the transactions contemplated by this Exchange Agreement, PNC and BlackRock will also enter into a Third Amendment to its Share Surrender Agreement (along with PNC's wholly owned subsidiary, PNC Bancorp, Inc.) and an Amended and Restated Implementation and Stockholder Agreement. On the same date it entered into the PNC Exchange Agreement, BlackRock entered into an Exchange Agreement with Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. BlackRock entered into the Merrill Lynch Exchange Agreement in anticipation of the consummation of the merger of Bank of America Corporation and Merrill Lynch, as contemplated by the Merger Agreement dated September 15, 2008 between those parties. The PNC and Merrill Lynch Exchange Agreements will restructure PNC's and Merrill Lynch's respective ownership of BlackRock equity and are expected to close upon the receipt of necessary foreign regulatory approvals.
The Exchange Agreements are described in more detail below. In connection with the transactions contemplated by the agreements, the principal effects on PNC's ownership of BlackRock equity will be as follows:
 
 
 
 
Summary of Agreements and Other Documents
Under its Exchange Agreement, PNC will be exchanging 17,872,000 shares of BlackRock Common Stock for a like number of shares of BlackRock's Series B non-voting convertible participating preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Series B Preferred Stock") and up to 2,940,866 shares of BlackRock Common Stock for a like number of shares of BlackRock's Series C non-voting convertible participating preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Series C Preferred Stock"). The amount of BlackRock Common Stock being exchanged for Series C Preferred Stock equals PNC's remaining obligation to deliver BlackRock Common Stock to fund BlackRock's LTIP under the current terms of the Share Surrender Agreement. The terms of the Series B Preferred Stock and the Series C Preferred Stock are summarized below. The approximately 22,308,500 remaining shares of BlackRock Common Stock held by PNC will not be affected by these exchanges.
Simultaneously with PNC's exchanges, Merrill Lynch will be exchanging all of its shares of BlackRock's Series A non-voting convertible participating preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share, and a majority of its BlackRock Common Stock for a like number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock. The Merrill Lynch exchange transactions are described in greater detail in a Form 8-K filed by BlackRock on December 29, 2008.
The changes contained in PNC's Amended and Restated Implementation and Stockholder Agreement with BlackRock in relation to the prior agreement will, among other things, (i) revise the definitions of "Fair Market Value," "Ownership Cap," "Ownership Percentage," "Ownership Threshold" and "Significant Stockholder"; and (ii) amend or supplement certain other provisions therein to incorporate the Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock, respectively.
The Third Amendment to the Share Surrender Agreement will provide for the substitution of Series C Preferred Stock for the shares of BlackRock Common Stock currently subject to the Share Surrender Agreement.
The terms of Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock, respectively, are summarized as below:
. The Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock will rank in right of payment with respect to dividends and upon liquidation with the Series A Preferred Stock and any other series of BlackRock's preferred stock that by its terms ranks in right of payment as to dividends and/or upon liquidation with the Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock, respectively.

In the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of BlackRock, the holders of the Series B Preferred Stock and the Series C Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive $0.01 per share and $40.00 per share, respectively, of the respective preferred stock held, plus any outstanding and unpaid dividends, before any payments are made to holders of BlackRock Common Stock or any other class or series of BlackRock's capital stock ranking junior as to liquidation rights to Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock, respectively. After such payment to the holders of Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock and the holders of shares of any other series of BlackRock's preferred stock ranking prior to the BlackRock Common Stock as to distributions upon liquidation, the remaining assets of BlackRock will be distributed to the holders of (i) Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock, (ii) any other series of BlackRock's preferred stock ranking prior to the BlackRock Common Stock as to distributions upon liquidation that participate with the holders of BlackRock Common Stock upon liquidation, and (iii) the BlackRock Common Stock and any other shares of BlackRock's capital stock ranking with the BlackRock Common Stock as to distributions upon liquidation.
