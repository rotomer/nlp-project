The information contained in this Financial Supplement is preliminary, unaudited and based on data available on February 3, 2009. We have reclassified certain prior period amounts included in this Financial Supplement to be consistent with the current period presentation. This information speaks only as of the particular date or dates included in the schedules. We do not undertake any obligation to, and disclaim any duty to, correct or update any of the information provided in this Financial Supplement. Our future financial performance is subject to risks and uncertainties as described in our United States Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") filings.
National City Corporation Acquisition
On December 31, 2008, we acquired National City Corporation ("National City") for approximately $6.1 billion. The total consideration included approximately $5.6 billion of PNC common stock, representing approximately 95 million shares, $150 million of preferred stock and $381 million of cash. Our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2008 and other consolidated PNC information presented as of that date in this Financial Supplement includes the impact of National City. All other disclosures, including the business segment tables on pages 15-20 (other than Period-end Employees on page 15), exclude any impact of National City. The assets and liabilities of National City were recorded at estimated fair value at December 31, 2008 and are subject to refinement as additional information as of that date becomes available.
Sterling Financial Corporation Acquisition
We completed our acquisition of Sterling Financial Corporation ("Sterling") on April 4, 2008. PNC issued approximately 4.6 million shares of PNC common stock and paid approximately $224 million in cash as consideration for the acquisition. PNC converted the Sterling banking charter and financial and customer data onto PNC's financial and operational systems during August 2008.

Lyons, LLC ("Hilliard Lyons"), a Louisville, Kentucky-based wholly-owned subsidiary of PNC and a full-service brokerage and financial services provider, to Houchens Industries, Inc. We recognized an after-tax gain of $23 million in the first quarter of 2008 in connection with this divestiture. Information for the periods presented reflects the reclassification of results for Hilliard Lyons, including the gain on the sale of this business, from the Retail Banking business segment to "Other, including BlackRock."

Glossary of Terms
- Net domestic and foreign fund investment assets for which we provide accounting and administration services. We do not include these assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Accounting/administration net fund assets
- Primarily comprised of total average quarterly (or annual) assets plus (less) unrealized losses (gains) on investment securities, less goodwill and certain other intangible assets (net of eligible deferred taxes).
Adjusted average total assets
- Adjusted to reflect a full year of activity.
Annualized
- Assets over which we have sole or shared investment authority for our customers/clients. We do not include these assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Assets under management
- One hundredth of a percentage point.
Basis point
- Process of removing a loan or portion of a loan from our balance sheet because it is considered uncollectible. We also record a charge-off when a loan is transferred to held for sale by reducing the carrying amount by the allowance for loan losses associated with such loan or, if the market value is less than its carrying amount, by the amount of that difference.
Charge-off
- Common shareholders' equity divided by total assets. Common shareholders' equity equals total shareholders' equity less the liquidation value of preferred stock.
Common shareholders' equity to total assets
- The difference in yield between debt issues of similar maturity. The excess of yield attributable to credit spread is often used as a measure of relative creditworthiness, with a reduction in the credit spread reflecting an improvement in the borrower's perceived creditworthiness.
Credit spread
- Investment assets held on behalf of clients under safekeeping arrangements. We do not include these assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Investment assets held in custody at other institutions on our behalf are included in the appropriate asset categories on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as if physically held by us.
Custody assets
- Financial contracts whose value is derived from publicly traded securities, interest rates, currency exchange rates or market indices. Derivatives cover a wide assortment of financial contracts, including forward contracts, futures, options and swaps.
Derivatives
- Includes residential real estate development loans, cross border leases, brokered home equity loans and certain residential real estate loans. These loans require special servicing and management oversight given current market conditions. The majority of these loans were from the National City acquisition.
Distressed loan portfolio
- An estimate of the rate sensitivity of our economic value of equity. A negative duration of equity is associated with asset sensitivity ( positioned for rising interest rates), while a positive value implies liability sensitivity ( positioned for declining interest rates). For example, if the duration of equity is +1.5 years, the economic value of equity declines by 1.5% for each 100 basis point increase in interest rates.
Duration of equity
i.e.,
i.e.,
- Assets that generate income, which include: federal funds sold; resale agreements; trading securities and other short-term investments; loans held for sale; loans, net of unearned income; investment securities; and certain other assets.
Earning assets
- Represents the amount of resources that a business segment should hold to guard against potentially large losses that could cause insolvency. It is based on a measurement of economic risk, as opposed to risk as defined by regulatory bodies. The economic capital measurement process involves converting a risk distribution to the capital that is required to support the risk, consistent with our target credit rating. As such, economic risk serves as a "common currency" of risk that allows us to compare different risks on a similar basis.
Economic capital

(Continued)
Glossary of Terms
 
- A measurement, expressed in years, that, when multiplied by a change in interest rates, would approximate the percentage change in value of on- and off- balance sheet positions.
Effective duration
- Noninterest expense divided by the sum of net interest income (GAAP basis) and noninterest income.
Efficiency
- The price that would be received to sell an asset or the price that would be paid to transfer a liability on the measurement date using the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between willing market participants.
Fair value
- A management accounting methodology designed to recognize the net interest income effects of sources and uses of funds provided by the assets and liabilities of a business segment. We assign these balances LIBOR-based funding rates at origination that represent the interest cost for us to raise/invest funds with similar maturity and repricing structures.
Funds transfer pricing
- Contracts in which the buyer agrees to purchase and the seller agrees to deliver a specific financial instrument at a predetermined price or yield. May be settled either in cash or by delivery of the underlying financial instrument.
Futures and forward contracts
- Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
GAAP
- Acquired loans determined to be credit impaired under AICPA Statement of Position 03-3, . Loans are determined to be impaired if there is evidence of credit deterioration since origination and for which it is probable that all contractually required payments receivable will not be collected.
Impaired loans
Accounting for Certain Loans or Debt Securities Acquired in a Transfer
- Collectively, securities available for sale and securities held to maturity.
Investment securities
- Tier 1 risk-based capital divided by adjusted average total assets.
Leverage ratio
- Acronym for London InterBank Offered Rate. LIBOR is the average interest rate charged when banks in the London wholesale money market (or interbank market) borrow unsecured funds from each other. LIBOR rates are used as a benchmark for interest rates on a global basis.
LIBOR
- A management accounting assessment, using funds transfer pricing methodology, of the net interest contribution from loans and deposits.
Net interest income from loans and deposits
- Annualized taxable-equivalent net interest income divided by average earning assets.
Net interest margin
- Assets we hold for our customers/clients in a non-discretionary, custodial capacity. We do not include these assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Nondiscretionary assets under administration
- Noninterest income divided by the sum of net interest income (GAAP basis) and noninterest income.
Noninterest income to total revenue
- Nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans, troubled debt restructured loans, foreclosed assets and other assets. We do not accrue interest income on assets classified as nonperforming.
Nonperforming assets
- Nonperforming loans include loans to commercial, commercial real estate, equipment lease financing, consumer, and residential mortgage and construction customers as well as troubled debt restructured loans. Nonperforming loans do not include loans held for sale or foreclosed assets and other assets. We do not accrue interest income on loans classified as nonperforming.
Nonperforming loans

Glossary of Terms
 
- The period to period dollar or percentage change in total revenue (GAAP basis) less the dollar or percentage change in noninterest expense. A positive variance indicates that revenue growth exceeded expense growth ( positive operating leverage) while a negative variance implies expense growth exceeded revenue growth ( negative operating leverage).
Operating leverage
i.e.,
i.e.,
- Impairment occurs when the fair value of a security is less than its cost. The impairment is considered other-than-temporary when it is probable that the holder will be unable to collect all amounts due according to contractual terms of a debt security at acquisition. A few factors that are considered to determine whether a decline in fair value is other than temporary may include a) the length of the time and the extent to which the market value has been less than cost; b) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, including any specific events which may influence the operations of the issuer such as changes in technology that may impair the earnings potential of the investment or the discontinuance of a segment of the business that may affect the future earnings potential; or c) the intent and ability of the holder to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value. Securities determined to be other-than-temporary-impaired are written down to fair value with the loss recognized in income during the period in which the assessment is made. The fair value would take into account credit and liquidity risk.
Other-than-temporary impairment
- Cash proceeds received on a loan that we had previously charged off. We credit the amount received to the allowance for loan and lease losses.
Recovery
- Annualized net income divided by average assets.
Return on average assets
- Annualized net income divided by average capital.
Return on average capital
- Annualized net income less preferred stock dividends divided by average common shareholders' equity.
Return on average common shareholders' equity
- Annualized net income less preferred stock dividends divided by average common shareholders' equity less goodwill and other intangible assets (net of deferred taxes for both taxable and nontaxable combinations), and excluding mortgage servicing rights.
Return on average tangible common shareholders' equity
- Primarily computed by the assignment of specific risk-weights (as defined by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System) to assets and off-balance sheet instruments.
Risk-weighted assets
- The process of legally transforming financial assets into securities.
Securitization
- An intangible asset created by an obligation to service assets for others. Typical servicing rights include the right to receive a fee for collecting and forwarding payments on loans and related taxes and insurance premiums held in escrow.
Servicing rights
- Period-end common shareholders' equity less goodwill and other intangible assets (net of eligible deferred taxes), and excluding mortgage servicing rights, divided by period-end assets less goodwill and other intangible assets (net of eligible deferred taxes), and excluding mortgage servicing rights.
Tangible common equity ratio
- The interest income earned on certain assets is completely or partially exempt from federal income tax. As such, these tax-exempt instruments typically yield lower returns than taxable investments. To provide more meaningful comparisons of yields and margins for all interest-earning assets, we use interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis in calculating average yields and net interest margins by increasing the interest income earned on tax-exempt assets to make it fully equivalent to interest income earned on other taxable investments. This adjustment is not permitted under GAAP on the Consolidated Income Statement.
Taxable-equivalent interest

(Continued)
Glossary of Terms
 
- Tier 1 risk-based capital equals: total shareholders' equity, plus trust preferred capital securities, plus certain minority interests that are held by others; less goodwill and certain other intangible assets (net of eligible deferred taxes relating to nontaxable combinations), less equity investments in nonfinancial companies and less net unrealized holding losses on available for sale equity securities. Net unrealized holding gains on available for sale equity securities, net unrealized holding gains (losses) on available for sale debt securities and net unrealized holding gains (losses) on cash flow hedge derivatives are excluded from total shareholders' equity for Tier 1 risk-based capital purposes.
Tier 1 risk-based capital
- Tier 1 risk-based capital divided by period-end risk-weighted assets.
Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio
- - Total domestic and offshore fund investment assets for which we provide related processing services. We do not include these assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Total fund assets serviced
- A non-traditional swap where one party agrees to pay the other the "total return" of a defined underlying asset (., a loan), usually in return for receiving a stream of LIBOR-based cash flows. The total returns of the asset, including interest and any default shortfall, are passed through to the counterparty. The counterparty is therefore assuming the credit and economic risk of the underlying asset.
Total return swap
e.g
- Tier 1 risk-based capital plus qualifying subordinated debt and trust preferred securities, other minority interest not qualified as Tier 1, and the allowance for loan and lease losses, subject to certain limitations.
Total risk-based capital
- Total risk-based capital divided by period-end risk-weighted assets.
Total risk-based capital ratio
- The sum of money market and interest-bearing demand deposits and demand and other noninterest-bearing deposits.
Transaction deposits
- A graph showing the relationship between the yields on financial instruments or market indices of the same credit quality with different maturities. For example, a "normal" or "positive" yield curve exists when long-term bonds have higher yields than short-term bonds. A "flat" yield curve exists when yields are the same for short-term and long-term bonds. A "steep" yield curve exists when yields on long-term bonds are significantly higher than on short-term bonds. An "inverted" or "negative" yield curve exists when short-term bonds have higher yields than long-term bonds.
