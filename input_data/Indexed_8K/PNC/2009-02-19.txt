At a meeting held on February 12, 2009, our Board of Directors approved various amendments to our By-Laws, as described below. The effective date for these amendments is February 12, 2009. Our Board's Nominating and Governance Committee previously reviewed these amendments and recommended their adoption to the full Board. We have attached the text of the Board-approved amended and restated By-Laws to this Report as Exhibit 3.2, and the descriptions in this Report are qualified in their entirety by reference to that exhibit.
Amendments to By-Laws.
Throughout this report, the amended and restated By-Laws effective February 12, 2009 are sometimes referred to as the "2009 By-Laws" and the previous amended and restated By-Laws effective December 14, 2005 are sometimes referred to as the "2005 By-Laws".

. The 2009 By-Laws revise the methods for nominating directors and making other proposals for action at an annual meeting of shareholders, as follows:

In addition, the 2009 By-Laws include a new provision that if the number of directors to be elected to the Board is increased and there is no public announcement by PNC naming all of the nominees for director or specifying the size of the increased Board of Directors at least 100 days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting, a shareholder's notice shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for any new positions created by such increase, if it shall be delivered no later than the close of business on the 10
th
day following the day on which such public announcement is first made by PNC.
The 2009 By-Laws also require a shareholder to update and supplement the notice, if necessary, so that the information provided or required to be provided shall be true and correct, and the 2009 By-Laws set forth the procedures for providing such updates and supplements.
The 2009 By-Laws update and revise the disclosures that shareholders must include in the notice, as follows:

The 2009 By-Laws also clarify that clause (b) above shall be the exclusive means for a shareholder to make nominations before a special meeting of shareholders, and set forth additional requirements for providing notice to PNC, including a description of the content of such notice and the timeframe for submitting such notice.
. The 2009 By-Laws also include additional provisions on the business to be properly brought before any meeting of shareholders. The revised provisions state, among other things, that:

. The 2009 By-Laws clarify that the size of the Board shall be established exclusively by resolution of the Whole Board, rather than "the Board of Directors".

Notwithstanding anything in the paragraph above to the contrary, in the event that the number of directors to be elected to the Board of Directors is increased and there is no public announcement by the Corporation naming all of the nominees for director or specifying the size of the increased Board of Directors at least 100 days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting, a shareholder's notice required by this By-Law shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for any new positions created by such increase, if it shall be delivered to the Secretary of the Corporation at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than the close of business on the 10

day following the day on which such public announcement is first made by the Corporation.
In addition, to be timely, a shareholder's notice shall further be updated and supplemented, if necessary, so that the information provided or required to be provided in such notice shall be true and correct as of the record date for the meeting and as of the date that is ten (10) business days prior to the meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof, and such update and supplement shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than five (5) business days after the record date for the meeting in the case of the update and supplement required to be made as of the record date, and not later than eight (8) business days prior to the date for the meeting, any adjournment or postponement thereof in the case of the update and supplement required to be made as of ten (10) business days prior to the meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof.

(d) With respect to each person, if any, whom the shareholder proposes to nominate for election or reelection to the Board of Directors, a shareholder's notice must, in addition to the matters set forth in paragraphs (a) and (c) above, also include a completed and signed questionnaire, representation and agreement required by Article III, Section 10. The Corporation may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information as may reasonably be required by the Corporation to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as an independent director of the Corporation or that could be material to a reasonable shareholder's understanding of the independence, or lack thereof, of such nominee.
 
Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors may be made at a special meeting of shareholders at which directors are to be elected pursuant to the Corporation's notice of meeting (a) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (b) provided that the Board of Directors has determined that directors shall be elected at such meeting, by any shareholder of the Corporation who (i) is a shareholder of record at the time of giving of notice provided for in this By-Law and will be such at the time of the special meeting, (ii) is entitled to vote at the meeting, and (iii) complies with the notice and other procedures set forth in this By-Law as to such nomination; clause (b) shall be the exclusive means for a shareholder to make nominations before a special meeting of shareholders. In the event the Corporation calls a special meeting of shareholders for the purpose of electing one or more directors to the Board of Directors, any such shareholder may nominate a person or persons (as the case may be) for election to such position(s) as specified in the Corporation's notice of meeting, if the shareholder's notice required by Section 2.1(3) with respect to any nomination (including the completed and signed questionnaire, representation and agreement required by Article III, Section 10) shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not earlier than the close of business on the 120
th
day prior to the date of such special meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 90
th
day prior to the date of such special meeting or, if the first public announcement of the date of such special meeting is less than 100 days prior to the date of such special meeting, the 10
th
day following the day on which public announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the Board of Directors to be elected at such meeting. In no event shall any adjournment or postponement of a special meeting or the announcement thereof commence a new time period for the giving of a shareholder's notice as described above.
 
(1) To be properly brought before a meeting of shareholders, business must be of a proper subject for action by shareholders under applicable law and must not, if implemented, cause the Corporation to violate any state, federal or foreign law or regulation, each as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors. No person may be appointed, nominated or elected as a director of the Corporation unless such person, at the time such person is nominated and appointed or elected, would then be able to serve as a director without conflicting in any manner with any state, federal or foreign law or regulation applicable to the Corporation, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors. Only such persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this By-Law shall be eligible to serve as directors and only such business shall be conducted at a meeting of shareholders as shall have been brought before the meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in this By-Law. Except as otherwise provided by law, the Articles of Incorporation of the Corporation or these By-Laws, the Chairman of the meeting shall have the power and duty to determine whether a nomination or any business proposed to be brought before the meeting was made or proposed, as the case may be, in accordance with the procedures set forth in this By-Law and, if any proposed nomination or business is not in compliance with this By-Law, to declare that such defective proposal or nomination shall be disregarded.
 
(2) For purposes of this By-Law, "public announcement" shall mean disclosure in a press release reported by a national news service or in a document publicly filed by the Corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.
(3) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this By-Law, a shareholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set forth in this By-Law; provided, however, that any references in these By-Laws to the Exchange Act or the rules promulgated thereunder are not intended to and shall not limit the requirements applicable to nominations or proposals as to any other business to be considered pursuant to Section 2.1 or Section 2.2.
 
Meetings of the shareholders shall be held at the principal office of the Corporation or at such other place as the Board of Directors may designate.
 
Written notice of every meeting of the shareholders shall be given, either personally, by electronic transmission or by mail, to each shareholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting at least five days prior to the day named for the meeting, unless a greater period of notice is required by law. The notice shall state the day, time and place of such meeting and the general nature of the business to be transacted. If mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be delivered when deposited in the United States mail with postage thereon prepaid, addressed to the shareholder at such shareholder's address as it appears on the stock transfer books of the Corporation. If notice is given by electronic transmission, such notice shall be deemed to be given at the times provided in the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law. Notice of a meeting may be waived in writing and attendance at a meeting shall itself constitute a waiver of notice of the meeting. Any previously scheduled meeting of the shareholders may be postponed, and (unless the Articles of Incorporation otherwise provides) any special meeting of the shareholders may be cancelled, by resolution of the Board of Directors upon public notice given prior to the date previously scheduled for such meeting of shareholders.
 
The presence, in person or by proxy, of shareholders entitled to cast at least a majority of the votes which all shareholders are entitled to cast on the particular matter shall constitute a quorum for the purpose of considering such matter. At a duly organized meeting, except as may be otherwise specified in the Articles of Incorporation or provided by law, each matter shall be decided upon receiving the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by all shareholders entitled to vote thereon and, if any shareholders are entitled to vote thereon as a class, upon receiving the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by the shareholders entitled to vote as a class. The Chairman of the meeting or a majority of the shares so represented may adjourn the meeting from time to time, whether or not there is such a quorum. No notice of the time and place of adjourned meetings need be given except as required by law. The shareholders present at a duly called meeting at which a quorum is present may continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough shareholders to leave less than a quorum.
 
The Board of Directors may fix a record date not more than ninety days prior to the date of any meeting of shareholders, or the date fixed for the payment of any dividend or distribution, or the date for the allotment of rights or the date when any change or conversion or exchange of shares will be made or go into effect. Only such shareholders as shall be shareholders of record at the close of business on the record date shall be entitled to notice of, or to vote at such meeting or to receive such allotment of rights or to exercise such rights, as the case may be.
Article III.
DIRECTORS
 
The business and offices of the Corporation shall be managed by the Board of Directors, which shall consist of not less than five nor more than thirty-six members as shall be established from time to time exclusively by resolution of the Whole Board.
 
After elected by the shareholders, directors shall hold office until the next succeeding annual meeting and until their successors shall have been elected and qualified.
 
Subject to applicable law and the rights of the holders of any series of the Corporation's preferred stock with respect to such series of preferred stock, all vacancies in the Board of Directors, including vacancies resulting from an increase in the number of directors, may be filled only by a majority of the remaining directors though less than a quorum, and any director so elected shall serve until the next annual meeting of the shareholders and until a successor shall have been elected and qualified.
 
As soon as practicable after the annual meeting of shareholders at which they were elected, the Board of Directors shall meet for the purpose of electing officers and the transaction of such other business as may be properly brought before the meeting.
 
Regular meetings of the Board of Directors may be held without notice at such times and at such places as the Board of Directors, by resolution, shall establish. When a regular meeting falls on a business holiday, it shall be held on the preceding or next following business day, as the Chief Executive Officer shall select.
 
Special meetings of the Board of Directors may be called by the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer or at the written request of a majority of the Board of Directors then in office. Notice of special meetings shall be given to each director personally or in writing, or by telephone, not later than during the day immediately preceding the day of such meeting and shall include the general nature of the business to be transacted at the meeting. A special meeting may be held at any time without notice if all the directors are present or if those not present waive notice of the meeting in accordance with these By-Laws.
 
A majority of the directors shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, and the acts of a majority of the directors present at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the acts of the Board of Directors. One or more directors may participate in a meeting of the Board of Directors, or in a meeting of a Committee of the Board of Directors by means of communication facilities enabling all persons participating in the meeting to hear each other. The directors present at a duly organized meeting may continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough directors to leave less than a quorum.
 
Any action which may be taken at a meeting of the Board of Directors may be taken without a meeting if a written consent or consents setting forth the action so taken is signed by all the directors and filed with the Corporate Secretary.
 
Directors shall be compensated for their services and reimbursed for their meeting attendance expenses, in such manner and at such time as the Board of Directors may determine.
 
To be eligible to be a nominee for election or reelection as a director of the Corporation, a person must deliver (in accordance with the applicable time periods prescribed for delivery of notice under Article II, Section 2) to the Secretary of the Corporation at the principal executive offices of the Corporation a written questionnaire with respect to the background and qualification of such person and the background of any other person or entity on whose behalf the nomination is being made (which questionnaire shall be provided by the Secretary upon written request) and a written representation and agreement (in the form provided by the Secretary upon written request) that such person (A) is not and will not become a party to (1) any agreement, arrangement or understanding with, and has not given any commitment or assurance to, any person or entity as to how such person, if elected as a director of the Corporation, will act or vote on any issue or question (a "Voting Commitment") that has not been disclosed to the Corporation or (2) any Voting Commitment that could limit or interfere with such person's ability to comply, if elected as a director of the Corporation, with such person's fiduciary duties under applicable law, (B) is not and will not become a party to any agreement, arrangement or understanding with any person or entity other than the Corporation with respect to any direct or
 
indirect compensation, reimbursement or indemnification in connection with service or action as a director that has not been disclosed to the Corporation, (C) in such person's individual capacity and on behalf of any person or entity on whose behalf the nomination is being made, would be in compliance, if elected as a director of the Corporation, and will comply with all applicable publicly disclosed corporate governance, conflict of interest, confidentiality and stock ownership and trading policies and guidelines of the Corporation and (D) will abide by the requirements of Article III, Section 11.
 
(A) Election of directors at all meetings of the shareholders at which directors are to be elected shall be by ballot, and, subject to the rights of the holders of any series of the Corporation's preferred stock to elect directors under specified circumstances, a majority of the votes cast at any meeting for the election of directors at which a quorum is present shall elect directors. For purposes of this By-Law, a majority of votes cast shall mean that the number of shares voted "for" a director's election exceeds 50% of the number of votes cast with respect to that director's election. Votes cast shall include votes to withhold authority in each case and exclude abstentions with respect to that director's election. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a contested election of directors, directors shall be elected by the vote of a plurality of the votes cast at any meeting for the election of directors at which a quorum is present. For purposes of this By-Law, a contested election shall mean any election of directors in which the number of candidates for election as directors exceeds the number of directors to be elected, with the determination thereof being made by the Secretary of the Corporation as of the close of the applicable notice of nomination period set forth in Article II, Section 2 of these By-Laws, based on whether one or more notice(s) of nomination were timely filed in accordance with said Article II, Section 2; provided, however, that the determination that an election is a "contested election" shall be determinative only as to the timeliness of a notice of nomination and not otherwise as to its validity. If, prior to the time the Corporation mails its initial proxy statement in connection with such election of directors, one or more notices of nomination are withdrawn such that the number of candidates for election as director no longer exceeds the number of directors to be elected, the election shall not be considered a contested election, but in all other cases, once an election is determined to be a contested election, directors shall be elected by the vote of a plurality of the votes cast.
(B) If a nominee for director who is an incumbent director is not elected and no successor has been elected at such meeting, the director shall promptly tender his or her resignation to the Board of Directors in accordance with the agreement contemplated by clause (D) of Article III, Section 10 of these By-Laws. The Nominating and Governance Committee shall make a recommendation to the Board of Directors as to whether to accept or reject the tendered resignation, or whether other action should be taken. The Board of Directors shall act on the tendered resignation, taking into account the Nominating and Governance Committee's recommendation, and publicly disclose (by a press release, a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission or other broadly disseminated means of communication) its decision regarding the tendered resignation and the rationale behind the decision within 90 days from the date of the certification of the election results. The Nominating and Governance Committee in making its recommendation, and the Board of Directors in making its decision, may each consider any factors or other information that it considers appropriate and relevant. The director
 
who tenders his or her resignation shall not participate in the recommendation of the Nominating and Governance Committee or the decision of the Board of Directors with respect to his or her resignation. If such incumbent director's resignation is not accepted by the Board of Directors, such director shall continue to serve until the next annual meeting and until his or her successor is duly elected, or his or her earlier resignation or removal. If a director's resignation is accepted by the Board of Directors pursuant to this By-Law, or if a nominee for director is not elected and the nominee is not an incumbent director, then the Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, may fill any resulting vacancy pursuant to the provisions of Article III, Section 3 of these By-Laws or may decrease the size of the Board of Directors pursuant to the provisions of Article III, Section 3 of these By-Laws.
(C) Except as otherwise provided by law, the Articles of Incorporation of the Corporation, or these By-Laws, in all matters other than the election of directors, the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the matter shall be the act of the shareholders.
Article IV.
OFFICERS

Upon appropriate action by the Boards of Directors of the Corporation and PNC Bank, National Association, any committee authorized by these By-Laws other than the Executive Committee may be designated and function as a joint committee of both Boards of Directors. The title and charter of such a committee need not reflect its status as a joint committee unless both Boards of Directors expressly provide otherwise.
 
The Board of Directors may authorize the establishment of such other committees as it shall deem advisable from time to time and may delegate to such committees such powers and authority as it shall deem appropriate and as shall be permitted by applicable laws and regulations. The Board shall appoint the members of any such other committee or shall determine the manner in which such members shall be appointed.

Except as otherwise expressly provided for herein or in the committee's charter, each committee may appoint a secretary, who need not be a director, adopt its own rules of procedure and, unless the Board of Directors has acted with respect thereto, determine the date, place and hour for its meetings. The Committee chairman or vice chairman may call a special meeting or reschedule a regular meeting if they deem it appropriate. In the absence of any other provision herein or in the committee's charter to the contrary, a majority of the members of any committee shall constitute a quorum, and the action of a majority of the members in attendance at a committee meeting shall constitute the action of the body.

Article VI.
STOCK CERTIFICATES
 
The interest of each shareholder of the Corporation may be evidenced by certificates for shares of stock in such form as the appropriate officers of the Corporation may from time to time prescribe or be uncertificated.
Certificates of stock of the Corporation shall be signed by the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, the President, any Vice Chairman, or any Vice President and shall be countersigned by the Corporate Secretary, the Treasurer, or any Assistant Corporate Secretary or Assistant Treasurer, and shall be sealed with the seal of the Corporation, which may be a facsimile. Where any such stock certificate is signed manually by a transfer agent or a registrar, the signatures of the officers may be facsimiles.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these By-Laws, at all times that the Corporation's stock is listed on a stock exchange, the shares of the stock of the Corporation shall comply with all direct registration system eligibility requirements established by such exchange, including any requirement that shares of the Corporation's stock be eligible for issue in book-entry form.

The shares of stock of the Corporation evidenced by certificates shall be transferable only on its books upon surrender of the stock certificate for such shares properly endorsed. The shares of stock of the Corporation which are uncertificated shall be transferable upon receipt of proper transfer instructions from the registered holder of the shares or by such person's attorney duly authorized in writing, and upon compliance with appropriate procedures for transferring shares in uncertificated form. No transfer of stock shall be valid as against the Corporation for any purpose until it shall have been entered in the stock records of the Corporation by an entry showing from and to whom transferred. The Board of Directors shall have power to appoint one or more Transfer Agents and Registrars for the transfer and registration of the Corporation's stock of any class, and may require, in the case of certificated shares of stock, that stock certificates shall be countersigned and registered by one or more such Transfer Agents and Registrars.
 
If a stock certificate shall be lost, stolen or destroyed, the shareholder may file with the Corporation an affidavit stating the circumstances of the loss, theft or destruction and may request the issuance of a new certificate. He shall give to the Corporation a bond which shall be in such sum, contain such terms and provisions and have such surety or sureties as the Board of Directors may direct. The Corporation may thereupon issue a new certificate replacing the certificate lost, stolen or destroyed.
Article VII.
DIRECTOR LIABILITY LIMITATION AND INDEMNIFICATION
 
A director of the Corporation shall, to the maximum extent permitted by the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, have no personal liability for monetary damages for any action taken, or any failure to take any action as a director, provided that this Section 1, Article VII shall not eliminate the liability of a director in any case where such elimination is not permitted by law.
 
Each person who at any time is or shall have been a director or officer of the Corporation, or is serving or shall have served at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, and his heirs, executors and administrators, shall be indemnified by the Corporation in accordance with and to the full extent permitted by the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania as in effect at the time of such indemnification. The foregoing right of indemnification shall constitute a contract between the Corporation and each of its directors and officers and shall not be deemed exclusive of other rights to which any director, officer, employee, agent or other person may be entitled in any capacity as a matter of law or under any by-law, agreement, vote of shareholders or directors, or otherwise. If authorized by the Board of Directors, the Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person to the full extent permitted by the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
The first (1st) paragraph of this Article VII, Section 2 provides indemnification only to persons who at any time are or shall have been (1) directors or officers of the Corporation or (2) directors or officers of the Corporation who are serving or shall have served at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise (any such person as described in (1) or (2) being a "Covered Person").
In connection with any threatened, pending or completed claim, action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, investigative, legislative or other, including without limitation an action by or in the right of the Corporation, in which a Covered Person was or is involved (as a party, a witness, by being threatened to be made a party, or otherwise) (each a "Proceeding") for which the Covered Person may be entitled to indemnification under this Article VII, Section 2, the Corporation shall pay the expenses (including without limitation
 
attorneys' fees and expenses) incurred by such Covered Person in any such Proceeding in advance of final disposition of such Proceeding (an "advancement of expenses") upon receipt by the Corporation of an undertaking, by or on behalf of such Covered Person, to repay all amounts so advanced if it is ultimately determined by final judicial decision from which there is no further right to appeal that such Covered Person is not entitled to be indemnified for such expenses under this Article VII, Section 2 or otherwise.
The Corporation will not, in connection with a Proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by a Covered Person, advance expenses to such person or, except as provided in the fifth (5th) paragraph of this Article VII, Section 2, indemnify such person pursuant to this Article VII, Section 2 unless the Proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.
If a written claim for indemnification or advancement of expenses pursuant to this Article VII, Section 2 is not paid in full by the Corporation within sixty (60) days after such claim has been received by the Corporation, the claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of any such claim, and if successful in whole or in part in any such suit, the claimant shall also be entitled to be paid the expenses of prosecuting such suit. It shall be a defense to any such suit (other than a suit to enforce a claim for advancement of expenses where the required undertaking has been received by the Corporation) that indemnification of the claimant would not be permitted by applicable law, but the burden of proving such defense shall be on the Corporation. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel or shareholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of any suit seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses pursuant to this Article VII, Section 2 that indemnification or advancement of expenses is proper in the circumstances, nor a determination by the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel or shareholders) that indemnification or advancement of expenses is not proper in the circumstances, shall, in itself, create a presumption that the claimant is not entitled to indemnification or advancement of expenses pursuant to this Article VII, Section 2 or be a defense to any such suit.
If any provision or provisions of this Article VII, Section 2 are held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason whatsoever: (1) the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Article VII, Section 2 (including without limitation each portion of any paragraph of this Article VII, Section 2 containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable that is not itself held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable) will not in any way be affected or impaired thereby; and (2) to the full extent possible, the provisions of this Article VII, Section 2 (including without limitation each such portion of any paragraph of this Article VII, Section 2 containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable) will be construed so as to give effect to the intent manifested by the provision or provisions held invalid, illegal or unenforceable.
If a claimant is entitled to indemnification pursuant to the provisions of this Article VII, Section 2 for some or a portion of the expense, liability and loss incurred or suffered by such person in connection with any Proceeding but not for the total amount thereof, the Corporation shall indemnify the claimant for the portion thereof to which the claimant is entitled.
 
The rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses set forth in this Article VII, Section 2: (1) shall be contract rights and such rights shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a Covered Person and shall inure to the benefit of a Covered Person's heirs, executors, administrators and legal representatives; and (2) shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which any director, officer, employee, agent or other person may be entitled in any capacity as a matter of law or under any charter provision, by-law, agreement, vote of shareholders or directors, or otherwise. Any repeal, amendment or modification of this Article VII, Section 2 or adoption of any other provision of the By-Laws or Articles of Incorporation of the Corporation which has the effect of limiting the rights set forth in this Article VII, Section 2 shall operate prospectively only and shall not affect any rights or obligations with respect to actions, omissions, circumstances or events occurring prior to the adoption of any such repeal, amendment or modification. Each Covered Person shall be deemed to be serving as such in reliance on the provisions of this Article VII, Section 2. Nothing in this Article VII, Section 2 shall require the Corporation to take any action that would be prohibited by applicable law.
 
The Corporation may provide indemnification and advancement of expenses to any employee or agent of the Corporation up to the full extent of the provisions of Article VII, Section 2 of these By-Laws with respect to the indemnification and advancement of expenses of directors and officers of the Corporation.
Article VIII.
