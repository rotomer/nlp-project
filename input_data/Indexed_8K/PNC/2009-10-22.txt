On October 22, 2009, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. ("the Corporation") issued a press release and held a conference call for investors regarding the Corporation's earnings and business results for the third quarter and first nine months of 2009. The Corporation also provided supplementary financial information on its web site, including financial information disclosed in connection with its press release, and provided electronic presentation slides on its web site used in connection with the related investor conference call. Copies of the supplementary financial information and electronic presentation slides are included in this Report as Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2, respectively, and are furnished herewith.
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
The information contained in this Financial Supplement is preliminary, unaudited and based on data available on October 22, 2009. We have reclassified certain prior period amounts to be consistent with the current period presentation. This information speaks only as of the particular date or dates included in the schedules. We do not undertake any obligation to, and disclaim any duty to, correct or update any of the information provided in this Financial Supplement. Our future financial performance is subject to risks and uncertainties as described in our United States Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") filings.
National City Corporation Acquisition
On December 31, 2008, we acquired National City Corporation ("National City"). The accompanying period-end balance sheet includes National City's assets and liabilities beginning December 31, 2008. Our average balance sheet and income statement includes National City's balances beginning January 1, 2009. Other financial information reported follows this same convention except that period-end disclosures in the business segment portions of this Financial Supplement do not include National City at December 31, 2008 unless otherwise noted.
During the first nine months of 2009, additional information was obtained about the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of December 31, 2008 which resulted in adjustments to the initial purchase price allocation. Most significantly, additional information was obtained on the credit quality of certain loans as of the acquisition date which resulted in additional fair value writedowns on acquired impaired loans. Adjustments to the purchase price allocation are summarized in the table below. Further modifications to the purchase price allocation may occur, resulting in the recognition of goodwill and liabilities during the fourth quarter.

Asset Management Group
directly originates first lien residential mortgage loans on a nationwide basis with a significant presence within the retail banking footprint and also originates loans through joint venture partners. Mortgage loans represent loans collateralized by one-to-four-family residential real estate and are made to borrowers in good credit standing. These loans are typically underwritten to third party standards and sold to primary mortgage market aggregators (Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Ginnie Mae, Federal Home Loan Banks and third-party investors) with servicing retained. The mortgage servicing operation performs all functions related to servicing first mortgage loans for various investors. Certain loans originated through our joint ventures are serviced by a joint venture partner. In November 2009, we will end our joint venture relationship related to our legacy PNC business and will rebrand the former National City Mortgage as PNC Mortgage.

- Net domestic and foreign fund investment assets for which we provide accounting and administration services. We do not include these assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Accounting/administration net fund assets
- The excess of a loan's cash flows expected to be collected over the carrying value of the loan. The accretable yield is recognized in interest income over the remaining life of the loan using the constant effective yield method.
Accretable yield
- Primarily comprised of total average quarterly (or annual) assets plus (less) unrealized losses (gains) on investment securities, less goodwill and certain other intangible assets (net of eligible deferred taxes).
Adjusted average total assets
- Adjusted to reflect a full year of activity.
Annualized
- Assets over which we have sole or shared investment authority for our customers/clients. We do not include these assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Assets under management
- One hundredth of a percentage point.
Basis point
- Process of removing a loan or portion of a loan from our balance sheet because it is considered uncollectible. We also record a charge-off when a loan is transferred to held for sale by reducing the loan carrying amount to the fair value of the loan.
Charge-off
- Common shareholders' equity divided by total assets. Common shareholders' equity equals total shareholders' equity less the liquidation value of preferred stock.
Common shareholders' equity to total assets
- The difference in yield between debt issues of similar maturity. The excess of yield attributable to credit spread is often used as a measure of relative creditworthiness, with a reduction in the credit spread reflecting an improvement in the borrower's perceived creditworthiness.
Credit spread
- Investment assets held on behalf of clients under safekeeping arrangements. We do not include these assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Investment assets held in custody at other institutions on our behalf are included in the appropriate asset categories on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as if physically held by us.
Custody assets
- Financial contracts whose value is derived from publicly traded securities, interest rates, currency exchange rates or market indices. Derivatives cover a wide assortment of financial contracts, including forward contracts, futures, options and swaps.
Derivatives
- An estimate of the rate sensitivity of our economic value of equity. A negative duration of equity is associated with asset sensitivity ( positioned for rising interest rates), while a positive value implies liability sensitivity ( positioned for declining interest rates). For example, if the duration of equity is +1.5 years, the economic value of equity declines by 1.5% for each 100 basis point increase in interest rates.
Duration of equity
i.e.,
i.e.,
- Assets that generate income, which include: Federal funds sold; resale agreements; trading securities; interest-earning deposits with banks; other short-term investments; loans held for sale; loans; investment securities; and certain other assets.
Earning assets
 
- Represents the amount of resources that a business segment should hold to guard against potentially large losses that could cause insolvency. It is based on a measurement of economic risk, as opposed to risk as defined by regulatory bodies. The economic capital measurement process involves converting a risk distribution to the capital that is required to support the risk, consistent with our target credit rating. As such, economic risk serves as a "common currency" of risk that allows us to compare different risks on a similar basis.
Economic capital
- A measurement, expressed in years, that, when multiplied by a change in interest rates, would approximate the percentage change in value of on- and off- balance sheet positions.
Effective duration
- Noninterest expense divided by the sum of net interest income (GAAP basis) and noninterest income.
Efficiency
- The price that would be received to sell an asset or the price that would be paid to transfer a liability on the measurement date using the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between willing market participants.
Fair value
- A management accounting methodology designed to recognize the net interest income effects of sources and uses of funds provided by the assets and liabilities of a business segment. We assign these balances LIBOR-based funding rates at origination that represent the interest cost for us to raise/invest funds with similar maturity and repricing structures.
Funds transfer pricing
- Contracts in which the buyer agrees to purchase and the seller agrees to deliver a specific financial instrument at a predetermined price or yield. May be settled either in cash or by delivery of the underlying financial instrument.
Futures and forward contracts
- Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
GAAP
- Collectively, securities available for sale and securities held to maturity.
Investment securities
- Tier 1 risk-based capital divided by adjusted average total assets.
Leverage ratio
- Acronym for London InterBank Offered Rate. LIBOR is the average interest rate charged when banks in the London wholesale money market (or interbank market) borrow unsecured funds from each other. LIBOR rates are used as a benchmark for interest rates on a global basis.
LIBOR
- A management accounting assessment, using funds transfer pricing methodology, of the net interest contribution from loans and deposits.
Net interest income from loans and deposits
- Annualized taxable-equivalent net interest income divided by average earning assets.
Net interest margin
- Assets we hold for our customers/clients in a non-discretionary, custodial capacity. We do not include these assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Nondiscretionary assets under administration
- Noninterest income divided by the sum of net interest income (GAAP basis) and noninterest income.
Noninterest income to total revenue
- Nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans, troubled debt restructured loans, foreclosed assets and other assets. We do not accrue interest income on assets classified as nonperforming.
Nonperforming assets
- Nonperforming loans include loans to commercial, commercial real estate, equipment lease financing, consumer, and residential mortgage customers and construction customers as well as troubled debt restructured loans. Nonperforming loans do not include loans held for sale or foreclosed and other assets. We do not accrue interest income on loans classified as nonperforming.
Nonperforming loans
- A number of currency units, shares, or other units specified in a derivatives contract.
Notional amount
 
- The period to period dollar or percentage change in total revenue (GAAP basis) less the dollar or percentage change in noninterest expense. A positive variance indicates that revenue growth exceeded expense growth ( positive operating leverage) while a negative variance implies expense growth exceeded revenue growth ( negative operating leverage).
Operating leverage
i.e.,
i.e.,
- When the fair value of a debt security is less than its amortized cost basis, an assessment is performed to determine whether the impairment is other-than-temporary. If we intend to sell the security or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current-period credit loss, an other-than-temporary impairment is considered to have occurred. In such cases, an other-than-temporary impairment is recognized in earnings equal to the entire difference between the investment's amortized cost basis and its fair value at the balance sheet date. Further, if we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost of the security, an other-than-temporary impairment is considered to have occurred. However, if we do not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely that we will be required to sell the security before its recovery, the other-than-temporary loss is separated into (a) the amount representing the credit loss, and (b) the amount related to all other factors. The other-than-temporary impairment related to credit losses is recognized in earnings while the amount related to all other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income, net of tax.
Other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI)
- Total revenue less noninterest expense.
Pretax, pre-provision earnings
- Accretion of the discounts and premiums on acquired assets and liabilities. The purchase accounting accretion is recognized in net interest income over the weighted average life of the financial instruments using the constant effective yield method.
Purchase accounting accretion
- Acquired loans determined to be credit impaired. Loans are determined to be impaired if there is evidence of credit deterioration since origination and for which it is probable that all contractually required payments will not be collected.
Purchased impaired loans
- The initial investment of a purchased impaired loan plus interest accretion and less any cash payments and writedowns. The recorded investment excludes any valuation allowance which is included in our allowance for loan and lease losses.
Recorded investment
- Cash proceeds received on a loan that we had previously charged off. We credit the amount received to the allowance for loan and lease losses.
Recovery
- Project-specific loans to commercial customers for the construction or development of residential real estate including land, single family homes, condominiums and other residential properties. This would exclude loans to commercial customers where proceeds are for general corporate purposes whether or not such facilities are secured.
Residential development loans
- We have elected to measure acquired or originated residential mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) at fair value under GAAP. We employ a risk management strategy designed to protect the economic value of MSRs from changes in interest rates. This strategy utilizes securities and a portfolio of derivative instruments to hedge changes in the fair value of MSRs arising from changes in interest rates. These financial instruments are expected to have changes in fair value which are negatively correlated to the change in fair value of the MSR portfolio. Net MSR hedge gains/(losses) represent the change in the fair value of MSRs, exclusive of changes due to time decay and payoffs, combined with the change in the fair value of the associated derivative instruments.
Residential mortgage servicing rights hedge gains / (losses), net
- Annualized net income divided by average assets.
Return on average assets
- Annualized net income divided by average capital.
Return on average capital
- Annualized net income less preferred stock dividends, including preferred stock discount accretion, divided by average common shareholders' equity.
Return on average common shareholders' equity
 
- Computed by the assignment of specific risk-weights (as defined by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System) to assets and off-balance sheet instruments.
Risk-weighted assets
- The process of legally transforming financial assets into securities.
Securitization
- An intangible asset or liability created by an obligation to service assets for others. Typical servicing rights include the right to receive a fee for collecting and forwarding payments on loans and related taxes and insurance premiums held in escrow.
Servicing rights
- The interest income earned on certain assets is completely or partially exempt from federal income tax. As such, these tax-exempt instruments typically yield lower returns than taxable investments. To provide more meaningful comparisons of yields and margins for all interest-earning assets, we use interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis in calculating average yields and net interest margins by increasing the interest income earned on tax-exempt assets to make it fully equivalent to interest income earned on other taxable investments. This adjustment is not permitted under GAAP on the Consolidated Income Statement.
Taxable-equivalent interest
- Tier 1 risk-based capital, less preferred equity, less trust preferred capital securities, and less noncontrolling interests.
Tier 1 common capital
- Tier 1 common capital divided by period-end risk-weighted assets.
Tier 1 common capital ratio
- Total shareholders' equity, plus trust preferred capital securities, plus certain noncontrolling interests that are held by others; less goodwill and certain other intangible assets (net of eligible deferred taxes relating to taxable and nontaxable combinations), less equity investments in nonfinancial companies less ineligible servicing assets and less net unrealized holding losses on available for sale equity securities. Net unrealized holding gains on available for sale equity securities, net unrealized holding gains (losses) on available for sale debt securities and net unrealized holding gains (losses) on cash flow hedge derivatives are excluded from total shareholders' equity for Tier 1 risk-based capital purposes.
Tier 1 risk-based capital
- Tier 1 risk-based capital divided by period-end risk-weighted assets.
Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio
- Total shareholders' equity less noncontrolling interests.
Total equity
- Total domestic and offshore fund investment assets for which we provide related processing services. We do not include these assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Total fund assets serviced
- Tier 1 risk-based capital plus qualifying subordinated debt and trust preferred securities, other noncontrolling interest not qualified as Tier 1, eligible gains on available for sale equity securities and the allowance for loan and lease losses, subject to certain limitations.
Total risk-based capital
- Total risk-based capital divided by period-end risk-weighted assets.
Total risk-based capital ratio
- The sum of money market and interest-bearing demand deposits and demand and other noninterest-bearing deposits.
Transaction deposits
- A restructuring of debt whereby the lender for economic or legal reasons related to the borrower's financial difficulties grants a concession to the borrower that it would not otherwise consider.
Troubled debt restructuring
- A graph showing the relationship between the yields on financial instruments or market indices of the same credit quality with different maturities. For example, a "normal" or "positive" yield curve exists when long-term bonds have higher yields than short-term bonds. A "flat" yield curve exists when yields are the same for short-term and long-term bonds. A "steep" yield curve exists when yields on long-term bonds are significantly higher than on short-term bonds. An "inverted" or "negative" yield curve exists when short-term bonds have higher yields than long-term bonds.
