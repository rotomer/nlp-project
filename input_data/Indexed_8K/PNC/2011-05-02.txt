Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
Director Compensation Review
On April 26, 2011, the Nominating and Governance Committee of the Board of Directors of The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. met and conducted its annual review of compensation for the Board's non-employee directors. The Committee reviewed a report on director compensation prepared by Towers Watson, a compensation consulting firm, and the recommendations contained in that report.
In undertaking this annual review, the Committee's primary objectives were to confirm that the director compensation program continued to align business and shareholder interests, to evaluate the competitiveness of the program relative to PNC's peer group, and to identify and respond to changes in director compensation in light of the competitive environment.
Following deliberation and discussion, and consistent with Towers Watson's recommendations, the Committee approved:
 
 
The Committee made no other changes to the compensation program for non-employee directors.
