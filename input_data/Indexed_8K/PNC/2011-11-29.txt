Item 8.01 Other Events.
The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. ("PNC") has been notified that the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System had no objections to the proposed revisions to the capital actions submitted by PNC as they pertain to the acquisition of RBC Bank (USA). Accordingly, we do not plan to issue any shares of PNC common stock as part of the consideration payable to Royal Bank of Canada at closing, nor to repurchase any PNC common shares in 2011. As a result, PNC expects that the acquisition of RBC Bank (USA) will be immediately accretive to earnings (excluding integration costs) upon closing which is expected to occur in the first quarter of 2012. The acquisition remains subject to regulatory approvals, including from the Board of Governors, and other customary closing conditions.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
