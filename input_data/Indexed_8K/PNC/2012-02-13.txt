Item 5.02(e). Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers
5.02(e).
On February 7, 2012, the Personnel and Compensation Committee (Committee) of our Board of Directors, following a discussion with all of our Board's independent directors, approved compensation decisions for the executive officers named in the most recent proxy statement that we filed in connection with our annual meeting of shareholders. With respect to these named executive officers, and except as disclosed below, the Committee made compensation decisions that were materially consistent with the terms that we previously disclosed as part of our 2011 compensation program.
At the meeting on February 7, the Committee approved a change to the composition of the total target compensation amount for 2012 for E. William Parsley, III, our Executive Vice President, Treasurer and Chief Investment Officer. Mr. Parsley was a named executive officer in last year's proxy statement. The Committee increased Mr. Parsley's 2012 base salary by $100,000 (from $400,000 to $500,000) and similarly decreased his target annual cash incentive award for 2012 by $100,000.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
