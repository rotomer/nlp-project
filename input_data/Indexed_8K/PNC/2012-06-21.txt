On June 15, 2012, PNC Bank, National Association ("PNC Bank"), an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. ("PNC"), sold $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of Senior Extendible Floating Rate Bank Notes (the "Extendible Note"). The initial maturity date of the Extendible Note is July 20, 2013, subject to the holder's monthly option to extend, with a final maturity date of June 20, 2014. Interest on the Extendible Note is 3-month LIBOR, reset quarterly, plus a spread of 22.5 basis points, which spread is subject to four potential one basis point increases in the event of certain extensions of maturity by the holder. The Extendible Note is redeemable at the option of PNC Bank in whole but not in part on June 20, 2013. In addition, on any date a holder does not elect to extend maturity with respect to any portion or all of the principal amount of the Extendible Note, PNC Bank may elect to redeem any portion or all of the principal amount of the Extendible Note for which maturity is not extended.
The Extendible Note ranks equally with all other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of PNC Bank, except deposit liabilities and other obligations that are entitled to any priority or preferences. The dealer on this offering was PNC Capital Markets LLC. The Extendible Note was issued in a private placement under PNC Bank's $20.0 billion program for senior and subordinated unsecured debt obligations with maturities of more than nine months.

Commencing on the Initial Interest Reset Date, the rate at which interest on this Senior Note is
 
payable shall be reset as of each Interest Reset Date specified on the face hereof; , , that the interest rate in effect for the period from the Original Issue Date to but excluding the Initial Interest Reset Date will be the Initial Interest Rate.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if this Senior Note is designated on the face hereof as having an Addendum attached, this Senior Note shall bear interest in accordance with the terms described in such Addendum.
Except as set forth above or specified on the face hereof or in an Addendum hereto, the interest rate in effect on each day shall be (i) if such day is an Interest Reset Date, the interest rate determined as of the Interest Determination Date (as defined hereinafter) immediately preceding such Interest Reset Date or (ii) if such day is not an Interest Reset Date, the interest rate determined as of the Interest Determination Date immediately preceding the most recent Interest Reset Date. If any Interest Reset Date would otherwise be a day that is not a Business Day, such Interest Reset Date shall be postponed to the next succeeding day that is a Business Day, except that if LIBOR is an applicable Interest Rate Basis and if such Business Day falls in the next succeeding calendar month, such Interest Reset Date will be the immediately preceding Business Day. In addition, if the Treasury Rate is an applicable Interest Rate Basis and the Interest Determination Date would otherwise fall on an Interest Reset Date, then such Interest Reset Date will be postponed to the next succeeding Business Day.
 
Unless otherwise specified on the face hereof, interest payable on this Senior Note on any Interest Payment Date will equal the amount of interest accrued from and including the next preceding Interest Payment Date in respect of which interest has been paid (or from and including the Original Issue Date specified on the face hereof, if no interest has been paid), to but excluding the related Interest Payment Date or Maturity Date or date of earlier redemption or repayment, as the case may be.
Unless otherwise specified on the face hereof, accrued interest hereon shall be an amount calculated by multiplying the face amount hereof by an accrued interest factor. Such accrued interest factor is computed by adding the interest factor calculated for each day in the period for which interest is being calculated. Unless otherwise specified on the face hereof, the interest factor for each such date will be computed by dividing the interest rate applicable to such day by 360 if the Commercial Paper Rate, the Federal Funds Rate, LIBOR or the Prime Rate is an applicable Interest Rate Basis or by the actual number of days in the year if the CMT Rate or the Treasury Rate is an applicable Interest Rate Basis. Unless otherwise specified on the face hereof, the interest factor for this Senior Note, if the interest rate is calculated with reference to two or more Interest Rate Bases, will be calculated in each period in the same manner as if only the applicable Interest Rate Bases specified on the face hereof applied.
The interest rate applicable to each day in an Interest Reset Period commencing on the related Interest Reset Date will be determined by the Calculation Agent as of the applicable Interest Determination Date and will be calculated by the Calculation Agent on or prior to the Calculation Date (as defined hereinafter), except with respect to LIBOR, which will be calculated on such Interest Determination Date.

If the interest rate of this Senior Note is determined with reference to two or more Interest Rate Bases specified on the face hereof, the "Interest Determination Date" pertaining to this Senior Note shall be the latest Business Day which is at least two Business Days prior to the applicable Interest Reset Date on which each Interest Rate Basis is determinable. Each Interest Rate Basis shall be determined as of such date, and the applicable interest rate shall take effect on the related Interest Reset Date.

Unless otherwise specified on the face hereof, the "Calculation Date" pertaining to any Interest Determination Date will be the earlier of (i) the tenth calendar day after such Interest
 
Determination Date or, if such day is not a Business Day, the next succeeding Business Day and (ii) the Business Day immediately preceding the applicable Interest Payment Date or Maturity Date or date of earlier redemption or repayment, as the case may be.

The determination of any interest rate by the Calculation Agent will be final and binding absent manifest error.
All percentages resulting from any calculation on this Senior Note will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred-thousandth of a percentage point, with five one-millionths of a percentage point rounded upward (e.g., 9.876545% (or 0.09876545) would be rounded to 9.87655% (or 0.0987655) and 9.876544% (or 0.09876544) would be rounded to 9.87654% (or 0.0987654)), and all dollar amounts used in or resulting from such calculation will be rounded, in the case of United States dollars, to the nearest cent or, in the case of a foreign currency, to the smallest denominational unit (with one-half cent being rounded upwards).
As used herein, "Business Day" means, unless otherwise specified on the face hereof, any day that is not a Saturday or Sunday and that in The City of New York and in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania is not a day on which banking institutions are authorized or required by law, regulation or executive order to close and, if an Interest Rate Basis shown on the face hereof is LIBOR, is also a London Banking Day.
As used herein, unless otherwise specified on the face hereof, "London Banking Day" means any day on which dealings in deposits in U.S. dollars are transacted in the London interbank market.
. If an Interest Rate Basis for this Senior Note is the CMT Rate, as specified on the face hereof, the CMT Rate shall be determined by the Calculation Agent as of the applicable Interest Determination Date (a "CMT Rate Interest Determination Date") in accordance with the following provisions:
CMT Rate
(i) If "CMT Moneyline Telerate Page 7051" is specified on the face hereof, the CMT Rate on the CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be a percentage equal to the yield for United States Treasury securities at "constant maturity" having the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof as set forth in H.15(519) (as defined hereinafter) under the caption "Treasury Constant Maturities", as such yield is displayed on Moneyline Telerate (or any successor service) on page 7051 (or any other page as may replace such page on such service) ("Moneyline Telerate Page 7051") for such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date. If such rate does not appear on Moneyline Telerate Page 7051, the CMT Rate on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be a percentage equal to the yield for United States Treasury securities at "constant maturity" having the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof and for such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date as set forth in H.15(519) under the caption "Treasury Constant Maturities". If such rate does not appear in H.15(519), the CMT Rate on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be the rate for the period of the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof as may then be published by either the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the "Federal Reserve Board") or the United States Department of the Treasury that the Calculation Agent determines to be comparable to the rate which would otherwise have been published in H.15(519). If the Federal Reserve Board or the United States Department of the
 
Treasury does not publish a yield on United States Treasury securities at "constant maturity" having the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof for such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date, the CMT Rate on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be calculated by the Calculation Agent and shall be a yield-to-maturity based on the arithmetic mean of the secondary market bid prices at approximately 3:30 P.M., New York City time, on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date of three leading primary United States government securities dealers in The City of New York (which may include the Dealers or their affiliates) (each, a "Reference Dealer") selected by the Calculation Agent (from five such Reference Dealers selected by the Calculation Agent and eliminating the highest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the highest) and the lowest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the lowest)) for United States Treasury securities with an original maturity equal to the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof, a remaining term to maturity no more than 1 year shorter than the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof and in a principal amount that is representative for a single transaction in such securities in such market at such time. If fewer than five but more than two such prices are provided as requested the CMT Rate on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be calculated by the Calculation Agent and shall be based on the arithmetic mean of the bid prices obtained and neither the highest nor the lowest of such quotations shall be eliminated. If fewer than three prices are provided as requested, the CMT Rate on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be calculated by the Calculation Agent and shall be a yield-to-maturity based on the arithmetic mean of the secondary market bid prices as of approximately 3:30 P.M., New York City time, on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date of three Reference Dealers selected by the Calculation Agent (from five such Reference Dealers selected by the Calculation Agent and eliminating the highest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the highest) and the lowest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the lowest)) for United States Treasury securities with an original maturity greater than the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof, a remaining term to maturity closest to the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof and in a principal amount that is representative for a single transaction in such securities in such market at such time. If fewer than five but more than two such prices are provided as requested, the CMT Rate on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be calculated by the Calculation Agent and shall be based on the arithmetic mean of the bid prices obtained and neither the highest nor the lowest of such quotations shall be eliminated; provided, however, that if fewer than three such prices are provided as requested, the CMT Rate determined as of such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be the CMT Rate in effect on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date. If two such United States Treasury securities with an original maturity greater than the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof have remaining terms to maturity equally close to the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof, the quotes for the Treasury security with the shorter original term to maturity will be used.
(ii) If "CMT Moneyline Telerate Page 7052" is specified on the face hereof, the CMT Rate on the CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be a percentage equal to the one-week or one-month, as specified on the face hereof, average yield for United States Treasury securities at "constant maturity" having the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof as set forth in H.15(519) opposite the caption "Treasury Constant Maturities", as such yield is displayed on Moneyline Telerate (or any successor service) on page 7052 (or any other page as may replace such page on such service ) ("Moneyline Telerate Page 7052") for the week or month, as applicable, ended immediately preceding the week or month, as applicable, in which such CMT
 
Rate Interest Determination Date falls. If such rate does not appear on the Moneyline Telerate Page 7052, the CMT Rate on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be a percentage equal to the one-week or one-month, as specified on the face hereof, average yield for United States Treasury securities at "constant maturity" having the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof and for the week or month, as applicable, preceding such. CMT Rate Interest Determination Date as set forth in H.15(519) opposite the caption "Treasury Constant Maturities". If such rate does not appear in H.15(519), the CMT Rate on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be the one-week or one-month, as specified on the face hereof, average yield for United States Treasury securities at "constant maturity" having the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof as otherwise announced by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for the week or month, as applicable, ended immediately preceding the week or month, as applicable, in which such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date falls. If the Federal Reserve Bank of New York does not publish a one-week or one-month, as specified on the face hereof, average yield on United States Treasury securities at "constant maturity" having the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof for the applicable week or month, the CMT Rate on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be calculated by the Calculation Agent and shall be a yield-to-maturity based on the arithmetic mean of the secondary market bid prices at approximately 3:30 P.M., New York City time, on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date of three Reference Dealers selected by the Calculation Agent (from five such Reference Dealers selected by the Calculation Agent and eliminating the highest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the highest) and the lowest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the lowest)) for United States Treasury securities with an original maturity equal to the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof, a remaining term to maturity of no more than 1 year shorter than the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof and in a principal amount that is representative for a single transaction in such securities in such market at such time. If fewer than five but more than two such prices are provided as requested, the CMT Rate on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be the rate on the CMT Rate Interest Determination Date calculated by the Calculation Agent based on the arithmetic mean of the bid prices obtained and neither the highest nor lowest of such quotations shall be eliminated. If fewer than three prices are provided as requested, the CMT Rate on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be calculated by the Calculation Agent and shall be a yield-to-maturity based on the arithmetic mean of the secondary market bid prices as of approximately 3:30 P.M., New York City time, on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date of three Reference Dealers selected by the Calculation Agent (from five such Reference Dealers selected by the Calculation Agent and eliminating the highest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the highest) and the lowest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the lowest)) for United States Treasury securities with an original maturity greater than the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof, a remaining term to maturity closest to the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof and in a principal amount that is representative for a single transaction in such securities in such market at such time. If fewer than five but more than two such prices are provided as requested, the CMT Rate on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be the rate on the CMT Rate Interest Determination Date calculated by the Calculation Agent based on the arithmetic mean of the bid prices obtained and neither the highest nor lowest of such quotations shall be eliminated; provided, however, that if fewer than three such prices are provided as requested, the CMT Rate determined as of such CMT Rate interest Determination Date shall be the CMT Rate in effect on such CMT Rate interest Determination Date. If two United States Treasury securities with an
 
original maturity greater than the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof have remaining terms to maturity equally close to the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof, the quotes for the Treasury security with the shorter original term to maturity will be used.
"H.15(519)" means the weekly statistical release designated as such, or any successor publication, published by the Federal Reserve Board.
. If an Interest Rate Basis for this Senior Note is the Commercial Paper Rate, as specified on the face hereof, the Commercial Paper Rate shall be determined as of the applicable Interest Determination Date (a "Commercial Paper Rate Interest Determination Date") as the Money Market Yield (as defined hereinafter) on such date of the rate for commercial paper having the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof as published in H.15(519) under the caption "Commercial Paper-Nonfinancial" or, if not so published by 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on the related Calculation Date, the Money Market Yield of the rate on such Commercial Paper Rate Interest Determination Date for commercial paper having the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof as published in H.15 Daily Update (as defined hereinafter), or such other recognized electronic source used for the purpose of displaying such rate, under the caption "Commercial Paper-Nonfinancial." If such rate is not yet published in H.15(519), H.15 Daily Update or another recognized electronic source by 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on such Calculation Date, then the Commercial Paper Rate on such Commercial Paper Rate Interest Determination Date will be calculated by the Calculation Agent and will be the Money Market Yield of the arithmetic mean of the offered rates at approximately 11:00 A.M., New York City time, on such Commercial Paper Rate Interest Determination Date of three leading dealers of United States dollar commercial paper in The City of New York (which may include the Dealers or their affiliates) selected by the Calculation Agent for commercial paper having the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof placed for industrial issuers whose bond rating is "Aa," or the equivalent, from a nationally recognized statistical rating organization; , , that if the dealers so selected by the Calculation Agent are not quoting as mentioned in this sentence, the Commercial Paper Rate determined as of such Commercial Paper Rate Interest Determination Date will be the Commercial Paper Rate in effect on such Commercial Paper Rate Interest Determination Date.
