On September 17, 2012, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (the "Corporation") filed a Statement with Respect to Shares (the "Statement") with the Secretary of State of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, establishing the rights, preferences, privileges, qualifications, restrictions and limitations of a new series of its preferred stock designated as the 5.375% Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series Q, $1.00 par value per share (the "Series Q Preferred Stock"). The Statement was filed in connection with an Underwriting Agreement, dated September 14, 2012 (the "Underwriting Agreement"), with Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., J .P. Morgan Securities LLC, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and PNC Capital Markets LLC (collectively, "Underwriters"), under which the Corporation agreed to sell to the Underwriters 18,000,000 depositary shares (the "Depositary Shares"), each representing a 1/4,000
th
 ownership interest in a share of the Series Q Preferred Stock, and granted them an option to purchase up to an additional 2,700,000 Depositary Shares to cover over-allotments, if any. Each holder of a Depositary Share will be entitled to the proportional rights of a share of Series Q Preferred Stock represented by the Depositary Share.
The Series Q Preferred Stock ranks senior to the Corporation's common stock, equally with the Corporation's outstanding Series B, K, L, O and P Preferred Stock, equally with the Corporation's Series H, I, J and M Preferred Stock when issued, and at least equally with each other series of preferred stock the Corporation may issue (except for any senior securities that may be issued with the requisite consent of the holders of the Series Q Preferred Stock and all parity stock), with respect to payments of dividends and distributions of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up.
Under the terms of the Series Q Preferred Stock, the ability of the Company to pay dividends on, make distributions with respect to, or to redeem, purchase or acquire, or make a liquidation payment on its common stock or any preferred stock ranking on a parity with or junior to the Series Q Preferred Stock, is subject to restrictions in the event that the Corporation does not declare dividends on the Series Q Preferred Stock for the most recently completed dividend period, or, in the case of a liquidation payment, does not pay to holders of the Series Q Preferred Stock the liquidation value of $100,000 per share, plus any declared and unpaid dividends, without accumulation of any undeclared dividends.
The terms of the Series Q Preferred Stock are more fully described in the Statement which is included as Exhibit 3.1 to this Current Report on Form 8K and is incorporated by reference herein.
 
On September 17, 2012, the Corporation filed the Statement with the Secretary of State of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, which became effective upon filing, amending our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation to establish the newly authorized Series Q Preferred Stock of the Corporation consisting of 5,175 authorized shares.
Holders of Series Q Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors, non-cumulative cash dividends based on the liquidation preference at a rate equal to 5.375% per annum for each dividend period from the original issue date of the Series Q Preferred Stock to, and including, the redemption date of the Series Q Preferred Stock, if any. If declared by the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors, dividends will be payable on the Series Q Preferred Stock quarterly, in arrears, on March 1, June 1, September 1 and December 1 of each year (each, a "Series Q Dividend Payment Date") beginning on December 1, 2012.
The Series Q Preferred Stock has a liquidation preference of $100,000 per share, plus any declared and unpaid dividends, without accumulation of any undeclared dividends. Liquidating distributions will be made on the Series Q Preferred Stock only to the extent the Corporation's assets are available after satisfaction of all liabilities to creditors and subject to the rights of holders of any security ranking senior to the Series Q Preferred Stock, and with any other shares of the Corporation's stock ranking equal to the Series Q Preferred Stock.
pro rata
The Series Q Preferred Stock does not have any maturity date. The Series Q Preferred Stock is redeemable (i) in whole or in part, from time to time, on any dividend payment date on or after December 1, 2017 at a redemption price equal to $100,000 per share (equivalent to $25.00 per depositary share), plus any declared and
unpaid dividends, without accumulation of any undeclared dividends, or (ii) in whole but not in part, at any time within 90 days following a regulatory capital treatment event (as defined in the Statement), at a redemption price equal to $100,000 per share (equivalent to $25.00 per depositary share), plus any declared and unpaid dividends and any accrued and unpaid dividends (whether or not declared) to the redemption date. If the Corporation redeems the Preferred Stock, the depositary will redeem a proportionate number of depositary shares. Accordingly, the Series Q Preferred Stock will remain outstanding indefinitely, unless and until the Corporation decides to redeem it and receives the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System applicable to bank holding companies. The Series Q Preferred Stock has no preemptive or conversion rights.
The Series Q Preferred Stock has no voting rights except with respect to (i) authorizing, increasing the authorized amount of, or issuing senior stock; (ii) authorizing adverse changes in the terms of the Series Q Preferred Stock; (iii) certain merger events; (iv) in the case of certain dividend non-payments only, electing directors; and (v) as otherwise required under Pennsylvania law.
The terms of the Series Q Preferred Stock are more fully described in the Statement which is included as Exhibit 3.1 to this Current Report on Form 8K and is incorporated by reference herein.
 
On September 21, 2012, the Corporation closed the public offering of 18,000,000 Depositary Shares pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement. The Depositary Shares and the Series Q Preferred Stock have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, by a registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-164364) (the "Registration Statement").

(a) Prior to the termination of the offering of the Securities, the Corporation will not file any amendment to the Registration Statement or supplement (including the Final Prospectus or any Preliminary Final Prospectus) to the Basic Prospectus unless the Corporation has furnished you a copy for your review prior to filing and will not file any such proposed amendment or supplement to which you reasonably object. Subject to the foregoing sentence, the Corporation will cause the Final Prospectus, properly completed, and any supplement thereto to be filed with the Commission pursuant to the applicable paragraph of Rule 424(b) within the time period prescribed; will prepare a final term sheet, containing solely a description of the Securities in a form approved by you and will file such term sheet pursuant to Rule 433(d) within the time period prescribed; will promptly file all other material required to be filed by the Corporation with the Commission pursuant to Rule 433(d) and will provide evidence satisfactory to the Representatives of such timely filing. The Corporation will promptly advise the Representatives (i) when the Registration Statement, if not effective at the Execution Time, and any amendment thereto, shall have become effective, (ii) when the Final Prospectus, and any supplement thereto, shall have been filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b), (iii) when any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus shall have been filed with the Commission, (iv) when, prior to termination of the offering of the Securities, any amendment to the Registration Statement shall have been filed or become effective, (v) of any request by the Commission for any amendment of the Registration Statement or supplement to the Final Prospectus or for any additional information, (vi) of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or the institution or threatening of any proceeding for that purpose and (vii) of the receipt by the Corporation of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of the Securities for sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose. The Corporation will use its best efforts to prevent the issuance of any such stop order and, if issued, to obtain as soon as possible the withdrawal thereof.
(b) If, at any time when a prospectus relating to the Securities is required to be delivered (or in lieu thereof, the notice referred to in Rule 173(a) under the Act) under the Act, any event occurs as a result of which the Final Prospectus as then supplemented would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein in the light of the circumstances under which they were made not misleading, or if it shall be necessary to amend the Registration Statement or supplement the Final Prospectus to comply with the Act or the Exchange Act or the respective rules thereunder, the Corporation promptly will advise the Underwriters of the happening of such event and prepare and file with the Commission, at the Corporation's expense, subject to the first sentence of paragraph (a) of this Section 4, an amendment or supplement which will correct such statement or omission or effect such compliance.
(c) As soon as practicable, the Corporation will make generally available to its security holders and to the Representatives an earnings statement or statements of the Corporation and its subsidiaries which will satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Act and Rule 158 under the Act.
 
(d) The Corporation will furnish to the Representatives and counsel for the Underwriters, without charge, copies of the Registration Statement (including exhibits thereto) and, so long as delivery of a prospectus by an Underwriter or dealer may be required by the Act, as many copies of any Preliminary Final Prospectus, the Final Prospectus and each Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and any supplement thereto as the Representatives may reasonably request. The Corporation will pay the expenses of printing or other production of all documents relating to the offering.
(e) The Corporation will use its best efforts to arrange for the qualification of the Securities for sale under the laws of such jurisdictions as the Representatives may designate, will maintain such qualifications in effect so long as required for the distribution of the Securities and will arrange for the determination of the legality of the Securities for purchase by institutional investors; , , that the Corporation shall not be required to qualify to do business in any jurisdiction where it is not now qualified or to take any action which would subject it to general or unlimited service of process in any jurisdiction where it is not now subject.
provided
however
(f) During the period beginning on the date hereof and continuing to and including the date 30 days after the date hereof, the Corporation will not, without the consent of the Representatives, offer, sell, contract to sell, announce the offering or otherwise dispose of any preferred securities or any other securities of the Corporation which are substantially similar to the Securities, including any guarantee of any such securities, or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for or representing the right to receive any such securities.
(g) During the period when the Securities are outstanding, the Corporation will not be or become an open end investment company, unit investment trust or face amount certificate company that is or required to be registered under Section 8 of the Investment Company Act.
(h) Whether or not the transactions contemplated in this Agreement are consummated or this Agreement is terminated, the Corporation agrees to pay all expenses, fees and taxes incident to the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, including, without limitation, (i) the fees, disbursements and expenses of its counsel and the accountants in connection with the issuance and sale of the Securities and all other fees or expenses in connection with the preparation of the Preliminary Final Prospectus, the Pricing Disclosure Package, the Final Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectuses prepared by or on behalf of, used by, or referred to by them and any amendments and supplements to any of the foregoing, including all printing costs associated therewith, and the delivering of copies thereof to the Underwriters and to dealers (including costs of mailing and shipment), (ii) all costs and expenses related to the transfer and delivery of the Securities to the Underwriters, including any transfer or other taxes payable thereon, (iii) the qualification of the Securities for offering and sale under state laws and the determination of their eligibility for investment under state law as aforesaid (including the
 
legal fees and filing fees and other disbursements of counsel for the Underwriters) and the printing and furnishing of copies of any blue sky surveys or legal investment surveys to the Underwriters and to dealers, (iv) any fees charged by rating agencies for the rating of the Securities, (v) the fees and expenses, if any, incurred in connection with the admission of the Securities in any appropriate stock exchange or market system, (vi) the costs of the preparation, issuance and delivery of the Securities, (vii) any filing for review of the public offering of the Securities by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, (viii) all costs and expenses incident to listing the shares on The New York Stock Exchange and (ix) all other costs and expenses incident to the performance of its obligations hereunder for which provision is not otherwise made in this Section. It is understood, however, that, except as provided in this Section and Section 7 hereof, the Underwriters will pay all of their own costs and expenses, including the fees and disbursements of their counsel and transfer taxes payable on resale of any of the Securities by them.
(i) The Corporation shall use commercially reasonable efforts to effect the admission, listing and trading of the Depositary Shares on The New York Stock Exchange within 30 days of the Closing Date.

(b) Each Underwriter represents and agrees that, without the prior consent of the Corporation and the Representatives, except for the final term sheet containing customary pricing terms prepared and filed pursuant to Section 4(a), it has not made and will not make any offer relating to the Securities that would constitute an "issuer free writing prospectus", as defined by Rule 433, or that would otherwise constitute a "free writing prospectus" as defined by Rule 405 that would be required to be filed with the Commission.
(c) Any free writing prospectus the use of which has been consented to by the Corporation and the Representatives (including the final term sheet prepared and filed pursuant to Section 4(a) hereof) is listed on Schedule III hereto.
(d) The Corporation has complied and will comply with the requirements of Rule 433 applicable to any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, including timely filing with the Commission or retention where required and legending.
(e) The Corporation agrees that if at any time following issuance of an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus any event occurred or occurs as a result of which such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus would conflict with the information in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package or the Final Prospectus or would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to
 
make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances then prevailing, not misleading, the Corporation will give prompt notice thereof to the Representatives and, if requested by the Representatives, will prepare and furnish without charge to each Underwriter an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or other document which will correct such conflict, statement or omission.

In connection with the foregoing, the Underwriters acknowledge and understand that the character of determinations involved in the process of preparing the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus (including any documents incorporated by reference) are such that such counsel need not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement or the Final Prospectus (including any documents incorporated by reference) except as expressly set forth herein;

(xv) the Deposit Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Corporation, and constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Corporation, enforceable against the Corporation in accordance with its terms (except as such enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, readjustment of debt, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or similar laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally, or general equity principles (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) and an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing).
 
In rendering such opinion, such counsel will opine only as to matters involving the application of the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania or the United States and may rely (A) as to matters involving the application of laws of any jurisdiction other than the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania or the United States, to the extent deemed proper and specified in such opinion, upon the opinion of other counsel of good standing believed to be reliable and who are reasonably satisfactory to counsel for the Underwriters, except that it will not be required that such counsel obtain an opinion of New York counsel as to matters of New York law in order to render such opinion or that such counsel express an opinion as to matters arising under the laws of any jurisdiction other than the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and matters of federal law arising under the laws of the United States of America, and (B) as to matters of fact, to the extent deemed proper, on certificates or representations of responsible officers of the Corporation and public officials. References to the Final Prospectus in this paragraph (b) include any supplements thereto at the Closing Date.
(c) The Representatives shall have received an opinion of Reed Smith LLP, counsel to the Corporation, dated the Closing Date or any Additional Closing Date, as applicable, substantially to the effect that:

(g) PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP shall have furnished to the Representatives letters (which may refer to letters previously delivered to the Representatives), dated as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Closing Date or any Additional Closing Date, as applicable, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives, confirming that they are independent accountants within the meaning of the Act and the Exchange Act and the respective applicable published rules and regulations thereunder and stating in effect that:
(i) in their opinion the audited consolidated financial statements audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP included or incorporated in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus and reported on by them comply in form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Act and the Exchange Act and the related published rules and regulations;
(ii) on the basis of a reading of the latest unaudited consolidated financial statements made available by the Corporation and its subsidiaries; carrying out certain specified procedures (but not an audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards) which would not necessarily reveal matters of significance with respect to the comments set forth in such letter; a reading of the minutes of the meetings of the shareholders and directors of the Corporation and the audit and executive committees thereof and inquiries of certain officials of the Corporation who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters of the Corporation and its subsidiaries as to transactions and events subsequent to the date of the most recent audited consolidated financial statements in or incorporated in the Final Prospectus, nothing came to their attention which caused them to believe that: (1) any unaudited consolidated financial statements included or incorporated in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus do not comply in form in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and with the published rules and regulations of the Commission with respect to the consolidated financial statements included or incorporated in quarterly reports on Form 10-Q under the Exchange Act; and said unaudited consolidated financial statements are not in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a basis substantially consistent with that of the audited consolidated financial statements included or incorporated in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus; or (2) with respect to the period subsequent to the date of the most recent audited or unaudited consolidated financial statements incorporated in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus, there were, at a specified date not more than five business days prior to the date of the letter, any increases in borrowed funds of the Corporation and its subsidiaries or any changes in the capital stock (defined as each of the individual dollar amounts of preferred stock, common stock, and capital surplus) of the Corporation or the stockholders' equity of the Corporation as compared with the amounts shown on the most recent consolidated balance sheet incorporated in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus, or for the period from the date of the most recent audited or unaudited consolidated financial statements incorporated in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus to such specified date there were any decreases, as compared with the corresponding period in the preceding year, in total or per share
 
amounts of consolidated net income of the Corporation or consolidated net interest income except in all instances for changes or decreases set forth in such letter, in which case the letter shall be accompanied by an explanation by the Corporation as to the significance thereof unless said explanation is not deemed necessary by the Representatives; and
(iii) they have performed certain other specified procedures as a result of which they determined that certain information of an accounting, financial or statistical nature (which is limited to accounting, financial or statistical information derived from the general accounting records of the Corporation and its subsidiaries) set forth in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus, including the information included in the "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" included or incorporated in the Corporation's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and the information included or incorporated in Items 1, 5, 6 and 7 of the Corporation's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the most recent fiscal year incorporated in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package and Final Prospectus, or incorporated in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package and Final Prospectus, agrees with the accounting records of the Corporation and its subsidiaries, excluding any questions of legal interpretation.
References to the Final Prospectus in this paragraph (g) include any supplement thereto at the date of the letter.
(h) On or subsequent to the Applicable Time or, if earlier, the dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement (exclusive of any amendment thereof), the Pricing Disclosure Package (exclusive of any supplement thereof) and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto), there shall not have been (i) any adverse change specified in the letter or letters referred to in paragraph (g) of this Section 6 or (ii) any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the business or properties of the Corporation and its subsidiaries the effect of which, in any case referred to in clause (i) or (ii) above, is, in the judgment of the Representatives, so material and adverse as to make it impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or the delivery of the Securities as contemplated by the Registration Statement (exclusive of any amendment thereof), the Pricing Disclosure Package (exclusive of any supplement thereto) and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto).
(i) On or subsequent to the Applicable Time, there shall not have been any decrease in the ratings of any of the Corporation's debt securities by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" (as such term is defined in Section 3(a)(62) of the Exchange Act), or any public announcement that any such organization has under surveillance or review the ratings of any of the Corporation's debt securities (other than an announcement with positive implications of a possible upgrading, and no implication of a possible downgrading, of such rating), and if, in any such case, the effect thereof in the judgment of the Representatives makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the purchase of the Securities.
 
(j) Prior to the Closing Date or any Additional Closing Date, as applicable, the Corporation shall have furnished to the Representatives such further information, certificates and documents as the Representatives may reasonably request in connection with the offering of the Securities.
If any of the conditions specified in this Section 6 shall not have been fulfilled when and as provided in this Agreement, or if any of the opinions and certificates mentioned above or elsewhere in this Agreement shall not be reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Representatives and counsel for the Underwriters, this Agreement and all obligations of the Underwriters hereunder may be canceled at, or at any time prior to, the Closing Date or any Additional Closing Date, as applicable, by the Representatives. Notice of such cancellation shall be given to the Corporation in writing or by telephone or telegraph confirmed in writing.
Section 7. . If the sale of the Securities provided for herein is not consummated because any condition to the obligations of the Underwriters set forth in Section 6 hereof is not satisfied, because of any termination pursuant to Section 10 hereof or because of any refusal, inability or failure on the part of the Corporation to perform any agreement herein or comply with any provision hereof other than by reason of a default by any of the Underwriters, the Corporation will reimburse the Underwriters severally upon demand for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) that shall have been incurred by them in connection with the proposed purchase and sale of the Securities. In no event shall the Corporation be liable to the Underwriters for loss of anticipated profits from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein, and to the extent that it may elect by written notice delivered to the indemnified party promptly after receiving the aforesaid notice from such indemnified party, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party; , , that if the defendants in any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, the indemnified party or parties shall have the right to select separate counsel to assert such legal defenses and to otherwise participate in the defense of such action on behalf of such indemnified party or parties.

reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the Corporation on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Corporation and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above.

Any party entitled to contribution will, promptly after receipt of notice of commencement of any action, suit or proceeding against such party in respect of which a claim for contribution may be made against another party or parties under this paragraph (d), notify such party or parties from whom contribution may be sought, but the omission to so notify such party or parties shall not relieve the party or parties from whom contribution may be sought from any other obligation it or they may have hereunder or otherwise than under this paragraph (d).
Section 9. . If any one or more Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Depositary Shares agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter or Underwriters hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the number of Depositary Shares set forth opposite their names in Schedule II hereto bears to the total number of Depositary Shares set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the Depositary Shares which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase; , , that in the event that the total number of Depositary Shares which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the total number of Depositary Shares set forth in Schedule II hereto, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Depositary Shares, and if such non-defaulting Underwriters do not purchase all the Depositary Shares, this Agreement will terminate without liability to any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Corporation. In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 9, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding seven days, as the Representatives shall determine in order that the required changes in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Corporation and any non-defaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder.

Exhibit 3.1
The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc., a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (the "Corporation"), in accordance with the provisions of Section 1522(c) of the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law of 1988 thereof, does hereby certify:
The Capital Committee of the Board of Directors of the Corporation, in accordance with the Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, of the Corporation, the Amended and Restated By-Laws of the Corporation, and applicable law, adopted the following resolution on September 14, 2012, creating a series of 5,175 shares of Preferred Stock of the Corporation designated as "5.375% Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series Q":
", that pursuant to the authority granted to and vested in the Capital Committee of the Board of Directors of The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (the "Corporation"), by the Board of Directors of the Corporation on August 16, 2012, the Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series Q, par value $1.00 per share, of the Corporation established by the Board of Directors of the Corporation by resolution on August 16, 2012, shall be designated as the "5.375% Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series Q" and the Capital Committee hereby fixes and determines the designations, voting rights, preferences, redemption rights, qualifications, privileges, limitations, restrictions and special or relative rights thereof as set forth below:
RESOLVED
Section 1. . A series of Preferred Stock designated the "5.375% Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series Q" (hereinafter called "Series Q Preferred Stock") shall be established and the authorized number of shares that shall constitute such series shall be 5,175 shares, $1.00 par value per share and having a liquidation preference of $100,000 per share. The number of shares constituting Series Q Preferred Stock may be increased from time to time in accordance with law up to the maximum number of shares of Preferred Stock authorized to be issued under the Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation of the Corporation, as amended, less all shares at the time authorized of any other series of Preferred Stock. Shares of Series Q Preferred Stock will be dated the date of issue, which shall be referred to herein as the "original issue date". Shares of outstanding Series Q Preferred Stock that are redeemed, purchased or otherwise acquired by the Corporation, or converted into another series of Preferred Stock, shall be cancelled and shall revert to authorized but unissued shares of Preferred Stock undesignated as to series.
Designation
Section 2. . The shares of Series Q Preferred Stock shall rank:
Ranking
(a) senior, as to dividends and upon liquidation, dissolution and winding up, to the common stock, the Series G Preferred Stock, and to any other class or series of capital stock of the Corporation now or hereafter authorized, issued or outstanding that, by its terms, does not expressly provide that it ranks with the Series Q Preferred Stock as to dividends and upon liquidation, dissolution and winding up, as the case may be (collectively, "Series Q Junior Securities"); and
pari passu
(b) on a parity, as to dividends and upon liquidation, dissolution and winding up, with the Series A, Series B, Series C, Series D, Series E, Series F, Series H, Series I, Series J, Series K, Series L, Series M, Series O Preferred Stock, and Series P Preferred Stock and with any other class or series of capital stock of the Corporation now or hereafter authorized, issued or outstanding that, by its terms, expressly provides that it ranks with the Series Q Preferred Stock as to dividends and upon liquidation, dissolution and winding up, as the case may be (collectively, "Series Q Parity Securities").
pari passu
The Corporation may authorize and issue additional shares of Series Q Junior Securities and Series Q Parity Securities without the consent of the holders of the Series Q Preferred Stock.
Section 3. . (a) Holders of Series Q Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors, out of assets legally available for the payment of dividends under Pennsylvania law, non-cumulative cash dividends based on the liquidation preference of the Series Q Preferred Stock at a rate equal to 5.375% per annum for each Series Q Dividend Period from the original issue date of the Series Q Preferred Stock to, and including, the redemption date of the Series Q Preferred Stock, if any. If the Corporation issues additional shares of the Series Q Preferred Stock after the original issue date, dividends on such shares will accrue from the date such additional shares are issued.
Dividends
(b) If declared by the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors, dividends will be payable on the Series Q Preferred Stock quarterly, in arrears, on March 1, June 1, September 1 and December 1 of each year (each, a "Series Q Dividend Payment Date") beginning on December 1, 2012. If any date on which dividends would otherwise be payable is not a Business Day, then the Series Q Dividend Payment Date will be the next Business Day, without any adjustment to the amount of such dividends. A "Business Day" means any weekday that is not a legal holiday in New York, New York and that is not a day on which banking institutions in New York, New York, or Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania are closed.
(c) Dividends will be payable to holders of record of Series Q Preferred Stock as they appear on the Corporation's books on the applicable record date, which shall be the 15
th
calendar day before the applicable Dividend Payment Date, or such other record date, no earlier than 30 calendar days before the applicable Dividend Payment Date, as shall be fixed by the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors.
 
(d) A "Series Q Dividend Period" is the period from and including a Series Q Dividend Payment Date to, but excluding, the next Series Q Dividend Payment Date, except that the initial Series Q Dividend Period will commence on and include the original issue date of Series Q Preferred Stock. Dividends payable on Series Q Preferred Stock will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. Dollar amounts resulting from that calculation will be rounded to the nearest cent, with one-half cent being rounded upwards. Dividends on the Series Q Preferred Stock will cease to accrue on the redemption date, if any, unless the Corporation defaults in the payment of the redemption price of the Series Q Preferred Stock called for redemption.
(e) Dividends on the Series Q Preferred Stock will not be cumulative. If the Board of Directors of the Corporation or a duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors does not declare a dividend on the Series Q Preferred Stock in respect of a Series Q Dividend Period, then no dividend shall be deemed to have accrued for such dividend period, be payable on the applicable Dividend Payment Date or be cumulative, and the Corporation will have no obligation to pay any dividend for that Series Q Dividend Period, whether or not the Board of Directors of the Corporation or a duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors declares a dividend for any future Series Q Dividend Period with respect to the Series Q Preferred Stock, the Corporation's common stock, or any other class or series of the Corporation's Preferred Stock.
(f) Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, dividends on the Series Q Preferred Stock shall not be declared , paid or set aside for payment to the extent such act would cause the Corporation to fail to comply with the laws and regulations applicable thereto, including applicable capital adequacy guidelines.
(g) During a Series Q Dividend Period, so long as any share of Series Q Preferred Stock remains outstanding:
(1) no dividend shall be declared or paid or set aside for payment, and no distribution shall be declared or made or set aside for payment, on any Series Q Junior Securities, other than (i) a dividend payable solely in Series Q Junior Securities or (ii) any dividend in connection with the implementation of a shareholders' rights plan, or the redemption or repurchase of any rights under such plan;
(2) no shares of Series Q Junior Securities shall be repurchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired for consideration by the Corporation, directly or indirectly, other than (i) as a result of a reclassification of Series Q Junior Securities for or into other Series Q Junior Securities, (ii) the exchange or conversion of one share of Series Q Junior Securities for or into another share of Series Q Junior Securities, (iii) through the use of the proceeds of a substantially contemporaneous sale of other shares of Series Q Junior Securities, (iv) purchases, redemptions or other acquisitions of shares of Series Q Junior Securities in connection with any employment contract, benefit plan or other similar arrangement with or for the benefit of employees, officers, directors or consultants, (v) purchases of shares of Series Q Junior Securities pursuant to a contractually binding requirement to buy Series Q Junior Securities existing prior to the preceding Series Q Dividend Period, including under a contractually binding stock repurchase plan, or (vi) the purchase of fractional interests in shares of Series Q Junior Securities pursuant to the conversion or exchange provisions of such stock or the security being converted or exchanged, nor shall any monies be paid to or made available for a sinking fund for the redemption of any such securities by the Corporation; and
 
(3) no shares of Series Q Parity Securities shall be repurchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired for consideration by the Corporation, directly or indirectly, other than pursuant to offers to purchase all, or a portion, of Series Q Preferred Stock and such Series Q Parity Securities except by conversion into or exchange for Series Q Junior Securities
pro rata
pro rata
unless, in each case, the full dividends for the preceding Series Q Dividend Period on all outstanding shares of Series Q Preferred Stock have been declared and paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof has been set aside.
(h) When dividends are not paid in full upon the shares of Series Q Preferred Stock and any Series Q Parity Securities, all dividends declared upon shares of Series Q Preferred Stock and any Series Q Parity Securities will be declared on a proportional basis so that the amount of dividends declared per share will bear to each other the same ratio that accrued dividends for the Series Q Preferred Stock, and accrued dividends, including any accumulations, on any Series Q Parity Securities, bear to each other for the then-current Series Q Dividend Period.
(i) Subject to the foregoing, and not otherwise, dividends (payable in cash, stock or otherwise), as may be determined by the Board of Directors of the Corporation or a duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors, may be declared and paid on the common stock and any other class or series of capital stock ranking equally with or junior to Series Q Preferred Stock from time to time out of any assets legally available for such payment, and the holders of Series Q Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to participate in any such dividend.
Section 4. . (a) Upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, holders of Series Q Preferred Stock are entitled to receive out of assets of the Corporation available for distribution to stockholders, after satisfaction of liabilities to creditors and subject to the rights of holders of any securities ranking senior to Series Q Preferred Stock, before any distribution of assets is made to holders of Common Stock or any Series Q Junior Securities, a liquidating distribution in the amount of the liquidation preference of $100,000 per share plus any declared and unpaid dividends, without accumulation of any undeclared dividends. Holders of Series Q Preferred Stock will not be entitled to any other amounts from the Corporation after they have received their full liquidating distribution.
Liquidation
(b) In any such distribution, if the assets of the Corporation are not sufficient to pay the liquidation preferences plus declared and unpaid dividends in full to all holders of Series Q Preferred Stock and all holders of any Series Q Parity Securities, the amounts paid to the holders of Series Q Preferred Stock and to the holders of all Series Q Parity Securities will be paid in accordance with the respective aggregate liquidating distribution owed to those holders. If the liquidation preference plus declared and unpaid dividends has been paid in full to all holders of Series Q Preferred Stock and any Series Q Parity Securities, the holders of the Corporation's Series Q Junior Securities shall be entitled to receive all remaining assets of the Corporation according to their respective rights and preferences.
pro rata
 
(c) For purposes of this section, the merger or consolidation of the Corporation with any other entity, including a merger or consolidation in which the holders of Series Q Preferred Stock receive cash, securities or property for their shares, or the sale, lease or exchange of all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation for cash, securities or other property, shall not constitute a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation.
Section 5. . (a) Series Q Preferred Stock is not subject to any mandatory redemption, sinking fund or other similar provisions. Series Q Preferred Stock is not redeemable prior to December 1, 2017. On and after that date, Series Q Preferred Stock will be redeemable at the option of the Corporation, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to $100,000 per share, plus any declared and unpaid dividends, without accumulation of any undeclared dividends. Holders of Series Q Preferred Stock will have no right to require the redemption or repurchase of Series Q Preferred Stock. Notwithstanding the foregoing, within 90 days following the occurrence of a Regulatory Capital Treatment Event, the Corporation, at its option, may redeem, at any time, all (but not less than all) of the shares of the Series Q Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, at a redemption price equal to $100,000 per share, plus any declared and unpaid dividends and any accrued and unpaid dividends (whether or not declared), upon notice given as provided in Subsection (b) below.
Redemption
A "Regulatory Capital Treatment Event" means the good faith determination by the Corporation that, as a result of (i) any amendment to, or change in, the laws or regulations of the United States or any political subdivision of or in the United States that is enacted or becomes effective after the initial issuance of any share of the Series Q Preferred Stock; (ii) any proposed change in those laws or regulations that is announced after the initial issuance of any share of the Series Q Preferred Stock; or (iii) any official administrative decision or judicial decision or administrative action or other official pronouncement interpreting or applying those laws or regulations that is announced after the initial issuance of any share of the Series Q Preferred Stock, there is more than an insubstantial risk that the Corporation will not be entitled to treat the full liquidation value of the shares of the Series Q Preferred Stock then outstanding as "Tier 1 Capital" (or its equivalent) for purposes of the capital adequacy guidelines of Federal Reserve Regulation Y, 12 CFR 225 (or, as and if applicable, the capital adequacy guidelines or regulations of any successor appropriate federal banking agency), as then in effect and applicable, for as long as any share of the Series Q Preferred Stock is outstanding.
(b) If shares of Series Q Preferred Stock are to be redeemed, the notice of redemption shall be given by first class mail to the holders of record of Series Q Preferred Stock to be redeemed, mailed not less than 30 days nor more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption thereof (provided that, if the depositary shares representing Series Q Preferred Stock are held in book-entry form through The Depository Trust Company, or "DTC", the Corporation may give such notice in any manner permitted by DTC). Each notice of redemption will include a statement setting forth: (i) the redemption date; (ii) the number of shares of Series Q Preferred Stock to be redeemed and, if less than all the shares held by such holder are to be redeemed, the number of such shares to be redeemed from such holder; (iii) the redemption price; (iv) the place or places where the certificates evidencing shares of Series Q Preferred Stock are to be surrendered for payment of the redemption price; and (v) that dividends on the shares to be redeemed will cease to accrue on the redemption date. If notice of redemption of any shares of Series Q Preferred Stock has been duly given and if the funds necessary for such redemption have been set aside by
 
the Corporation for the benefit of the holders of any shares of Series Q Preferred Stock so called for redemption, then, on and after the redemption date, dividends will cease to accrue on such shares of Series Q Preferred Stock, such shares of Series Q Preferred Stock shall no longer be deemed outstanding and all rights of the holders of such shares will terminate, except the right to receive the redemption price, (i) plus any declared and unpaid dividends, or (ii) in the case of a Regulatory Capital Treatment Event, plus any declared and unpaid dividends and any accrued and unpaid dividends (whether or not declared).
(c) In case of any redemption of only part of the shares of Series Q Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, the shares to be redeemed shall be selected either , by lot or in such other manner as the Corporation may determine to be equitable and permitted by the rules of any stock exchange on which the Series Q Preferred Stock is listed.
pro rata
Section 6. . (a) Except as provided below or as expressly required by law, the holders of shares of Series Q Preferred Stock shall have no voting power, and no right to vote on any matter at any time, either as a separate series or class or together with any other series or class of shares of capital stock, and shall not be entitled to call a meeting of such holders for any purpose, nor shall they be entitled to participate in any meeting of the holders of the Common Stock.
Voting Rights
(b) So long as any shares of Series Q Preferred Stock remain outstanding, the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least two-thirds of all of the shares of Series Q Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, voting separately as a class, shall be required to: (1) authorize or increase the authorized amount of, or issue shares of any class or series of stock ranking senior to the Series Q Preferred Stock with respect to payment of dividends or the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, or issue any obligation or security convertible into or evidencing the right to purchase, any class or series of stock ranking senior to Series Q Preferred Stock with respect to payment of dividends or the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation; (2) amend the provisions of the Corporation's Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, so as to adversely affect the powers, preferences, privileges or rights of Series Q Preferred Stock, taken as a whole, provided, however, that any increase in the amount of the authorized or issued shares of Series Q Preferred Stock or authorized common or preferred stock or the creation and issuance, or an increase in the authorized or issued amount, of other series of Preferred Stock ranking equally with or junior to Series Q Preferred Stock with respect to the payment of dividends (whether such dividends are cumulative or non-cumulative) or the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation will not be deemed to adversely affect the powers, preferences, privileges or rights of Series Q Preferred Stock; or (3) consolidate with or merge into any other corporation unless the shares of Series Q Preferred Stock outstanding at the time of such consolidation or merger or sale are converted into or exchanged for preference securities having such rights, privileges and voting powers, taken as a whole, as are not materially less favorable to the holders thereof than the rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers of Series Q Preferred Stock, taken as a whole. The foregoing voting provisions will not apply if, at or prior to the time when the act with respect to which such vote would otherwise be required shall be effected, all outstanding shares of Series Q Preferred Stock shall have been redeemed or called for redemption upon proper notice and sufficient funds shall have been set aside by the Corporation for the benefit of the holders of Series Q Preferred Stock to effect such redemption.
 
(c) If the Corporation fails to pay, or declare and set apart for payment, dividends on outstanding shares of the Series Q Preferred Stock or any other series of Preferred Stock for six quarterly dividend periods, or their equivalent, whether or not consecutive, the number of directors of the Corporation shall be increased by two at the Corporation's first annual meeting of the shareholders held thereafter, and at such meeting and at each subsequent annual meeting until cumulative dividends payable for all past dividend periods and continuous noncumulative dividends for at least one year on all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock entitled thereto shall have been paid, or declared and set apart for payment, in full, the holders of shares of Series Q Preferred Stock shall have the right, voting as a class with holders of any other equally ranked series of Preferred Stock that have similar voting rights, to elect such two additional members of the Board of Directors to hold office for a term of one year. Upon such payment, or such declaration and setting apart for payment, in full, the terms of the two additional directors so elected shall forthwith terminate, and the number of directors shall be reduced by two, and such voting right of the holders of shares of Preferred Stock shall cease, subject to increase in the number of directors of the Corporation as described above and to revesting of such voting right in the event of each and every additional failure in the payment of dividends for six quarterly dividend periods, or their equivalent, whether or not consecutive, as described above.
Section 7. . The holders of shares of Series Q Preferred Stock shall not have any rights to convert such shares into shares of any other class or series of securities of the Corporation.
Conversion Rights
Section 8. . The holders of shares of Series Q Preferred Stock will have no preemptive rights with respect to any shares of the Corporation's capital stock or any of its other securities convertible into or carrying rights or options to purchase any such capital stock.

In rendering this opinion, I have examined such corporate records and other documents, and have reviewed such matters of law, as I, or attorneys under my supervision, have deemed necessary or appropriate.

I express no opinion as to the laws of any jurisdiction other than the federal laws of the United States and the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
Based on and subject to the foregoing, I am of the opinion that (i) the shares of Preferred Stock represented by the Depositary Shares are validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and (ii) the Depositary Shares are validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and the holders of the Depositary Shares are entitled to the rights specified in the Deposit Agreement.

In giving such consent, I do not thereby admit that I am in the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the rules and regulations thereunder.
