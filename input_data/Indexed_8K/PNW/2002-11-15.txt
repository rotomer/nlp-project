ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS. On November 8, 2002, Arizona Public Service Company ("APS") filed an application (the "Interim Financing Application") with the Arizona Corporation Commission (the "ACC") requesting a waiver of certain ACC rules to permit APS to (a) make short-term advances to Pinnacle West Capital Corporation ("Pinnacle West" or the "Company") in the form of an inter-affiliate line of credit or (b) guarantee Pinnacle West's short-term debt. See "ACC Applications" in Note 5 to Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in the Pinnacle West Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2002 (the "September 10-Q"). In either case, the waiver would be limited to a maximum aggregate principal amount of $125 million and for a maximum term of 364 days. An ACC special open meeting has been scheduled for November 22, 2002 for consideration of the Interim Financing Application. On November 14, 2002, the staff ("ACC Staff") recommended that the Interim Financing Application be approved without a hearing by granting APS a partial waiver of the ACC affiliate rules, subject to the following conditions: (a) the terms and conditions, including the pricing schedule, of the line of credit between the Company and APS will be the same as those in the Company's bank facility that is expiring November 29, 2002; (b) APS acquires a $125 million security interest in certain Pinnacle West Energy Corporation assets to secure the financing; (c) all amounts received by APS be deferred and accounted for in a manner to allow amortization as a credit to customers; and, (d) the ACC will examine ways to improve regulatory insulation between APS and its affiliates in their consideration of APS' $500 million Financing Application filed on September 16, 2002. See Note 5 in the September 10-Q. A copy of the ACC Staff's recommendation is incorporated herein as Exhibit 99.1. ITEM 7. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND EXHIBITS.

Exhibit 99.1 OPEN MEETING MEMORANDUM RECEIVED TO: THE COMMISSION 2002 N0V 14 P 4:37 AZ CORP COMMISSION FROM: Utilities Division DOCUMENT CONTROL DATE: November 14, 2002 RE: IN THE MATTER OF THE APPLICATION OF ARIZONA PUBLIC SERVICE CO. FOR A WAIVER OF ARIZONA ADMINISTRATIVE CODE R14-2-804(B)(1) AND (2) (DOCKET NO. E-01345A-02-0840) On November 8, 2002, Arizona Public Service Co. ("APS" or "Company") filed an application for a waiver of Arizona Administrative Code ("A.A.C.") R14-2-804(B)(1) and (2) (the "Rules"). Specifically, APS seeks to make short-term advances of funds to its parent, Pinnacle West Capital Corporation ("Pinnacle West"), or to make short-term guarantees of Pinnacle West's debt, as more fully described below. The financing statutes would allow APS to execute this transaction without Commission approval but for Rule 804, one of the Commission's affiliated interests rules. Those rules state in relevant part: R14-2-804. Commission Review of Transactions Between Public Utilities and Affiliates B. A utility will not consummate the following transactions without prior approval by the Commission: 1. Obtain a financial interest in any affiliate not regulated by the Commission; or guarantee, or assume the liabilities of such affiliate; 2. Lend to any affiliate not regulated by the Commission, with the exception of short-term loans for a period less than 12 months in an amount less than $100,000...(1) and R14-2-806. Waiver from the Provisions of this Article A. The Commission may waive compliance with any of the provisions of this Article upon a finding that such waiver is in the public interest. (1) Rules 804 and 806 were adopted in 1990 as part of the Commission's affiliated interest rules. The Commission stayed these rules shortly after their adoption in anticipation of litigation. In 1992, the Arizona Supreme Court issued an opinion upholding the Commission's authority to adopt the rules. Shortly thereafter, the Commission lifted the stay. See Decision No. 58063 (November 3, 1992). The Commission, however, did not completely lift the stay, so portions of Rule 804 are still subject to a partial stay. For purposes of this case, the relevant portions of Rule 804(b)(1) have not been stayed. Decision No. 58063 at 4. By contrast, relevant portions of Rule 804(b)(2) may be subject to the partial stay. Decision No. 58063 at 5.
THE COMMISSION November 14, 2002 Page 2 The full text of rules 804 and 806 is set forth in Exhibit 1. APS intends to loan Pinnacle West up to an aggregate principle amount of $125,000,000 for a period of up to 364 days ("Backup Line of Credit") or to guarantee Pinnacle West debt up to an aggregate principle amount of $125,000,000 ("Interim Guarantee") for the same period. APS wants to undertake these obligations because Pinnacle West recently lost the ability to renew a $125,000,000 364-day bank facility ("Bank Facility") that was used to support Pinnacle West's commercial paper program. The Bank Facility expires November 29, 2002. The commercial paper program funds Pinnacle West's ongoing operations. Commercial paper programs-are-normally backed by some form of credit, such as the expiring Bank Facility, and loss of such backup would normally result in loss of an ability to sell commercial paper in the same amount. Staff confirmed that Pinnacle West is expected to suffer liquidity problems if it was unable to access its full commercial paper program, including the $125,000,000 commercial paper or similar program. -Pinnacle West needs the credit facility or a similar- cash source to manage its cash flows over the next year. Without access to these or similar sources, Pinnacle West's cash flow will likely become negative relatively soon. The application states that the Backup Line of Credit or Interim Guarantee is necessary to stabilize the financial condition of Pinnacle West and its affiliates and to avoid rating downgrades. On November 4, 2002, Standard & Poor's Ratings Services ("S&P") lowered APS' corporate credit rating to BBB from BBB+. The downgrade was the result of S&P's consolidating the ratings of APS and Pinnacle West because of a lack of regulatory insulation between the two entities. APS' application asserts that it will not be required to borrow funds to finance either the Backup Line of Credit or the Interim Guarantee and that neither would result in a loss of APS' overall credit quality or debt rating or in any manner adversely affect APS customers. The application further indicates that APS would avoid further deleterious financial consequences through Pinnacle West if the application was granted and APS was allowed to support its parent through the Backup Line of Credit or the Interim Guarantee. APS asserts that "it is making this emergency request to address a deteriorating financial situation arising from the Arizona Corporation Commission's ("Commission") dramatic "reversal of course" on divestiture of generation assets by APS and the necessary integration of APS and Pinnacle West Energy Corporation ("PWEC") generation as called for under the 1999 APS Settlement Agreement and the Commission's Electric Competition Rules." Contrary to APS' assertions, Staff believes that the exigent circumstances are due to market conditions quite apart from any Arizona action. Those market conditions include a reduction in credit extended to the energy industry generally. See Exhibit 2 for articles on the current credit situation. The article "Energy Industry's Debt Is Long-Term Problem" from THE WALL STREET JOURNAL states that a Standard & Poor's report concludes that a combination of factors makes this one of the worst times in recent history to refinance debt [for the energy industry]. THE WASHINGTON POST article
THE COMMISSION November 14, 2002 Page 3 "A Shock to the System" reports that "[S]ince July, S&P has downgraded credit ratings on 57 power companies, compared with nine downgrades in the same period a year ago." The article "Electric Industry Hits Credit Crisis" from THE Wall STREET Journal indicates that in the first nine months of 2002 there were 135 credit downgrades of utility holding companies and their subsidiaries. The article states, "Utility companies, electric and gas, are carrying big debt loads piled on in the late 1990s as companies prepared for energy industry deregulation. More recently, they have suffered from lower cash flow after wholesale energy prices collapsed. The result is that companies are finding it more difficult and more expensive to roll over debt and to complete costly new generation and transmission projects." In Staff's assessment, the situation described by APS presents an exigent circumstance, especially when viewed in the context of the energy sector as a whole. Failing to address the liquidity problem at Pinnacle West could cause significant problems for APS. Because of this risk and because of the attendant turmoil currently surrounding the energy industry, Staff believes that prompt action by the Commission is appropriate. Staff believes that the limited size and duration of the request weighed against the potential harm that could accrue to APS indicates that the waiver is in the public interest. Finally, Staff believes that granting this application will preserve the status quo without prejudicing the Commission's ability to evaluate the pending APS financing application. Staffs recommendation to approve this waiver application is not intended to indicate a position regarding the pending financing application in Docket No. E-10345A-02-0707. Staff further believes that the lack of regulatory insulation between APS and Pinnacle West has the potential to result in APS suffering further deleterious derivative financial consequences, such as rating downgrades, if Pinnacle West suffered liquidity problems. For these reasons, Staff recommends that the Commission examine methods for improving the regulatory insulation between APS and its affiliates in the pending financing application. Staff recommends that APS be granted a waiver of Rule 804(B)(1) and, to the extent necessary, Rule 804(B)(2) subject to the following four conditions: (1) The pricing schedule between Pinnacle West and APS for the Backup Line of Credit shall be the existing pricing schedule on the expiring Bank Facility at Level IV status (or Level V if Pinnacle West's ratings fall below either BBB- by S&P or Baa3 by Moody's). Other terms and conditions of the Backup Line of Credit shall be the same as the expiring Bank Facility. (2) APS shall acquire a $125,000,000 security interest in certain Pinnacle West Energy Corp. assets.
THE COMMISSION November 14, 2002 Page 4 (3) All revenues received by APS pursuant to this authority shall be deferred and accounted for in a manner to allow amortization as a credit to customers in the next rate case. (4) The Commission shall examine methods for improving the regulatory insulation between APS and its affiliates in the pending financing application. These conditions are designed to ensure that APS' ratepayers will be adequately protected from any potential risk associated with this transaction. Staff recommends approval of the application without a hearing. If the Commission does not act on this matter before December 8, 2002, APS' request for a waiver will be granted by operation of law. Accordingly, if the. Commission wishes to set this matter for hearing or to otherwise delay acting upon this application, it will be necessary to suspend it pursuant to A.A.C. R14-2-806(C). /s/ Ernest G. Johnson Ernest G. Johnson Director Utilities Division EGJ:JST ORIGINATOR: John S. Thornton, Jr. CC: Parties of record, Docket No. E-01345A-02-0707
