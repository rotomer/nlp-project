SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION Washington, D.C. 20549 FORM 8-K CURRENT REPORT Pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Date of Report (Date of earliest event reported): December 31, 2002 PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION (Exact name of registrant as specified in its charter) Arizona 1-8962 86-0512431 (State or other jurisdiction (Commission (IRS Employer of incorporation) File Number) Identification Number) 400 North Fifth Street, P.O. Box 53999, Phoenix, Arizona 85072-3999 (Address of principal executive offices) (Zip Code) (602) 250-1000 (Registrant's telephone number, including area code) NONE (Former name or former address, if changed since last report)
ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS TRACK B As previously reported, on September 10, 2002, the Arizona Corporation Commission (the "ACC") issued an order that, among other things, established a requirement that Arizona Public Service Company ("APS") competitively procure, at a minimum, any required power that it cannot produce from its existing assets in accordance with the ultimate outcome of the pending "Track B" ACC proceedings. See "Track A Order" in Note 5 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of the Pinnacle West Capital Corporation Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2002. On October 25, 2002, the ACC Staff issued its report in the Track B proceeding proposing a process by which APS would procure power not supplied by its own resources. This report was subsequently modified at the November hearing on Track B. Under the ACC Staff's modified proposal, we believe APS would be required to competitively bid for about 2,500 MW of capacity on peak during 2003, increasing to about 3,000 MW in 2006 based on projections of increasing customer loads. On January 30, 2003, an ACC administrative law judge ("ALJ") issued a recommended order on Track B. The ALJ's recommendation generally adopts the ACC Staff's position. The parties must file comments on the recommended order no later than February 10, 2003. APS expects to file comments. The ACC has scheduled a special open meeting on February 21, 2003 to consider this matter. ITEM 7. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND EXHIBITS (c) EXHIBITS. EXHIBIT NO.

Last Updated 2/3/2003 PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION QUARTERLY CONSOLIDATED STATISTICAL SUMMARY PERIODS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002 AND 2001 - ---------- (a) The net effect on net electric operating revenues from realization of prior-period mark-to-market included in line 38 is zero. Realization of prior-period mark-to-market relates to cash flow recognition, not revenue recognition. The arithmetic opposites of amounts included in line 33 are included in lines 28 and 32. For example, line 33 shows that a prior-period mark-to-market gain of $8 million was transferred to "realized" for the fourth quarter of 2002. Lines 28 and 32 include amounts totaling $9 million of realized revenues for the fourth quarter of 2002. See Glossary of Terms.
Last Updated 2/3/2003 PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION QUARTERLY CONSOLIDATED STATISTICAL SUMMARY PERIODS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002 AND 2001 FUTURE MARKETING AND TRADING MARK-TO-MARKET REALIZATION As of December 31, 2002, Pinnacle West had accumulated mark-to-market net gains of $41 million related to our power marketing and trading activities. We estimate that these gains will be reclassified to realized gains as the underlying commodities are delivered, as follows: 2003, $4 million; 2004, $10 million; 2005 and thereafter, $27 million. ---------- (a) The net effect on pretax gross margin from realization of prior-period mark-to-market included in line 59 and in line 64 is zero. Realization of prior-period mark-to-market relates to cash flow recognition, not earnings recognition. The arithmetic opposites of amounts included in line 55 are included in line 51. The opposites of amounts included in line 56 are included in line 53. For example, line 55 shows that a prior-period mark-to-market gain of $4 million was transferred to "realized" for the fourth quarter of 2002. A $4 million realized gain is included in the $23 million on line 51 for the fourth quarter of 2002. (b) Quarterly amounts do not total to the annual amounts because of intra-year mark-to-market eliminations. See Glossary of Terms.

Exhibit 99.7 Last updated 02/03/03 PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION EARNINGS VARIANCE EXPLANATIONS FOR PERIODS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002 AND 2001 This discussion explains the changes in our earnings for the three and twelve month periods ended December 31, 2002 and 2001. Consolidated income statements for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 follow this discussion. We will file our 2002 Annual Report on Form 10-K on or before March 31, 2003. We suggest this section be read in connection with the Pinnacle West Capital Corporation Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2001, Form 8-K dated November 21, 2002 (which includes certain restated prior year numbers), and the Pinnacle West Capital Corporation Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarters ended March 31, 2002, June 30, 2002 and September 30, 2002. We have reclassified certain prior period amounts to conform to our current period presentation. Additional operating and financial statistics and a glossary of terms are available on our website (www.pinnaclewest.com). EARNINGS CONTRIBUTIONS BY SUBSIDIARY AND BUSINESS SEGMENT We have two principal business segments (determined by products, services and the regulatory environment): * Our regulated electricity segment, which consists of regulated traditional retail and wholesale electricity businesses and related activities, and includes electricity transmission, distribution, and generation; and * Our marketing and trading segment, which consists of our competitive business activities, including wholesale marketing and trading and APS Energy Services' commodity-related energy services. The following tables summarize net income and segment details for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2002 and the comparable prior year periods for Pinnacle West and each of our subsidiaries (dollars in millions):
Last updated 02/03/03 (a) Consistent with APS' October 2001 ACC filing, APS entered into agreements with its affiliates to buy power. The agreements reflect a price based on the fully-dispatchable dedication of the Pinnacle West Energy generating assets to APS' native load customers. (b) APS recorded a $15 million after-tax loss in 2001 for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting for derivatives related to the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities." (c) We recorded a $66 million after-tax loss in 2002 for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting for trading activities, for the early adoption of Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 02-3 "Accounting for Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities" as of October 1, 2002. (d) Primarily includes activities related to SunCor and El Dorado. (e) APS Energy Services and El Dorado's net income are primarily reported before income taxes, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The income tax expense or benefit for these subsidiaries is recorded at the parent company. 2
Last updated 02/03/03 EARNINGS VARIANCE EXPLANATIONS Throughout these explanations, we refer to "gross margin." With respect to our regulated electricity segment and marketing and trading segment, gross margin refers to electric operating revenues less purchased power and fuel costs. Real estate gross margin refers to real estate revenues less real estate operations costs of SunCor. Other gross margin refers to other operating revenues less other operating expenses, which includes El Dorado's investment in NAC International Inc. (NAC), which we began consolidating in our financial statements in July 2002 (see further discussions in "NAC International Inc. Losses" below). Other gross margin also includes amounts related to APS Energy Services' energy consulting services. OPERATING RESULTS - THREE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002 COMPARED WITH THREE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001 Our consolidated net loss for the three months ended December 31, 2002 was $81 million compared with net income of $36 million for the same period in the prior year. We recognized a $66 million after-tax loss in the three months ended December 31, 2002 for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting for trading activities as a result of our adoption of EITF 02-3 as of October 1, 2002. Our consolidated loss before accounting change for the three months ended December 31, 2002 was $15 million compared with income before accounting change of $36 million for the same period in the prior year. The period-to-period decrease was primarily the result of a $49 million pretax write-off related to the cancellation of Pinnacle West Energy's Redhawk Units 3 and 4, of which $47 million was recorded in operations and maintenance expense and $2 million was recorded in capitalized interest, pretax losses of $38 million at El Dorado primarily related to its subsidiary, NAC, in the fourth quarter of 2002 (see further discussion in "NAC International Inc. Losses" below) and pretax severance costs of $11 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2002 related to a voluntary workforce reduction. The regulated electricity comparison was negatively impacted by higher costs for purchased power and gas, weather impacts and a 1.5% electric retail price reduction that took effect July 1, 2002. These factors were offset by lower replacement power costs for power plant outages, higher earnings contributions from our marketing and trading activities and customer growth of 3.2% for the fourth quarter of 2002. 3
Last updated 02/03/03 The major factors that increased (decreased) income before accounting change were as follows (dollars in millions): 4
Last updated 02/03/03 MARKETING AND TRADING SEGMENT GROSS MARGIN Marketing and trading segment revenues were $96 million higher in the three-month period ended December 31, 2002, compared with the same period in the prior year as a result of: * increased revenues from generation sales other than native load due to higher sales volumes ($26 million); * higher realized wholesale revenues net of related mark-to-market reversals due to higher volumes ($20 million); * increased revenues from higher competitive retail sales in California by APS Energy Services ($26 million); * 2001 write-off of prior period mark-to-market value related to trading with Enron and its affiliates ($8 million increase); * higher revenues related to the adoption of EITF 02-3 ($8 million); and * higher electricity mark-to-market gains for future delivery primarily as a result of increased activity ($8 million). Marketing and trading segment purchased power and fuel costs were $71 million higher in the three-month period ended December 31, 2002, compared to the same period in the prior year as a result of: * increased fuel costs related to generation sales other than native load primarily because of higher natural gas prices and higher sales volumes ($20 million); * increased purchased power costs related to other realized marketing activities in the current period primarily due to higher purchased power prices and higher sales volumes, net of mark-to-market reversals ($32 million); * increased purchased power costs related to higher competitive retail sales in California by APS Energy Services ($19 million). REGULATED ELECTRICITY SEGMENT GROSS MARGIN Revenues related to our regulated retail and wholesale electricity businesses were $20 million lower in the three-month period ended December 31, 2002, compared with the same period in the prior year as a result of: * decreased revenues related to wholesale sales for retail native load hedge management, as a result of lower prices ($16 million); * decreased retail revenues related to milder weather ($9 million); * decreased retail revenues related to a reduction in retail electricity prices ($6 million); * increased retail revenues related to customer growth partially offset by lower average usage, excluding weather effects ($1 million); and * other miscellaneous factors ($10 million net increase). Regulated electricity segment purchased power and fuel costs were $21 million lower in the three-month period ended December 31, 2002, compared with the same period in the prior year as a result of: * increased costs related to higher hedged natural gas and purchased power prices, net of mark-to-market reversals ($26 million); 5
Last updated 02/03/03 * decreased purchased power costs related to wholesale sales for retail load hedge management as a result of lower prices ($26 million); * decreased costs related to the effects of milder weather on retail sales ($3 million); * 2001 charges related to purchased power contracts with Enron and its affiliates ($13 million decrease); * decreased replacement power costs for power plant outages due to lower market prices and fewer unplanned nuclear and coal plant outages ($4 million); and * other miscellaneous factors ($1 million net decrease). The increase in real estate gross margin of $5 million was primarily due to increased sales activities. The decrease in other gross margin of $32 million was primarily due to losses on El Dorado's investment in NAC (see further discussion in NAC International Inc. Losses below). The increase in operations and maintenance expense of $72 million was due to a $47 million write-off related to the cancellation of Redhawk Units 3 and 4, severance costs of $11 million related to a 2002 voluntary workforce reduction and other costs of $14 million. The increase in depreciation and amortization expenses of $5 million was primarily related to increased depreciation and amortization on higher property, plant and equipment balances partially offset by lower regulatory asset amortization, in accordance with APS' 1999 Regulatory Agreement. The increase in taxes other than income taxes of $6 million is primarily due to increased property taxes on higher property balances. Other expense decreased $7 million primarily due to lower miscellaneous non-operating costs. Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized, increased $8 million primarily due to decreased capitalized interest related to our generation expansion program. 6
Last updated 02/03/03 OPERATING RESULTS - TWELVE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002 COMPARED WITH TWELVE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001 Our consolidated net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2002 was $149 million compared with $312 million for the same period in the prior year. We recognized a $66 million after-tax loss in the twelve months ended December 31, 2002 for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting for trading activities for the early adoption of EITF 02-3 as of October 1, 2002. We recognized a $15 million after-tax loss in the twelve months ended December 31, 2001 as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting for derivatives, as required by SFAS No. 133. Our income before accounting change for the twelve months ended December 31, 2002 was $215 million compared with $327 million for the same period a year earlier. The period-to-period comparison was lower due to lower earnings contributions from our marketing and trading activities, pretax losses of $59 million related to El Dorado's investment in NAC, a $49 million pretax write-off related to the cancellation of Redhawk Units 3 and 4, of which $47 million was recorded in operations and maintenance expense and $2 million was recorded in capitalized interest, and severance costs of approximately $36 million pretax recorded in the second half of 2002 relating to a voluntary workforce reduction, partially offset by increased earnings contributions from our regulated electricity and real estate operations. The regulated electricity comparison was favorably impacted by lower replacement power costs for power plant outages and customer growth and higher average usage per customer, partially offset by the effects of milder weather, retail electricity price decreases and higher costs for purchased power and gas due to higher hedged gas and power prices. The real estate results benefited primarily from more sales activities. The comparison for marketing and trading activities reflects lower liquidity and lower price volatility in the wholesale power markets in the western United States. 7
Last updated 02/03/03 The major factors that increased (decreased) income before accounting change were as follows (dollars in millions): 8
Last updated 02/03/03 MARKETING AND TRADING SEGMENT GROSS MARGIN Marketing and trading segment revenues were $325 million lower in the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2002, compared to the same period in the prior year as a result of: * decreased revenues from generation sales other than native load due to lower market prices partially offset by higher sales volumes ($98 million); * lower realized wholesale revenues net of related mark-to-market reversals due to lower prices partially offset by higher volumes ($273 million); * increased revenues from higher competitive retail sales in California by APS Energy Services ($105 million); * 2001 write-off of prior period mark-to-market value related to trading with Enron and its affiliates ($8 million increase); * higher revenues related to the adoption of EITF 02-3 ($8 million); and * lower mark-to-market gains for future delivery primarily as a result of lower market liquidity and lower price volatility, resulting in lower volumes ($75 million). Marketing and trading segment purchased power and fuel costs were $140 million lower in the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2002, compared to the same period in the prior year as a result of: * decreased fuel costs related to generation sales other than native load primarily because of lower natural gas prices partially offset by higher sales volumes ($32 million); * decreased purchased power costs related to other realized marketing activities in the current period primarily due to lower prices partially offset by higher volumes ($182 million); * increased purchased power costs related to higher competitive retail sales in California by APS Energy Services ($73 million); and * change in mark-to-market fuel costs for future delivery ($1 million increase). REGULATED ELECTRICITY SEGMENT GROSS MARGIN Revenues related to our regulated retail and wholesale electricity businesses were $549 million lower in the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2002, compared to the same period in the prior year as a result of: * decreased revenues related to traditional wholesale sales as a result of lower sales volumes and lower prices ($64 million); * decreased revenues related to retail load hedge management wholesale sales, as a result of lower prices and lower sales volumes ($455 million); * decreased retail revenues related to milder weather ($60 million); * increased retail revenues related to customer growth and higher average usage, excluding weather effects ($69 million); * decreased retail revenues related to reductions in retail electricity prices ($28 million); and * other miscellaneous factors ($11 million net decrease). 9
Last updated 02/03/03 Regulated electricity segment purchased power and fuel costs were $661 million lower in the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2002, compared with the same period in the prior year as a result of: * decreased costs related to traditional wholesale sales as a result of lower sales volumes and lower prices ($64 million); * decreased costs related to retail load hedge management wholesale sales, as a result of lower prices and lower sales volumes ($460 million); * increased costs related to higher prices for hedged natural gas and purchased power, net of mark-to-market reversals ($14 million); * decreased costs related to the effects of milder weather on retail sales ($33 million); * increased costs related to retail sales growth, excluding weather effects ($31 million); * charges in 2001 related to purchased power contracts with Enron and its affiliates ($13 million net decrease); * decreased replacement power costs for power plant outages due to lower market prices and fewer unplanned outages ($127 million); and * miscellaneous factors ($9 million net decrease). The increase in real estate gross margin of $16 million was primarily due to increased sales activities. The decrease in other gross margin of $44 million was primarily due to losses on El Dorado's investment in NAC (see further discussion in "NAC International Inc. Losses" below). The increase in operations and maintenance expense of $54 million was due to a $47 million write-off related to the cancellation of Redhawk Units 3 and 4, severance costs of $36 million related to a 2002 voluntary workforce reduction and other costs of $9 million, partially offset by lower costs related to generation reliability, plant outages and maintenance costs of $38 million. The increase in taxes other than income taxes of $7 million is primarily due to increased property taxes on higher property balances. Other income decreased $11 million primarily due to an insurance recovery recorded in 2001 related to environmental remediation costs and other costs. Other expense remained constant compared to the prior year primarily due to losses recorded related to El Dorado's investment in NAC of approximately $8 million (see further discussion in "NAC International Inc. Losses" below) offset by $8 million of lower miscellaneous non-operating costs. Net interest expense increased $16 million primarily because of higher debt balances related to our generation expansion program and lower capitalized interest on our generation expansion program. 10
