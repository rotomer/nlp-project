ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS ACC TRACK B DECISION As previously reported, on September 10, 2002, the Arizona Corporation Commission (the "ACC") issued an order that, among other things, established a requirement that Arizona Public Service Company ("APS") competitively procure certain power requirements. See "Track A Order" in Note 5 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of the Pinnacle West Capital Corporation Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2002. On February 27, 2003, the ACC approved a decision in the Track B proceeding. The decision adopted most of the provisions of an ACC administrative law judge's ("ALJ") recommendation that was issued on January 30, 2003. Under the ACC's Track B decision, APS will be required to solicit bids for its capacity and energy requirements for periods beginning July 1, 2003. For 2003, APS will be required to solicit competitive bids for about 2,500 megawatts of capacity and about 4,600 gigawatt-hours of energy, or approximately 20% of APS' total retail energy requirements. The bid amounts are expected to increase in 2004 and 2005 based largely on growth in APS' retail load and APS' retail energy sales. The Track B decision also confirmed that it was "not intended to change the current rate-base status of [APS'] existing assets." The decision recognizes APS' right to reject any bids that are unreasonable, uneconomical or unreliable. The Track B procurement process will involve the ACC Staff and an independent monitor. The Track B decision also contains requirements relating to standards of conduct between APS and any affiliate of APS that may participate in the competitive solicitation, requires that APS treat bidders in a non-discriminatory manner, and requires APS to file a protocol regarding short-term and emergency procurements. The decision permits the provision of corporate oversight, support and governance as long as such activities do not favor Pinnacle West Energy Corporation ("Pinnacle West Energy") in the procurement process or provide Pinnacle West Energy with confidential APS bidding information that is not available to other bidders. The decision directs APS to evaluate bids on cost, reliability and reasonableness. The decision requires bidders to allow the ACC to inspect their plants and requires assurances of appropriate competitive market conduct from senior officers of such bidders. Following the solicitation, APS will prepare a report evaluating environmental issues relating to the procurement and a series of workshops on environmental risk management will be commenced thereafter. APS expects to issue requests for proposals in March 2003 and to complete the selection process by June 1, 2003. Pinnacle West Energy will be eligible to bid to supply APS' electricity requirements. 2
