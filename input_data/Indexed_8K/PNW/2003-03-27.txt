OTHER EVENTS APS FINANCING APPLICATION On March 27, 2003, the ACC approved the $500 million Financing Application of Arizona Public Service Company ("APS") (see "APS Financing Application" in Item 5 of the Pinnacle West Capital Corporation (the "Company" or "Pinnacle West") Current Report on Form 8-K dated March 11, 2003), subject to the following principal conditions: * any debt issued by APS pursuant to the order must be unsecured; * APS will be permitted to loan up to $500 million (the "APS Loan") to Pinnacle West Energy Corporation ("Pinnacle West Energy"), guarantee up to $500 million of Pinnacle West Energy debt or a combination of both, not to exceed $500 million in the aggregate; * the APS Loan must be callable and secured by certain Pinnacle West Energy assets; * the APS Loan must bear interest at a rate equal to 264 basis points above the interest rate on APS debt that could be issued and sold on equivalent terms (including, but not limited to, maturity and security); * the 264 basis points referred to in the previous bullet will be capitalized as a deferred credit and used to offset retail rates in the future, with the deferred credit balance bearing an interest rate of six percent per annum; * the APS Loan must have a maturity date of not more than four years, unless otherwise ordered by the ACC; * any demonstrable increase in APS' cost of capital as a result of the transaction (such as from a decline in bond rating) will be excluded from future rate cases; * APS must maintain a common equity ratio of at least forty percent and may not pay common dividends if such payment would reduce its common equity ratio below that threshold, unless otherwise waived by the ACC. The ACC will process any waiver request within sixty days, and for this sixty-day period this condition will be suspended. However, this condition, which will be continued indefinitely, will not be permanently waived without an order of the ACC; and * certain waivers of the ACC's affiliated interest rules previously granted to APS and its affiliates will be withdrawn and, during the term of the APS Loan, neither Pinnacle West nor Pinnacle West Energy may reorganize or restructure, acquire or divest assets, or form, buy or sell affiliates (each, a "Covered Transaction"), or pledge or otherwise encumber the Pinnacle West Energy assets without prior ACC 2
