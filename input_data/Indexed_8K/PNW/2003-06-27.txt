SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION Washington, D.C. 20549 FORM 8-K CURRENT REPORT Pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Date of Report (Date of earliest event reported): June 27, 2003 PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION (Exact name of registrant as specified in its charter) Arizona 1-8962 86-0512431 (State or other jurisdiction (Commission (IRS Employer of incorporation) File Number) Identification Number) 400 North Fifth Street, P.O. Box 53999, Phoenix, Arizona 85072-3999 (Address of principal executive offices) (Zip Code) (602) 250-1000 (Registrant's telephone number, including area code) NONE (Former name or former address, if changed since last report)
ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS APS RATE REQUEST On June 27, 2003, Arizona Public Service Company ("APS") filed a request with the Arizona Corporation Commission (the "ACC") for a $175.1 million, or 9.8%, increase in its annual retail electricity revenues, to become effective July 1, 2004. MAJOR COMPONENTS OF THE REQUEST The major reasons for the request include: o complying with the provisions of the APS' regulatory settlement agreement approved by the ACC in 1999 (the "1999 Settlement Agreement"); o incorporating significant increases in fuel and purchased power costs, including results of purchases through the ACC's Track B procurement process; o recognizing changes in APS' cost of service, cost allocation and rate design; o obtaining rate recognition of the generating plants (the "PWEC Assets") built in Arizona by Pinnacle West Energy Corporation ("Pinnacle West Energy" or "PWEC"), another subsidiary of Pinnacle West Capital Corporation (the "Company") since 1999 to serve APS' retail electricity customers; o recovering $234 million written off by APS as a result of the 1999 Settlement Agreement; and o recovering restructuring and compliance costs associated with the ACC's electric competition rules. For additional background information regarding the 1999 Settlement Agreement, the ACC's electric competition rules, and this rate case, see Note 5 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2003. 2
REQUESTED RATE INCREASE The requested rate increase totals $175.1 million, or 9.8%, and is comprised of the following items: Annual Revenue Percent Increase Increase -------- -------- Increase in base rates $ 166.8 million 9.3% Competition rules compliance charge 8.3 million 0.5% --------------- --- Total increase $ 175.1 million 9.8% =============== === TEST YEAR The filing is based on an adjusted historical test year ended December 31, 2002. COST OF CAPITAL The proposed weighted average cost of capital for the test year ended December 31, 2002 is 8.67%, including an 11.5% return on equity. RATE BASE The request is based on a rate base of $4.2 billion, calculated using Original Cost Less Depreciation ("OCLD") methodology. The OCLD rate base approximates the ACC-jurisdictional portion of the net book value of utility plant, net of accumulated depreciation, as of December 31, 2002. The requested rate base includes the PWEC Assets - specifically, Redhawk Combined Cycle Units 1 and 2, West Phoenix Combined Cycle Units 4 and 5 and the Saguaro Combustion Turbine Unit 3, with a total combined capacity of approximately 1700 megawatts. Upon approval of the request, the PWEC Assets would be transferred to APS from Pinnacle West Energy. The filing also includes calculated amounts for Fair Value Rate Base and Replacement Cost New Depreciated ("RCND") rate base. The ACC is required by the Arizona Constitution to make a finding of Fair Value Rate Base, which is defined as the arithmetic average of OCLD rate base and RCND rate base. RECOVERY OF PREVIOUS $234 MILLION WRITE-OFF The request includes recovery, over a fifteen year period, of the write-off of $234 million pretax by APS as a result of the 1999 Settlement Agreement. 3
ESTIMATED TIMELINE APS has asked the ACC to approve the requested rate increase by July 1, 2004. The Company expects the ACC to issue procedural schedules during the next several months detailing the timeline for addressing the request. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This document contains forward-looking statements based on current expectations and we assume no obligation to update these statements or make any further statements on any of these issues, except as required by applicable laws. Because actual results may differ materially from expectations, we caution readers not to place undue reliance on these statements. A number of factors could cause future results to differ materially from historical results, or from results or outcomes currently expected or sought by us. These factors include the ongoing restructuring of the electric industry, including the introduction of retail electric competition in Arizona; the outcome of regulatory and legislative proceedings relating to the restructuring; state and federal regulatory and legislative decisions and actions, including the outcome of the rate case APS filed with the ACC on June 27, 2003 and the wholesale electric price mitigation plan adopted by the FERC; regional economic and market conditions, including the results of litigation and other proceedings resulting from the California energy situation and completion of generation construction in the region, which could affect customer growth and the cost of power supplies; the cost of debt and equity capital; weather variations affecting local and regional customer energy usage; conservation programs; power plant performance; the successful completion of our generation construction program, such as permitting and licensing; our ability to compete successfully outside traditional regulated markets (including the wholesale market); our ability to manage our marketing and trading activities and the use of derivative contracts in our business; technological developments in the electric industry; the performance of the stock market, which affects the amount of our required contributions to our pension plan and nuclear decommissioning trust funds; the strength of the real estate market in SunCor's market areas, which include Arizona, New Mexico and Utah; and other uncertainties, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control.

EXHIBIT 99.1 BEFORE THE ARIZONA CORPORATION COMMISSION COMMISSIONERS MARC SPITZER, Chairman JIM IRVIN WILLIAM A. MUNDELL JEFF HATCH-MILLER MIKE GLEASON IN THE MATTER OF THE APPLICATION OF ARIZONA PUBLIC SERVICE COMPANY FOR A HEARING TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF DOCKET NO. E-01345A-03-__ THE UTILITY PROPERTY OF THE COMPANY FOR RATEMAKING PURPOSES, TO FIX A JUST AND REASONABLE RATE OF RETURN THEREON, TO APPLICATION APPROVE RATE SCHEDULES DESIGNED TO DEVELOP SUCH RETURN, AND FOR APPROVAL OF PURCHASED POWER CONTRACT Pursuant to A.R.S. ss. 40-250, ET SEQ.; A.A.C. R14-2-103; and Decision No. 61973 (October 6, 1999), Arizona Public Service Company ("APS" or "Company") hereby files an Application for a permanent increase of at least $175 million on annualized test year sales, or 9.8 percent on average, for its jurisdictional electric operations, to become effective on July 1, 2004. The rate increase sought herein is required to enable the Company to maintain its credit ratings and attract new capital on reasonable terms, recover its costs of service, and permit APS to earn a fair rate of return on the fair value of its assets devoted to public service, which return will recover the Company's capital costs necessarily and prudently incurred in rendering adequate utility service to customers. The requested increase is necessary for APS to continue as the type of financially strong utility that can ensure APS customers continued reliable service, on demand, and at reasonable prices into the future.
APS is requesting that the Arizona Corporation Commission ("Commission") recognize the higher fuel and purchased power expenses that are being incurred by the Company; allow APS to include in rates at cost of service certain generation assets of Pinnacle West Energy Corporation ("PWEC");(1) permit APS to recover the $234 million write off taken under the 1999 Settlement Agreement, which was approved in Decision No. 61973; and provide for the recovery of all prudently incurred costs to comply with the Commission's Retail Electric Competition Rules, A.A.C. R14-2-1601, ET SEQ. (the "Electric Competition Rules"), including the one-third of costs associated with the planned divestiture of generation from APS to PWEC that was not previously deferred pursuant to Decision No. 61973. Such amounts are included in the $175 million increase requested by this Application. In addition, APS requests that the Commission approve depreciation and amortization rates and classifications for certain of the Company's tangible and intangible property and approve a specific accounting and ratemaking treatment of costs associated with asset retirement obligations under the recently implemented Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143 ("SFAS 143"). Finally, APS is requesting Commission review of its long-term purchased power contract with PWEC, which was previously submitted to the Commission. This request is required by Section 5.3 of such contract. However, the need for such review and any subsequent Commission approval would be moot if the PWEC units are rate based as requested in this Application. In support of this Application, the Company respectfully states as follows: - ---------- (1) These units are Redhawk Combined Cycle Units 1 and 2, West Phoenix Combined Cycle Units 4 and 5, and Saguaro Combustion Turbine Unit 3 (collectively, the "PWEC Units"). -2-

Its principal place of business is 400 North Fifth Street, Phoenix, Arizona, 85004, and its post office address is P.O. Box 53999, Phoenix, Arizona 85072-3999. II. The Company is a public service corporation principally engaged in the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity for sale in Arizona. In conducting such business, the Company operates an interconnected and integrated electric utility system. III. All communications and correspondence concerning this Application, as well as communications and pleadings with respect thereto filed by other parties, should be served upon the following: Thomas L. Mumaw Karilee S. Ramaley Pinnacle West Capital Corporation Law Department P.O. Box 53999 Phoenix, Arizona 85072-3999 Attorneys for Arizona Public Service Company Jeffrey B. Guldner Faraz Sanei Snell & Wilmer L.L.P. 400 East Van Buren Phoenix, Arizona 85004-2202 Attorneys for Arizona Public Service Company IV. This Commission has jurisdiction to conduct public hearings to determine the fair value of the property of a public service corporation, to fix a just and reasonable rate of return thereon, and thereafter, to approve rate schedules designed to develop such return. Further, the Commission has jurisdiction to -3-
establish the practices and procedures to govern the conduct of such hearing, including, but not limited to, such matters as notice, intervention, filing, service, exhibits, discovery and other prehearing and hearing matters. V. Accompanying this Application are all of the relevant standard filing requirements ("SFRs") and rate design schedules described in A.A.C. R14-2-103(2) and the direct testimony and attachments of the following witnesses: o Steven M. Wheeler o Donald G. Robinson o Ajit P. Bhatti o Chris N. Froggatt o Laura L. Rockenberger o Charles E. Olson, Ph.D. o William H. Hieronymus, Ph.D. o John H. Landon, Ph.D. o Alan Propper o David J. Rumolo o Kenneth Gordon, Ph.D. VI. The Company respectfully requests that this Commission set a date for a hearing on this Application such that new rates for the Company will become effective July 1, 2004. At the hearing conducted pursuant to this rate request, APS will establish and hereby alleges that: (1) its current rates and charges do not permit the Company to earn a fair return on the fair value of its assets devoted to public service and are therefore no longer just and reasonable; - ---------- 2 This Application does not include SFR Schedule E-6 because such schedule applies only to a "combination utility" within the meaning of A.A.C. R14-2-103(A)(3)(q) which does not include APS. -4-
(2) the requested increase is the minimum amount necessary to allow the Company an opportunity to earn a fair return on the fair value of its assets devoted to public service, for preservation of the Company's financial integrity and for the attraction of new capital investment on reasonable terms; (3) the Company requires additional permanent revenue of at least $175 million based on annualized test period sales in order to continue to provide adequate and reliable electric service to its customers as required by law; (4) the PWEC Units were prudently planned and constructed and are used and useful, and the acquisition of the PWEC Units and their inclusion in rates at cost of service is appropriate and in the best interests of APS customers; (5) the recovery by APS of the $234 million write off taken pursuant to Decision No. 61973 and the recovery by APS of all prudently incurred costs to comply with the Commission's Electric Competition Rules, including the one-third of costs associated with the planned divestiture of generation from APS to PWEC that was not previously deferred pursuant to Decision No. 61973, is appropriate and warranted; (6) Section 3.4 of the APS-PWEC Track B contract(3) requires APS to file an application for approval and full cost recovery within 60 days of contract execution because deliveries are contemplated to occur after January 1, 2006; to the extent that further action by APS is required, this Application constitutes such action as is required by Section 3.4 - ---------- 3 This contract was submitted to the Commission in APS' May 27, 2003 Report on the Track B Solicitation Process and is discussed in the Independent Monitor's Final Report on Track B Solicitation filed on June 13, 2003.
of the contract, and APS requests that any Commission order regarding such contract be consistent with the Company's rate application; and (7) the requested increase and associated approvals fairly balance the interests of both APS' customers and its investors. WHEREFORE, THE COMPANY RESPECTFULLY REQUESTS that the Commission: A. Issue a procedural order establishing a date for hearing evidence concerning the Application and prescribing the time and form of notice to APS customers; B. Issue a final order granting the Company the permanent rate increase sought herein; C. Issue a final order authorizing APS' depreciation and amortization rates and classifications, and authorizing the requested treatment of asset retirement obligations resulting from SFAS 143; and D. Grant the Company such other relief as the Commission deems just and proper. RESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED this 27th day of June 2003. PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORP. Law Department Thomas L.
