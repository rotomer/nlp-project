Exhibit 99.8
     This discussion explains the changes in our consolidated earnings for the three, six and twelve month periods ended June 30, 2003 and 2002. Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income for the three, six and twelve months ended June 30, 2003 and 2002 follow this discussion. We will file our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2003 on or before August 14, 2003. We suggest this section be read in connection with the Pinnacle West Capital Corporation Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2002 and the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2003. We have reclassified certain prior period amounts to conform to our current period presentation. Additional operating and financial statistics and a glossary of terms are available on our website (www.pinnaclewest.com).
Earnings Contributions By Subsidiary And Business Segment
     We have three principal business segments (determined by products, services and the regulatory environment):
     The following tables summarize net income and segment details for the three, six and twelve months ended June 30, 2003 and the comparable prior periods for Pinnacle West and each of our subsidiaries (dollars in millions):
 
 
Results of Operations
     
General
     Throughout the following explanations of our results of operations, we refer to "gross margin." With respect to our regulated electricity segment and our marketing and trading segment, gross margin refers to electric operating revenues less purchased power and fuel costs. Our real estate segment gross margin refers to real estate revenues less real estate operations costs of SunCor. Other gross margin refers to other operating revenues less other operating expenses, which includes El Dorado's investment in NAC, which we began consolidating in our financial statements in July 2002. Other gross margin also includes amounts related to APS Energy Services' energy consulting services.
     
Operating Results  Three-month period ended June 30, 2003 compared with three-month period ended June 30, 2002
     Our consolidated net income for the three months ended June 30, 2003 was $56 million compared with $75 million for the prior year. The period-to-period decrease of $19 million was primarily due to (amounts after tax):
     The above decreases were partially offset by (amounts after tax):
 
     For additional details, see the following discussion.
     The major factors that increased (decreased) net income were as follows (dollars in millions):
 
Regulated Electricity Segment Gross Margin
     Regulated electricity segment revenues related to our regulated retail and wholesale electricity businesses were $10 million higher in the three months ended June 30, 2003, compared with the same period in the prior year as a result of:
     Regulated electricity segment purchased power and fuel costs were $20 million higher in the three months ended June 30, 2003, compared with the same period in the prior year as a result of:
Marketing and Trading Segment Gross Margin
     Marketing and trading segment revenues were $118 million higher in the three months ended June 30, 2003, compared with the same period in the prior year as a result of:
     Marketing and trading segment purchased power and fuel costs were $117 million higher in the three months ended June 30, 2003, compared to the same period in the prior year as a result of:
 
Other Income Statement Items
     The increase in operations and maintenance expense of $13 million was due to increased pension and other benefit costs, new power plants in service, a prior period reversal of APS Energy Services' California reserve and other costs.
     Net interest expense increased $7 million primarily because of higher debt balances and lower capitalized interest related to our generation construction program, including completion of Redhawk Units 1 and 2 in mid-2002.
     The increase in depreciation and amortization expense of $5 million primarily related to increased plant assets and new power plants, partially offset by lower regulatory asset amortization.
     The increase in other gross margin of $2 million was primarily due to increased NAC gross margins.
     The decrease in other expense of $8 million primarily related to the absence of NAC losses of $6 million in 2003 and lower other expenses.
     The increase in real estate segment gross margin of $2 million was primarily due to higher home sales. In addition, in the 2003 period, discontinued operations of $1 million after tax primarily related to SunCor's sale of its water utility company. In the 2002 period, discontinued operations of $6 million after tax primarily related to SunCor's sale of a retail center (see "Real Estate Activities" below).
     
Operating Results  Six-month period ended June 30, 2003 compared with six-month period ended June 30, 2002
     Our consolidated net income for the six months ended June 30, 2003 was $81 million compared with $129 million for the prior year. Both periods include income from discontinued operations related to our real estate segment. The period-to-period decrease of $48 million was primarily due to (amounts after tax):
 
     The above decreases were partially offset by (amounts after tax):
     For additional details, see the following discussion.
 
     The major factors that increased (decreased) net income were as follows (dollars in millions):
 
Regulated Electricity Segment Gross Margin
     Regulated electricity segment revenues related to our regulated retail and wholesale electricity businesses were $15 million higher in the six months ended June 30, 2003, compared with the same period in the prior year as a result of:
     Regulated electricity segment purchased power and fuel costs were $33 million higher in the six months ended June 30, 2003, compared with the same period in the prior year as a result of:
Marketing and Trading Segment Gross Margin
     Marketing and trading segment revenues were $205 million higher in the six months ended June 30, 2003, compared with the same period in the prior year as a result of:
     Marketing and trading segment purchased power and fuel costs were $225 million higher in the six months ended June 30, 2003, compared to the same period in the prior year as a result of:
 
Other Income Statement Items
     The increase in operations and maintenance expense of $28 million was due to increased pension and other benefit costs, new power plants in service and increased customer service costs.
     Net interest expense increased $14 million primarily because of higher debt balances and lower capitalized interest related to our generation construction program, including completion of Redhawk Units 1 and 2 in mid-2002.
     The increase in depreciation and amortization expense of $11 million primarily related to new power plants and increased plant assets, partially offset by lower regulatory asset amortization.
     The increase in other gross margin of $8 million was primarily due to NAC's $5 million reversal of loss reserves related to the settlement of a contract.
     The decrease in other expense of $7 million primarily related to prior period NAC losses.
     
Operating Results  Twelve-month period ended June 30, 2003 compared with twelve-month period ended June 30, 2002
     Our consolidated net income for the twelve months ended June 30, 2003 was $102 million compared with $315 million for the prior year. The period-to-period decrease of $213 million was primarily due to (amounts after tax):
 
     The above decreases were partially offset by (amounts after tax):
     For additional details, see the following discussion.
 
     The major factors that increased (decreased) net income were as follows (dollars in millions):
 
Regulated Electricity Segment Gross Margin
     Regulated electricity segment revenues related to our regulated retail and wholesale electricity businesses were $259 million lower in the twelve months ended June 30, 2003, compared with the same period in the prior year as a result of:
     Regulated electricity segment purchased power and fuel costs were $230 million lower in the twelve months ended June 30, 2003, compared with the same period in the prior year as a result of:
Marketing and Trading Segment Gross Margin
     Marketing and trading segment revenues were $247 million higher in the twelve months ended June 30, 2003, compared with the same period in the prior year as a result of:
 
     Marketing and trading segment purchased power and fuel costs were $306 million higher in the twelve months ended June 30, 2003, compared to the same period in the prior year as a result of:
Other Income Statement Items
     The increase in operations and maintenance expense of $94 million was due to a $47 million write-off related to the cancellation of Redhawk Units 3 and 4, severance costs of $36 million related to a 2002 voluntary workforce reduction, increased pension and other benefit costs of $17 million, new power plants in service of $17 million and other costs of $1 million, partially offset by lower costs related to generation reliability of $25 million.
     The decrease in other gross margin of $37 million was primarily due to losses on El Dorado's investment in NAC, partially offset by increased margin on APS Energy Services' non-commodity sales. Total NAC losses for the twelve month period ended June 30, 2003 totaled approximately $47 million on a pretax basis and were primarily related to contracts with two customers. We reversed $5 million of loss reserves in the first quarter of 2003 related to NAC's settlement of one of those contracts. We believe we have reserved our exposure with respect to these contracts in all material respects and, as a result, we consider these charges to be non-recurring.
     The decrease in other expense of $7 million is primarily related to the absence of NAC losses of $4 million in 2003 recorded as other expense and prior period non-operating costs.
     Net interest expense increased $30 million primarily because of higher debt balances related to our generation construction program and lower capitalized interest on our generation construction program due to completion of Redhawk Units 1 and 2 in mid-2002.
     The increase in depreciation and amortization expense of $17 million primarily related to new power plants and increased plant assets, partially offset by lower regulatory amortization.
     The increase in taxes other than income taxes of $6 million is primarily due to increased property taxes on higher property balances.
     The decrease in real estate segment gross margin of $4 million was primarily due to lower commercial and property management sales, partially offset by higher home sales activities. In addition, as discussed in "Real Estate Activities" below, SunCor had a $14 million ($8 million after tax) gain on the sale of its water utility company included in discontinued operations for the twelve months ended June 30, 2003 and a $12 million ($7 million after tax) gain related primarily to the sale of a retail center included in discontinued operations in the twelve months ended June 30, 2002.
 
Real Estate Activities
     As discussed in our 2002 10-K, we have undertaken an aggressive effort to accelerate asset sales activities to approximately double SunCor's annual earnings in 2003 to 2005 compared with the $19 million in earnings recorded in 2002.
     Certain components of SunCor's real estate sales activities, which are included in the real estate segment, may be required to be reported as discontinued operations on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income in accordance with SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets." Among other things, SFAS No. 144 prescribes accounting for discontinued operations and defines certain real estate activities as discontinued operations. We adopted SFAS No. 144 effective January 1, 2002 and determined that activities that would have required discontinued operations reporting in 2002, 2001 and 2000 were immaterial. We currently estimate that 15% to 30% of SunCor's net income in 2003 will be reported in discontinued operations; however, this ultimately depends on the specific properties sold.
     In the first quarter of 2003, SunCor sold its water utility company, which resulted in an after tax gain of $5 million ($8 million pretax). The gain on the sale and operating income in the current and prior periods are classified as discontinued operations on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.
     In the second quarter of 2002, SunCor sold a retail center, but maintained a significant continuing involvement through a management contract. In the first quarter of 2003, this management contract was canceled. As a result, the gain on the 2002 sale and the operating income related to this property have been reclassified as discontinued operations. The income from discontinued operations in the three, six and twelve months ended June 30, 2002 primarily reflects this sale.
     The following chart provides a summary of SunCor's earnings (after income taxes) for the three, six and twelve months ended June 30, 2003 and the comparable prior periods (dollars in millions):
Forward-Looking Statements
     This document contains forward-looking statements based on current expectations and we assume no obligation to update these statements or make any further statements on any of these issues, except as required by applicable law. These forward-looking statements are often identified by words such as "hope," "may," "believe," "anticipate," "plan," "expect," "require," "intend,"
 
"assume" and similar words. Because actual results may differ materially from expectations, we caution readers not to place undue reliance on these statements. A number of factors could cause future results to differ materially from historical results, or from results or outcomes currently expected or sought by us. These factors include, but are not limited to, the ongoing restructuring of the electric industry, including the introduction of retail electric competition in Arizona and decisions impacting wholesale competition; the outcome of regulatory and legislative proceedings relating to the restructuring; state and federal regulatory and legislative decisions and actions, including the outcome of the rate case we filed with the ACC on June 27, 2003 and the wholesale electric price mitigation plan adopted by the FERC; regional economic and market conditions, including the results of litigation and other proceedings resulting from the California energy situation, volatile purchased power and fuel costs and the completion of generation and transmission construction in the region, which could affect customer growth and the cost of power supplies; the cost of debt and equity capital and access to capital markets; weather variations affecting local and regional customer energy usage; conservation programs; power plant performance; the successful completion of our generation construction program; regulatory issues associated with generation construction, such as permitting and licensing; our ability to compete successfully outside traditional regulated markets (including the wholesale market); our ability to manage our marketing and trading activities and the use of derivative contracts in our business; technological developments in the electric industry; the performance of the stock market, which affects the amount of our required contributions to our pension plan and nuclear decommissioning trust funds; the strength of the real estate market in SunCor's market areas, which include Arizona, New Mexico and Utah; and other uncertainties, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control.
 
 
 

 
Exhibit 99.9
 
 
 
 

 
PHOENIX  Pinnacle West Capital Corporation (NYSE: PNW) today reported consolidated net income for the quarter ended June 30, 2003, of $56.1 million or $0.61 per diluted share of common stock. The result compares with net income of $75.4 million or $0.89 per share for the same quarter a year ago.
The lower earnings were primarily the result of higher natural gas and purchased power costs at Arizona Public Service (APS) to serve retail electricity customers. Compared with the second quarter of 2002, for instance, the cost of natural gas to run the Company's plants increased from $15 million to $30 million  a 100 percent increase.
"While clearly not desirable earnings, the results include the cost of gas hedges purchased in early 2001 during the western energy crisis," Chairman Bill Post said. "In addition to the higher gas prices, our gas plants produced more than twice their output of a year ago to meet the growing electricity needs of our customers."
In order to meet Arizona's growth of three times the national average, the Company has built several new plants and added about 3,000 miles of transmission and distribution lines over the last several years  all designed to meet growing customer demand with the highest level of reliable service.
Other factors affecting the quarterly comparison included a $5 million increase in expenses, net of the benefit of reduced purchased power, related to three new power plant units placed into service in mid-2002; an increase of $4 million in pension and other related benefit costs; and $4 million for a 1.5 percent retail electricity price decrease related to the Company's 1999 regulatory settlement agreement. These factors were partially offset by 3.1 percent retail customer growth of $8 million; and lower regulatory asset amortization of $4 million.
A substantial deterioration in the western wholesale power market over the last few months has caused the Company to reduce its 2003 earnings estimate to a range of $2.55 to $2.85 per share. This deterioration was driven by a 15 to 20 percent reduction in margins (known in the industry as "spark spreads"), and by a reduction in market liquidity attributable to fewer creditworthy counterparties and the decision of several key
 
market participants to reduce their activities or exit the market entirely. The Company's revised earnings estimate assumes 2003 power marketing and trading contributions, although still profitable, will be down 75 percent from 2002 levels.
For 2004, the Company anticipates earnings to be in the range of $2.85 to $3.15 per share, reflecting a return to earnings growth related to the scheduled completion of regulatory asset amortization, and continuing customer growth of about three times the national average. Marketing and trading contributions in 2004 are expected to be comparable to the levels assumed in the Company's 2003 earnings estimate.
