Earnings Outlook
     In this discussion, earnings per share amounts are after income taxes and are based on diluted common shares outstanding. Trading contributions refers to gross margin contributions from our marketing and trading segment before income taxes, excluding margins from generation sales other than native load, margins attributable to structured transactions originated in prior years, and margins attributable to commodity sales by APS Energy Services Company, Inc. ("APS Energy Services"). The earnings guidance in this Form 8-K Report supersedes all previous earnings guidance provided by Pinnacle West Capital Corporation (the "Company").
2003 Earnings Outlook
     On July 28, 2003, we issued guidance that our estimate of 2003 earnings was a range of $2.55 to $2.85 per share. We currently project that 2003 earnings are likely to be in the lower half of the range primarily as a result of the following factors:

2004 Earnings Outlook
     In June 2003, APS filed a general rate case with the Arizona Corporation Commission (the "ACC") and requested a $175 million (9.8%) increase in its annual retail electricity revenues, to become effective July 1, 2004. We are unable to predict when the ACC will make a decision in this case, nor are we able to predict the specific date when a rate increase will become effective.
     We estimate that a base level of earnings for 2004 is approximately $229 million ($2.50 per share) before considering any potential earnings benefit derived from a rate increase effective at anytime during the second half of 2004. Such a level of earnings is premised on no trading contributions and combined SunCor Development Company ("SunCor") and APS Energy Services earnings of approximately $40 million ($0.44 per

share) in 2004. Trading contributions were $74 million ($0.52 per share) in 2002 and are estimated to be negligible in 2003.
     If the ACC were to grant the retail rate increase we have requested, and the increase became effective July 1, 2004, we estimate that 2004 earnings would increase by approximately $70 million ($0.76 per share), consisting of approximately $55 million ($0.60 per share) in the third quarter of 2004, and approximately $15 million ($0.16 per share) in the fourth quarter of 2004.
     Our earnings forecasts are subject to numerous risks, including those described under "Forward-Looking Statements" below and under "Business Outlook" in Part I, Item 2 of our June 10-Q. Our estimates as to how several of these risks and other factors may affect 2004 earnings follow:
Table of Contents
     The 2004 earnings guidance we issued in July 2003 was intended to reflect an assumption that the ACC would not make a decision on our retail rate increase request until the end of 2004. However, the range that we communicated unintentionally reflected a portion of a retail rate increase for a partial period of 2004. Due to the extent of uncertainty regarding the timing and amount of any retail rate increase and its potential effect on 2004 earnings, we believe the information set forth above with respect to 2004 earnings is more appropriate and informative for analytical purposes than would be any specific range.
Earnings Prospects Beyond 2004
     The past two years have presented us with significant challenges in the forms of regulatory uncertainty, volatile fuel prices, and a substantial deterioration in the western wholesale power market. Looking at the foreseeable future beyond 2004 and the resolution of APS' pending rate case, we are confident that the Company has the potential to consistently achieve earnings levels greater than $3.40 per share and that our customer growth of about three times the national average will provide a solid catalyst for continuing long-term earnings and dividend growth. Such a level of earnings is premised on: (1) the ACC granting APS' requested retail rate increase, (2) annual trading contributions of $10 million, and (3) combined SunCor and APS Energy Services earnings of $30 million in 2005 and $10 million in each subsequent year.

Forward-Looking Statements
     This Report on Form 8-K contains forward-looking statements based on current expectations, and we assume no obligation to update these statements or make any further statements on any of these issues, except as required by applicable law. These

forward-looking statements are often identified by words such as "hope," "may," "believe," "anticipate," "plan," "expect," "require," "intend," "assume," and similar words. Because actual results may differ materially from expectations, we caution readers not to place undue reliance on these statements. A number of factors could cause future results to differ materially from historical results, or from results or outcomes currently expected or sought by us. These factors include, but are not limited to, the ongoing restructuring of the electric industry, including the introduction of retail electric competition in Arizona and decisions impacting wholesale competition; the outcome of regulatory and legislative proceedings relating to the restructuring; state and federal regulatory and legislative decisions and actions, including the outcome of the rate case APS filed with the Arizona Corporation Commission on June 27, 2003 and the wholesale electric price mitigation plan adopted by the FERC; regional economic and market conditions, including the results of litigation and other proceedings resulting from the California energy situation, volatile purchased power and fuel costs, and the completion of generation and transmission construction in the region, which could affect customer growth and the cost of power supplies; the cost of debt and equity capital and access to capital markets; energy usage; weather variations affecting local and regional customer energy usage; conservation programs; power plant performance; the successful completion of our generation construction program; regulatory issues associated with generation construction, such as permitting and licensing; changes in accounting principles; our ability to compete successfully outside traditional regulated markets (including the wholesale market); our ability to manage our marketing and trading activities and the use of derivative contracts in our business (including the interpretation of the subjective and complex accounting rules related to these contracts); technological developments in the electric industry; the performance of the stock market, which affects the amount of our required contributions to our pension plan and nuclear decommissioning trust funds; the strength of the real estate market in SunCor's market areas, which include Arizona, New Mexico and Utah; and other uncertainties, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control.
