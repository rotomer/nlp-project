EXHIBIT 99.8
     This discussion explains the changes in our consolidated earnings for the three, nine and twelve month periods ended September 30, 2003 and 2002. Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income for the three, nine and twelve months ended September 30, 2003 and 2002 follow this discussion. We will file our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2003 on or before November 14, 2003. We suggest this section be read in connection with the Pinnacle West Capital Corporation Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2002 and the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2003 and June 30, 2003. We have reclassified certain prior period amounts to conform to our current period presentation. Additional operating and financial statistics and a glossary of terms are available on our website (www.pinnaclewest.com).
Earnings Contributions By Subsidiary And Business Segment
     We have three principal business segments (determined by products, services and the regulatory environment):
     The following tables summarize net income and segment details for the three, nine and twelve months ended September 30, 2003 and the comparable prior year periods for Pinnacle West and each of our subsidiaries (dollars in millions):
 
 
Results of Operations
     Throughout the following explanations of our results of operations, we refer to "gross margin." With respect to our regulated electricity segment and our marketing and trading segment, gross margin refers to electric operating revenues less purchased power and fuel costs. Our real estate segment gross margin refers to real estate revenues less real estate operations costs of SunCor. Other gross margin refers to other operating revenues less other operating expenses, which primarily includes El Dorado's investment in NAC, which we began consolidating in our financial statements in July 2002. Other gross margin also includes amounts related to APS Energy Services' energy consulting services.
     Consistent with APS returning to a vertically integrated utility, as evidenced by APS' recent general rate case filing, which includes the request for rate recognition of generation assets, APS has also returned to the Allowance for Funds Used During Construction ("AFUDC") method, which is a more traditional method of capitalizing interest and equity costs associated with construction projects in a regulated utility. This change increased earnings by $8 million in the third quarter of 2003.
     Our consolidated net income for the three months ended September 30, 2003 was $110 million compared with $101 million for the prior period. The $9 million increase in the period-to-period comparison reflects the following changes in earnings by segment:
 
     Additional details on the major factors that increased (decreased) income from continuing operations before income taxes and net income are contained in the table below (dollars in millions).
     The increase in operating and interest costs related to new power plants placed in service by Pinnacle West Energy, net of purchased power savings and increased gross margin from generation sales other than native load, totaled approximately $3 million after income taxes in the three months ended September 30, 2003 compared with the prior-year period.
 
Regulated Electricity Segment Revenues
     Regulated electricity segment revenues were $25 million lower in the three months ended September 30, 2003, compared with the same period in the prior year primarily as a result of:
Marketing and Trading Segment Revenues
     Marketing and trading segment revenues were $67 million higher in the three months ended September 30, 2003, compared with the same period in the prior year primarily as a result of:
 
     Our consolidated net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2003 was $191 million compared with $230 million for the prior year. Both periods include income from discontinued operations related to our real estate segment (see "Real Estate Activities" below). The $39 million decrease in the period-to-period comparison reflects the following changes in earnings by segment:
     Additional details on the major factors that increased (decreased) income from continuing operations before income taxes and net income are contained in the table below (dollars in millions).
 
 
     The increase in operating and interest costs related to new power plants placed in service by Pinnacle West Energy, net of purchased power savings and increased gross margin from generation sales other than native load, totaled approximately $17 million after income taxes in the nine months ended September 30, 2003 compared with the prior-year period.
Regulated Electricity Segment Revenues
     Regulated electricity segment revenues were $10 million lower in the nine months ended September 30, 2003, compared with the same period in the prior year primarily as a result of:
Marketing and Trading Segment Revenues
     Marketing and trading segment revenues were $272 million higher in the nine months ended September 30, 2003, compared with the same period in the prior year primarily as a result of:
 
     Operating Results  Twelve-month period ended September 30, 2003 compared with Twelve-month period ended September 30, 2002
     Our consolidated net income for the twelve months ended September 30, 2003 was $111 million compared with $266 million for the prior year. Both periods include income from discontinued operations related to our real estate segment (see "Real Estate Activities" below). The $155 million decrease in the period-to-period comparison reflects the following changes in earnings by segment:
     Additional details on the major factors that increased (decreased) income from continuing operations and net income are contained in the table below (dollars in millions).
 
 
     The increase in operating and interest costs related to new power plants placed in service by Pinnacle West Energy, net of purchased power savings and increased gross margin from generation sales other than native load, totaled approximately $21 million after income taxes in the twelve months ended September 30, 2003 compared with the prior-year period.
Regulated Electricity Segment Revenues
     Regulated electricity segment revenues were $30 million lower in the twelve months ended September 30, 2003, compared with the same period in the prior year primarily as a result of:
Marketing and Trading Segment Revenues
     Marketing and trading segment revenues were $368 million higher in the twelve months ended September 30, 2003, compared with the same period in the prior year primarily as a result of:
 
Real Estate Activities
     As discussed in our 2002 10-K, we have undertaken an aggressive effort to accelerate asset sales activities to approximately double SunCor's annual earnings in 2003 to 2005 compared with the $19 million in earnings recorded in 2002.
     Certain components of SunCor's real estate sales activities, which are included in the real estate segment, are required to be reported as discontinued operations on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income in accordance with SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets." Among other things, SFAS No. 144 prescribes accounting for discontinued operations and defines certain real estate activities as discontinued operations. We adopted SFAS No. 144 effective January 1, 2002 and determined that activities that would have required discontinued operations reporting in 2002, 2001 and 2000 were immaterial. We currently estimate that 15% to 30% of SunCor's net income in 2003 will be reported in discontinued operations; however, this ultimately depends on the specific properties sold.
     In the first quarter of 2003, SunCor sold its water utility company, which resulted in an after-tax gain of $5 million ($8 million pretax). The gain on the sale and operating income in the current and prior periods are classified as discontinued operations on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.
     In the second quarter of 2002, SunCor sold a retail center, but maintained a significant continuing involvement through a management contract. In the first quarter of 2003, this management contract was canceled. As a result, the gain on the 2002 sale and the operating income related to this property have been reclassified as discontinued operations. The income from discontinued operations in the three, nine and twelve months ended September 30, 2002 primarily reflects this sale.
     The following chart provides a summary of SunCor's earnings (after income taxes) for the three, nine and twelve months ended September 30, 2003 and the comparable prior periods (dollars in millions):

EXHIBIT 99.10
PHOENIX  Pinnacle West Capital Corp. (NYSE: PNW) today reported consolidated net income for the quarter ended September 30, 2003, of $110.0 million, or $1.20 per diluted share of common stock. This result compares with consolidated net income of $100.9 million, or $1.19 per diluted share, for the same period in 2002.
"Our employees navigated through some challenging issues while maintaining an intense focus on customer service, cost management and profitability," said Chairman Bill Post.
The earnings were positively impacted by higher retail sales due to both customer growth and favorable weather; improved results from the Company's unregulated subsidiaries; the absence of severance costs recorded in the 2002 period; and income tax credits. These factors were substantially offset by continuing deterioration in the western wholesale power market; unplanned plant outages; higher fuel and hedged gas prices; a 1.5 percent retail electricity price decrease; and an increase in pension and other related benefit costs.
The electricity price decrease, which took effect in July 2003, completed a 10-year commitment of reducing prices a total of 16 percent for residential and small commercial customers since 1994.
Looking forward, Post said, "The Company needs to achieve a constructive regulatory outcome in our pending rate case to cover the costs of providing reliable service for our retail customer base, which is growing at about three times the national average."
As a result of increased home and land sales, SunCor Development Co., Pinnacle West's real estate subsidiary, reported an earnings increase of about $7 million for the 2003 third quarter. Unregulated subsidiary results also benefited from the absence of a $10 million after-tax charge recorded in the third quarter of 2002 related to NAC International.
For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2003, Pinnacle West's consolidated net income was $191.5 million, or $2.09 per diluted share of common stock. This result compares with consolidated net income of $230.0 million, or $2.71 per diluted share, in last year's corresponding period.

Pinnacle West is a Phoenix-based company with consolidated assets of approximately $9 billion.

This press release contains forward-looking statements based on current expectations, and the Company assumes no obligation to update these statements or make any further statements on any of these issues, except as required by applicable law. These forward-looking statements are often identified by words such as "hope," "may," "believe," "anticipate," "plan," "expect," "require," "intend," "assume," and similar words. Because actual results may differ materially from expectations, the Company cautions readers not to place undue reliance on these statements. A number of factors could cause future results to differ materially from historical results, or from results or outcomes currently expected or sought by the Company. These factors include the ongoing restructuring of the electric industry, including the introduction of retail electric competition in Arizona and decisions impacting wholesale competition; the outcome of regulatory and legislative proceedings relating to the restructuring; state and federal regulatory and legislative decisions and actions, including the outcome of the rate case APS filed with the Arizona Corporation Commission on June 27, 2003 and the wholesale electric price mitigation plan adopted by the FERC; regional economic and market conditions, including the results of litigation and other proceedings resulting from the California energy situation, volatile purchased power and fuel costs, and the completion of generation and transmission construction in the region, which could affect customer growth and the cost of power supplies; the cost of debt and equity capital and access to capital markets; energy usage; weather variations affecting local and regional customer energy usage; conservation programs; power plant performance; the successful completion of our generation construction program; regulatory issues associated with generation construction , such as permitting and licensing; changes in accounting principles; our ability to compete successfully outside traditional regulated markets (including the wholesale market);our ability to manage our marketing and trading activities and the use of derivative contracts in our business (including the interpretation of the subjective and complex accounting rules related to these contracts); technological developments in the electric industry; the performance of the stock market, which affects the amount of our required contributions to our pension plan and nuclear decommissioning trust funds; the strength of the real estate market in SunCor's market areas, which include Arizona, New Mexico and Utah; and other uncertainties, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control.
