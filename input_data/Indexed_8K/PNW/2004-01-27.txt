Item 5. State Regulatory Matters
     In early December 2003, Arizona Public Service Company ("APS") issued a request for proposals ("RFP") for long-term power supply resources, and on January 8, 2004, an Arizona Corporation Commission ("ACC") Administrative Law Judge issued an order requiring, among other things, APS to file a summary of the proposals with the ACC. See "State Regulatory Matters" in Item 5 of the Pinnacle West Capital Corporation (the "Company") Current Report on Form 8-K dated January 8, 2004. On January 27, 2004, APS filed a summary of the proposals with the ACC. This summary is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
Item 7. Financial Statements, Pro Forma Financial Information and Exhibits
          
(c) Exhibits.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Company has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

 
Exhibit 99.1
     On December 3, 2003, Arizona Public Service Company ("APS") issued a Request for Proposals-Power Supply Resource Proposal for the Procurement of Generating Capacity (the "RFP"). Therein, APS requested proposals "for at least 500 MW of power supply resources" to be used for APS' rapidly growing retail load, with deliveries of such power supply resources to APS commencing no later than in the Summer of 2006/2007.
     On December 19, 2003, the Arizona Competitive Power Alliance (the "Alliance") filed with the Arizona Corporation Commission (the "Commission") a "Motion to Revise the Procedural Schedule or, in the alternative, to Bifurcate Rate Case to Exclude Issues Regarding PWEC Assets," relating to APS' application for a rate increase (the "APS Rate Application"). In so moving, the Alliance raised certain issues relating to the RFP.
     On January 6, 2004, a procedural conference was held in the APS Rate Application proceeding. During the procedural conference, various parties, including the Alliance, APS and the Commission's Utilities Division Staff ("Staff"), addressed the Alliance Motion with the Chief Administrative Law Judge.
     On January 8, 2004, the Chief Administrative Law Judge issued a Procedural Order directing APS to (i) revise Attachment 1 to the RFP, (ii) extend the deadline for "submitting proposals by one week" (thereby extending the proposal submission date from January 14, 2004 to January 21, 2004), and (iii) submit a filing with the Commission on or before January 27, 2004, which would provide "a summary of the proposals that contains information about the number and the terms of the bids [emphasis supplied]" (the "Procedural Order").
in such a manner that does not disclose confidential information
     In compliance with the Procedural Order, APS hereby submits this summary of the responses received to its RFP. In preparing this summary, APS has attempted to be fully responsive to the Procedural Order while being equally mindful of the Procedural Order's admonition against the disclosure of any confidential and/or proprietary information provided by any respondent to the RFP process. APS has also attempted to summarize the RFP responses in a manner that will not seriously prejudice the negotiation process which will occur as a part of the RFP in a manner that could result in higher costs for APS customers.

REGULATORY REVIEW
 
APS has only just begun the process of evaluating these bids and proposals. The schedule for the RFP currently contemplates notifying all bidders of their status by approximately February 4, 2004. If after the short-list review process, APS determines that one of more of the bids should be selected for further evaluation, more detailed due diligence and negotiations will begin with the ultimate goal of executing definitive agreement(s) and securing the necessary regulatory approvals.
