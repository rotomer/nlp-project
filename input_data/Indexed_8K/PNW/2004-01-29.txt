     Certain of the Information relates to the Company's results of operations for its fiscal quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2003. This Information is attached hereto as Exhibits 99.2, 99.3, and 99.8.
     On January 29, 2004, the Company issued a press release regarding its financial results for its fiscal quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2003. A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.10.
     The information in Exhibits 99.2, 99.3, 99.8 and 99.10 of this report relating to the Company's financial results for its fiscal quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2003 shall not be deemed to be "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") or otherwise subject to the liability of that section, and shall not be incorporated by reference into any registration statement or other document filed under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.
     Exhibit 99.10 to this report contains certain "non-GAAP financial measures," as defined in Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K of the Exchange Act. The non-GAAP financial measures, which we describe as "on-going earnings" and "on-going earnings per share," exclude from net income: income tax credits related to prior years and recorded in 2003; previously disclosed, non-recurring charges in 2002; and a 2002 charge for the cumulative effect of an accounting change. Exhibit 99.10 reconciles each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("GAAP"). We believe on-going earnings provide investors with a useful indicator of our results that is comparable among periods because it excludes the effects of unusual items that may occur on an irregular basis. Investors should note that these non-GAAP financial measures involve judgments by management, including whether an item is classified as an unusual item. We use on-going earnings, or similar concepts, to internally measure performance in reports for management.

Exhibit 99.8
LAST UPDATED 1/29/04
     This discussion explains the changes in our consolidated earnings for the three and twelve month periods ended December 31, 2003 and 2002. Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 follow this discussion. We will file our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2003 on or before March 15, 2004. We have reclassified certain prior period amounts to conform to our current period presentation, including netting of certain revenue and purchased power amounts as a result of the adoption of EITF 03-11, "Reporting Realized Gains and Losses on Derivative Instruments That Are Subject to FASB Statement No. 133 and Not Held for Trading Purposes' as Defined in in Issue No. 02-03." Additional operating and financial statistics and a glossary of terms are available on our website (www.pinnaclewest.com).
Earnings Contributions by Subsidiary and Business Segment
     We have three principal business segments (determined by products, services and the regulatory environment):
     The following tables summarize net income and segment details for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2003 and the comparable prior-year periods for Pinnacle West and each of our subsidiaries (dollars in millions):
 
Results of Operations
     
General
     Throughout the following explanations of our results of operations, we refer to "gross margin." With respect to our regulated electricity segment and our marketing and trading segment, gross margin refers to electric operating revenues less purchased power and fuel costs. Our real estate segment gross margin refers to real estate revenues less real estate operations costs of SunCor. Other gross margin refers to other operating revenues less other operating expenses, which primarily includes El Dorado's investment in NAC, which we began consolidating in our financial statements in July 2002. Other gross margin also includes amounts related to APS Energy Services' energy consulting services.
 
Operating Results  Three-month period ended December 31, 2003 compared with three-month period ended December 31, 2002
     Our consolidated net income for the three months ended December 31, 2003 was $49 million compared with a net loss of $81 million for the prior-year quarter. The 2002 net loss includes a $66 million after-tax charge for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting for trading activities due to the adoption of EITF 02-3. Excluding the accounting change, the $64 million increase in the period-to-period comparison reflects the following changes in earnings by segment:
     Additional details on the major factors that increased (decreased) income from continuing operations before income taxes and net income for the three months ended December 31, 2003 compared with the three months ended December 31, 2002 are contained in the table below (dollars in millions).
 
 
     The increase in operating and interest costs related to new power plants placed in service by Pinnacle West Energy, net of purchased power savings and increased gross margin from generation sales other than Native Load, totaled approximately $13 million after income taxes in the three months ended December 31, 2003 compared with the prior year period.
Regulated Electricity Segment Revenues
     Regulated electricity segment revenues were $26 million higher in the three months ended December 31, 2003 compared with the same period in the prior year, primarily as a result of:
Marketing and Trading Segment Revenues
     Marketing and trading segment revenues were $10 million lower in the three months ended December 31, 2003 compared with the same period in the prior year, primarily as a result of:
Real Estate Segment Revenues
     Real estate segment revenues were $115 million higher in the three months ended December 31, 2003 compared with the same period in the prior year primarily as a result of increased asset and land sales related to SunCor's effort to accelerate asset sales.
 
Other Revenues
     Other revenues were $12 million lower in the three months ended December 31, 2003 compared with the same period in the prior year primarily due to decreased sales activity at NAC and decreased APS Energy Services non-commodity sales activity.
Operating Results  Twelve-month period ended December 31, 2003 compared with twelve-month period ended December 31, 2002
     Our consolidated net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 was $241 million compared with $149 million for the prior year. The 2002 net income includes a $66 million after-tax charge for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting for trading activities due to the adoption of EITF 02-3. Excluding the accounting change, the $26 million increase in the period-to-period comparison reflects the following changes in earnings by segment:
     Additional details on the major factors that increased (decreased) income from continuing operations before income taxes and net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 compared with the twelve months ended December 31, 2002 are contained in the table below (dollars in millions).
 
     The increase in operating and interest costs related to new power plants placed in service by Pinnacle West Energy, net of purchased power savings and increased gross margin from generation sales other than Native Load, totaled approximately $30 million after income taxes in the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 compared with the prior-year period.
Regulated Electricity Segment Revenues
     Regulated electricity segment revenues were $88 million higher in the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 compared with the prior year, primarily as a result of:
 
Marketing and Trading Segment Revenues
     Marketing and trading segment revenues were $105 million higher in the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 compared with the prior year, primarily as a result of:
Real Estate Segment Revenues
     Real estate segment revenues were $161 million higher in the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 compared with the prior year primarily as a result of increased asset, land and home sales related to SunCor's effort to accelerate asset sales.
Other Revenues
     Other revenues were $24 million higher in the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 compared with the prior year primarily due to our consolidation of NAC's financial statements beginning in the third quarter of 2002, partially offset by decreased sales activity at NAC.
 
Real Estate Activities
     Certain components of SunCor's real estate sales activities, which are included in the real estate segment, are required to be reported as discontinued operations on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income in accordance with SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets." Among other guidance, SFAS No. 144 prescribes accounting for discontinued operations and defines certain activities as discontinued operations. We adopted SFAS No. 144 effective January 1, 2002 and determined that activities that would have required discontinued operations reporting in 2002, 2001 and 2000 were immaterial.
     In the first quarter of 2003, SunCor sold its water utility company, which resulted in an after-tax gain of $5 million ($8 million pretax). The amounts of the gain on the sale and operating income of the water utility company in the current and prior periods are classified as discontinued operations on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.
     In the second quarter of 2002, SunCor sold a retail center, but maintained a continuing involvement through a management contract. In the first quarter of 2003, this management contract was canceled. As a result, the after-tax gain of $6 million ($10 million pre-tax) recorded in operations in 2002 related to this property was reclassified as discontinued operations on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. The income from discontinued operations in the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2002 primarily reflects this sale.
     In the fourth quarter of 2003, SunCor sold a retail center, which resulted in an after-tax gain of $3 million ($5 million pretax). The gain on the sale and the operating income related to this property in the current period are classified as discontinued operations on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. There were no prior-year operations related to this retail center.

Exhibit 99.10
PHOENIX  Pinnacle West Capital Corporation (NYSE: PNW) today reported consolidated net income for the year 2003 of $240.6 million, or $2.63 per diluted share of common stock. This result compares with $149.4 million, or $1.76 per share, for the year 2002. Arizona Public Service (APS) reported net income for 2003 of $180.9 million, compared with $199.3 million for 2002. APS' on-going earnings were $168.7 million for 2003 versus $219.6 million for the prior year.
On-going consolidated earnings in 2003 were $223.4 million, or $2.44 per share, compared with $302.1 million, or $3.56 per share, for the prior year. On-going earnings exclude income tax credits related to prior years and recorded in 2003 of $17.2 million, or $0.19 per share; previously disclosed, non-recurring charges in 2002 totaling $87.0 million, or $1.03 per share; and a 2002 charge for the cumulative effect of an accounting change of $65.7 million, or $0.77 per share.
"Earnings for the year were in line with our guidance, and our operational performance and market area remained strong," said Chairman Bill Post, citing vibrant customer growth of 3.3 percent, about three times the national average. In addition, retail electricity consumption hit record levels, with the Company experiencing a 9 percent increase in its peak demand and a 5 percent increase in total retail kilowatt-hour sales.
Looking forward, Post said, "The Company needs to achieve a constructive regulatory outcome in our pending rate case to cover the costs of providing reliable service for our retail customers."
APS' on-going earnings exclude income tax credits related to prior years and recorded in 2003 of $12.2 million, and previously disclosed, non-recurring severance charges in 2002 of $20.3 million. These lower results were due to deterioration in the western wholesale power market; higher hedged natural gas and purchased power prices; retail electricity price decreases; and other operating cost increases necessary to meet the growing demand of retail customers, which were partially offset by the effects of higher retail sales due to customer growth and favorable weather. These higher costs  and the Company's investment in new power plants and other infrastructure  are currently under review by the Arizona Corporation Commission. A decision on their recovery in rates is anticipated before the end of 2004.
 
In addition to APS' earnings variances, Pinnacle West's consolidated results were impacted by deterioration in the western wholesale power markets; an increase in fixed costs related to placing new electricity-generating units into service in 2002 and 2003; and improved results from the Company's unregulated subsidiaries.
Consistent with its accelerated asset sales program for 2003-2005, SunCor Development Co., Pinnacle West's real estate subsidiary, delivered solid, on-plan performance, reporting 2003 net income of $56.1 million, compared with net income of $18.9 million for 2002.
For the 2003 fourth quarter, the Company reported consolidated net income of $49.1 million, or $0.54 per diluted share, compared with a net loss of $80.6 million, or $0.95 per share, in the comparable 2002 period. On-going consolidated earnings in the 2003 fourth quarter were $38.4 million, or $0.42 per share, compared with $44.5 million, or $0.52 per share. On-going earnings exclude income tax credits related to prior years and recorded in 2003 totaling $10.7 million, or $0.12 per share; previously disclosed, non-recurring charges in 2002's fourth quarter totaling $59.4 million, or $0.70 per share; and a 2002 charge for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting of $65.7 million, or $0.77 per share. In addition, fourth quarter earnings reflect an increase in SunCor's earnings of $29.4 million, or $0.33 per share, compared with the prior year's same period.
