EXHIBIT 99.8
PHOENIX  Pinnacle West Capital Corporation (NYSE: PNW) today reported consolidated net income for the quarter ended March 31, 2004, of $30.2 million, or $0.33 per diluted share of common stock. This result compares with net income of $25.3 million, or $0.28 per share, for the comparable quarter a year ago.
The improved results were positively impacted by higher retail sales volumes at Arizona Public Service (APS) due to customer growth and weather, which in 2004 included the hottest March on record. Compared with the first quarter a year ago, electricity consumption by APS retail customers increased 10.3 percent in 2004.
"The rapidly increasing demand for electricity in Arizona underscores the critical importance of staying ahead of the growing energy needs of our customers," said Chairman Bill Post. "Meeting that challenge requires tenacity and investment."
In addition to 3.4 percent customer growth (about three times the national average) and weather effects, the quarter-to-quarter comparison also was positively affected by lower regulatory asset amortization. These positive factors were partially offset by a net increase in costs related to placing a new electricity-generating unit into service in mid-2003; and replacement power costs related to unplanned power plant outages.
