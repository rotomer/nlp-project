Item 12. Results of Operations and Financial Condition
     Certain of the Information relates to the Company's results of operations for its fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2004. This Information is attached hereto as Exhibits 99.2, 99.3, and 99.7.
     On July 29, 2004, the Company issued a press release regarding its financial results for its fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2004. A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.9.
     The information in Exhibits 99.2, 99.3, 99.7 and 99.9 of this report relating to the Company's financial results for its fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2004 shall not be deemed to be "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") or otherwise subject to the liability of that section, and shall not be incorporated by reference into any registration statement or other document filed under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.
     Exhibit 99.9 to this report contains certain "non-GAAP financial measures," as defined in Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K of the Exchange Act. The non-GAAP financial measures, which we describe as "on-going earnings" and "on-going earnings per share," exclude the after-tax gain on the sale of our interest in the Phoenix Suns from consolidated net income. Exhibit 99.9 reconciles each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). We believe on-going earnings provide investors with a useful indicator of our results that is comparable among periods because it excludes the effects of unusual items that may occur on an irregular basis. Investors should note that these non-GAAP financial measures involve judgments by management, including whether an item is classified as an unusual item. We use on-going earnings, or similar concepts, to measure our performance internally in reports for management.

Exhibit 99.7
     This discussion explains the changes in our consolidated earnings for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2004 and 2003. Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2004 and 2003 follow this discussion. We will file our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2004 on or before August 9, 2004.

Other gross margin refers to other operating revenues less other operating expenses, which primarily includes El Dorado's investment in NAC and APS Energy Services' non-commodity services.

Exhibit 99.9
PHOENIX  Pinnacle West Capital Corporation (NYSE: PNW) today reported consolidated net income for the quarter ended June 30, 2004, of $71 million, or $0.78 per diluted share of common stock. This result compares with net income of $56 million, or $0.61 per diluted share, for the same quarter a year ago.
On-going consolidated earnings in the second quarter of 2004 were $50 million, or $0.55 per share, compared with $56 million, or $0.61 per share in the comparable 2003 quarter. On-going earnings exclude a gain of $21 million after income taxes, or $0.23 per share, from the second quarter 2004 sale of the Company's interest in the Phoenix Suns professional basketball team partnership.
On-going earnings were adversely impacted by new generating plants placed in service in 2003 and 2004 which have not been given rate treatment and higher replacement power costs due to unplanned plant outages.
"Operationally, we have dealt with several events this summer which have tested the strength of our system and our people" said Pinnacle West Chairman Bill Post. "Our people have performed admirably and decisions over the last few years to expand both our generation and transmission systems have allowed us to meet the state's growing demand."
