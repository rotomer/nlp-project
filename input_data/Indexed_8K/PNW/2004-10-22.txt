Exhibit 99.7
LAST UPDATE: 10-22-04
     This discussion explains the changes in our consolidated earnings for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2004 and 2003. Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2004 and 2003 follow this discussion. We will file our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2004 on or before November 9, 2004. We have reclassified certain prior period amounts to conform to our current period presentation. Additional operating and financial statistics and a glossary of terms are available on our website (www.pinnaclewest.com).
Earnings Contribution by Business Segment
     We have three principal business segments (determined by services and the regulatory environment):
     The following table summarizes net income by segment for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2004 and the comparable prior-year periods (dollars in millions):
 
General
     Throughout the following explanations of our results of operations, we refer to "gross margin." With respect to our regulated electricity segment and our marketing and trading segment, gross margin refers to electric operating revenues less purchased power and fuel costs. Our real estate segment gross margin refers to real estate revenues less real estate operations costs of SunCor.
     In accordance with the 1999 regulatory settlement approved by the Arizona Corporation Commission, we completed amortizing substantially all of our regulatory assets related to the 1999 Settlement Agreement as of June 30, 2004.
     Our consolidated net income for the three months ended September 30, 2004 was $105 million compared with $110 million for the prior-year period. The $5 million decrease in the period-to-period comparison reflects the following changes in earnings by segment:
     Additional details on the major factors that increased (decreased) net income are contained in the following table (dollars in millions).
 
     The increase in net costs (primarily interest expense, depreciation and operations and maintenance expense, net of gross margin contributions) related to new power plants placed in service in mid-2003 and mid-2004 by Pinnacle West Energy totaled approximately $6 million after income taxes in the three months ended September 30, 2004, compared with the prior-year period.
 
Regulated Electricity Segment Revenues
     Regulated electricity segment revenues were $3 million higher for the three months ended September 30, 2004 compared with the prior-year period, primarily as a result of:
Marketing and Trading Segment Revenues
     Marketing and trading segment revenues were $46 million higher for the three months ended September 30, 2004 compared with the prior-year period, primarily as a result of:
Other Revenues
     Other revenues were $7 million higher for the three months ended September 30, 2004 compared with the prior year period primarily due to higher non-commodity revenues at APS Energy Services.
     Our consolidated net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2004 was $209 million compared with $191 million for the prior-year period. The $18 million increase in the period-to-period comparison reflects the following changes in earnings by segment:
 
     Additional details on the major factors that increased (decreased) income from continuing operations and net income are contained in the following table (dollars in millions).
 
     The increase in net costs (primarily interest expense, depreciation and operations and maintenance expense, net of gross margin contributions) related to new power plants placed in service in mid-2003 and mid-2004 by Pinnacle West Energy totaled approximately $21 million after income taxes in the nine months ended September 30, 2004, compared with the prior-year period.
 
Regulated Electricity Segment Revenues
     Regulated electricity segment revenues were $60 million higher for the nine months ended September 30, 2004 compared with the prior-year period, primarily as a result of:
Marketing and Trading Segment Revenues
     Marketing and trading segment revenues were $31 million higher for the nine months ended September 30, 2004 compared with the prior-year period, primarily as a result of:
Real Estate Segment Revenues
     Real estate segment revenues were $21 million higher for the nine months ended September 30, 2004 compared with the prior year period primarily as a result of increased home and commercial property sales partially offset by decreased land sales.
Other Revenues
     Other revenues were $16 million higher for the nine months ended September 30, 2004 compared with the prior year period primarily due to higher non-commodity revenues at APS Energy Services.
 
Discontinued Operations
     In 2003, SunCor sold its water utility company. The amounts of the gain on the sale and operating income of the water utility company are classified as discontinued operations on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2004 and 2003.
     In July 2004, we entered into an agreement to sell our investment in NAC Holding Inc. and NAC International Inc. (NAC). The transaction is expected to close later this year and result in an after-tax gain of approximately $6 million, which will be classified as discontinued operations. Due to the pending sale of NAC, all revenues and expenses for NAC have been reclassified to discontinued operations for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2004 and 2003 on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.
     The following chart provides a summary of SunCor and NAC income from discontinued operations (after income taxes) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2004 and the comparable prior periods (dollars in millions):

Exhibit 99.9
PHOENIX  Pinnacle West Capital Corp. (NYSE: PNW) today reported consolidated net income for the quarter ended September 30, 2004, of $105.4 million, or $1.15 per diluted share of common stock. This result compares with consolidated net income of $110.0 million, or $1.20 per diluted share, for the same period in 2003.
"Our results reflect milder weather and rising costs necessary to meet Arizona's growing energy needs," said Chairman Bill Post, citing customer growth that is three times the national average. "With an eye to the future, we remain focused on achieving regulatory treatment that covers the costs of providing reliable service for our retail customers."
The decrease in quarter-to-quarter earnings was primarily the result of hotter-than-normal weather in the 2003 summer period; a net increase in costs related to new electricity generating units placed into service in mid-2003 and mid-2004; an increase in customer service and other operating costs; and higher fuel and purchased power prices.
These factors were partially offset by lower replacement power costs due to fewer unplanned power plant outages; improved wholesale power marketing results; the absence of regulatory asset amortization; and higher retail sales volumes due to customer growth of 3.9 percent during the 2004 third quarter.
For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2004, Pinnacle West's consolidated net income was $209.5 million, or $2.29 per diluted share of common stock. This result compares with consolidated net income of $191.5 million, or $2.09 per diluted share, in last year's corresponding period.

This press release contains forward-looking statements based on current expectations, and the Company assumes no obligation to update these statements or make any further statements on any of these issues, except as required by applicable law. These forward-looking statements are often identified by words such as "hope," "may," "believe," "anticipate," "plan," "expect," "require," "intend," "assume," and similar words. Because actual results may differ materially from expectations, the Company cautions readers not to place undue reliance on these statements. A number of factors could cause future results to differ materially from historical results, or from results or outcomes currently expected or sought by the Company. These factors include the ongoing restructuring of the electric industry, including the introduction of retail electric competition in Arizona and decisions impacting wholesale competition; the outcome of regulatory and legislative proceedings relating to the restructuring; state and federal regulatory and legislative decisions and actions, including the outcome of the rate case APS filed with the Arizona Corporation Commission on June 27, 2003 and the wholesale electric price mitigation plan adopted by the FERC; regional economic and market conditions, including the results of litigation and other proceedings resulting from the California energy situation, volatile purchased power and fuel costs, and the completion of generation and transmission construction in the region, which could affect customer growth and the cost of power supplies; the cost of debt and equity capital and access to capital markets; energy usage; weather variations affecting local and regional customer energy usage; conservation programs; power plant performance; the successful completion of our generation construction program; regulatory issues associated with generation construction , such as permitting and licensing; changes in accounting principles; our ability to compete successfully outside traditional regulated markets (including the wholesale market);our ability to manage our marketing and trading activities and the use of derivative contracts in our business (including the interpretation of the subjective and complex accounting rules related to these contracts); technological developments in the electric industry; the performance of the stock market, which affects the amount of our required contributions to our pension plan and nuclear decommissioning trust funds; the strength of the real estate market in SunCor's market areas, which include Arizona, New Mexico and Utah; and other uncertainties, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control.
