Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition
     Certain of the Information referenced in Item 7.01 below relates to Pinnacle West Capital Corporation's (the "Company") results of operations for its fiscal quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2004. This Information is attached hereto as Exhibits 99.2, 99.3, and 99.7.
     On January 28, 2005, the Company issued a press release regarding its financial results for its fiscal quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2004. A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.9.
     The information being furnished pursuant to this Item 2.02 and in Exhibits 99.2, 99.3, 99.7 and 99.9 of this report relating to the Company's financial results for its fiscal quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2004 shall not be deemed to be "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") or otherwise subject to the liability of that Section, and shall not be incorporated by reference into any registration statement or other document filed under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.
     Exhibit 99.9 to this report contains certain "non-GAAP financial measures," as defined in Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K of the Exchange Act. We describe these non-GAAP financial measures as "on-going earnings" and "on-going earnings per share." Exhibit 99.9 reconciles each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). We believe on-going earnings provide investors with a useful indicator of our results that is comparable among periods because it excludes the effects of unusual items that may occur on an irregular basis. Investors should note that these non-GAAP financial measures involve judgments by management, including whether an item is classified as an unusual item. We use on-going earnings, or similar concepts, to measure our performance internally in reports for management.
Item 7.01. Regulation FD Disclosure
     The Company is providing quarterly consolidated statistical summaries, earnings variance explanations, and a glossary of relevant terms (collectively, "Information") to help interested parties better understand its business (see Exhibits 99.1, 99.2, 99.3, 99.4, 99.5, 99.6, 99.7, and 99.8). This Information is concurrently being posted to the Company's website at . The Information may not represent all of the factors that could affect the Company's operating or financial results for various periods. Some of the Information is preliminary in nature and could be subject to significant adjustment. Some of the Information is based on information received from third parties and may contain inaccuracies. The Company is not responsible for any such inaccuracies. Although the Company may update or correct the Information if it is aware that such Information has been revised or is inaccurate, the Company assumes no obligation to update or correct the Information and reserves the right to discontinue the provision of all or any portion of the Information at any time or to change the type of Information provided. The Information being furnished pursuant to this Item 7.01 and in

Exhibits 99.1, 99.2, 99.3, 99.4, 99.5, 99.6, 99.7, and 99.8 shall not be deemed to be "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Exchange Act or otherwise subject to the liability of that Section.
Item 8.01. Other Events
Earnings Outlook
     In June 2003, Arizona Public Service Company ("APS") filed a general rate case with the Arizona Corporation Commission (the "ACC"). In August 2004, APS and a substantial majority of the parties to the rate case entered into an agreement that proposes terms under which the rate case would be settled (the "2004 Settlement Agreement"). The key financial components of the 2004 Settlement Agreement are described in Note 5 to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, "Regulatory Matters," in the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2004. We are unable to predict whether the ACC will approve the 2004 Settlement Agreement as proposed or the exact timing when the ACC will consider the 2004 Settlement Agreement.
     If the ACC were to approve the 2004 Settlement Agreement as proposed and the provisions of the settlement were to become effective on March 31, 2005, we estimate that 2005 earnings will be within a reasonable range around $3.00 per diluted share before the regulatory disallowance proposed in the settlement. This estimate also assumes that SunCor Development Company will report 2005 net income of approximately $50 million, or $0.55 per share.
     This earnings guidance supersedes all previous earnings guidance provided by the Company, is forward-looking information, and actual results may differ materially from our expectations. See "Forward-Looking Statements" below.
ACC Order Regarding Sundance Plant
     On January 20, 2005, the ACC issued an order related to APS' proposed acquisition of the 450 megawatt Sundance power plant (the "Sundance Plant") from PPL Sundance Energy, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of PPL Corporation. See Note 5 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company's Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2004 and Item 1.01 of the Company's Report on Form 8-K filed December 20, 2004 for additional information about the proposed acquisition. The ACC order confirmed APS' authority to "self-build or buy new generation assets for native load" and stated that APS' acquisition of the Sundance Plant would be a proper purpose under APS' existing ACC financing authorizations.
     APS' filings with the ACC also had requested that the ACC allow APS to defer for future recovery certain capital and operating costs (net of fuel and purchased power savings) associated with the Sundance Plant acquisition until rate treatment for the Sundance Plant could be considered in APS' next general rate case. APS' filings estimated that the deferrals would be approximately $10 million to $15 million before income taxes on an annualized basis. The order issued by the ACC allows APS to record the deferrals for up to 36 months, subject to a number of conditions. However, if APS has a general rate case pending at the end of the 36-month period, the deferral period could extend until the rate case had been decided. The conditions imposed by the order are expected to substantially limit the amount of deferrals that APS will be able to record.
     APS' acquisition of the Sundance Plant is subject to Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approval and to customary closing conditions. The transaction is targeted to close in the spring of 2005.
Forward-Looking Statements
     This Report on Form 8-K contains forward-looking statements based on current expectations, and we assume no obligation to update these statements or make any further statements on any of these issues, except as required by applicable law.

EXHIBIT 99.7
     This discussion explains the changes in our consolidated earnings for the three-month and twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2004 and 2003. Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income for the three months and twelve months ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 follow this discussion. We will file our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2004 on or before March 16, 2005. We have reclassified certain prior-period amounts to conform to our current period presentation. Additional operating and financial statistics and a glossary of terms are available on our website .
(www.pinnaclewest.com)
Earnings Contribution by Business Segment
     We have three principal business segments (determined by services and the regulatory environment):
     The following table summarizes net income by segment for the three months and twelve months ended December 31, 2004 and the comparable prior-year periods (dollars in millions):
 
General
     Throughout the following explanations of our results of operations, we refer to "gross margin." With respect to our regulated electricity segment and our marketing and trading segment, gross margin refers to electric operating revenues less purchased power and fuel costs. Our real estate segment gross margin refers to real estate revenues less real estate operations costs of SunCor. "Gross margin" is a "non-GAAP financial measure," as defined in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission rules. We view gross margin as an important performance measure of the core profitability of our operations. This measure is a key component of our internal financial reporting and is used by our management in analyzing our business segments. We believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that our management uses.
     As of June 30, 2004, we completed amortization of our regulatory assets related to a 1999 regulatory settlement approved by the Arizona Corporation Commission.
Operating Results  Three-month period ended December 31, 2004 compared with the three-month period ended December 31, 2003
     Our consolidated net income for the three months ended December 31, 2004 was $34 million compared with $49 million for the prior-year period. The $15 million decrease in the period-to-period comparison reflected the following changes in earnings by segment:
 
     Additional details on the major factors that increased (decreased) net income are contained in the following table (dollars in millions).
     The increase in net costs (primarily net interest expense, depreciation and operations and maintenance expense) related to a new power plant placed in service in mid-2004 by Pinnacle West Energy totaled approximately $6 million after income taxes in the three months ended December 31, 2004 compared with the prior-year period.
Regulated Electricity Segment Revenues
     Regulated electricity segment revenues were $3 million lower for the three months ended December 31, 2004 compared with the prior-year period primarily as a result of:
 
Marketing and Trading Segment Revenues
     Marketing and trading segment revenues were $38 million higher for the three months ended December 31, 2004 compared with the prior-year period primarily as a result of:
Real Estate Revenues
     Real estate revenues were $23 million lower for the three months ended December 31, 2004 compared with the prior year period primarily due to decreased asset sales partially offset by increased land sales.
Operating Results  Twelve-month period ended December 31, 2004 compared with the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2003
     Our consolidated net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 was $243 million compared with $241 million for the prior-year period. The $2 million increase in the period-to-period comparison reflected the following changes in earnings by segment:
 
 
     Additional details on the major factors that increased (decreased) income from continuing operations and net income are contained in the following table (dollars in millions).
     The increase in net costs (primarily interest expense, depreciation and operations and maintenance expense, net of gross margin contributions) related to new power plants placed in service in mid-2003 and mid-2004 by Pinnacle West Energy totaled approximately $26 million after income taxes in the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 compared with the prior-year period.
 
Regulated Electricity Segment Revenues
     Regulated electricity segment revenues were $57 million higher for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 compared with the prior-year period primarily as a result of:
Marketing and Trading Segment Revenues
     Marketing and trading segment revenues were $70 million higher for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 compared with the prior-year period primarily as a result of:
Other Revenues
     Other revenues were $15 million higher for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 compared with the prior-year period primarily due to higher non-commodity revenues at APS Energy Services.
 
Discontinued Operations
     In 2003, SunCor sold its water utility company, which resulted in an after-tax gain of $8 million ($14 million pretax). The amounts of the gain on the sale and operating income of the water utility company are classified as discontinued operations on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.
     In the fourth quarter of 2003, SunCor sold a retail center, which resulted in an after-tax gain of $2 million ($3 million pretax). The gain on the sale and the operating income related to this property in 2003 are classified as discontinued operations on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.
     In November 2004, we sold our investment in NAC Holding Inc. and NAC International Inc. ("NAC"). The transaction resulted in an after-tax gain of approximately $2 million and is classified as discontinued operations. All revenues and expenses for NAC have been reclassified to discontinued operations on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.
     The following chart provides a summary of SunCor and NAC income from discontinued operations (after income taxes) for the three months and twelve months ended December 31, 2004 and the comparable prior periods (dollars in millions):

EXHIBIT 99.9
PHOENIX  Pinnacle West Capital Corporation (NYSE: PNW) today reported consolidated net income for the year 2004 of $243.2 million, or $2.66 per diluted share of common stock. This result compares with $240.6 million, or $2.63 per share, for the year 2003.
On-going consolidated earnings in 2004 were $218.3 million, or $2.39 per share, compared with $218.6 million, or $2.39 per share, for the prior year. On-going earnings for 2004 exclude income after income taxes of $24.9 million, or $0.27 per share, related to the sale of the Company's interests in the Phoenix Suns professional basketball team and NAC International. For 2003, on-going earnings exclude income tax credits related to prior years and recorded in 2003 of $17.2 million, or $0.19 per share, and income after income taxes of $4.8 million, or $0.05 per share, related to NAC International.
"Our employees' steadfast focus on customer satisfaction and operational excellence has allowed us to reliably serve one of the fastest growing markets in the U.S.," said Chairman Bill Post. "Our fundamental growth provides a solid foundation for long-term performance."
Post said that in 2005, resolution of the Company's pending rate case is the top priority. "As Arizona's economy continues to surge, it's more important than ever for us to achieve a constructive regulatory outcome that recognizes our infrastructure investments and covers the costs of providing reliable service for our fast-growing customer base."
In 2004, APS set more meters than in any other year in the Company's 118-year history. More than 40,000 meters were installed, reflecting retail customer growth rate of about 4 percent, more than three times the U.S. average.
The year-to-year comparison was favorably affected by higher retail sales volumes; lower regulatory asset amortization; and improved wholesale power marketing results.
These favorable factors were substantially offset by a net increase in costs related to new plants placed into service in 2003 and 2004; an increase in customer service and other operating costs; an increase in depreciation for delivery and other assets; the effects of milder weather in 2004 versus 2003; a retail rate decrease in mid-2003; and, as previously forecast, lower contributions from the Company's unregulated operations.
 
APS reported net income for 2004 of $199.6 million, compared with $180.9 million for 2003. SunCor Development Co., Pinnacle West's real estate subsidiary, delivered solid performance, reporting 2004 net income of $44.7 million, compared with its net contribution of $56.1 million in 2003. APS Energy Services, the Company's competitive retail energy subsidiary, reported net income of $2.9 million for 2004, compared with $16.0 million in 2003, reflecting the dynamics of California's competitive energy market.
For the 2004 fourth quarter, the Company reported consolidated net income of $33.7 million, or $0.37 per diluted share of common stock. This result compares with consolidated net income of $49.1 million, or $0.54 per share, in last year's corresponding period. On-going consolidated earnings in the 2004 fourth quarter, excluding the sale of NAC, were $31.0 million, or $0.34 per share, compared with $37.5 million, or $0.41 per share. On-going earnings for 2003's fourth quarter exclude $11.6 million, or $0.13 per share, related to NAC and income tax credits for prior years and recorded in 2003's fourth quarter.
All dollar amounts included in this release are reported after income tax effects. For more information on Pinnacle West's operating statistics and earnings, please visit .
