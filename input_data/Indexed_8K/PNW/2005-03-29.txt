APS General Rate Case; 2004 Settlement Agreement
     On March 28, 2005, the ACC voted to approve the recommended order of the ACC administrative law judge in APS' general rate case with certain modifications. For additional information regarding the rate case, see "APS General Rate Case; 2004 Settlement Agreement" in Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2004 Form 10-K and "Recommended Order in APS General Rate Case" in Item 8.01 of the March 1 Form 8-K. The primary modifications to the recommended order are:
     As a result of the ACC's approval, the provisions of the 2004 Settlement Agreement, including an annual retail rate increase of approximately 4.21%, will become effective on April 1, 2005. This increase does not include the impact of the PSA, which is estimated to be 5% in 2006. These increases could be further impacted if the ACC approves additional surcharges. The acquisition by APS of the PWEC Dedicated Assets from Pinnacle West Energy Corporation is subject to approval by the FERC.
