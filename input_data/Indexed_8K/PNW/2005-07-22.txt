ITEM 8.01 OTHER EVENTS
Application for Surcharge Under Power Supply Adjuster
     On July 22, 2005, Arizona Public Service Company ("APS") filed an Application for Surcharge with the Arizona Corporation Commission (the "ACC") requesting recovery of $100 million in deferred fuel and purchased power costs under the power supply adjuster ("PSA") approved by the ACC in APS' recent general rate case. See "APS General Rate Case" in Note 5 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Pinnacle West Capital Corporation's and APS' Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2005 for additional information regarding the general rate case and the PSA.
     As required by the ACC order approving the PSA, APS filed the Application for Surcharge after the PSA "bank balance" reached $50 million and before it reached $100 million, which APS expects to occur by mid-August of this year. APS proposes to recover $100 million of the PSA bank balance over a 24-month period beginning with billing cycle one of November 2005. The requested PSA surcharge represents an approximate 2.2% temporary increase in overall APS annual retail revenues.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, each registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
