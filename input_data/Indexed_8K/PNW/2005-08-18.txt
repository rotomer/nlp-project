Although such counsel does not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus and has not independently verified any of such statements except as stated in such opinion, such counsel has no reason to believe that (1) any part of the Registration Statement, when the Company filed its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K or on the effective date of the Registration Statement or the effective date of any post-effective amendment thereto, whichever is later, other than financial statements and schedules, and other financial, statistical or accounting data included or incorporated by reference therein or omitted therefrom, as to which such counsel need express no opinion, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material factrequired to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, not misleading, or (2) the Prospectus, as of the date of the Prospectus Supplement and at the Closing Date, other than financial statements and schedules, and other financial, statistical or accounting data included or incorporated by reference therein or omitted therefrom, as to which such counsel need express no opinion, contained or contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading; and to the knowledge of such counsel there are no legal or governmental proceedings required to be described in the Prospectus that are not described as required, nor any contracts or documents of a character required to be described in the Registration Statement or Prospectus or to be filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement that are not described and filed as required (it being understood that such counsel need express no opinion as to the statements of eligibility and qualification of the trustee under the Indenture);
,
          (vii) This Agreement and the Terms Agreement have been duly authorized, executed, and delivered by the Company;
 
          (viii) The Company is not and, after giving effect to the offering and sale of the Purchased Securities, will not be an "investment company" or an entity "controlled" by an "investment company", as such terms are defined in the 1940 Act; and
          (ix) Neither the execution nor delivery by the Company of this Agreement or the Terms Agreement, nor the consummation by the Company of the transactions therein contemplated, nor the fulfillment by the Company of the terms, conditions or provisions thereof (1) violates or results in a breach of any law, administrative regulation or, to the knowledge of such counsel, court decree applicable to the Company, (2) contravenes or constitutes a default under any of the terms, conditions or provisions of the Articles of Incorporation or by-laws of the Company or of any material agreement or instrument listed in a certificate provided by the Company, to which the Company is a party or by which it is bound, or (3) will result in the creation or imposition of any lien, charge or encumbrance of any nature whatsoever upon any of the properties or assets of the Company, except as contemplated therein; and
     Whenever the opinions required by this Agreement are stated to be "to the knowledge of such counsel" or "to such counsel's knowledge", such statements are intended to signify that those attorneys in the firm responsible for preparing the opinion or who have given substantive attention to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, after consultation with such other attorneys in such firm who have worked on legal matters related to the Company and its subsidiaries as they considered appropriate, do not have current actual knowledge of the inaccuracy of such statement. However, except where expressly stated otherwise, such counsel need not undertake any special or independent investigation to determine the existence or absence of such facts, and no inference as to such counsel's knowledge of the existence or absence of such facts should be drawn from its representation of the Company in connection with this transaction or otherwise.
     In giving such opinion, Snell & Wilmer L.L.P. may rely to the extent such counsel deems appropriate upon certificates of the Company as to any factual matters upon which any such opinions are based and may rely upon the opinion of Keleher & McLeod, P.A., referred to below, as to all matters governed by the laws of the State of New Mexico, and may rely on the opinion of Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP, counsel for the Underwriters, as to all matters governed by the law of the State of New York, and further may rely upon the opinion of Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP, delivered to you at the Closing Date, as to all matters under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended, and the Federal Power Act, as amended.
     (e) The Underwriters shall have received evidence that the Purchased Securities have been rated Baa1 or higher by Moody's Investors Service and BBB or higher by Standard & Poor's Corporation.
     (f) The Underwriters shall have received an opinion of Keleher & McLeod, P.A., New Mexico counsel for the Company, dated the Closing Date, to the effect that:
          (i) The Company is duly qualified as a foreign corporation to do business and is in good standing in the State of New Mexico and has full corporate power and authority to engage in the State of New Mexico in the business now conducted by it therein; and
 
          (ii) The activities of the Company in the State of New Mexico to date do not constitute it a "public utility" as that term is defined in the relevant laws of the State of New Mexico, and accordingly, no public utility franchises or certificates of convenience and necessity are necessary under New Mexico law with respect to the maintenance and operation of the Company's property and business as now conducted in the State of New Mexico and no approval, authorization, or consent of the New Mexico Public Regulation Commission or any other public board or body of the State of New Mexico is required for the issuance and sale of the Purchased Securities on the terms and conditions herein and in the Prospectus set forth or contemplated or for the execution of the Supplemental Indenture relating to the Purchased Securities, except as may be required under New Mexico state securities or blue sky laws, as to which laws such counsel shall not be required to express an opinion.
     In giving such opinion, Keleher & McLeod, P.A. may rely to the extent such counsel deems appropriate upon certificates of the Company as to any factual matters upon which any such opinions are based and may rely upon the certificates of public officials concerning the legal existence and good standing of the Company.
     (g) The Underwriters shall have received from Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP, counsel for the Underwriters, an opinion or opinions, dated the Closing Date, with respect to such matters as they may reasonably require and the Company shall have furnished to such counsel such documents as they request for the purpose of enabling them to pass upon such matters In rendering such opinion, such counsel may rely as to the incorporation of the Company and all matters governed by the laws of the States of Arizona and New Mexico upon the opinions of Snell & Wilmer L.L.P. and Keleher & McLeod, P.A., referred to above.
     (h) The Underwriters shall have received a certificate of the President or any Vice President and a principal financial or accounting officer of the Company, dated the Closing Date, in which such officers, to the best of their knowledge after reasonable investigation, shall state that the representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement are true and correct, that the Company has complied with all agreements and satisfied all conditions on its part to be performed or satisfied at or prior to such Closing Date, that no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or are contemplated by the Commission, and that, subsequent to the date of the most recent financial statements in the Prospectus, there has been no material adverse change in the financial position or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, except as set forth or contemplated in the Prospectus or as described in such certificate.
     (i) The Underwriters shall have received a letter of Deloitte & Touche LLP, dated the Closing Date, which meets the requirements of subsection (a) of this Section, except that the specified date referred to in such subsection will be a date not more than five days prior to the Closing Date for the purposes of this subsection.
     The Company will furnish the Underwriters with such conformed copies of such opinions, certificates, letters, and documents as may be reasonably requested.
 
     6. .
Indemnification
     (a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, its directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls such Underwriter within the meaning of the Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter or such controlling person may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages, or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in any part of the Registration Statement relating to the Securities, when such part became effective, any preliminary prospectus relating the Securities, the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, not misleading; and will reimburse each Underwriter and each such controlling person for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter or such controlling person, as incurred, in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability, or action; provided, however, that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage, or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in any of such documents in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for use therein and provided, further, that with respect to any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement in or omission or alleged omission from any preliminary prospectus relating to the Securities or the Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, the indemnity agreement contained in this subsection (a) shall not inure to the benefit of any Underwriter from whom the person asserting any such losses, claims, damages or liabilities purchased the Securities concerned, insofar as such indemnity relates to an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement in or omission or alleged omission from any preliminary prospectus relating to the Securities or the Prospectus, but eliminated or remedied prior to the consummation of such sale in the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, furnished on a timely basis by the Company to the Underwriters, unless a copy of the Prospectus (in the case of such a statement or omission made in such preliminary prospectus) or such amendment or supplement (in the case of such a statement or omission made in the Prospectus) (excluding, however, any document then incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference in the Prospectus or such amendment or supplement) is furnished, if legally required to be furnished, by such Underwriter to such person (i) with or prior to the written confirmation of the sale involved or (ii) as soon as available after such written confirmation (if it is made available on a timely basis to the Underwriters prior to settlement of such sale). This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have.
     (b) Each Underwriter will severally indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who have signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act, against any losses, claims, damages, or liabilities to which the Company or any such director, officer, or controlling person may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages, or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in any part of the Registration Statement relating to the Securities, when such part became effective, any preliminary prospectus relating to the Securities, the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or the alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the
 
extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for use therein; and will reimburse any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred, as incurred, by the Company or any such director, officer, or controlling person in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability, or action. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which such Underwriter may otherwise have.
     (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against an indemnifying party under this Section, notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof; but the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have under subsection (a) or (b) above except to the extent that it has been materially prejudiced (including through the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses) by such failure; and provided further that the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to an indemnified party otherwise than under subsection (a) or (b) above. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it may wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, without the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its assumption of the defense thereof, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in respect of the legal expenses of any indemnified party in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified parties. Such firm shall be designated in writing by the Representatives, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 6(a) above, and by the Company, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 6(b) above. An indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of a claim or action effected without its written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.
 
     (d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any loss, claim, damage, liability, or action described in subsection (a) or (b) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in subsection (a) or (b) above on the following basis: (i) if such loss, claim, damage, liability, or action arises under subsection (a) above, then (A) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities or (B) if the allocation provided by clause (A) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (A) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities as well as any other relevant equitable considerations; and (ii) if such loss, claim, damage, liability, or action arises under subsection (b) above, then in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriter on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. For the purposes of clause (i) above, the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters. For the purposes of clauses (i) and (ii) above, the relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Company and each of the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in the first sentence of this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim which is the subject of this subsection (d). Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.
 
     7. . If any Underwriter or Underwriters default in their obligations to purchase Purchased Securities pursuant to this Agreement and the Terms Agreement and the principal amount of Purchased Securities that such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase is ten percent (10%) or less of the principal amount of Purchased Securities to which such Terms Agreement relates, the Representatives or, if there are no Representatives, the Underwriters, may make arrangements satisfactory to the Company for the purchase of such Purchased Securities by other persons, including any of the Underwriters, but if no such arrangements are made by the Closing Date the non-defaulting Underwriters shall be obligated severally, in proportion to their respective commitments hereunder and under such Terms Agreement, to purchase the Purchased Securities that such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase. If any Underwriter or Underwriters so default and the aggregate principal amount of Purchased Securities with respect to which such default or defaults occur is more than the above-described amount and arrangements satisfactory to the remaining Underwriters and the Company for the purchase of such Purchased Securities by other persons are not made within thirty-six hours after such default, the Terms Agreement will terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except as provided in Section 8. As used in this Agreement, the term "Underwriter" includes any person substituted for an Underwriter under this Section. Nothing herein will relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
Default of Underwriters; Termination by Underwriters
     If this Agreement shall be terminated by the Underwriters because of any failure or refusal on the part of the Company to comply with the terms or to fulfill any of the conditions of this Agreement, or if for any reason the Company shall be unable to perform its obligations under this Agreement, the Company shall not be liable to any Underwriter or to any member of any selling group for the loss of anticipated profits from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. However, in such an event, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters for all out of pocket expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of their counsel) reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in connection with this Agreement and the offering contemplated hereunder; provided, however, that if the Purchased Securities are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company solely as a result of the failure to satisfy the condition set forth in Section 5(c) hereof, the Company shall have no liability to the Underwriters except as provided in Sections 4(h) and 6 of this Agreement.
     8. . The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties, and other statements of the Company or its officers and of the Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation, or statement as to the results thereof, made by or on behalf of the Underwriters or the Company or any of its officers or directors or any controlling person, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Purchased Securities. If any Terms Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 7, or if for any reason a purchase pursuant to any Terms Agreement is not consummated, the Company shall remain responsible for the expenses to be paid or reimbursed by it pursuant to Section 4 and the respective obligations of the Company and the Underwriters pursuant to Section 6 shall remain in effect.
