Power Supply Adjustor
     As previously reported, on July 22, 2005, Arizona Public Service Company ("APS") filed an Application for Surcharge with the Arizona Corporation Commission (the "ACC") requesting recovery through a surcharge of $100 million in deferred purchased power and fuel costs under the power supply adjustor ("PSA") approved by the ACC in APS' recent general rate case settlement. In its application, APS proposed to recover $100 million of the PSA "bank balance" over a 24-month period beginning in November 2005.
     Although a procedural order setting a hearing date in this matter has not yet been issued, the ACC staff filed a proposed procedural schedule with the ACC indicating that the ACC staff, APS and the Residential Utility Consumer Office have agreed upon an approach to limit issues and permit the timely implementation of the surcharge consistent with an adjustment mechanism. Under the proposal, APS would withdraw from its surcharge application, without prejudice, $20 million, which represents an estimate of replacement power costs associated with unplanned outages at the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station between April 1, 2005 and July 31, 2005. APS would seek full recovery of these expenses in a later proceeding in which the prudence of the expenses would be reviewed. Under ACC regulations, expenses are presumed to have been prudently incurred and this presumption may be set aside only by clear and convincing evidence that the expenses were unreasonable, dishonest, or obviously wasteful. APS believes these expenses were prudently incurred and are therefore recoverable.
     If the proposed procedural schedule is approved, the hearing would commence on October 27, 2005 and APS would be requesting recovery of $80 million of deferred purchased power and fuel costs over a 24-month period beginning at year end. At August 31, 2005, APS' deferred purchased power and fuel costs were approximately $117 million, including the $80 million of deferred costs that would be subject to the pending surcharge application.
