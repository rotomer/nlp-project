Item 8.01 Other Events
     On October 11, 2005, Arizona Public Service Company ("APS") plant engineers at the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station ("Palo Verde") were unable to demonstrate that the original design of the emergency core cooling system could perform its safety function under certain scenarios. The type of event that could be affected by the design issue is among the least probable events that could occur in a nuclear power plant. In accordance with technical specifications, Palo Verde Units 2 and 3 were temporarily shut down. APS had taken Palo Verde Unit 1 out of service on October 8, 2005 for a planned refueling and maintenance outage expected to last about 75 days.
     APS is currently developing the necessary plant and procedural remedies that will address the issue that required Units 2 and 3 to be shut down. Upon Nuclear Regulatory Commission approval of these remedies, Units 2 and 3 will be restarted and return to service. Unit 1 will return to service after the successful completion of its planned refueling and maintenance outage.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, each registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
