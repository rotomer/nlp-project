Item 8.01 Other Events
Power Supply Adjustor Order
On January 25, 2006, the Arizona Corporation Commission (the "ACC") voted to approve, with certain modifications, the recommended order of the ACC administrative law judge in connection with the $80 million surcharge application filed by Arizona Public Service Company ("APS") in July 2005. The approved order modifies APS' Power Supply Adjustor ("PSA") as follows:
The approved order denies APS' pending $80 million surcharge application solely on the procedural basis that it was premature.
As of December 31, 2005, APS' pretax accumulated PSA deferrals totaled $173 million, including interest.
See Note 5 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in the Pinnacle West Capital Corporation ("Pinnacle West")/APS Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2005, Item 8.01 of the Pinnacle West/APS Current Report on Form 8-K filed December 6, 2005, Item 8.01 of the Pinnacle West/APS Current Report on Form 8-K filed on January 5, 2006, and Item 8.01 of the Pinnacle West/APS Current Report on Form 8-K filed January 9, 2006 for additional information regarding the PSA, APS' general rate case, the recommended order and APS' emergency interim rate case.
Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station
APS has been operating Unit 1 of the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station at reduced power levels since December 25, 2005 due to a non-safety related acoustic impact in one of the unit's shutdown cooling lines. Unit 1 is currently operating at approximately 25% power. APS is in the process of formulating potential remedies to the issue. APS estimates that, to date, Unit 1's reduced output has resulted in incremental replacement power costs of less than $10 million after income taxes.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, each registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
