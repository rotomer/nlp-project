Item 8.01 Other Events
General Rate Case
     On January 31, 2006, Arizona Public Service Company ("APS") filed with the Arizona Corporation Commission (the "ACC") updated financial schedules, testimony and other data in the general rate case that APS filed on November 4, 2005. As requested by the ACC staff, the updated information uses the twelve months ended September 30, 2005 as the test period instead of the test year ended December 31, 2004 used in APS' original filing. As a result of the updated filing, APS is requesting a 21.3%, or $453.9 million, increase in its annual retail electricity revenues effective no later than December 31, 2006. The original filing requested a 19.9%, or $409.1 million, retail rate increase.
     The updated requested rate increase is necessary to recover the following increased costs (dollars in millions):
Table of Contents
     The request is based on (a) a rate base of $4.4 billion, which approximates the ACC-jurisdictional portion of the book value of utility plant, net of accumulated depreciation, as of September 30, 2005; (b) a base rate for fuel and purchased power costs of $0.031904 per kilowatt-hour based on estimated 2006 prices; and (c) a proposed capital structure of 45% long-term debt and 55% common stock equity, with a weighted-average cost of capital of 8.73% (5.41% for long-term debt and 11.50% for common stock equity). As noted in the above chart, the requested increase in annual retail electricity revenues from the original filing is based solely on increased fuel and purchased power costs. If the ACC approves the requested base rate increase for fuel and purchased power costs (see clause (b) of this paragraph), subsequent power supply adjustor ("PSA") rate adjustments and/or PSA surcharges would be reduced because such costs would otherwise be eligible for recovery in the future under APS' PSA.
     The other primary components of the updated request remain unchanged from APS' November 4, 2005 original rate case filing. For additional information regarding APS' original filing, see "APS 2005 General Rate Case" in Note 5 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in the Pinnacle West Capital Corporation/APS Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2005.
     The updated request does not include the power supply adjustor rate increase of approximately 5% that will take effect February 1, 2006 or any PSA surcharge APS may seek pursuant to the terms of the ACC's decision entered on January 25, 2006. For additional information regarding this decision, see "Power Supply Adjustor Order" in Item 8.01 of the Pinnacle West/APS Current Report on Form 8-K filed January 26, 2006.

Exhibit 99.7
LAST UPDATED 2/1/06
     This discussion explains the changes in our consolidated earnings for the three-month and twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2005 and 2004. Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income for the three months and twelve months ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 follow this discussion. We will file our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2005 on or before March 16, 2006. We suggest that this discussion be read in connection with the Pinnacle West Capital Corporation Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2004 and the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarters ended March 31, 2005, June 30, 2005 and September 30, 2005. Additional operating and financial statistics and a glossary of terms are available on our website (). We have reclassified certain prior-period amounts to conform to our current-period presentation.
www.pinnaclewest.com
     We have three principal business segments (determined by products, services and the regulatory environment):
 
     The following table summarizes net income for the three months and twelve months ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 (dollars in millions):
General
     Throughout the following explanations of our results of operations, we refer to "gross margin." With respect to our regulated electricity segment and our marketing and trading segment, gross margin refers to electric operating revenues less purchased power and fuel costs. "Gross margin" is a "non-GAAP financial measure," as defined in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission rules. Exhibit 99.10 reconciles this non-GAAP financial measure to operating income, which is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). We view gross margin as an important performance measure of the core profitability of our operations. This measure is a key component of our internal financial reporting and is used by our management in analyzing our business segments. We believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that our management uses.
Sale of Silverhawk
     In June 2005, we entered into an agreement to sell our 75% interest in the Silverhawk Power Station to Nevada Power Company. As a result of the sale, we recorded an after-tax loss from discontinued operations of approximately $56 million in the second quarter of 2005. The marketing and trading segment discontinued operations in the chart above include this loss as well as revenues and expenses related to the operations of Silverhawk. The sale was completed on January 10, 2006.
 
Deferred Fuel and Purchased Power Costs
     The settlement of APS' 2003 general retail rate case became effective April 1, 2005. As part of the settlement, the ACC approved a 4.2% annual retail rate increase and a power supply adjustor ("PSA") that provides mechanisms for adjusting rates to reflect variations in fuel and purchased power costs. In accordance with the PSA, APS defers for future rate recovery 90% of the difference between actual fuel and purchased power costs, net of Off-System Sales margins, and the amount for such costs currently included in base rates. The current base rate for fuel and purchased power costs is based on 2003 price levels and spot prices for natural gas and wholesale power have increased over 40% since then. Although APS defers actual fuel and purchased power costs on a current basis, APS' recovery of the deferrals from its ratepayers is subject to annual PSA adjustments and ACC approval of periodic surcharge applications.
     Actual fuel and purchased power costs are higher than prior periods primarily due to higher fuel prices and increased plant outage days.
     The amount of APS' pretax accumulated PSA deferrals of realized costs at December 31, 2005 was $173 million, including interest. This amount includes $111 million of PSA deferrals that are expected to be recovered through the PSA annual adjustor rate that became effective February 1, 2006.
Operating Results  Three-month period ended December 31, 2005 compared with three-month period ended December 31, 2004
     Our consolidated net income for the three months ended December 31, 2005 was $21 million compared with $34 million for the prior-year period. The current-quarter net income included an after-tax net loss from discontinued operations of $3 million compared with an after-tax loss of $4 million in the prior-year quarter, both of which are primarily related to Silverhawk operations (see "Sale of Silverhawk" above). Income from continuing operations decreased $14 million in the period-to-period comparison, reflecting the following changes in earnings by segment:
 
Additional details on the major factors that increased (decreased) net income are contained in the following table (dollars in millions).
 
Regulated Electricity Segment Revenues
     Regulated electricity segment revenues were $59 million higher for the three months ended December 31, 2005 compared with the prior-year period primarily as a result of:
     
Real Estate Revenues
     Real estate revenues were $58 million lower for the three months ended December 31, 2005 compared with the prior-year period primarily due to the timing of parcel sales. Most of these sales closed earlier in 2005 than in 2004.
     
Marketing and Trading Segment Revenues
     Marketing and trading segment revenues were $27 million lower for the three months ended December 31, 2005 compared with the prior-year period primarily as a result of:
 
Operating Results  Twelve-month period ended December 31, 2005 compared with twelve-month period ended December 31, 2004
     Our consolidated net income for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $176 million compared with $243 million for the prior year. The current-year net income included an after-tax net loss from discontinued operations of $47 million compared with a $4 million after-tax loss in the prior year, which for both years is related primarily to the sale and operations of Silverhawk (see "Sale of Silverhawk" above), partially offset by sales of commercial properties at SunCor. Income from continuing operations decreased $24 million in the period-to-period comparison, reflecting the following changes in earnings by segment:
 
Additional details on the major factors that increased (decreased) net income are contained in the following table (dollars in millions).
 
     
Regulated Electricity Segment Revenues
     Regulated electricity segment revenues were $202 million higher for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared with the prior year primarily as a result of:
     
Marketing and Trading Segment Revenues
     Marketing and trading segment revenues were $49 million lower for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared with the prior year primarily as a result of:
     
Real Estate Revenues
     Real estate revenues were $12 million lower for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared with the prior year primarily due to decreased parcel sales, partially offset by increased home sales at SunCor.
Other Revenues
     Other revenues were $18 million higher for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the prior year primarily due to increased sales of energy-related products and services by APS Energy Services.

Exhibit 99.8 Last updated 10/27/05
 
 
 
 

 
Exhibit 99.9
PHOENIX  Pinnacle West Capital Corporation (NYSE: PNW) today reported consolidated net income for the year 2005 of $176.3 million, or $1.82 per diluted share of common stock. This result compares with $243.2 million, or $2.66 per share, for the year 2004.
"Our 2005 earnings reflect the deferral of the higher natural gas prices we experienced," said Chairman Bill Post. "The Arizona Corporation Commission's (ACC) action last week to start recovery of these deferrals is a positive step; however, the pending emergency rate case is critical to recover the higher fuels costs we are incurring to meet current customer demands today."
Under the power supply adjustor (PSA) approved by the ACC in Arizona Public Service Company's (APS) last rate case, 90 percent of the increases in the Company's fuel and purchased power costs above current base rates are "deferred," or set aside, for future recovery from customers. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the deferrals positively impact earnings on a non-cash basis until the collection of such costs is approved by the ACC.
The year-to-year comparison was negatively impacted by the regulatory disallowance resulting from the ACC's retail rate decision issued in April 2005; higher fuel and purchased power costs; a net loss from discontinued operations related to the sale of the Company's interest in the Silverhawk Power Station; an increase in operating costs primarily related to customer service and generation; higher property taxes; lower contributions from the marketing and trading segment; and the 2004 gain on the sale of the Phoenix Suns. These factors were partially offset by the PSA deferrals; higher retail sales volumes at APS due to customer growth; higher retail electricity revenues resulting from the company's first price increase in 14 years; improved results from the Company's real estate operations; and lower depreciation and amortization expense.
APS reported lower net income for 2005 of $170.5 million, of which about 60 percent, or $105.5 million, was related to the PSA deferrals. This result compares with net income of $199.6 million for 2004. APS' retail customer base grew 4.3 percent, more than three times the U.S. average, and its customers' peak energy needs grew more than 9 percent. Moreover, in 2005, APS passed the one-million-customer mark as it added more than 41,000 new retail customers.
 
SunCor Development Co., Pinnacle West's real estate subsidiary, delivered solid performance, reporting 2005 net income of $55.6 million, compared with net income of $44.7 million for 2004.
For the 2005 fourth quarter, the Company reported consolidated net income of $21.3 million, or $0.22 per diluted share of common stock. This result compares with consolidated net income of $33.7 million, or $0.37 per share, in last year's corresponding period.
