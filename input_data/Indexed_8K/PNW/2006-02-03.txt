Item 8.01 Other Events
Power Supply Adjustor Application for Surcharges
     On February 2, 2006, Arizona Public Service Company ("APS") filed with the Arizona Corporation Commission (the "ACC") an application for two separate surcharges under APS' Power Supply Adjustor ("PSA"). The surcharges would recover the balance of $59.9 million in retail fuel and purchased power costs deferred by APS in 2005 under the PSA. As discussed in more detail below, the combined surcharges would represent a temporary rate increase of approximately 2.6% during the overlapping portion of the twelve-month recovery periods for the two surcharges. The other component of the 2005 PSA deferrals is being recovered under a PSA annual adjustor rate increase of approximately 5% that became effective February 1, 2006. See Item 8.01 of the Pinnacle West Capital Corporation ("Pinnacle West")/APS Current Report on Form 8-K filed on January 26, 2006 for additional information about the PSA and the ACC's approval of the annual adjustor rate.
     The first requested surcharge would recover approximately $15.3 million over a twelve-month period, representing a temporary rate increase of approximately .66%, proposed to begin with the date of the ACC's decision in APS' pending emergency interim rate case. Hearings on that rate case are scheduled to begin on March 20, 2006. See Item 8.01 of the Pinnacle West/APS Current Report on Form 8-K filed on January 9, 2006 for additional information about the emergency interim rate case.
     The second requested surcharge would recover approximately $44.6 million over a twelve-month period, representing a temporary rate increase of approximately 1.9%, proposed to begin no later than the ACC's completion of its inquiry regarding the unplanned 2005 outages at the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station ("Palo Verde"). The $44.6 million of PSA deferrals represents replacement power costs associated with the additional unplanned outages at Palo Verde from April 1, 2005 (the effective date of the PSA) through December 31, 2005.
