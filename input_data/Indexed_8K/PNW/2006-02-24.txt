Item 8.01. Other Events
Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station
     As previously reported, Arizona Public Service Company ("APS or the "Company"") has been operating Unit 1 of the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station at reduced power levels since December 25, 2005 due to a non-safety related acoustic impact in one of the unit's shutdown cooling lines. See "Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station" in Item 8.01 of the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed on January 26, 2006. Unit 1 is currently operating at approximately 25% power. Implementation of a potential solution preliminarily scheduled for February was canceled after comprehensive analysis concluded that the desired improvement likely would not have been achieved. APS is currently evaluating other potential solutions. APS estimates that, to date, Unit 1's reduced power level has resulted in incremental monthly replacement power costs of approximately $10 million after income taxes. Based on lower current forward market energy prices, APS estimates that operating Unit 1 at such a reduced power level will result in additional monthly incremental replacement power costs of less than $7 million after income taxes.
