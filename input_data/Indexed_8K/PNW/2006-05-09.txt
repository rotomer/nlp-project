Exhibit 99.8
PHOENIX  Pinnacle West Capital Corporation (NYSE: PNW) today reported lower consolidated net income for the quarter ended March 31, 2006, of $12.5 million, or $0.13 per diluted share of common stock. This result compares with net income of $24.4 million, or $0.27 per share, for the comparable quarter a year ago.
Arizona Public Service (APS) reported a net loss of $5.5 million for the first quarter of 2006, compared with net income of $27.0 million for the same period a year ago. Whereas, SunCor Development Co., Pinnacle West's real estate subsidiary, delivered solid performance, reporting net income of $22.0 million, compared with $9.4 million in the 2005 first quarter.
"APS' first quarter sales growth was strong, increasing 4 percent in 2006. But the associated revenue growth was more than offset by high natural gas and purchased power prices," said Chairman Bill Post. "The power supply adjustor approved by the Arizona Corporation Commission (ACC) last week allows us to begin collecting a significant portion of our fuel cost increases on a timely basis.
"And, the ACC's order will improve APS' cash flow, which is essential to maintaining its financial integrity and investment grade credit ratings so as to allow us to continue supporting Arizona's growth in the most cost-effective manner for our customers."
