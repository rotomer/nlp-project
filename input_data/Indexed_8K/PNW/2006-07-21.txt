Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition
     Certain of the Information referenced in Item 7.01 below relates to Pinnacle West Capital Corporation's ("Pinnacle West" or the "Company") results of operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2006. This Information is attached hereto as Exhibits 99.2, 99.3 99.7, 99.9 and 99.10.
     On July 21, 2006, the Company issued a press release regarding its financial results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2006. A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.9.
     The information being furnished pursuant to this Item 2.02 and in Exhibits 99.2, 99.3 99.7, 99.9 and 99.10 of this report relating to the Company's financial results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2006 shall not be deemed to be "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that Section, and shall not be incorporated by reference into any registration statement or other document filed under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.
     Exhibit 99.9 to this report contains certain "non-GAAP financial measures," as defined in Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K of the Exchange Act. We describe these non-GAAP financial measures as "on-going earnings" and "on-going earnings per share." Exhibit 99.9 contains a table that reconciles each of these non-GAAP financial measures to net income, which is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). We believe on-going earnings provide investors with a useful indicator of our results that is comparable among periods because it excludes the effects of unusual items that may occur on an irregular basis. Investors should note that these non-GAAP financial measures involve judgments by management, including whether an item is classified as an unusual item. We use on-going earnings, or similar concepts, to measure our performance internally in reports for management.

EXHIBIT 99.7
     This discussion explains the changes in our consolidated earnings for the three-month and six-month periods ended June 30, 2006 and 2005. Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2006 and 2005 follow this discussion. We will file our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal period ended June 30, 2006 on or before August 9, 2006. We suggest that this discussion be read in connection with the Pinnacle West Capital Corporation Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2005 and the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2006. Additional operating and financial statistics and a glossary of terms are available on our website ().
www.pinnaclewest.com
     Pinnacle West has three principal business segments (determined by products, services and the regulatory environment):
     The following table summarizes net income by segment for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2006 and 2005 (dollars in millions):
 
 
General
     Throughout the following explanations of our results of operations, we refer to "gross margin." With respect to our regulated electricity segment and our marketing and trading segment, gross margin refers to operating revenues less fuel and purchased power costs. "Gross margin" is a "non-GAAP financial measure," as defined in accordance with SEC rules. Exhibit 99.10 reconciles this non-GAAP financial measure to operating income, which is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). We view gross margin as an important performance measure of the core profitability of our operations. This measure is a key component of our internal financial reporting and is used by our management in analyzing our business segments. We believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that our management uses. In addition, we have reclassified certain prior-period amounts to conform to our current-period presentation.
Deferred Fuel and Purchased Power Costs
     Arizona Public Service Company's ("APS") retail rate settlement became effective April 1, 2005. As part of the settlement, the Arizona Corporation Commission ("ACC") approved the power supply adjustor ("PSA") which permits APS to defer for recovery or refund fluctuations in retail fuel and purchased power costs, subject to specified parameters. In accordance with the PSA, APS defers for future rate recovery 90% of the difference between actual retail fuel and purchased power costs and the amount of such costs currently included in base rates. APS' recovery of PSA deferrals from its customers is subject to the ACC's approval of annual PSA adjustments and periodic surcharge applications.
     Since the inception of the PSA, APS has incurred substantially higher fuel and purchased power prices than those authorized in the Company's current base rates and has deferred those cost differences in accordance with the PSA. The balance of APS' PSA deferrals at June 30, 2006 was $175 million. APS estimates that its PSA deferral balance at December 31, 2006 will be approximately $155 million to $175 million, based on APS' hedged positions for fuel and purchased power at June 30, 2006 and recent forward market prices for natural gas and purchased power (which are subject to change). The recovery of PSA deferrals through ACC approved adjustors and surcharges recorded as revenue is offset dollar-for-dollar by the amortization of those deferred expenses.
     APS operated Palo Verde Unit 1 at reduced power levels from December 25, 2005 until March 18, 2006 due to vibration levels in one of the Unit's shutdown cooling lines. During an outage at Unit 1 from March 18, 2006 to July 7, 2006, APS performed the necessary work and modifications to remedy the situation. APS estimates that incremental replacement power costs resulting from Palo Verde's outages and reduced power levels were approximately $78 million during the six months ended June 30, 2006. The related PSA deferrals were approximately $70 million in that
 
period. The Palo Verde replacement power costs were partially offset by $30 million of lower than expected replacement power costs related to APS' fossil-fueled generating units during the six months ended June 30, 2006. As a result, the corresponding deferrals were reduced in that six-month period by $27 million.
     The PSA deferral balance at June 30, 2006 and estimated balance as of December 31, 2006 each includes (a) $45 million related to replacement power costs associated with unplanned 2005 Palo Verde outages and (b) $70 million related to replacement power costs associated with unplanned 2006 outages or reduced power operations at Palo Verde. The PSA deferrals associated with these unplanned Palo Verde outages and reduced power operations are the subject of an ACC prudence review.
Operating Results  Three-month period ended June 30, 2006 compared with three-month period ended June 30, 2005
     Our consolidated net income for the three months ended June 30, 2006 was $112 million compared with $27 million for the comparable prior-year period. The three months ended June 30, 2005 included a net loss from discontinued operations of $58 million, substantially all of which was related to the sale and operations of Silverhawk. Income from continuing operations increased $26 million in the period-to-period comparison, reflecting the following changes in earnings by segment:
 
Additional details on the major factors that increased (decreased) net income are contained in the following table (dollars in millions):

EXHIBIT 99.9
PHOENIX  Pinnacle West Capital Corporation (NYSE: PNW) today reported consolidated net income for the quarter ended June 30, 2006, of $112.2 million, or $1.13 per diluted share of common stock. This result compares with net income of $26.7 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, for the same quarter a year ago.
On-going consolidated earnings in the 2006 second quarter were $102 million, or $1.03 per share, compared with $86 million, or $0.89 per share in the comparable 2005 quarter. The 2006 results exclude income tax credits related to prior years of $10 million, or $0.10 per share. On-going earnings for the second quarter of 2005 exclude an after-tax loss of $59 million, or $0.61 per share, related to the sale of the Silverhawk Power Station.
"Growth in our service territory remains robust," said Pinnacle West Chairman Bill Post, citing Arizona's population growth, which is three times the national average. "Successfully serving this growth will require continuing cooperation from state regulators as our company invests in new, long-term resources to meet the ever-increasing demand for electricity."
Results for the quarter were positively impacted by higher retail sales at Arizona Public Service (APS) due to customer growth of 4.6 percent; fuel and purchased power cost deferrals; and warmer weather, punctuated by the hottest June on record. The average temperature during June was almost 5 degrees above normal. The warmer weather added $0.10 per share compared with last year's second quarter.
These positive items were partially offset by higher fuel and purchased power costs; and an increase in operating costs primarily related to higher generation maintenance and customer service costs.
APS reported net income of $93.8 million for the second quarter of 2006, compared with net income of $64.0 million for the same period a year ago. In addition, SunCor Development Co., Pinnacle West's real estate subsidiary, reported net income of $9.6 million, compared with $11.3 million in the 2005 second quarter.
