ACC Staff Report on 2005 Palo Verde Outages
     As previously reported, on February 2, 2006, Arizona Public Service Company ("APS") filed with the Arizona Corporation Commission (the "ACC") an application to recover approximately $45 million through a surcharge over a 12-month period, representing a temporary rate increase of approximately 1.9%, proposed to begin no later than the ACC's completion of its inquiry regarding 2005 Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station ("Palo Verde") outages. See "Power Supply Adjustor  PSA Deferrals Related to Unplanned Palo Verde Outages" in Note 5 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in the Pinnacle West Capital Corporation/APS Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2006.
     On August 17, 2006, the ACC staff filed a report with the ACC recommending that the ACC disallow approximately $17.4 million ($10 million after income taxes) of the $45 million request. The report alleges that four of the eleven Palo Verde outages in 2005 were "avoidable," three of which resulted in the recommended disallowance. The report also finds, among other things, that:
     The report also recommends that the ACC (a) establish minimum nuclear performance standards for Palo Verde, with associated penalties if the standards are not met; (b) require APS to provide semi-annual operational reports to the ACC; and (c) require APS to establish programs to manage and evaluate certain Palo Verde plant equipment.
     APS disagrees with, and plans to contest, the report's recommendation that the ACC disallow a portion of the $45 million of PSA deferrals. Under ACC regulations, prudent investments are those "which under ordinary circumstances would be deemed reasonable and not dishonest or obviously wasteful" and "investments [are] presumed to have been prudently made, and such presumptions may be set aside only by clear and convincing evidence that such investments were imprudent." APS believes the expenses in question were prudently incurred and are therefore recoverable. Also on August 17, 2006, the ACC staff requested the ACC to address the issues described above in APS' general rate case (currently these issues are being addressed in an ACC docket separate from the general rate case docket). If the ACC grants the staff's request to consolidate these proceedings, the issues described above would be addressed in the general rate case. Hearings in the general rate case are scheduled to begin on October 10, 2006.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, each registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
