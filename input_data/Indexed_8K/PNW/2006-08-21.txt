Item 8.01. Other Events
Arizona Public Service Company ("APS") General Rate Case  Testimony
     As required by the procedural schedule in APS' general rate case pending before the Arizona Corporation Commission (the "ACC"), on August 18, 2006, the ACC staff and other approved rate case intervenors filed their initial written testimony with the ACC. APS is requesting (a) a 21.3%, or $453.9 million, increase in its annual retail electricity revenues and (b) modifications to the power supply adjustor ("PSA") approved by the ACC in 2005. The requested rate increase includes the following principal components: $299.0 million (14.0%) for increased fuel and purchased power costs and $155.2 million (7.3%) for non-fuel increases. For additional information regarding APS' request, see "APS General Rate Case" in Note 5 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in the Pinnacle West Capital Corporation ("Pinnacle West")/APS Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2006 ("Note 5").
     
ACC Staff Recommendations
     In its filed testimony, the ACC staff recommends that the ACC increase APS' annual retail electricity revenues by $208.3 million, which would result in a rate increase of approximately 9.8%. The principal components of the increase recommended by the ACC staff are $193.5 million (9.1%) for increased fuel and purchased power costs; $10.5 million (0.5%) for non-fuel increases; and $4.3 million (0.2%) for environmental portfolio standard.
     In arriving at its recommendations, the ACC staff proposed, among other things, that the ACC:
     The ACC staff raised for consideration (without specifically recommending) the following potential changes to the PSA:
     If forecasted 2007 fuel costs were used to set the 2007 PSA annual adjustor, the ACC staff estimated that the 2007 PSA annual adjustor would be set to recover approximately $157.4 million over the base rate level of fuel cost recovery recommended. For additional information regarding 2006 PSA-related rate increases, see "Power Supply Adjustor" in Note 5. For information regarding the ACC staff's recommended disallowances of $17.4 million in PSA deferrals related to 2005 Palo Verde outages, which the ACC staff has requested the ACC to address in the general rate case, see "ACC Staff Report on 2005 Palo Verde
 
Outages" in Item 8.01 of the Pinnacle West/APS Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on August 18, 2006.
     
Other Intervenors' Recommendations
     Other intervenors in the rate case include the Arizona Residential Utility Consumer Office ("RUCO"), an office established by the Arizona legislature to represent the interests of residential utility consumers before the ACC; Arizonans for Electric Choice and Competition ("AECC"), a business coalition that advocates on behalf of retail electric customers in Arizona ; and Phelps Dodge Mining Company ("Phelps Dodge). In its filed testimony, RUCO recommended that the ACC increase APS' annual retail electricity revenues by $232 million, which would result in a rate increase of approximately 10.89%. In jointly-filed testimony, AECC and Phelps Dodge recommended that the ACC reduce APS' requested annual increase by at least $131 million.
     
Procedural Schedule
     As required by the procedural schedule, the parties will file additional testimony in the next few weeks, including APS' rebuttal testimony which is due September 15, 2006. Hearings in the rate case are scheduled to begin on October 10, 2006. We cannot predict the timing or the outcome of this rate case or the resulting levels of regulated revenues.
