Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition
      Certain of the Information referenced in Item 7.01 below relates to Pinnacle West Capital Corporation's ("Pinnacle West" or the "Company") results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2006. This Information is attached hereto as Exhibits 99.2, 99.3 99.7, 99.9, 99.10 and 99.11.
      On October 27, 2006, the Company issued a press release regarding its financial results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2006. A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.9.
      The information being furnished pursuant to this Item 2.02 and in Exhibits 99.2, 99.3 99.7, 99.9, 99.10 and 99.11 of this report relating to the Company's financial results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2006 shall not be deemed to be "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that Section, and shall not be incorporated by reference into any registration statement or other document filed under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.
      Exhibit 99.9 to this report contains certain "non-GAAP financial measures," as defined in Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K of the Exchange Act. We describe these non-GAAP financial measures as "on-going earnings" and "on-going earnings per share." Exhibit 99.9 contains a table that reconciles each of these non-GAAP financial measures to net income, which is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). We believe on-going earnings provide investors with a useful indicator of our results that is comparable among periods because it excludes the effects of unusual items that may occur on an irregular basis. Investors should note that these non-GAAP financial measures involve judgments by management, including whether an item is classified as an unusual item. We use on-going earnings, or similar concepts, to measure our performance internally in reports for management.

      This discussion explains the changes in our consolidated earnings for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2006 and 2005. Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2006 and 2005 follow this discussion. We will file our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal period ended September 30, 2006 on or before November 9, 2006. We suggest that this discussion be read in connection with the Pinnacle West Capital Corporation Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2005 and the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarters ended March 31, 2006 and June 30, 2006. Additional operating and financial statistics and a glossary of terms are available on our website ().

EARNINGS CONTRIBUTION BY BUSINESS SEGMENT
      Pinnacle West has three principal business segments (determined by products, services and the regulatory environment):
      The following table summarizes net income by segment for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2006 and 2005 (dollars in millions):
 
General
      Throughout the following explanations of our results of operations, we refer to "gross margin." With respect to our regulated electricity segment and our marketing and trading segment, gross margin refers to operating revenues less fuel and purchased power costs. "Gross margin" is a "non-GAAP financial measure," as defined in accordance with SEC rules. Exhibit 99.10 reconciles this non-GAAP financial measure to operating income, which is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). We view gross margin as an important performance measure of the core profitability of our operations. This measure is a key component of our internal financial reporting and is used by our management in analyzing our business segments. We believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that our management uses.
Deferred Fuel and Purchased Power Costs
      Arizona Public Service Company's ("APS") retail rate case settlement relating to its 2003 general rate case became effective April 1, 2005. As part of the settlement, the Arizona Corporation Commission ("ACC") approved the Power Supply Adjustor ("PSA"), which permits APS to defer for recovery or refund fluctuations in retail fuel and purchased power costs, subject to specified parameters. In accordance with the PSA, APS defers for future rate recovery 90% of the difference between actual retail fuel and purchased power costs and the amount of such costs currently included in base rates. APS' recovery of PSA deferrals from its customers is subject to the ACC's approval of annual PSA adjustments and periodic surcharge applications.
      Since the inception of the PSA, APS has incurred substantially higher fuel and purchased power costs than those authorized for recovery through APS' current base rates primarily due to the use of higher cost resources to serve incremental customer growth and has deferred those cost differences in accordance with the PSA. The balance of APS' PSA deferrals at September 30, 2006 was $209 million. APS estimates that its PSA deferral balance at December 31, 2006 will be approximately $140 million to $160 million, based on the amounts already approved for collection and on APS' hedged positions for fuel and purchased power at September 30, 2006 and recent forward market prices for natural gas and purchased power (which are subject to change). The recovery of PSA deferrals through ACC approved adjustors and surcharges recorded as revenue is offset dollar-for-dollar by the amortization of those deferred expenses.
      APS operated Palo Verde Unit 1 at reduced power levels from December 25, 2005 until March 18, 2006 due to vibration levels in one of the Unit's shutdown cooling lines. During an outage at Unit 1 from March 18, 2006 to July 7, 2006, APS performed the necessary work and modifications to remedy the situation. APS estimates that incremental replacement power costs resulting from these Palo Verde outages and reduced power levels were approximately $86 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2006. The impact on the PSA deferrals was an increase of approximately
 
$78 million in that period. These Palo Verde replacement power costs were partially offset by $43 million of lower than expected replacement power costs related to APS' other generating units during the nine months ended September 30, 2006, which decreased PSA deferrals by $39 million.
      The PSA deferral balance at September 30, 2006 and estimated balance as of December 31, 2006 each includes (a) $45 million related to replacement power costs associated with unplanned 2005 Palo Verde outages and (b) $78 million related to replacement power costs associated with unplanned 2006 outages or reduced power operations at Palo Verde. The PSA deferrals associated with these unplanned Palo Verde outages and reduced power operations are the subject of ACC prudence reviews. The ACC Staff has recommended disallowance of $17 million of the 2005 costs. The recommendation will be considered as part of APS' general rate case currently before the ACC. The ACC Staff recommendation does not change management's belief that the expenses in question were prudently incurred and, therefore, are recoverable.
Operating Results  Three-month period ended September 30, 2006 compared with three-month period ended September 30, 2005
      Our consolidated net income for the three months ended September 30, 2006 was $184 million compared with $104 million for the comparable prior-year period. The three months ended September 30, 2005 included income from discontinued operations of $19 million, a substantial portion of which was related to the sale of real estate commercial properties. Income from continuing operations increased $99 million in the period-to-period comparison, reflecting the following changes in earnings by segment:
 
Additional details on the major factors that increased (decreased) net income are contained in the following table (dollars in millions):

      Our consolidated net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2006 was $309 million compared with $155 million for the comparable prior-year period. The nine months ended September 30, 2005 included a net loss from discontinued operations of $44 million, which was related to the sale and operations of Silverhawk, partially offset by income from the sales of real estate commercial properties. Income from continuing operations increased $108 million in the period-to-period comparison, reflecting the following changes in earnings by segment:

Exhibit 99.9
PHOENIX  Pinnacle West Capital Corp. (NYSE: PNW) today reported consolidated net income for the quarter ended September 30, 2006, of $184.2 million, or $1.84 per diluted share of common stock. This result reflects a decline from on-going earnings of $186.4 million, or $1.89 per diluted share, for the same period in 2005.
Third-quarter 2005 on-going results exclude several non-recurring items, the largest of which was a regulatory disallowance of $87 million, or $0.88 per share, recorded in that prior-year quarter. On-going earnings for the 2005 third quarter also exclude $4.3 million, or $0.04 per share, of income from discontinued operations related to the sales of the Company's interests in NAC International and the Silverhawk Power Station. Reported consolidated net income was $103.7 million, or $1.05 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2005.
"Customer price increases granted by the Arizona Corporation Commission earlier this year have had no impact on 2006 earnings" said Chairman Bill Post. "These fuel related price increases decreased customer fuel cost liabilities and stabilized our declining cash flow."
The quarter-to-quarter comparison was negatively impacted by higher fuel costs; lower results from the Company's wholesale power marketing and real estate operations; and milder weather. These items were substantially offset by higher fuel cost deferrals and increased retail sales at Arizona Public Service (APS) due to customer growth of 4.4 percent.
In addition, APS reported net income for the third quarter of 2006 of $168.6 million, compared with on-going earnings of $148.1 million for the same period a year ago. Third quarter 2005 on-going results exclude the previously mentioned $87 million regulatory disallowance. APS reported net income of $61.1 million for the third quarter of 2005. SunCor Development Co., Pinnacle West's real estate subsidiary, reported net income of $17.5 million, compared with $21.4 million in the 2005 third quarter.
