Officer Election and Officer Retirement
          On December 13, 2006, Pinnacle West Capital Corporation ("Pinnacle West") and Arizona Public Service Company ("APS") announced the following:
          Mr. Brandt (52) was elected as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Pinnacle West and of APS in September 2003 and was Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Pinnacle West (December 2002  September 2003) and of APS (January 2003  September 2003).   Prior to that time, he was Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Ameren Corporation. On December 13, 2006, Pinnacle West's Board of Directors, acting on the recommendation of the Board's Human Resources Committee, increased Mr. Brandt's base salary to $600,000.
          Mr. Levine has agreed to provide consulting services to APS for a six-month period following his retirement for his current monthly base salary of $50,000 per month. Consistent with Mr. Levine's twenty-two years of credited service to APS, Mr. Levine will receive normal pension benefits as well as life insurance (at an annual cost to APS of between $3,500 and $5,500 through 2014) and medical coverage (at a monthly cost to APS of $1,600).
Modification of Long-Term Compensation Program; Grant of Retention Units
          On December 13, 2006 (the "Effective Date"), Pinnacle West's Board of Directors, acting on the recommendation of the Committee, modified Pinnacle West's long-term compensation program to replace, on a going-forward basis, the incentive opportunity previously afforded key employees through grants of performance shares and stock options with grants of performance shares and "Retention Units" or Restricted Stock Units ("RSUs"). This modified program would be expected to afford key employees the opportunity to earn long-term incentive compensation comparable with their opportunity in prior years. The focus of the modified program is to motivate long-term performance while promoting key employee retention.
          Retention Units are incentive awards that vest over a number of years if the award recipient remains employed by Pinnacle West or one of its subsidiaries. Each Retention Unit represents the fair market value of one share of Pinnacle West's common stock on each vesting date (the "Fair Market Value"), as described in more detail below. Consistent with the modified long-term compensation

program, on the Effective Date the Committee granted Retention Units to selected key employees of Pinnacle West and its subsidiaries. The Retention Units:
          RSUs are similar to Retention Units in that a key employee is awarded "units," the value of which are based on the value of Pinnacle West's common stock and which are subject to vesting requirements. Unlike Retention Units, however, upon the achievement of the vesting requirements, the employee generally receives shares of Pinnacle West common stock, the cash equivalent of those shares, or a combination of both. Depending on the RSU award agreement, either Pinnacle West or the recipient may have the election to choose between stock and cash. The Board expects to seek shareholder approval of a new long-term stock incentive plan at Pinnacle West's 2007 annual meeting to replace Pinnacle West's current stock plan, which was adopted in 2002. The new plan would authorize, among other things, stock-based long-term incentive awards designed to motivate long-term performance and promote key employee retention, such as RSUs.
          On the Effective Date the Committee granted Retention Units to Pinnacle West's and APS' officers, including the "Named Executive Officers" specified in Pinnacle West's proxy statement relating to its May 17, 2006 annual meeting. The Named Executive Officers and the amount of Retention Units granted to each are as follows: William J. Post, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, 21,034 units; Mr. Davis, 19,030 units; Mr. Levine, 7,011 units; Mr. Brandt, 11,018 units; and Steven M. Wheeler, Executive Vice President, Customer Service and Regulation of APS, 7,011 units. Upon Mr. Levine's retirement, he will be fully vested in his Retention Units because of his age and years of credited service although, as noted above, amounts will be payable to him on the dates and in the specified amounts in the vesting schedule.

Annual Grant
          On December 13, 2006, the Board approved a cash payment to each of Mr. Davis and Mr. Levine equal to the value of 2,000 shares of Pinnacle West common stock ($99,840). Mr. Davis and Mr. Levine have each received a similar annual grant (either in the form of 2,000 shares of Pinnacle West common stock or a cash equivalent) since 1999 and 2002, respectively.
