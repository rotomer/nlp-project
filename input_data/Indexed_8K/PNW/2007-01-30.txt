Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition
     On January 30, 2007, Pinnacle West Capital Corporation (the "Company" or "Pinnacle West") issued a press release regarding its financial results for its fiscal quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2006. A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.9.
     Certain of the Information referenced in Item 7.01 below relates to the Company's results of operations for its fiscal quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2006. This Information is attached hereto as Exhibits 99.2, 99.3, 99.7, 99.9, and 99.10.
     Exhibit 99.9 to this report contains certain "non-GAAP financial measures," as defined in Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K of the Exchange Act. We describe these non-GAAP financial measures as "on-going earnings" and "on-going earnings per share." Exhibit 99.9 contains a table that reconciles each of these non-GAAP financial measures to net income, which is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). We believe on-going earnings provide investors with a useful indicator of our results that is comparable among periods because it excludes the effects of unusual items that may occur on an irregular basis. Investors should note that these non-GAAP financial measures involve judgments by management, including whether an item is classified as an unusual item. We use on-going earnings, or similar concepts, to measure our performance internally in reports for management.
Item 7.01. Regulation FD Disclosure

2007 Earnings Outlook
     In this discussion, earnings per share amounts are after income taxes and are based on diluted common shares outstanding. The earnings guidance in this Form 8-K supersedes all previous earnings guidance provided by Pinnacle West.
     Our earnings forecasts are subject to numerous risks, including those described under "Forward-Looking Statements" below and under "Business Outlook" in Part I, Item 2 of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2006 (the "September 2006 Form 10-Q"). Our estimates as to how several of these risks and other factors may affect future earnings follow:
Table of Contents
     We estimate that our base level of consolidated earnings for 2007, before considering any potential earnings benefit derived from a base rate increase effective at any time during 2007, will be within a reasonable range of $2.45 per share.
     Assuming APS' retail rate request is granted effective May 1, 2007, we expect consolidated earnings for 2007 to be within a reasonable range of $3.00 per share. We estimate that APS' earnings contribution included in such 2007 consolidated earnings will be within a reasonable range of $2.70 per share (equivalent to a return on APS' average common equity of 8%). Under these assumptions, we estimate that 2007 earnings will include $55 million ($0.55 per share) related to the retail rate decision, consisting of $15 million ($0.15 per share) in the second quarter, $25 million ($0.25 per share) in the third quarter, and $15 million ($0.15 per share) in the fourth quarter.
Forward-Looking Statements
     This Form 8-K contains forward-looking statements regarding our 2007 earnings outlook. Neither the Company nor APS assumes any obligation to update these statements or make any further statements on any of these issues, except as required by applicable law. These forward-looking statements are often identified by words such as "estimate," "predict," "hope," "may," "believe," "anticipate," "plan," "expect," "require," "intend," "assume" and similar words. Because actual results may differ materially from expectations, we caution readers not to place undue reliance on these statements. A number of factors could cause future results to differ materially from historical results, or from results or outcomes currently expected or sought by Pinnacle West or APS. In addition to the Risk Factors described in Item 1A of the Pinnacle West/APS Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2005, these factors include, but are not limited to, state and federal regulatory and legislative decisions and actions, including the outcome and timing of APS' retail rate proceedings pending before the ACC; the timely recovery of PSA deferrals, including such deferrals in 2005 and 2006 associated with unplanned Palo Verde outages and reduced power operations that are the subject of ACC prudence reviews; the

Exhibit 99.7
LAST UPDATED 1/30/07
     This discussion explains the changes in our consolidated earnings for the three-month and twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2006 and 2005. Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income for the three months and twelve months ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 follow this discussion. We will file our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal period ended December 31, 2006 on or before March 1, 2007. We suggest that this discussion be read in connection with the Pinnacle West Capital Corporation Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2005 and the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarters ended March 31, 2006, June 30, 2006 and September 30, 2006. Additional operating and financial statistics and a glossary of terms are available on our website (www.pinnaclewest.com).
     Pinnacle West's two principal business segments are:
     Our reportable business segments reflect a change from the previously reported information. As of December 31, 2006, our marketing and trading activities are no longer considered a segment requiring separate reporting or disclosure. The marketing and trading activities consist of our competitive energy business, including wholesale marketing and trading and retail commodity-related energy services. These activities have decreased as a result of fewer market opportunities and the Company's intention to deemphasize that part of our business. These activities are now reported as part of the "Other" category in the table below. The corresponding information for earlier periods has been reclassified.
     The following table summarizes income from continuing operations by segment for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 and reconciles to net income in total (dollars in millions):
 
 
General
     Throughout the following explanations of our results of operations, we refer to "gross margin." With respect to our regulated electricity segment and our marketing and trading contributions, gross margin refers to operating revenues less fuel and purchased power costs. "Gross margin" is a "non-GAAP financial measure," as defined in accordance with SEC rules. Exhibit 99.10 reconciles this non-GAAP financial measure to operating income, which is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). We view gross margin as an important performance measure of the core profitability of our operations. This measure is a key component of our internal financial reporting and is used by our management in analyzing our business segments. We believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that our management uses.
Deferred Fuel and Purchased Power Costs
     Our subsidiary, Arizona Public Service Company ("APS"), settled its 2003 general retail rate case effective April 1, 2005. As part of the settlement, the Arizona Corporation Commission ("ACC") approved the Power Supply Adjustor ("PSA"), which permits APS to defer for recovery or refund fluctuations in retail fuel and purchased power costs, subject to specified parameters. In accordance with the PSA, APS defers for future rate recovery 90% of the difference between actual retail fuel and purchased power costs and the amount of such costs currently included in base rates. APS' recovery of PSA deferrals from its customers is subject to the ACC's approval of annual PSA adjustments and periodic surcharge applications.
     Since the inception of the PSA, APS has incurred substantially higher fuel and purchased power costs than those authorized for recovery through APS' current base rates primarily due to the use of higher cost resources and has deferred those cost differences in accordance with the PSA. The
 
balance of APS' PSA deferrals at December 31, 2006 was approximately $160 million. The recovery of PSA deferrals through ACC approved adjustors and surcharges recorded as revenue is offset dollar-for-dollar by the amortization of those deferred expenses recorded as fuel and purchased power.
     APS operated Palo Verde Unit 1 at reduced power levels from December 25, 2005 until March 18, 2006 due to vibration levels in one of the Unit's shutdown cooling lines. During an outage at Unit 1 from March 18, 2006 to July 7, 2006, APS performed the necessary work and modifications to remedy the situation. APS estimates that incremental replacement power costs resulting from these and other unplanned Palo Verde outages and reduced power levels were approximately $88 million during 2006. The related impact on the PSA deferrals was an increase of approximately $79 million. These Palo Verde replacement power costs were partially offset by $42 million of lower than expected replacement power costs related to APS' other generating units during 2006, which decreased PSA deferrals by $38 million.
     The PSA deferral balance at December 31, 2006 includes (a) $45 million related to replacement power costs associated with unplanned 2005 Palo Verde outages and (b) $79 million related to replacement power costs associated with unplanned 2006 outages or reduced power operations at Palo Verde. The PSA deferrals associated with these unplanned Palo Verde outages and reduced power operations are the subject of ACC prudence reviews. The ACC staff has recommended disallowance of $17 million of the 2005 costs. The recommendation will be considered as part of APS' general rate case currently before the ACC. The ACC staff recommendation does not change management's belief that the expenses in question were prudently incurred and, therefore, are recoverable.
     
Operating Results  Three-month period ended December 31, 2006 compared with three-month period ended December 31, 2005
     Our consolidated net income for the three months ended December 31, 2006 was $18 million compared with $21 million for the comparable prior-year period. The three months ended December 31, 2006 includes $8 million of income from discontinued operations that relates to the sales of real estate commercial properties at SunCor. Income from continuing operations decreased $14 million in the period-to-period comparison, reflecting the following changes in earnings by segment:
 
Additional details on the major factors that increased (decreased) net income are contained in the following table (dollars in millions):
Regulated Electricity Segment Revenues
     Regulated electricity segment revenues were $81 million higher for the three months ended December 31, 2006 compared with the prior-year period primarily as a result of:
 
Real Estate Segment Revenues
     Real estate segment revenues were $24 million lower for the three months ended December 31, 2006 compared with the prior-year period primarily as a result of:
Other Revenues
     Marketing and trading revenues were $13 million lower for the three months ended December 31, 2006 compared with the prior-year period primarily as a result of lower power prices on realized electricity sales and a decrease in mark-to-market gains on contracts for future delivery due to changes in forward prices.
     Other revenues were $6 million lower for the three months ended December 31, 2006 compared with the prior-year period primarily as a result of decreased sales-related products and services by APS Energy Services.
Operating Results  Twelve-month period ended December 31, 2006 compared with twelve-month period ended December 31, 2005
     Our consolidated net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006 was $327 million compared with $176 million for the comparable prior-year period. The twelve months ended December 31, 2005 included a net loss from discontinued operations of $47 million, which was related to the sale and operations of Silverhawk, partially offset by income from sales of real estate commercial properties at SunCor. Income from continuing operations increased $94 million in the period-to-period comparison, reflecting the following changes in earnings by segment:
 
 
Additional details on the major factors that increased (decreased) net income are contained in the following table (dollars in millions):

Exhibit 99.9
CONFIDENTIAL FINAL  1/16/2007 5:01 PM
PHOENIX  Pinnacle West Capital Corporation (NYSE: PNW) today reported lower net income for the quarter ended December 31, 2006, of $18.5 million, or $0.18 per diluted share of common stock. This result compares with net income of $21.3 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, for the same quarter a year ago.
In addition, the Company's principal subsidiary, Arizona Public Service (APS), reported lower earnings of $12.9 million for the 2006 fourth quarter, compared with earnings of $18.3 million for the same period a year ago. Pinnacle West's quarterly results also were impacted by lower results from its real estate subsidiary, SunCor Development Co, which reported income of $11.4 million, compared with $13.5 million in the 2005 fourth quarter.
Fourth-quarter earnings declined despite increased retail sales at APS due to customer growth of 4 percent, three times the national average, and income tax credits related to prior years. These positive factors were more than offset by higher operation and maintenance costs; increased depreciation and interest expense; lower results from the Company's real estate operations, primarily due to timing of transactions during the year; and milder weather.
"Arizona is now the fastest-growing state in the nation, and our business reflects that fact," said Chairman Bill Post, citing a record 44,000 new APS customers in 2006, the equivalent of a small city. "Looking ahead, growth will continue to dominate our operating environment, thus requiring innovation and investments in infrastructure to ensure we continue providing reliable, affordable energy."
Post added that the effects of Arizona's growth were evident throughout the company's business in 2006, and employees met the challenge. Recognized by J.D. Power and Associates in its 2006 survey results for superior customer satisfaction, APS was rated the top investor-owned electric utility in the West by business customers and number two by residential customers.
In 2006, APS established a new system peak demand of 7,652 megawatts (MW)  9.3 percent higher than the previous peak of 7,000 MW. APS met this peak, in large part, through the performance of its fossil-fueled power plants. Coal-fired plants set a company fleet record capacity factor of 87 percent, compared with the industry average of 72 percent. And, APS' gas units produced their highest output ever of 7.3 million megawatt-hours.
Additionally, in a period of volatile energy costs, the Company continued its emphasis on cost containment and price stability. APS' energy risk management efforts helped mitigate dramatic price swings of natural gas and their impact on customers. The Arizona Corporation Commission (ACC) also responded to this challenge. They approved changes to APS' annual fuel adjustment, as well as APS' request for interim rate relief, thus improving both current and future recovery of fuel-related costs.
 
For the year 2006 as a whole, Pinnacle West's consolidated on-going earnings decreased 3.5 percent to $313.3 million, or $3.13 per diluted share. This result compares with 2005 on-going earnings of $324.5 million, or $3.35 per share. Pinnacle West reported 2006 consolidated net income of $327.3 million, or $3.27 per share, compared with 2005 net income of $176.3 million, or $1.82 per diluted share.
The annual on-going earnings exclude several non-recurring items: a regulatory disallowance of $84 million recorded in 2005; a net loss in 2005 from discontinued operations related to sales of the Company's interests in the Silverhawk Power Station and NAC International totaling $64 million; and income tax credits of $14 million recorded in 2006, but related to prior years.
