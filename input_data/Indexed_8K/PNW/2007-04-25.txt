Exhibit 99.7
LAST UPDATED     4/25/07
     This discussion explains the changes in our consolidated net income for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2007 and 2006. Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income for the three months ended March 31, 2007 and 2006 follow this discussion. We will file our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal period ended March 31, 2007 on or before May 10, 2007. We suggest that this discussion be read in connection with the Pinnacle West Capital Corporation Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006. Additional operating and financial statistics and a glossary of terms are available on our website ().
www.pinnaclewest.com
     Pinnacle West's two principal business segments are:
     The following table summarizes income from continuing operations by segment for the three months ended March 31, 2007 and 2006 and reconciles net income in total (dollars in millions):
 
 
General
     Throughout the following explanations of our results of operations, we refer to "gross margin." With respect to our regulated electricity segment, gross margin refers to operating revenues less fuel and purchased power costs. "Gross margin" is a "non-GAAP financial measure," as defined in accordance with SEC rules. Exhibit 99.10 reconciles this non-GAAP financial measure to operating income, which is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). We view gross margin as an important performance measure of the core profitability of our operations. This measure is a key component of our internal financial reporting and is used by our management in analyzing our business. We believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that our management uses.
Deferred Fuel and Purchased Power Costs
     Our subsidiary, Arizona Public Service Company ("APS"), settled its 2003 general retail rate case effective April 1, 2005. As part of the settlement, the Arizona Corporation Commission ("ACC") approved the power supply adjustor ("PSA"), which permits APS to defer for recovery or refund fluctuations in retail fuel and purchased power costs, subject to specified parameters. In accordance with the PSA, APS defers for future rate recovery 90% of the difference between actual retail fuel and purchased power costs and the amount of such costs currently included in base rates. APS' recovery of PSA deferrals from its customers is subject to the ACC's approval of annual PSA adjustments and periodic surcharge applications.
     Since the inception of the PSA, APS has incurred substantially higher fuel and purchased power costs than those authorized for recovery through APS' current base rates, primarily due to the use of higher cost resources and higher fuel prices, and has deferred those cost differences in accordance with the PSA. The balance of APS' PSA accumulated unrecovered deferrals at March 31, 2007 was approximately $118 million. The recovery of PSA deferrals through ACC approved adjustors and surcharges recorded as revenue is offset dollar-for-dollar by the amortization of those deferred expenses recorded as fuel and purchased power.
     APS recorded PSA deferrals of (a) $45 million related to replacement power costs in 2005 associated with unplanned Palo Verde outages and (b) $79 million related to replacement power costs in 2006 associated with unplanned outages or reduced power operations at Palo Verde. The PSA deferrals associated with these unplanned Palo Verde outages and reduced power operations are the subject of ACC prudence reviews. The ACC staff has completed its prudence review of 2005 unplanned outages and has recommended disallowance of $16 million of the 2005 costs. The recommendation is being considered as part of APS' general rate case currently pending before the ACC. The ACC staff recommendation does not change management's belief that the expenses in question were prudently incurred and, therefore, are recoverable. The prudence review of 2006 unplanned outages has not yet been completed.
 
Operating Results  Three-month period ended March 31, 2007 compared with three-month period ended March 31, 2006
     Our consolidated net income for the three months ended March 31, 2007 was $17 million compared with $13 million for the comparable prior-year period. Net income increased $4 million in the period-to-period comparison, reflecting the following changes in earnings by segment:
 
Additional details on the major factors that increased (decreased) net income are contained in the following table (dollars in millions):
Regulated Electricity Segment Revenues
     Regulated electricity segment revenues were $70 million higher for the three months ended March 31, 2007 compared with the prior-year period primarily as a result of:

     Real estate segment revenues were $31 million lower for the three months ended March 31, 2007 compared with the prior-year period primarily as a result of:
 
Other Revenues

Exhibit 99.9
PHOENIX  Pinnacle West Capital Corporation (NYSE: PNW) today reported consolidated net income for the quarter ended March 31, 2007, of $16.5 million, or $0.16 per diluted share of common stock. This result compares with net income of $12.5 million, or $0.13 per share, for the comparable quarter a year ago.
The improved results were driven largely by higher retail sales at Arizona Public Service (APS) due to cooler weather and by fewer power plant outages, partially offset by lower results from the Company's real estate operations. Weather effects, highlighted by the coldest Arizona January in nearly two decades, contributed $8 million, or $0.08 per share, to the quarterly improvement.
Compared with the first quarter a year ago, electricity consumption by APS retail customers increased 7.1 percent in 2007 with a customer base that grew 3.8 percent, according to Chairman Bill Post.
"Serving Arizona's growth continues to drive our business and our strategies," he said. "During the first quarter alone, we invested more than $180 million in capital improvements to Arizona's electric infrastructure. And, over the balance of the year, we expect to invest an additional $750 million to continue reliably serving our retail customers."
APS reported earnings of $4.3 million for the first quarter of 2007, compared with a net loss of $5.5 million in the 2006 first quarter. Operationally, the 2007 quarter reflected significantly improved performance at the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station, which recorded a site capacity factor of 94 percent.
SunCor Development Co., Pinnacle West's real estate subsidiary, reported net income of $9.3 million, down from $22.0 million for the same period a year ago, primarily due to decreased sales of land parcels and residential property.
