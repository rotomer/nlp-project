2007 Earnings Outlook
     We are updating Pinnacle West's 2007 earnings outlook in light of the recent Arizona Corporation Commission ("ACC") decision in APS' general retail rate case. See "APS General Rate Case and Power Supply Adjustor" in Item 8.01 of the Pinnacle West/APS Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on June 20, 2007 for additional information about the ACC decision. In this discussion, earnings per share amounts are after income taxes and are based on diluted common shares outstanding. The earnings guidance in this Form 8-K supersedes all previous earnings guidance provided by Pinnacle West. Our earnings forecasts are subject to numerous risks, including those described under "Forward-Looking Statements" below.
     We currently estimate that our consolidated earnings for 2007 will be within a reasonable range of $2.55 per share. We estimate that APS' earnings contribution included in such 2007 consolidated earnings will be within a reasonable range of $2.25 per share (equivalent to a return on APS' average common equity of 7.5%). These estimates include the $8 million after-tax ($0.08 per share) regulatory disallowance recorded in the second quarter of 2007 as a result of the general rate case decision. We currently estimate that net income for 2007 for our real estate subsidiary, SunCor Development Company ("SunCor") will be approximately $30 million.
     We previously estimated that our base level of consolidated earnings for 2007, before considering any potential earnings benefit derived from a base rate increase effective at any time during 2007, would be within a reasonable range of $2.45 per share. See the Pinnacle West/APS Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on January 30, 2007 for further information on our prior 2007 guidance. Our current guidance differs from our prior guidance principally due to the following factors, all of which relate to implementation of the retail rate decision effective July 1, 2007:

Forward-Looking Statements
     This Form 8-K contains forward-looking statements regarding our 2007 earnings outlook. Neither the Company nor APS assumes any obligation to update these statements or make any further statements on any of these issues, except as required by applicable law. Because actual results may differ materially from expectations, we caution readers not to place undue reliance on these statements. A number of factors could cause future results to differ materially from historical results, or from results or outcomes currently expected or sought by Pinnacle West or APS. In addition to the Risk Factors described in Item 1A of the Pinnacle West/APS Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006, these factors include, but are not limited to, state and federal regulatory and legislative decisions and actions; the ongoing restructuring of the electric industry, including the introduction of retail electric competition in Arizona and decisions impacting wholesale competition; the outcome of regulatory, legislative and judicial proceedings, both current and future, relating to the restructuring; market prices for electricity and natural gas; power plant performance and outages; transmission outages and constraints; weather variations affecting local and regional customer energy usage; customer growth and energy usage; regional economic and market conditions, including the results of litigation and other proceedings resulting from the California energy situation, volatile fuel and purchased power costs and the completion of generation and transmission construction in the region, which could affect customer growth and the cost of power supplies; the cost of debt and equity capital and access to capital markets; current credit ratings remaining in effect for any given period of time; our ability to compete successfully outside traditional regulated markets (including the wholesale market); the performance of our marketing and trading activities due to volatile market liquidity and any deteriorating counterparty credit and the use of derivative contracts in our business (including the interpretation of the subjective and complex accounting rules related to these contracts); changes in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and the interpretation of those principles; the performance of the stock market and the changing interest rate environment, which affect the value of our nuclear decommissioning trust, pension, and other postretirement benefit plans assets, the amount of required contributions to Pinnacle West's pension plan and contributions to APS' nuclear decommissioning trust funds, as well as the reported costs of providing pension and other postretirement benefits; technological developments in the electric industry; the strength of the real estate market in SunCor's market areas, which include Arizona, Idaho, New Mexico and Utah; and other uncertainties, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond the control of Pinnacle West and APS.

LAST UPDATED 7/26/07
     This discussion explains the changes in our consolidated net income for the three-month and six-month periods ended June 30, 2007 and 2006. Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2007 and 2006 follow this discussion. We will file our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal period ended June 30, 2007 on or before August 9, 2007. We suggest that this discussion be read in connection with the Pinnacle West Capital Corporation ("Pinnacle West") Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006. Additional operating and financial statistics and a glossary of terms are available on our website ().

     Pinnacle West's two principal business segments are:
     The following table summarizes income from continuing operations by segment for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2007 and 2006 and reconciles net income in total (dollars in millions):
 
 
General
     Throughout the following explanations of our results of operations, we refer to "gross margin." With respect to our regulated electricity segment, gross margin refers to operating revenues less fuel and purchased power costs. "Gross margin" is a "non-GAAP financial measure," as defined in accordance with SEC rules. Exhibit 99.10 reconciles this non-GAAP financial measure to operating income, which is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). We view gross margin as an important performance measure of the core profitability of our operations. This measure is a key component of our internal financial reporting and is used by our management in analyzing our business. We believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that our management uses.
Deferred Fuel and Purchased Power Costs
     Our subsidiary, Arizona Public Service Company ("APS"), settled its 2003 general retail rate case effective April 1, 2005. As part of the settlement, the Arizona Corporation Commission ("ACC") approved the Power Supply Adjustor ("PSA"), which permits APS to defer for recovery or refund fluctuations in retail fuel and purchased power costs, subject to specified parameters. In its June 28, 2007 general rate case order, the ACC modified the PSA in various respects, effective July 1, 2007. In accordance with the modified PSA, APS continues to defer for future rate recovery 90% of the difference between actual retail fuel and purchased power costs and the amount of such costs currently included in base rates, excluding certain costs. APS recovers PSA deferrals from its customers through the PSA, which is adjusted annually. See "APS General Rate Case and Power Supply Adjustor" in Item 8.01 of the Pinnacle West/APS Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 20, 2007 for additional information about the ACC order and the PSA modifications.
     The balance of APS' PSA accumulated unrecovered deferrals at June 30, 2007 was approximately $137 million. APS expects to recover these deferrals through a combination of the PSA adjustor that took effect on February 1, 2007 and the temporary PSA surcharge discussed in the following paragraph. The recovery of PSA deferrals recorded as revenue is offset dollar-for-dollar by the amortization of those deferred expenses recorded as fuel and purchased power.
     APS recorded PSA deferrals of (a) $45 million related to replacement power costs in 2005 associated with Palo Verde outages (the "2005 Deferrals") and (b) $79 million related to replacement power costs in 2006 associated with outages or reduced power operations at Palo Verde (the "2006 Deferrals"). In its June 28, 2007 order, the ACC (a) disallowed approximately $14 million, including accrued interest ($8 million after income taxes), of the 2005 Deferrals and (b) approved APS' recovery of the balance of the 2005 Deferrals (approximately $34 million, including accrued interest) through a temporary PSA surcharge over a twelve-month period effective July 1, 2007. The ACC's prudence review of 2006 Palo Verde outage costs has not yet been completed. APS believes the 2006 Deferrals were prudently incurred and, therefore, are recoverable.
 
Operating Results  Three-month period ended June 30, 2007 compared with three-month period ended June 30, 2006
     Our consolidated net income for the three months ended June 30, 2007 was $79 million compared with $112 million for the comparable prior-year period. Net income decreased $33 million in the period-to-period comparison, reflecting the following changes in earnings by segment:

Exhibit 99.9
PHOENIX  Pinnacle West Capital Corporation (NYSE: PNW) today reported lower consolidated net income for the quarter ended June 30, 2007, of $79.0 million, or $0.78 per diluted share of common stock. This result compares with net income of $112.2 million, or $1.13 per diluted share, for the same quarter a year ago.
The lower quarterly results were principally driven by lower earnings at Arizona Public Service (APS) as a result of an $8 million after-tax regulatory disallowance, milder weather, and the absence of $7 million of income tax credits recorded in 2006.
"The exceptional population growth in our service territory drives an ever-increasing demand for electricity," said Pinnacle West Chairman Bill Post. "Going forward, we need to continue making substantial investments in infrastructure and long-term resources, while working with regulators to achieve timely and constructive regulatory treatment."
For the second quarter of 2007, APS reported lower net income of $75.1 million, compared with net income of $93.8 million for the same period a year ago. Operationally, the 2007 quarter reflected significantly improved performance at the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station, which increased its output by 54 percent compared with the same quarter a year ago.
SunCor Development Co., Pinnacle West's real estate subsidiary, reported net income of $0.3 million, compared with $9.6 million in the 2006 second quarter, primarily due to decreased sales of residential property.
