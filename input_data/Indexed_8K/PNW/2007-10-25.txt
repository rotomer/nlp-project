2007 Earnings Outlook
     We are updating Pinnacle West's 2007 earnings outlook. The differences between our current guidance and our previous guidance are described below. In this discussion, earnings per share amounts are after income taxes and are based on diluted common shares outstanding. The earnings guidance in this Form 8-K supersedes all previous earnings guidance provided by Pinnacle West. Our earnings forecasts are subject to numerous risks, including those described under "Forward-Looking Statements" below.
     We currently estimate that our consolidated earnings for 2007 will be within a reasonable range of $2.90 per share. We estimate that Arizona Public Service Company's ("APS") earnings contribution included in such 2007 consolidated earnings will be within a reasonable range of $2.70 per share (equivalent to a return on APS' average common equity of 8.25%). These estimates include the $8 million ($0.08 per share) after-tax regulatory disallowance recorded in the second quarter of 2007 as a result of the general retail rate case decision; and $13 million ($0.13 per share) of income tax benefits related to prior years resolved in 2007. We currently estimate that net income for 2007 for our real estate subsidiary, SunCor Development Company ("SunCor"), will be approximately $20 million. See "APS General Rate Case and Power Supply Adjustor" in Note 5 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in the Pinnacle West/APS Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2007 for additional information about the rate case decision.
     We previously estimated that our consolidated earnings for 2007 would be within a reasonable range of $2.55 per share. See the Pinnacle West/APS Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on July 26, 2007 for further information on our prior 2007 guidance. Our current guidance differs from our prior guidance principally due to the following factors:

Forward-Looking Statements
     This Form 8-K contains forward-looking statements regarding our 2007 earnings outlook. Neither the Company nor APS assumes any obligation to update these statements or make any further statements on any of these issues, except as required by applicable law. Because actual results may differ materially from expectations, we caution readers not to place undue reliance on these statements. A number of factors could cause future results to differ materially from historical results, or from results or outcomes currently expected or sought by Pinnacle West or APS. In addition to the Risk Factors described in Item 1A of the Pinnacle West/APS Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006, these factors include, but are not limited to, state and federal regulatory and legislative decisions and actions, particularly those affecting our rates and recovery of fuel and purchased power costs; the ongoing restructuring of the electric industry, including the introduction of retail electric competition in Arizona and decisions impacting wholesale competition; the outcome of regulatory, legislative and judicial proceedings, both current and future, relating to the restructuring and environmental matters (including those relating to climate change); market prices for electricity and natural gas; power plant performance and outages; transmission outages and constraints; weather variations affecting local and regional customer energy usage; customer growth and energy usage; regional economic and market conditions, including the results of litigation and other proceedings resulting from the California energy situation, volatile fuel and purchased power costs and the completion of generation and transmission construction in the region, which could affect customer growth and the cost of power supplies; the cost of debt and equity capital and access to capital markets; current credit ratings remaining in effect for any given period of time; our ability to compete successfully outside traditional regulated markets (including the wholesale market); the performance of our marketing and trading activities due to volatile market liquidity and any deteriorating counterparty credit and the use of derivative contracts in our business (including the interpretation of the subjective and complex accounting rules related to these contracts); changes in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and the interpretation of those principles; the performance of the stock market and the changing interest rate environment, which affect the value of our nuclear decommissioning trust, pension, and other postretirement benefit plans assets, the amount of required contributions to Pinnacle West's pension plan and contributions to APS' nuclear decommissioning trust funds, as well as the reported costs of providing pension and other postretirement benefits; technological developments in the electric industry; the strength of the real estate market in SunCor's market areas, which include Arizona, Idaho, New Mexico and Utah; and other uncertainties, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond the control of Pinnacle West and APS.

     This discussion explains the changes in our consolidated net income for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2007 and 2006. Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2007 and 2006 follow this discussion. We will file our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal period ended September 30, 2007 on or before November 9, 2007. We suggest that this discussion be read in connection with the Pinnacle West Capital Corporation ("Pinnacle West") Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006 and the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarters ended March 31, 2007 and June 30, 2007. Additional operating and financial statistics and a glossary of terms are available on our website ().

     The following table summarizes income (loss) from continuing operations for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2007 and 2006 and reconciles net income in total (dollars in millions):
 
 
Regulatory Matters
     On June 28, 2007, the Arizona Corporation Commission (the "ACC") issued an order in the general rate case of Arizona Public Service Company ("APS"). In its order, effective July 1, 2007, among other things, the ACC (a) approved an increase in APS' retail base rates, the components of which included an increase in APS' base fuel rate and a non-fuel rate increase; (b) modified the Power Supply Adjustor ("PSA"); and (c) disallowed certain PSA deferrals as described below.
     Under the PSA, APS defers for future rate recovery or refund 90% of the difference between actual retail fuel and purchased power costs and the base fuel rate included in APS' retail rates, subject to specified parameters. APS absorbs the other 10% of variances between actual retail fuel and purchased power costs and the base fuel rate. The increase in APS' base fuel rate approved by the ACC reduced the amount of fuel and purchased power costs subject to the 90/10 PSA sharing arrangement. APS recovers PSA deferrals from its customers through PSA annual adjustors and surcharges. The recovery of PSA deferrals recorded as revenue is offset dollar-for-dollar by the amortization of those deferred expenses recorded as fuel and purchased power. The balance of APS' PSA accumulated unrecovered deferrals at September 30, 2007 was approximately $150 million. See "APS General Rate Case and Power Supply Adjustor" in Note 5 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in the Pinnacle West/APS Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2007 for additional information about the ACC order and the PSA.
     APS recorded PSA deferrals of (a) $45 million related to replacement power costs in 2005 associated with Palo Verde outages (the "2005 Deferrals") and (b) $79 million related to replacement power costs in 2006 associated with outages or reduced power operations at Palo Verde (the "2006 Deferrals"). In its order, the ACC (a) disallowed approximately $14 million, including accrued interest ($8 million after income taxes), of the 2005 Deferrals and (b) approved APS' recovery of the balance of the 2005 Deferrals (approximately $34 million, including accrued interest) through a temporary PSA surcharge over a twelve-month period beginning July 1, 2007. The ACC directed the ACC staff to conduct a "prudence audit" of the 2006 Palo Verde outage costs. Virtually all of the 2006 Deferrals were associated with a Unit 1 vibration issue. On October 4, 2007, the ACC staff filed a report with the ACC that concludes that APS' response to the Unit 1 vibration issue was "reasonable and prudent." APS continues to believe that the 2006 Deferrals were prudently incurred and, therefore, are recoverable.
Operating Results  Three-month period ended September 30, 2007 compared with three-month period ended September 30, 2006
     Our consolidated net income for the three months ended September 30, 2007 was $209 million compared with $184 million for the comparable prior-year period. The current period includes income from discontinued operations of $8 million, which was related to income from the sale of commercial properties at SunCor. Income from continuing operations increased $17 million in the period-to-period comparison, reflecting the following changes in earnings:
 
 
Additional details on the major factors that increased (decreased) net income for the three-month period ended September 30, 2007 compared with the prior-year period are contained in the following table (dollars in millions):
Regulated Electricity Segment Revenues
     Regulated electricity segment revenues were $157 million higher for the three months ended September 30, 2007 compared with the prior-year period primarily because of:
 
Real Estate Segment Revenues
     Real estate segment revenues were $50 million lower for the three months ended September 30, 2007 compared with the prior-year period primarily because of:
All Other Revenues
     Marketing and trading revenues were $15 million higher for the three months ended September 30, 2007 compared with the prior-year period primarily due to an increase in competitive retail sales volumes in California.
     Other revenues were $8 million higher for the three months ended September 30, 2007 compared to the prior-year period primarily as a result of increased sales by APSES of energy related products and services.
Operating Results  Nine-month period ended September 30, 2007 compared with nine-month period ended September 30, 2006
     Our consolidated net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2007 was $304 million compared with $309 million for the comparable prior-year period. Our net income includes income from discontinued operations related primarily to sales of commercial properties by SunCor of $9 million in the current period and $2 million in the prior-year period. Income from continuing operations decreased $12 million in the period-to-period comparison, reflecting the following changes in earnings:
 
 
Additional details on the major factors that increased (decreased) net income for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2007 compared with the prior-year period are contained in the following table (dollars in millions):
Regulated Electricity Segment Revenues
     Regulated electricity segment revenues were $225 million higher for the nine months ended September 30, 2007 compared with the prior-year period primarily because of:
 
Real Estate Segment Revenues
     Real estate segment revenues were $145 million lower for the nine months ended September 30, 2007 compared with the prior-year period primarily because of:
All Other Revenues
     Marketing and trading revenues were $5 million higher for the nine months ended September 30, 2007 compared with the prior-year period primarily because of higher competitive retail sales volumes in California and higher mark-to-market gains because of changes in forward prices.
     Other revenues were $8 million higher for the nine months ended September 30, 2007 compared to the prior-year period primarily as a result of increased sales by APSES of energy-related products and services.

Exhibit 99.9
PHOENIX  Benefiting from one of the hottest Arizona summers on record, Pinnacle West Capital Corp. (NYSE: PNW) today reported consolidated net income for the quarter ended September 30, 2007, of $208.7 million, or $2.07 per diluted share of common stock. This result compares with $184.2 million, or $1.84 per diluted share, for the same period in 2006.
"Our improved results were driven by higher retail sales at Arizona Public Service (APS) as a result of hotter than normal temperatures," said Pinnacle West Chairman Bill Post. The extreme weather in the quarter  punctuated by a record 32 days with highs of 110 degrees or higher in the Phoenix metropolitan area and by the hottest August on record  improved the Company's earnings by $16 million, or $0.16 per share.
In addition to the weather effects, the 2007 third quarter also was positively impacted by tax benefits of $10 million, or $0.10 per share, related to prior years. Solid customer growth was offset by increases in operating and maintenance costs for generation and customer service; and lower results from the Company's real estate operations.
APS reported net income of $204.3 million for the third quarter of 2007, compared with net income of $168.6 million for the same period a year ago. The Company benefited from strong operational performance at the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station (which achieved a site average capacity factor of 89 percent); increased retail sales of 6.4 percent; and retail customer growth of 3.2 percent.
"Even with a slowing housing market, our growth continues at a fairly strong level of 3.2 percent compared with our ten-year average of 3.8 percent," Post said. "Our state's rapidly growing population requires continuing infrastructure investments. Over the next five years, we expect to spend about $1 billion annually on transmission, distribution and generation infrastructure to meet our customers' needs and support Arizona's economy."
SunCor Development Co., Pinnacle West's real estate subsidiary, reported net income of $6.0 million, compared with $17.5 million in the 2006 third quarter. The decrease was primarily due to lower sales of residential property and land parcels attributable to the effects of deteriorating credit markets.
