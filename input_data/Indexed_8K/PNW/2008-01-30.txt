     On January 30, 2008, Pinnacle West Capital Corporation (the "Company" or "Pinnacle West") issued a press release regarding its financial results for its fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2007. A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.9.

2008 Earnings Outlook
     In this discussion, earnings per share amounts are after income taxes and are based on diluted common shares outstanding. The earnings guidance in this Form 8-K supersedes all previous earnings guidance provided by Pinnacle West.
     We estimate that our base level of consolidated earnings for 2008 will be within a reasonable range of $2.50 per share. We currently expect Arizona Public Service Company ("APS") 2008 earnings to be basically flat compared with 2007, excluding the effects of abnormal weather and prior years' tax adjustments. These estimates assume a March 1, 2008 effective date for APS' request pending before the Arizona Corporation Commission (the "ACC") for a $30 million increase in pretax annual retail revenues under an ACC-approved transmission cost adjustment mechanism and do not include any potential earnings effect from proposed amendments to APS' line extension schedule (see below). We currently estimate that 2008 net income for our real estate subsidiary, SunCor Development Company ("SunCor"), will be approximately $20 million, reflecting continued weakness in the western United States real estate markets.
     For additional information regarding the retail transmission cost adjustment request pending before the ACC and the related Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC") rate case, see "FERC Rate Case" in Note 5 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in the Pinnacle West/APS Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2007 (the "September 2007 Form 10-Q") and "FERC Rate Case" in the Pinnacle West/APS Current Report on Form 8-K filed December 31, 2007. For information on the proposed line extension amendments, see "APS General Rate Case and Power Supply Adjustor" in Note 5 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated

Forward-Looking Statements
     Our earnings forecasts are subject to numerous risks, including those described below. This Form 8-K contains forward-looking statements regarding our 2008 earnings outlook. Neither the Company nor APS assumes any obligation to update these statements or make any further statements on any of these issues, except as required by applicable law. Because actual results may differ materially from expectations, we caution readers not to place undue reliance on these statements. A number of factors could cause future results to differ materially from historical results, or from results or outcomes currently expected or sought by Pinnacle West or APS. In addition to the Risk Factors described in Item 1A of the Pinnacle West/APS Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006, these factors include, but are not limited to, state and federal regulatory and legislative decisions and actions, particularly those affecting our rates and our recovery of fuel and purchased power costs; the ongoing restructuring of the electric industry, including the introduction of retail electric competition in Arizona and decisions impacting wholesale competition; the outcome of regulatory, legislative and judicial proceedings, both current and future, relating to the restructuring and environmental matters (including those related to climate change); market prices for electricity and natural gas; power plant performance and outages; transmission outages and constraints; weather variations affecting local and regional customer energy usage; customer growth and energy usage; regional economic and market conditions, including the results of litigation and other proceedings resulting from the California energy situation, volatile fuel and purchased power costs and the completion of generation and transmission construction in the region, which could affect customer growth and the cost of power supplies; the cost of debt and equity capital and access to capital markets; current credit ratings remaining in effect for any given period of time; our ability to compete successfully outside traditional regulated markets (including the wholesale market); the performance of our marketing and trading activities due to volatile market liquidity and any deteriorating counterparty credit and the use of derivative contracts in our business (including the interpretation of the subjective and complex accounting rules related to these contracts); changes in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and the interpretation of those principles; the performance of the stock market and the changing interest rate environment, which affect the value of our nuclear decommissioning trust, pension, and other postretirement benefit plan assets, the amount of required contributions to Pinnacle West's pension plan and contributions to APS' nuclear decommissioning trust funds, as well as the reported costs of providing pension and other postretirement benefits; technological developments in the electric industry; the strength of the real estate market in SunCor's market areas, which include Arizona, Idaho, New Mexico and Utah; and other uncertainties, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond the control of Pinnacle West and APS.

Exhibit 99.9
PHOENIX  Pinnacle West Capital Corporation (NYSE: PNW) today reported consolidated net income for the quarter ended December 31, 2007, of $2.9 million, or $0.03 per diluted share of common stock. This result compares with net income of $18.5 million, or $0.18 per diluted share, for the same quarter a year ago.
The quarterly results were impacted by lower results from the Company's utility and real estate operations. Arizona Public Service (APS), the Company's principal subsidiary, reported net income of $0.3 million, compared with earnings of $12.9 million for the same period a year ago. In addition, real estate subsidiary SunCor Development Co. reported lower net income of $8.1 million, compared with $11.4 million in the final quarter of 2006, reflecting a continued slowdown in the western U.S. real estate markets.
The 2007 fourth-quarter earnings were negatively impacted by increased operation and maintenance costs primarily related to power plant maintenance and planned overhauls, as well as higher customer service, depreciation and other growth-related costs. These factors more than offset increased retail sales at APS primarily due to customer growth of 2.6 percent.
"Arizona's growth and the increasing demand for energy require additional capital investment," said Chairman Bill Post. "Meeting this growth  and finding a way to effectively pay for and recover the associated costs  will require a transparent, collaborative and forward-looking process with all our stakeholders. We are committed to working with our customers, communities and regulators to find solutions to these challenges."
Post added that in 2007 the Company's employees continued meeting the challenges of growth in Arizona. The Company recorded all-time best results in measures such as customer outage frequency and average outage duration, all while setting 35,000 new meters and managing one of the hottest summers on record. APS' top-tier customer service also was recognized in 2007 survey results from J.D. Power and Associates. APS was rated number two among investor-owned electric utilities in the West for superior customer satisfaction by both residential and business customers.
 
For the year 2007 as a whole, Pinnacle West's consolidated net income decreased 6 percent to $307.1 million, or $3.05 per share, compared with 2006 net income of $327.3 million, or $3.27 per diluted share. APS reported earnings of $283.9 million during the same period compared with $269.7 million in 2006. And, SunCor reported net income of $23.7 million, down from $60.5 million for the same period a year ago.
