Item 8.01. Other Events
2008 General Rate Case
     On March 24, 2008, Arizona Public Service Company ("APS") filed a request with the Arizona Corporation Commission (the "ACC") for a net rate increase of $265.5 million for retail customers effective no later than July 1, 2009. As proposed by APS, the request would result in an average rate increase of 8.1% for existing customers plus the establishment of a new growth-related impact fee charged to new connections. The filing is based on a test year ended September 30, 2007, adjusted as described below. APS expects the ACC to issue a procedural schedule during the next several months detailing the timeline for addressing the request.
     The key financial provisions of the request include:
     In addition, APS requested various modifications to the Environmental Improvement Surcharge (the "EIS"), the Demand Side Management Adjustment Clause (the "DSMAC"), and the Transmission Cost Adjustor. The proposed modifications to the EIS and the DSMAC will allow APS to expand its conservation and demand-side management programs and support environmental upgrades to APS facilities in response to and in anticipation of future environmental requirements.

Exhibit 99.1
COMMISSIONERS
MIKE GLEASON, Chairman WILLIAM A. MUNDELL JEFF HATCH-MILLER KRISTIN K. MAYES GARY PIERCE
     APS's current rates and charges do not recover the cost of providing service today, let alone in the future. Consequently, they do not produce a reasonable return on the fair value of its property devoted to public service and are therefore unjust and unreasonable as a matter of law. , 80 Ariz. 146, 294 P.2d 378 (1956); , 200 Ariz. 85, 22 P. 3d 905 (App. 2001). Indeed, as the Company demonstrated in its last rate case, the rates established by Decision No. 69663 (June 28, 2007) were inadequate the day they were implemented. This is because earnings attrition continued from the end of the test period in that proceeding (September 30, 2005) through the date of Decision No. 69663  some 21 months later  but was not recognized by such Decision in any meaningful fashion. Moreover, from September 30, 2005 through July 1, 2009, APS will have placed
Simms v. Round Valley Light & Power Co.
Arizona Consumers Council v. Arizona Corporation Commission
 
another $928 million (net jurisdictional investment) of facilities into service to its customers  none of which investment has been reflected in retail rates.
     Inadequate rates are not just a problem for investors or some abstract legal issue. They prevent APS from maintaining the financial strength it needs to do its job, which is to provide safe and reliable electric service to the public. Inadequate rates today also invariably lead to even higher rates to consumers in the future.
     Pursuant to A.R.S. 40-222, 40-250, 40-251 and A.A.C. R14-2-102 and R14-2-103, Arizona Public Service Company ("APS" or "Company") hereby files the instant Application for a permanent base rate increase in non-fuel rates of $252.6 million. The requested increase is based on adjusted test year sales and expenses for the Company's jurisdictional electric operations during the twelve months ending September 30, 2007 ("Test Year"), and APS is requesting the increase to become effective no later than July 1, 2009. A.A.C. R14-2-103 (B) (11).
See
     In addition, APS is seeking to increase its base fuel cost by $119.1 million over the level established in the Company's last rate proceeding ($101 million over the Test Year level of fuel costs), effectively reclassifying current Power Supply Adjustor ("PSA") revenues as base fuel revenues as called for in the Commission-approved Plan of Administration for the PSA. Although the Company's Application herein reflects this fuel cost increase as part of the total base rate increase ($371.7 million) shown on Schedule A-1 of the Commission's Standard Rate Case Filing Requirements ("SFR's"), after taking into consideration the reclassification of such fuel costs to base rates, the net increase in base rates would be $265.5 million, as is also shown on Schedule A-1.
1
 
 
     The requested increase in non-fuel base rates includes an $86.6 million allowance for attrition caused by regulatory lag from the end of the Test Year to 2010. APS is proposing to collect up to $53 million of that attrition amount through a new "hook-up" or "impact" fee that would be applicable only to new APS customers at a new service location. Thus, if such proposal is adopted and taking also into consideration the reclassification of fuel costs from PSA rates (which APS customers are already paying) to the base fuel rate described above, the impact of the instant request on APS customer bills in 2009 will be considerably less than $265.5 million.

     In 2008 (the first full year the rates established by Decision No. 69663 are to be in effect), APS will earn only 7.2% on equity compared to the 10.75% found reasonable by Decision No. 69663. SFR Schedule F-1. Absent meaningful non-fuel rate relief in this proceeding, equity returns will fall to 6.8% next year and a paltry 6.1% the following year. The returns on fair value fall even more precipitously and are confiscatory by any definition of that term. 113 Ariz. 368, 370, 555 P.2d 326, 328 (1976)("Prospectively, the rate may well become confiscatory" if it does not allow the company a fair rate of return.).

Id.
Arizona Corporation Commission v. Arizona Public Service Co.,
     In this Application, APS has proposed several specific adjustments to the historical Test Year that will address the undeniable impacts of attrition  impacts that the Commission must address in this proceeding and impacts that APS can no longer endure
 
 
if it is to avoid a chronic pattern of rate cases that invariably result in inadequate relief and a diminished capacity to face the challenges of the future in a fast-growing state such as Arizona. These adjustments include the inclusion in rate base of plant under construction at the close of the Test Year but going into service prior to July 1, 2009 (and in some instances much sooner) as well as a specific attrition pro forma.
     All of the plant referenced above will be in service within two years of the close of the Test Year. Some of it, such as the new steam generators at Palo Verde, is already in service and providing substantial benefits to APS customers. Other examples include important environmental improvements to the Cholla plant (improvements necessary to keep that plant available to APS customers) that will be complete by this summer, as well as the new Yucca generating units under construction for improved reliability in Yuma. The Commission has authorized inclusion in rate base of post-Test Year plant on numerous occasions. And, the Arizona Supreme Court has gone so far as to characterize as "entirely reasonable" the Commission's inclusion in rate base of plant that was anticipated to be in service (and thus far more than two years following the then test period). , 123 Ariz. 228, 230, 599 P.2d 184, 186 (1979). 113 Ariz. 368, 371, 555 P.2d 326, 329 (1976)("It is obvious that the Commission can consider matters subsequent to the historic test year. . . . Construction projects contracted for and commenced during the historical year may certainly be considered by the Commission . . . ."); ., 120 Ariz. 184, 189, 584 P.2d 1175, 1180 (App. 1978)(constitutional requirements "may, at the administrative level, require the Commission to consider post test year evidence on due process grounds.").
within two years of when rates were set
Arizona Community Action Ass'n v. Arizona Corporation Commission
See also Arizona Corporation Commission v. Arizona Public Service Co.,
Arizona Corporation Commission v. Citizens Utilities Co
     After making this and other pro forma adjustment to the Test Year to reflect known and measurable changes, APS made a further adjustment to account for the remaining
 
effects of attrition during the likely pendency of this case. Contrary to the assertion made in Decision No. 69663, significant attrition  and especially attrition that exists even prior to rates being established  is not supposed to be the normal outcome of ratemaking and cannot be "cured" simply by subsequent rate filings. Rather, attrition represents a breakdown of that ratemaking process that must be redressed by the Commission through specific regulatory actions. This was recognized in at least two prior APS rate decisions under circumstances startlingly similar to those now affecting APS. Decision No. 48139 (August 1, 1977) stated at pages 15-16: "Because this is for a historic period, the Company will never earn the rates allowed. Attrition will set in. . . . We think it is appropriate to allow a 4% attrition factor per year in the earnings of the Company." Similarly, in Decision No. 51009 (May 29, 1980) at page 20, the Commission found that: "[T]he Commission may include a factor for attrition in determining what rates the company may be authorized to charge. . . .[B]y use of this approach, the Commission is attempting to evaluate, and compensate, for a very real phenomenon." The Company's proposed impact fee is intended to provide the Commission an option to collect most of this attrition without affecting current APS customers.
     By looking backwards to set rates in a time of substantial growth, with the implicit but erroneous assumption that costs and revenues will increase proportionately, the Commission's rate setting practices necessarily prohibit the Company from realizing a fair return on its invested equity. Using a historical test year without accounting for known or reasonably anticipated attrition ensures that no rate set by the Commission will ever compensate the Company for the value of its property at the time the property is being used, as constitutionally required. 262 U.S. 679, 690 (1923) ["Rates which are not sufficient to yield a reasonable return on the value of the property used are unjust, unreasonable and confiscatory, and their
Bluefield Water Works & Improvement Co. v. Public Service Commission of West Virginia,
at the time it is being used to render the service
 
enforcement deprives the public utility company of its property in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment." (Emphasis supplied.)]
     In addition, the rate increase sought is required to enable the Company to maintain its credit ratings, attract new capital on reasonable terms, and recover its costs of service. These criteria represent both the conditions necessary for APS to provide safe and reliable service to the public and those necessary to satisfy the Commission's obligations under both the Arizona and United States Constitutions. ., 85 Ariz. 198, 200, 335 P.2d 412, 414 (1959)("[I]f [the Commission] refuses to consider all the relevant factors, the fair value of the properties cannot have been determined under our Constitution."). As it is, this increase will not permit APS to recover past earnings shortfalls or fully earn a reasonable rate of return going forward on the fair value of its assets devoted to public service. Rather, the return resulting from the APS rate request will do no more than recover the Company's capital costs necessarily and prudently incurred in rendering adequate utility service to customers.
Id. See also Arizona Corporation Commission v. Arizona Water Co
     There are several major components of the Company's request. Specifically, APS is seeking that (1) the Commission recognize the higher fuel and purchased power expenses that are being incurred by the Company by increasing the base fuel rate from $.032491 per kWh to $.0366 per kWh; (2) the Commission allow APS to include in rates at cost of service the Yucca generation assets, the construction of which was specifically authorized by Decision No. 69400 (March 30, 2007), as well as other plant investments made prior to the time the rates requested in this proceeding will become effective; and (3) the Commission authorize a return of fair value rate base or otherwise account for attrition in a manner that allows APS an opportunity to earn an 11.5% return on equity after the rates established in this proceeding become effective.
 
      APS is further requesting:
     In addition to these and the changes to the EIS, TCA and DSMAC discussed above, APS is proposing several new rate programs or modifications of existing rates to allow participating customers to better manage their energy costs and provide long-term benefits to the Company and its customers. These include a new residential time-of-use ("TOU") option that reflects a "super peak" period of 3-6 p.m. during July, August and September  the three hottest months of the year  as well as a conservation tier to the Company's most popular residential non-TOU rate. APS is also proposing, in response to a Commission initiative in Decision No. 69663, a "critical peak pricing" ("CPP") program
 
for commercial, industrial and other non-residential customers. This program will provide incentives for participating customers to shed significant electric load when called upon by APS for the top 90 hours of system demand during the year. APS's existing TOU programs are already the most successful in the country both in terms of number of participants and percentage of customers participating, while the CPP proposal would be the first implemented by a Commission-regulated utility.
