2008 Earnings Outlook
     In this discussion, earnings per share amounts are after income taxes and are based on diluted common shares outstanding. The earnings guidance in this Form 8-K supersedes all previous earnings guidance provided by Pinnacle West. Our earnings forecasts are subject to numerous risks, including those described under "Forward-Looking Statements" below.
      We currently estimate that our consolidated earnings for 2008 will be within a reasonable range of $2.50 per share. Although our current estimate is consistent with our previous guidance, it reflects changes in certain components. We currently estimate that Arizona Public Service Company ("APS") will contribute substantially all of the 2008 earnings. We estimate that APS' 2008 earnings will be higher than previously expected for a number of reasons, including but not limited to: increased wholesale revenues, favorable first-quarter 2008 weather, favorable mark-to-market valuations related to fuel hedges, favorable resolutions of various tax matters, and an assumed mid-2008 transmission revenue increase. We expect these favorable effects will be partially offset by lower customer growth reflecting economic conditions. As a result of the weak real estate market, we currently estimate that the 2008 earnings contribution by SunCor Development Company ("SunCor") will be minimal.
      For information on our prior 2008 guidance, see the Pinnacle West/APS Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 30, 2008. For information on transmission revenue increases, see "Rate Requests for Transmission and Ancillary Services" in Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Pinnacle West/APS Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2007.
Forward-Looking Statements
     Our earnings forecasts are subject to numerous risks, including those described below. This Form 8-K contains forward-looking statements regarding our 2008 earnings outlook. Neither the Company nor APS assumes any obligation to update these statements or make any further statements on any of these issues, except as required by applicable law. Because actual results may differ materially from expectations, we caution readers not to place undue reliance on these statements. A number of factors could cause future results to differ materially from historical results, or from results or outcomes currently expected or sought by Pinnacle West or APS. In addition to the Risk Factors described in Item 1A of the Pinnacle West/APS Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2007, these factors include, but are not limited to, state and federal regulatory and legislative decisions and actions, including the outcome or timing of the rate case filed with the ACC on March 24, 2008; the outcome of regulatory, legislative and judicial proceedings, both current and future, relating to the restructuring of the electric industry and environmental matters (including those related to climate change); the ongoing restructuring of the electric industry, including decisions impacting wholesale competition and the introduction of retail electric competition in Arizona; fluctuations in market prices for electricity, natural gas, coal, uranium and other fuels used in our generating facilities, and supplies of such commodities; volatile market liquidity, any deteriorating counterparty credit and the use of derivative contracts in our business (including the interpretation of the subjective and complex accounting rules related to these

contracts); power plant performance and outages; transmission outages and constraints; weather variations affecting local and regional customer energy usage; customer growth and energy usage; regional economic and market conditions, including the results of litigation and other proceedings resulting from the California and Pacific Northwest energy situations, volatile fuel and purchased power costs, and the completion of generation and transmission construction in the region, which could affect customer growth and the cost of power supplies; ability of power plant participants to meet contractual or other obligations; the cost of debt and equity capital and access to capital markets; current credit ratings remaining in effect for any given period of time; our ability to compete successfully outside traditional regulated markets (including the wholesale market); changes in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and the interpretation of those principles; the performance of the stock market and the changing interest rate environment, which affect the value of our nuclear decommissioning trusts, pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets, the amount of required contributions to Pinnacle West's pension plan and contributions to APS' nuclear decommissioning trust funds, as well as the reported costs of providing pension and other postretirement benefits; technological developments in the electric industry; the strength of the real estate market in SunCor's market areas, which include Arizona, Idaho, New Mexico and Utah; and other uncertainties, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond the control of Pinnacle West and APS.

     Additional details on the major factors that increased (decreased) net income for the three-month period ended March 31, 2008 compared with the prior-year period are contained in the following table (dollars in millions):
Regulated Electricity Segment Revenues
     Regulated electricity segment revenues were $87 million higher for the three months ended March 31, 2008 compared with the prior-year period primarily because of:
 
Real Estate Segment Revenues
     Real estate segment revenues were $29 million lower for the three months ended March 31, 2008 compared with the prior-year period primarily because of the weak real estate market.
All Other Revenues
     All other revenues were $16 million lower for the three months ended March 31, 2008 compared with the prior-year period primarily due to a $15 million decrease in marketing and trading revenues as a result of lower mark-to-market gains because of changes in forward prices and lower sales volumes.

Exhibit 99.9
PHOENIX  Pinnacle West Capital Corporation (NYSE: PNW) today reported a consolidated net loss for the quarter ended March 31, 2008, of $4.5 million, or $0.04 per diluted share of common stock. This result compares with net income of $16.5 million, or $0.16 per share, for the first quarter of 2007.
Rising costs incurred by Arizona Public Service Co. (APS) to maintain and expand its electric system to sustain Arizona's growth, and decreased earnings from Pinnacle West's real estate operations, drove the lower results.
APS reported a net loss of $6.4 million for the 2008 first quarter, compared with net income of $4.3 million in the 2007 first quarter. APS' increased operating costs in 2008 were related to a greater number of planned power plant overhauls and system maintenance, as well as higher customer service costs. Increased depreciation and interest costs related to growth also dampened the quarterly results. Higher retail sales, primarily due to customer growth, partially offset the increased costs.
SunCor Development Co. reported a net loss of $0.9 million for the current-year first quarter, compared with earnings of $9.3 million for the same period a year ago. SunCor's results reflect the distressed national real estate market.
"Arizona continues to grow even with a slower economy. To support current growth levels, we must continue building more electricity infrastructure at a time when basic building materials (such as steel, copper, aluminum and concrete) for providing electricity are at record-high prices," said Chairman Bill Post. "As a result, our costs for constructing needed facilities and maintaining APS' existing electric service continue to increase."
In a continuing effort to mitigate the rising costs, Post said the Company's focus on cost-management remains a top priority. As previously reported, the Company has streamlined its organizational structure to better serve APS' customers and is eliminating about 300 positions. These moves  and other operating cost reductions  are expected to decrease APS' operating costs by $14 million annually.

Based in Phoenix, Pinnacle West has consolidated assets of about $11 billion. Through its subsidiaries, the Company generates, sells and delivers electricity and sells energy-related products and services to retail and wholesale customers in the western United States.

The Company assumes no obligation to update this statement or to make any further statement on this issue, except as required by applicable law. Because actual results may differ materially from our expectations, the Company cautions readers not to place undue reliance on this statement. A number of factors could cause future results to differ materially from the results we currently expect. These factors include our ability to eliminate positions while maintaining required reliability and customer service levels and unexpected developments that would require us not to eliminate all or a portion of these positions or to reinstate all of a portion of these or other positions.
