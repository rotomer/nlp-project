2008 General Rate Case
     The financial schedules, testimony and other data contained in Arizona Public Service Company's ("APS") March 24, 2008 rate case filing (the "March Filing") reflected a test year ended September 30, 2007. The Arizona Corporation Commission ("ACC") staff requested that APS update the March Filing to reflect a test year ended December 31, 2007. Although APS concluded that the March Filing complied with applicable ACC test year requirements, to prevent further delays in processing the rate request, APS agreed to file the updated information on or before June 3, 2008. The ACC staff has agreed to complete its review of the updated information no later than 30 days after APS makes its revised submission. A copy of the ACC staff's letter dated May 6, 2008 is attached as Exhibit 99.1. For additional information regarding the rate case, see the Pinnacle We st Capital Corporation/APS Report on Form 8-K filed March 24, 2008.
