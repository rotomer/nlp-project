Item 8.01. Other Events
2008 General Rate Case
     On June 2, 2008, Arizona Public Service Company ("APS") filed with the Arizona Corporation Commission (the "ACC") updated financial statements, testimony and other data in the general rate case originally filed on March 24, 2008. As requested by the ACC staff, the updated information reflects a test year ended December 31, 2007, rather than the September 30, 2007 test year used in APS' original filing. As a result of the updated filing, APS is requesting a net rate increase of $278.2 million for retail customers effective no later than October 1, 2009. The original filing requested a net rate increase of $265.5 million for retail customers. As proposed by APS, the updated request would result in an average rate increase of 8.5% for existing customers plus the establishment of a new growth-related impact fee charged to new connections.
     The key financial provisions of the updated request include:
     The update also requests that the ACC adopt certain goals for APS to improve its financial strength which include: allowing APS' internal cash flow generation to cover its operating and capital costs of providing service; stabilizing and improving APS' credit ratings; and providing a meaningful and ongoing opportunity for APS to achieve a reasonable return on the fair value of its property. The other primary components of the updated request remain essentially unchanged from APS' March 24, 2008 original filing. For additional information regarding APS' original filing, which except as set forth above remains part of the updated filing, see "2008 General Rate Case" in Note 5 to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in the Pinnacle West Capital Corporation/APS Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2008.

Exhibit 99.1
COMMISSIONERS
MIKE GLEASON, Chairman WILLIAM A. MUNDELL JEFF HATCH-MILLER KRISTIN K. MAYES GARY PIERCE
     As noted in its original Application dated March 24, 2008, Arizona Public Service Company's ("APS" or "Company") current rates and charges do not recover the cost of providing service today, let alone in the future. Consequently, they do not produce a reasonable return on the fair value of its property devoted to public service and are therefore unjust and unreasonable as a matter of law. , 80 Ariz. 146, 294 P.2d 378 (1956); , 200 Ariz. 85, 22 P. 3d 905 (App. 2001). Indeed, as the Company demonstrated in its last rate case, the rates established by Decision No. 69663 (June 28, 2007) were inadequate the day they were implemented. This is because earnings attrition continued from the end of the test period in that proceeding (September 30, 2005) through the date of Decision No. 69663  some 21 months later  but was not recognized by such Decision in any meaningful fashion. Moreover, from the end of the September 30, 2005 test year used to set the rates authorized by Decision No. 69663 through
Simms v. Round Valley Light & Power Co.
Arizona Consumers Council v. Arizona Corporation Commission
 
October 1, 2009, APS will have placed another $956 million (net jurisdictional investment) of facilities into service to its customers  none of which investment has been reflected in retail rates.
     Inadequate rates are not just a problem for investors or some abstract legal issue. They prevent APS from maintaining the financial strength it needs to do its job, which is to provide safe and reliable electric service to the public. Inadequate rates today also invariably lead to even higher rates to consumers in the future. Consistent with that theme, APS strongly urges the Commission to identify and adopt specific financial goals for APS that will assure the Company's ability to build needed infrastructure, to adopt the new technologies, and to enhance the sustainability of Arizona's economy. APS believes those goals should include: (1) reaching the regulatory equivalent of a "balanced budget" where APS is able to "pay as it goes" for the capital and operating costs of providing service; (2) first stabilizing and then systematically improving its credit metrics to achieve solid investment grade ratings (BBB+ or even A-); and (3) providing a meaningful and ongoing opportunity for APS to achieve a reasonable return on the fair value of its property.
     APS witness and President Donald Brandt will suggest one means of breaking out of the current downward spiral affecting the Company and moving forward to the future. Specifically, this would involve a post-order proceeding to be conducted the year after rates from this case are set to ensure both that APS has the opportunity to earn its authorized rate of return and a reasonable return on Fair Value, and that it is on target for long-term financial stability and improvement. Mr. Brandt's proposal is likely not the only means to accomplish this purpose. Various Commissioners have suggested that Arizona look for creative solutions that are different from the "business as usual" approaches of the past to address the issues raised by Arizona's growth and the impact of such growth, as well as commodity price inflation, on Arizona utilities and their customers. The Company looks forward to the opportunity of discussing these vital issues with the Commission, Commission Staff, and other interested parties. This rate
 
proceeding and the Company's resource alternatives proposal (and perhaps other ongoing proceedings as well), provide a collective opportunity for the Commission to both formulate regulatory goals and implement procedures to make those goals possible of achievement.
     Pursuant to A.R.S. 40-222, 40-250, 40-251 and A.A.C. R14-2-102 and R14-2-103, Arizona Public Service Company ("APS" or "Company") hereby files the instant Amended Application for a permanent increase in non-fuel base rates of $264.3 million. As agreed to by the Company and Commission Staff, the requested increase is based on adjusted test year sales and expenses for the Company's jurisdictional electric operations during the twelve months ending December 31, 2007 ("Test Year"). APS is requesting the increase to become effective no later than October 1, 2009. A.A.C. R14-2-103 (B) (11).
See
     In addition, APS is seeking to increase its base fuel cost by $183.9 million over the level established in the Company's last rate proceeding, effectively reclassifying current and anticipated Power Supply Adjustor ("PSA") revenues as base fuel revenues as called for in the Commission-approved Plan of Administration for the PSA. The Company's Amended Application is required by Commission rule to reflect this base fuel cost increase as part of the total base rate increase ($448.2 million) shown on Schedule A-1 of the Commission's Standard Rate Case Filing Requirements ("SFR's"). But, after taking into consideration the reclassification of such PSA revenues to base rates, the net increase in rates would be $278.2 million, as is also shown on Schedule A-1. And, even this figure overstates the potential impact in 2009 of the Company's request on existing APS customer bills.

     The requested increase in non-fuel base rates includes a $79.3 million allowance for attrition and measures the impact of regulatory lag through 2010, the first full year new rates would be in effect. APS is proposing to collect up to $53 million of that attrition amount through a new "hook-up" or "impact" fee that would be applicable only to APS customers at a new service location. Thus, if such proposal is adopted and taking also into consideration the reclassification of fuel revenues from PSA rates (which APS customers will already be paying by 2009) to the base fuel rate described above, the incremental impact of the instant request on APS customer bills in 2009 will be considerably less than $278.2 million.
     In 2008 (the first full year the rates established by Decision No. 69663 are to be in effect), APS will earn only 7.8% on equity compared to the 10.75% found reasonable by Decision No. 69663. SFR Schedule F-1. Absent meaningful non-fuel rate relief in this proceeding, equity returns will fall to 6.2% next year and a paltry 5.4% the following year. The returns on fair value fall even more precipitously and are confiscatory by any definition of that term. 113 Ariz. 368, 370, 555 P.2d 326, 328 (1976)("Prospectively, the rate may well become confiscatory" if it does not allow the company a fair rate of return.).

Id.
Arizona Corporation Commission v. Arizona Public Service Co.,
     In this Amended Application, APS has proposed several specific adjustments to the historical Test Year that will address the undeniable impacts of attrition. These are impacts that the Commission must address in this proceeding and impacts that APS can no longer endure because the alternative  a chronic pattern of rate cases that invariably result in inadequate relief and a diminished capacity to face the challenges of the future in
 
 
a fast-growing state such as Arizona  is simply unworkable. These adjustments include the inclusion in rate base of plant under construction at the close of the Test Year but going into service prior to October 1, 2009 (and in some instances much sooner) as well as a specific attrition pro forma adjustment.
     All of the plant referenced above will be in service within two years of the close of the Test Year. Some of it, such as the new steam generators at Palo Verde, is already in service and providing substantial benefits to APS customers. Other examples include important environmental improvements to the Cholla plant (improvements necessary to keep that plant available to APS customers) that will be complete by this summer, as well as the new Yucca generating units under construction for improved reliability in Yuma. The Commission has authorized inclusion in rate base of post-Test Year plant on numerous occasions, including in both of the Company's last two rate proceedings. And, the Arizona Supreme Court has gone so far as to characterize as "entirely reasonable" the Commission's inclusion in rate base of plant that was anticipated to be in service (and thus far more than two years following the then test period). , 123 Ariz. 228, 230, 599 P.2d 184, 186 (1979). 113 Ariz. 368, 371, 555 P.2d 326, 329 (1976)("It is obvious that the Commission can consider matters subsequent to the historic test year. . . . Construction projects contracted for and commenced during the historical year may certainly be considered by the Commission . . . ."); ., 120 Ariz. 184, 189, 584 P.2d 1175, 1180 (App. 1978)(constitutional requirements "may, at the administrative level, require the Commission to consider post test year evidence on due process grounds.").
within two years of when rates were set

See also Arizona Corporation Commission v. Arizona Public Service Co.,
Arizona Corporation Commission v. Citizens Utilities Co
     After making this and other pro forma adjustment to the Test Year to reflect known and measurable changes, APS made a further adjustment to account for the remaining
 
effects of attrition during the likely pendency of this case. Contrary to the assertion made in Decision No. 69663, significant attrition  and especially attrition that exists even prior to rates being established  is not supposed to be the normal outcome of ratemaking and cannot be "cured" simply by subsequent rate filings. Rather, attrition represents a breakdown of that ratemaking process that must be redressed by the Commission through specific regulatory actions. This was recognized in at least two prior APS rate decisions under circumstances startlingly similar to those now affecting APS. Decision No. 48139 (August 1, 1977) stated at pages 15-16: "Because this is for a historic period, the Company will never earn the rates allowed. Attrition will set in. . . . We think it is appropriate to allow a 4% attrition factor per year in the earnings of the Company." Similarly, in Decision No. 51009 (May 29, 1980) at page 20, the Commission found that: "[T]he Commission may include a factor for attrition in determining what rates the company may be authorized to charge. . . .[B]y use of this approach, the Commission is attempting to evaluate, and compensate, for a very real phenomenon." The Company's proposed impact fee is intended to provide the Commission an option to collect much of this attrition without affecting current APS customers.
     By looking backwards to set rates in a time of substantial growth, with the implicit but erroneous assumption that costs and revenues will increase proportionately, the Commission's rate setting practices necessarily prohibit the Company from realizing a fair return on its invested equity. Using a historical test year without accounting for known or reasonably anticipated attrition ensures that no rate set by the Commission will ever compensate the Company for the value of its property at the time the property is being used, as constitutionally required. 262 U.S. 679, 690 (1923) ["Rates which are not sufficient to yield a reasonable return on the value of the property used are unjust, unreasonable and confiscatory, and their
Bluefield Water Works & Improvement Co. v. Public Service Commission of West Virginia,
at the time it is being used to render the service
 
enforcement deprives the public utility company of its property in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment." (Emphasis supplied.)]
     In addition, the rate increase sought is required to enable the Company to maintain its credit ratings, attract new capital on reasonable terms, and recover its costs of service. These criteria represent both the conditions necessary for APS to provide safe and reliable service to the public and those necessary to satisfy the Commission's obligations under both the Arizona and United States Constitutions. ., 85 Ariz. 198, 200, 335 P.2d 412, 414 (1959)("[I]f [the Commission] refuses to consider all the relevant factors, the fair value of the properties cannot have been determined under our Constitution."). As it is, this increase will not permit APS to recover past earnings shortfalls or fully earn a reasonable rate of return going forward on the fair value of its assets devoted to public service. Rather, the return resulting from the APS rate request will do no more than recover the Company's capital costs necessarily and prudently incurred in rendering adequate utility service to customers.
Id. See also Arizona Corporation Commission v. Arizona Water Co
     There are several major components of the Company's request. Specifically, APS is seeking that: (1) the Commission recognize the higher fuel and purchased power expenses that are being incurred by the Company by increasing the base fuel rate from $.032491 per kWh to $.038783 per kWh; (2) the Commission allow APS to include in rates at cost of service the Yucca generation assets, the construction of which was specifically authorized by Decision No. 69400 (March 30, 2007), as well as other plant investments made prior to the time the rates requested in this proceeding will become effective; (3) the Commission authorize a return on fair value rate base or otherwise account for attrition in a manner that allows APS a reasonable opportunity to earn an 11.5% return on equity after the rates established in this proceeding become effective; (4)
 
the Commission establish as financial goals for APS the improvement in its internal generation of funds for construction to a level close if not equal to 100%, the reasonable opportunity to earn a reasonable return on an ongoing basis, and the improvement of its credit rating to at least a high BBB; and (5) the Commission implement in this proceeding a regulatory mechanism that can achieve these financial goals, which mechanism could include a post-order proceeding of the sort described in APS witness Brandt's Testimony.
     APS is further requesting:
     In addition to these and the changes to the EIS, TCA and DSMAC discussed above, APS is proposing several new rate programs or modifications of existing rates to
 
allow participating customers to better manage their energy costs and provide long-term benefits to the Company and its customers. These include a new residential time-of-use ("TOU") option that reflects a "super peak" period of 3-6 p.m. during July, August and September  the three hottest months of the year  as well as a conservation tier to the Company's most popular residential non-TOU rate. APS is also proposing, in response to a Commission initiative in Decision No. 69663, a "critical peak pricing" ("CPP") program for commercial, industrial and other non-residential customers. This program will provide incentives for participating customers to shed significant electric load when called upon by APS for the top 90 hours of system demand during the year. APS's existing TOU programs are already the most successful in the country both in terms of number of participants and percentage of customers participating, while the CPP proposal would be the first implemented by a Commission-regulated utility.
