Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition
     On July 30, 2008, Pinnacle West Capital Corporation (the "Company" or "Pinnacle West") issued a press release regarding its financial results for its fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2008. A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.9.
     Certain of the Information referenced in Item 7.01 below relates to the Company's results of operations for its fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2008. This Information is attached hereto as Exhibits 99.2, 99.3, 99.7 and 99.9.
     Exhibit 99.9 to this report contains certain "non-GAAP financial measures," as defined in Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K of the Exchange Act. We describe these non-GAAP financial measures as "on-going earnings" and "on-going earnings per share." Exhibit 99.9 contains a table that reconciles each of these non-GAAP financial measures to net income, which is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). We believe on-going earnings provide investors with a useful indicator of our results that is comparable among periods because it excludes the effects of unusual items that may occur on an irregular basis. Investors should note that these non-GAAP financial measures involve judgments by management, including whether an item is classified as an unusual item. We use on-going earnings, or similar concepts, to measure our performance internally in reports for management.

2008 Earnings Outlook
     We currently estimate that our on-going consolidated earnings for 2008 will be within a reasonable range of $2.50 per share. We estimate that Arizona Public Service Company ("APS") will contribute substantially all of the 2008 on-going earnings and that SunCor Development Company's 2008 earnings contribution will be minimal. Our 2008 on-going earnings estimate excludes $0.30 per share of tax credits related to prior years recorded in the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2008. In this discussion, earnings per share amounts are after income taxes and are based on diluted average common shares outstanding. The earnings guidance in this Form 8-K supersedes all previous earnings guidance provided by Pinnacle West. Our earnings forecasts are subject to numerous risks, including those described under "Forward-Looking Statements" below.
Capital Expenditures and Financings
     We are continuing efforts to improve APS' financial strength and to reduce our need for external financing. These efforts consist of the following four components:
We believe that successful implementation of this program will eliminate the need for a Pinnacle West equity issuance in 2008.
     See "Capital Expenditures" in Part I, Item 2 of the Pinnacle West/APS Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2008 ("March 10-Q") for current capital expenditure estimates, which include the $200 million reduction described above. See the Pinnacle West/APS Report on Form 8-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on June 9, 2008, for information regarding the interim base rate surcharge request. See "2008 General Rate Case" in Note 5 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in the March 10-Q and the Pinnacle West/APS Report on Form 8-K, filed with the SEC on June 2, 2008, for information regarding the pending general retail rate case.

Forward-Looking Statements
     This Form 8-K contains forward-looking statements regarding our 2008 earnings outlook, expected decreases in capital expenditures and other expenses resulting from previous and current cost reduction efforts, achievement of interim rate relief and receipt of a constructive process and decision in our pending general retail rate case with the ACC, and the successful implementation of our program to improve our financial strength, eliminating the need for a Pinnacle West equity issuance in 2008. Neither the Company nor APS assumes any obligation to update these statements or make any further statements on any of these issues, except as required by applicable law. Because actual results may differ materially from expectations, we caution readers not to place undue reliance on these statements. A number of factors could cause future results to differ materially from historical results, or from results or outcomes currently expected or sought by Pinnacle West or APS. In addition to the Risk Factors described in Item 1A of the Pinnacle West/APS Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2007, these factors include, but are not limited to, our ability to reduce capital expenditures and other costs while maintaining reliability and customer service levels and unexpected developments that would limit us from reducing all or some of these capital expenditures; our ability to successfully implement our program to improve our financial strength in whole or in part and unexpected financial or other developments that would require a Pinnacle West equity issuance before the end of 2008; state and federal regulatory and legislative decisions and actions, including the outcome or timing of our pending rate cases; the outcome of regulatory, legislative and judicial proceedings, both current and future, including those related to environmental matters and climate change; the potential for additional restructuring of the electric industry, including decisions impacting wholesale competition and the introduction of retail electric competition in Arizona; fluctuations in market prices for electricity, natural gas, coal, uranium and other fuels used in our generating facilities, and supplies of such commodities; volatile market liquidity, any deteriorating counterparty credit and the use of derivative contracts in our business (including the interpretation of the subjective and complex accounting rules related to these contracts); power plant performance and outages; transmission outages and constraints; weather variations affecting local and regional customer energy usage; customer growth and energy usage; national and regional economic and market conditions, including the strength of the housing and credit markets, volatile fuel and purchased power costs, the completion of generation and transmission construction in the region, which could affect customer growth and the cost of power supplies, and the results of litigation and other proceedings resulting from the California and Pacific Northwest energy situations; ability of power plant participants to meet contractual or other obligations; the cost of debt and equity capital and access to capital markets; current credit ratings remaining in effect for any given period of time; changes in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and the interpretation of those principles; the performance of the stock market and the changing interest rate environment, which affect the value of our nuclear decommissioning trusts, pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets, the amount of required contributions to Pinnacle West's pension plan and contributions to APS' nuclear decommissioning trust funds, as well as the reported costs of providing pension and other postretirement benefits; technological developments in the electric industry; the strength of the real estate market in SunCor's market areas, which include Arizona, Idaho, New Mexico and Utah; and other uncertainties, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond the control of Pinnacle West and APS.

Exhibit 99.7
LAST UPDATED: 7/30/08
     This discussion explains the changes in our consolidated earnings for the three-month and six-month periods ended June 30, 2008 and 2007. Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2008 and 2007 follow this discussion. We will file our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2008 on or before August 11, 2008. We suggest that this discussion be read in connection with the Pinnacle West Capital Corporation ("Pinnacle West") Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2007 and the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2008. Additional operating and financial statistics and a glossary of terms are available on our website ().

     Pinnacle West's two reportable business segments are:
     The following table presents income from continuing operations for our regulated electricity and real estate segments and reconciles those amounts to net income in total for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2008 and 2007 (dollars in millions):
 
 
Operating Results  Three-month period ended June 30, 2008 compared with three-month period ended June 30, 2007
     Our consolidated net income for the three months ended June 30, 2008 was $134 million compared with net income of $79 million for the comparable prior-year period. Net income increased $55 million in the period-to-period comparison and is reflected in the segments as follows:
     Additional details on the major factors that increased (decreased) net income for the three-month period ended June 30, 2008 compared with the prior-year period are contained in the following table (dollars in millions):
 
Regulated Electricity Segment Revenues
     Regulated electricity segment revenues were $118 million higher for the three months ended June 30, 2008 compared with the prior-year period primarily because of:
 
Real Estate Segment Revenues
     Real estate segment revenues were $11 million lower for the three months ended June 30, 2008 compared with the prior-year period primarily due to lower land parcel and home sales as a result of the weak real estate market.
All Other Revenues
     All other revenues were $44 million lower for the three months ended June 30, 2008 compared with the prior-year period primarily due to the planned reduction of APSES' retail commodity-related energy services and a decrease in other marketing and trading activities.
Operating Results  Six-month period ended June 30, 2008 compared with six-month period ended June 30, 2007
     Our consolidated net income for the six months ended June 30, 2008 was $129 million compared with net income of $96 million for the comparable prior-year period. Net income increased $33 million in the period-to-period comparison and is reflected in the segments as follows:
 
     Additional details on the major factors that increased (decreased) net income for the six-month period ended June 30, 2008 compared with the prior-year period are contained in the following table (dollars in millions):
 
 
Regulated Electricity Segment Revenues
     Regulated electricity segment revenues were $205 million higher for the six months ended June 30, 2008 compared with the prior-year period primarily because of:
Real Estate Segment Revenues
     Real estate segment revenues were $40 million lower for the six months ended June 30, 2008 compared with the prior-year period primarily due to lower land parcel sales as a result of the weak real estate market.
All Other Revenues
     All other revenues were $60 million lower for the six months ended June 30, 2008 compared with the prior-year period primarily due to the planned reduction of APSES' retail commodity-related energy services and a decrease in other marketing and trading activities.

Exhibit 99.9
PHOENIX  Pinnacle West Capital Corporation (NYSE: PNW) today reported consolidated net income of $133.9 million, or $1.33 per diluted share of common stock, for the quarter ended June 30, 2008. These results compare with net income of $79.0 million, or $0.78 per diluted share, for the same period a year ago. The higher results were due in large part to $30 million of credits attributable to the resolution of tax issues applicable to prior years at the Company's regulated utility and a $19 million gain from the sale of a large asset in its real estate business.
Pinnacle West Chairman Bill Post pointed out that Pinnacle West's on-going earnings for the first six months of 2008 were the same as a year ago.
"Although earnings for the second quarter are up, after adjusting for the tax impacts, on-going earnings are flat for the year with inflation offsetting our efficiency savings and revenue growth," said Post. "Year-to-date, on-going earnings at Arizona Public Service are essentially flat, increasing only $4 million compared to last year."
SunCor Development Co., Pinnacle West's real estate subsidiary, reported net income of $14.7 million for the second quarter of 2008, compared with $0.3 million in the 2007 second quarter. The increase was entirely related to the sale of a 12-story office building at SunCor's Hayden Ferry Lakeside development in Tempe, Ariz.
