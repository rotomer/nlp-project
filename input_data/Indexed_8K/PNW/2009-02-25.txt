Conditions of the Obligations of the Underwriters
 
On the date hereof, the Representative shall have received a letter, dated the date hereof, of Deloitte & Touche LLP, confirming that they are independent registered public accountants within the meaning of the Act and the applicable published Rules and Regulations thereunder and stating to the effect that:
(a)
                                 
 
in their opinion, the financial statements and financial statement schedule audited by them and incorporated by reference in the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Act and the related published Rules and Regulations;
(i)

(ii)
                                 
on the basis of the review referred to in clause (ii) above, a reading of the latest available interim financial statements of the Company, inquiries of officials of the Company who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters and other specified procedures, nothing came to their attention that caused them to believe that:
(iii)
                              
 
the unaudited financial statements, if any, included in the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus do not comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Act and the related published Rules and Regulations or any material modifications should be made to such unaudited financial statements and summary of earnings for them to be in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles;
(A)
                             
 
if any unaudited "capsule" information is contained in the Pricing Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, the unaudited operating revenues, gross income, net income and net income per share amounts or other amounts constituting such "capsule" information and described in such letter do not agree with the corresponding amounts set forth in the unaudited financial statements or were not determined on a basis substantially consistent with that of the corresponding amounts in the audited statements of income;
(B)
                               
 
at the date of the latest available balance sheet read by such accountants, or at a subsequent specified date not more than three business days prior to the date of such letter, there was any change in the amounts of common stock, redeemable preferred stock or non-redeemable preferred stock of the Company or any increase, exceeding $10,000,000, in long-term debt of the Company or, at the date of the most recent available unaudited financial statements, there was any decrease in net current assets or common stock equity as compared with amounts shown in the most recent financial statements included in the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, except in all cases for changes, increases or decreases that result from the declaration or payment of dividends; or
(C)
                               
 
for the period from the closing date of the latest income statement included in the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus to the closing date of the latest available income statement read by such accountants, there were any decreases, as compared with the corresponding period of the previous year and with the period of corresponding length ended the date of the latest income statement included in the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, in the amounts of total revenues or net income;
(D)
                              
 
except in all cases set forth in clause (C) and clause (D) above for changes, increases or decreases that the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus disclose have occurred or may occur or that are described in such letter; and
 
they have compared specified dollar amounts (or percentages derived from such dollar amounts) and other financial information contained in the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus (in each case to the extent that such dollar
(iv)
                             
amounts, percentages and other financial information are derived from the general accounting records of the Company and its subsidiaries subject to the internal controls of the Company's accounting system or are derived directly from such records by analysis or computation) with the results obtained from inquiries, a reading of such general accounting records and other procedures specified in such letter and have found such dollar amounts, percentages and other financial information to be in agreement with such results, except as otherwise specified in such letter.
 
All financial statements and schedules included in material incorporated by reference into the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus shall be deemed included in the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus for purposes of this Section 6(a).

Any request of the Commission for inclusion of additional information in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or otherwise shall have been complied with or resolved to the reasonable satisfaction of the Representative. The Commission shall not have notified the Company of any objection to the use of the form of the Registration Statement.

In giving such opinion, Snell & Wilmer L.L.P. may rely to the extent such counsel deems appropriate upon certificates of the Company as to any factual matters upon which any such opinions are based, may rely upon the opinion of Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP, counsel for the Underwriters, as to all matters governed by the law of the State of New York, and further may rely upon the opinion of Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP, delivered to the Underwriters and on which it is stated the Underwriters may rely at the Closing Date, as to all matters under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 and the Federal Power Act, as amended.

(i)
                                    
 
the activities of the Company in the State of New Mexico to date do not constitute it a "public utility" as that term is defined in the relevant laws of the State of New Mexico, and, accordingly, no public utility franchises or certificates of convenience and necessity are necessary under New Mexico law with respect to the maintenance and operation of the Company's property and business as now conducted in the State of New Mexico and no approval, authorization or consent of the New Mexico Public Regulation Commission or any other public board or body of the State of New Mexico is required for the issuance and sale of the Securities on the terms and conditions set forth or contemplated in this Agreement, the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus or for the execution of the Most Recent Supplemental Indenture, except as may be required under New Mexico state securities or blue sky laws, as to which laws such counsel need express no opinion.
(ii)
                                 
In giving such opinion, Keleher & McLeod, P.A. may rely to the extent such counsel deems appropriate upon certificates of the Company as to any factual matters upon which any such opinions are based and may rely upon the certificates of public officials concerning the legal existence and good standing of the Company.
 
The Underwriters shall have received from Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP, counsel for the Underwriters, an opinion or opinions, dated the Closing Date, with respect to such matters as they may reasonably require, and the Company shall have furnished to such counsel such documents as they request for the purpose of enabling them to pass upon such matters.

This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability that the Company may otherwise have.

Each Underwriter will severally indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who have signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company or any such director, officer or controlling person may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or the alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representative specifically for use therein, and will reimburse any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred, as incurred, by the Company or any such director, officer or controlling person in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability that such Underwriter may otherwise have. The Company acknowledges that the statements set forth in the last paragraph of text on the cover page of the Most Recent Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus and in the fourth paragraph, the third sentence of the sixth paragraph, the fourth sentence of the sixth paragraph, the seventh paragraph, the eighth paragraph, the ninth paragraph, the tenth paragraph (such tenth paragraph being furnished solely by BNY Mellon Capital Markets, LLC and not by any other Underwriter), and the fourteenth paragraph (such fourteenth paragraph being furnished solely by Wedbush Morgan Securities Inc. and not by any other Underwriter) of text under the caption "Underwriting" in the Most Recent Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the several Underwriters for inclusion in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus and any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto.
(b)
                                
 
Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 7 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against an indemnifying party under this Section 7, notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof; , that the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have under Section 7(a) or Section 7(b) except to the extent that it has been materially prejudiced (including through the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses) by such failure; , , that the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to an indemnified party otherwise than under Section 7(a) or Section 7(b). In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it may wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, without the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its assumption of the defense thereof, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section 7 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties that are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in respect of the legal expenses of any indemnified party in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified parties. Such firm shall be designated in writing by the Representative, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 7(a), and by the Company, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 7(b). An indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of a claim or action effected without its written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.

further
 
If the indemnification provided for in this Section 7 is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any loss, claim, damage, liability or action described in Section 7(a) or Section 7(b), then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in Section 7(a) or Section 7(b) on the following basis: (i) if such loss, claim, damage, liability or action arises under Section 7(a), then (A) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Securities or (B) if the allocation provided by clause (A) 
(d)
                                
above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (A) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities as well as any other relevant equitable considerations; and (ii) if such loss, claim, damage, liability or action arises under Section 7(b), then in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriter on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. For purposes of clause (i) above, the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters. For purposes of clause (i) and clause (ii) above, the relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Company and each of the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7(d) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 7(d). The amount paid by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in the first sentence of this Section 7(d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim that is the subject of this Section 7(d). Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7(d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations in this Section 7(d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.
 
. If any Underwriter or Underwriters default in their obligations to purchase Securities pursuant to this Agreement and the principal amount of Securities that such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase is 10% or less of the principal amount of Securities that the Underwriters are obligated to purchase, the Representative (or, if there is no Representative, the Underwriters) may make arrangements satisfactory to the Company for the purchase of such Securities by other persons, including any of the Underwriters, but if no such arrangements are made by the Closing Date the non-defaulting Underwriters shall be obligated severally, in proportion to their respective commitments hereunder, to purchase the Securities that such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase. If any Underwriter or Underwriters so default and the aggregate principal amount of Securities with respect to which such default or defaults occur is more than the above-described amount and arrangements satisfactory to the remaining Underwriters and the Company for the purchase of such Securities by other persons are not made

Exhibit 4.1
 
 
 
 
 
This ELEVENTH SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURE, dated as of February 26, 2009, is between Arizona Public Service Company, a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of the State of Arizona (herein called the "Company"), having its principal office at 400 North Fifth Street, Phoenix, Arizona 85004, and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., successor to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (formerly known as The Chase Manhattan Bank), a national banking association, as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee") under the Indenture dated as of January 15, 1998 between the Company and the Trustee (the "Indenture").
 
The Company has executed and delivered the Indenture to the Trustee to provide for the issuance from time to time of its unsecured debentures, notes or other evidences of indebtedness (the "Securities"), said Securities to be issued in one or more series as provided in the Indenture.
 
Section 901(7) of the Indenture provides that, without the consent of any Holders, the Company and the Trustee may enter into one or more indentures supplemental to the Indenture for the purpose of establishing the form or terms of Securities of any series.
 
Pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, the Company desires to provide for the establishment of a new series of its Securities to be known as its 8.750% Notes due 2019 (herein called the "Notes"), the forms and substance of such Notes and the terms, provisions, and conditions thereof to be set forth as provided in the Indenture and this Eleventh Supplemental Indenture.
 
All things necessary to make this Eleventh Supplemental Indenture a valid agreement of the Company, and to make the Notes described herein, when executed by the Company and authenticated and delivered by the Trustee, the valid obligations of the Company, have been done.
 
NOW, THEREFORE, THIS ELEVENTH SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURE WITNESSETH:
 
For and in consideration of the premises and the purchase of the Notes by the Holders thereof, and for the purpose of setting forth, as provided in the Indenture, the form and substance of each of the Notes and the terms, provisions, and conditions thereof, it is mutually agreed, for the equal and proportionate benefit of all Holders of the Notes, as applicable, as follows:
 
ARTICLE ONE
 
GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE NOTES
 
.  There shall be and is hereby authorized a series of Securities designated the "8.750% Notes due 2019" initially limited in aggregate principal amount to $500,000,000, which amount shall be as set forth in any Company Order for the authentication and delivery of Notes.  The Notes shall mature and the principal
SECTION 101.              
Authentication and Delivery
 
shall be due and payable together with all accrued and unpaid interest thereon on March 1, 2019, and the Notes shall be issued in the form of registered Securities without coupons.
 
The foregoing principal amount of the Notes may be increased from time to time as permitted by Section 301 of the Indenture.  All Notes need not be issued at the same time and such series may be reopened at any time, without notice to, or the consent of, the then existing Holders, for issuance of additional Notes.  Any such additional Notes will be equal in rank and have the same respective maturity, payment terms, redemption features, and other terms as the Notes initially issued, except for the issue date, public offering price, payment of interest accruing prior to the issue date, and first payment of interest following the issue date of the additional Notes.
 
SECTION 102.               .  The Notes shall be issued in certificated form, except that the Notes shall be issued initially as a Global Security to and registered in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee of The Depository Trust Company, as Depositary therefor.  Any Notes to be issued or transferred to, or to be held by, Cede & Co. (or any successor thereof) for such purpose shall bear the depositary legend in substantially the form set forth at the top of the form of Note in Section 301 hereof (in lieu of that set forth in Section 204 of the Indenture), unless otherwise agreed by the Company, such agreement to be confirmed in writing to the Trustee.  Each such Global Security may be exchanged in whole or in part for Notes registered, and any transfer of such Global Security in whole or in part may be registered, in the name(s) of Persons other than such Depositary or a nominee thereof only under the circumstances set forth in clause (2) of the last paragraph of Section 305 of the Indenture, or such other circumstances in addition to or in lieu of those set forth in clause (2) of the last paragraph of Section 305 of the Indenture as to which the Company shall agree, such agreement to be confirmed in writing to the Trustee.  Upon the occurrence of any such event, the Notes will be issued in such names as the Depositary shall instruct the Trustee.
Global Security
 
SECTION 103.               .  Principal of, and premium, if any, and interest on, the Notes will be payable, the transfer of Notes will be registrable and the Notes will be exchangeable for Notes bearing identical terms and provisions, at the office or agency of the Company in the Borough of Manhattan, The City and State of New York; , , that payment of interest may be made at the option of the Company by wire transfer to any Holder or by deposit to the account of the Holder of any such Notes if such account is maintained with the Trustee, in each case according to the written instructions given by such Holder on or prior to the applicable record date to the Trustee, which written instructions shall remain in effect until revised by such Holder by an instrument in writing delivered to the Trustee.
Place of Payment and Place for Registration of Transfers and Exchange
provided
however
 
SECTION 104.               .  The Notes will bear interest at the rate of 8.750% per annum from February 26, 2009 or from the most recent Interest Payment Date (as hereinafter defined) to which interest has been paid or duly provided for until the principal thereof is paid or made available for payment, payable on March 1 and September 1 of each year (each, an "Interest Payment Date"), commencing on September 1, 2009, to the person in whose name such Note or any Predecessor Security is registered, at the close of business on February 15 and August 15, as the case may be, whether or not a Business Day, immediately preceding the Interest Payment Date. Any such interest installment not punctually paid or duly provided for
Payment of Interest
 
shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Holders on such Regular Record Date, and may be paid to the Person in whose name such Note (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date to be fixed by the Trustee for the payment of such Defaulted Interest, notice whereof shall be given to the Holders of the Notes not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date, or may be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Notes may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully described in the Indenture.
 
The amount of interest payable for any period will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.  Interest will accrue from February 26, 2009 or from the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for to, but not including, the relevant payment date.  In the event that any date on which interest is payable on the Notes is not a Business Day, then payment of interest payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day which is a Business Day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay), in each case with the same force and effect as if made on such date.  A "Business Day" shall mean any day except a Saturday, a Sunday or a legal holiday in The City of New York on which banking institutions are authorized or required by law, regulation or executive order to close.
 
.  The Company may redeem all or any portion of the Notes, at its option, at any time or from time to time, upon notice as provided in the Indenture.  The Redemption Price for any of the Notes to be redeemed on any Redemption Date will be equal to the greater of the following amounts:
SECTION 105.              
Redemption of the Notes
 
(a)          100% of the principal amount of the Notes being redeemed on the Redemption Date; or
 
(b)         the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Notes being redeemed on that Redemption Date (not including any portion of any payments of interest accrued to the Redemption Date) discounted to the Redemption Date on a semiannual basis at the Adjusted Treasury Rate plus 50 basis points as determined by a Reference Treasury Dealer appointed by the Company for such purpose;
 
plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the Redemption Date.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, installments of interest on the Notes that are due and payable on Interest Payment Dates falling on or prior to a Redemption Date will be payable on the Interest Payment Date to the Holders as of the close of business on the relevant record date in accordance with the terms of such Notes and the Indenture.  The Redemption Price will be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months.
 
For purposes of this Section 105, the following terms shall have the following meanings:
 
"" means, with respect to any Redemption Date, the rate per annum equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such Redemption Date.
Adjusted Treasury Rate
 
"" means the U.S. Treasury security selected by a Reference Treasury Dealer appointed by the Company for such purpose as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Notes to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of such Notes.
Comparable Treasury Issue
 
"" means, with respect to any Redemption Date, (A) if the Company obtains three or more Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such Redemption Date, after excluding the highest and lowest of such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, (B) if the Company obtains two such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of such quotations, or (C) if only one Reference Treasury Dealer Quotation is received, such quotation.
Comparable Treasury Price
 
means a primary U.S. government securities dealer in the United States.
"Primary Treasury Dealer"
 
"" means (A) Barclays Capital Inc., BNY Mellon Capital Markets, LLC and Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (or their respective affiliates that are Primary Treasury Dealers), and their respective successors; provided, however, that if any of the foregoing shall cease to be a Primary Treasury Dealer, the Company will substitute therefor another Primary Treasury Dealer; and (B) any other Primary Treasury Dealer(s) selected by the Company.
Reference Treasury Dealer
 
"" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any Redemption Date, the average of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Trustee by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the third Business Day preceding such Redemption Date.
Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations
 
The Company shall give the Trustee written notice of the Redemption Price, promptly after the calculation thereof.
 
The Trustee shall be under no duty to inquire into, may conclusively presume the correctness of, and shall be fully protected in acting upon, the Company's calculation of any Redemption Price.
 
No Notes of $1,000 principal amount or less can be redeemed in part.

The Company may redeem all or any portion of the Securities of this series, at its option, at any time or from time to time, at a Redemption Price equal to the greater of (a) 100% of the principal amount of the Securities of this series being redeemed on the Redemption Date or (b) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Securities of this series being redeemed on that Redemption Date (not including the portion of any payments of interest accrued to the Redemption Date) discounted to the Redemption Date on a semiannual basis at the Adjusted Treasury Rate plus 50 basis points, as determined by a Reference Treasury Dealer appointed by the Company for such purpose; plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the Redemption Date.

The notice of redemption will specify, among other items, the manner of calculation of the Redemption Price and the principal amount of the Securities of this series held by such Holder to be redeemed if less than all of such Securities.  If less than all of the Securities of this series are to be redeemed at the option of the Company, the Trustee shall select, in such manner as it shall deem appropriate, the portion of such Securities to be redeemed.
