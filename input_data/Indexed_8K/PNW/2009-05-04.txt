Item 8.01. Other Events.
In connection with a review of its executive compensation practices, Pinnacle West Capital Corporation (the "Company") has determined that, on a going forward basis, it will no longer provide excise tax gross-up payments in new and materially amended agreements with its named executive officers. In unusual circumstances where the Company believes that accommodations have to be made to recruit a new executive to the Company, limited reimbursement for taxes payable may be included in executives' contracts; but even in those circumstances, the excise tax gross-ups will be limited to payments triggered by both a change in control and termination of employment and will be subject to a three-year sunset provision.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, each registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
