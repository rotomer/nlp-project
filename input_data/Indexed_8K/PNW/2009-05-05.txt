2009 Earnings Outlook
     In this discussion, earnings per share amounts are after income taxes and are based on diluted common shares outstanding. The earnings guidance in this Form 8-K supersedes all previous earnings guidance provided by Pinnacle West.
     Our earnings forecasts are subject to numerous risks, including those described under "Forward-Looking Statements" below and under "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2008.
     We estimate that our consolidated earnings for 2009 will be within a reasonable range around $2.30 per share, excluding the impact of SunCor Development Company ("SunCor"). This guidance takes into account the effects of milder weather in the first quarter, as well as the 2009 portion of the annualized pretax cost savings identified in our March 2009 report to the Arizona Corporation Commission (the "ACC"), as required by the ACC's interim rate decision in December 2008.
     We estimate that Arizona Public Service Company's ("APS") earnings contribution included in such consolidated earnings will be within a reasonable range around $2.35 per share (equivalent to a return on APS' average common equity of about 7%). This estimate assumes that the interim base rate surcharge will remain in effect throughout 2009. We currently estimate that holding company expenses and other items, net, will be a net loss within a reasonable range around $0.05 per share. For additional details regarding the major factors affecting our consolidated earnings outlook for 2009, see Exhibit 99.4 attached hereto.
2010 Earnings Outlook
     Assuming APS' proposed general retail rate settlement is approved as proposed and is effective for the entire year, we estimate that our consolidated earnings for 2010, with negligible impact from SunCor, if any, will be within a reasonable range around $3.00 per share. We estimate that APS' earnings contribution included in such 2010 consolidated earnings will be within a reasonable range around $3.00 per share (equivalent to a return on APS' average common equity of about 9%). We currently estimate that holding company expenses and other items, net, will not have any meaningful impact on our 2010 consolidated financial results. For additional details regarding major factors affecting our consolidated earnings outlook for 2010, see Exhibit 99.5 attached hereto.
Forward-Looking Statements
     This Form 8-K contains forward-looking statements regarding our 2009 and 2010 earnings outlook. Neither Pinnacle West nor APS assumes any obligation to update these statements or make any further statements on any of these issues, except as required by applicable law. These forward-looking statements are often identified by words such as "estimate," "predict," "hope," "may," "believe," "anticipate," "plan," "expect," "require," "intend," "assume" and similar words. Because actual results may differ materially from expectations, we caution readers not to place undue reliance on these statements. A number of factors could cause future results to differ materially from historical results, or from results or outcomes currently expected or sought by Pinnacle West or APS. In addition to the Risk Factors described in Item 1A of the Pinnacle West/APS Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2008, these factors include, but are not limited to, state and federal regulatory and legislative decisions and actions, including the outcome or timing of the pending rate case of APS; increases in our capital expenditures and operating costs and our ability to achieve timely and adequate rate recovery of these increased costs; our ability to reduce capital expenditures and other costs while

Exhibit 99.2
PHOENIX  Pinnacle West Capital Corp. (NYSE: PNW) today reported a consolidated net loss attributable to common shareholders for the quarter ended March 31, 2009, of $156.5 million, or $1.55 per diluted share of common stock compared with a net loss attributable to common shareholders of $4.5 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, for the same quarter in 2008. The lower results were driven largely by previously announced real estate charges, as well as rising costs incurred by Arizona Public Service (APS) related to its electric system expansion, and the effects of milder weather.
Excluding the real estate charges, Pinnacle West recorded a consolidated on-going loss of $29.1 million or $0.29 per share in the 2009 first quarter compared with a consolidated on-going loss of $4.5 million, or $0.04 per share, in the comparable 2008 quarter.
APS, the company's principal subsidiary, reported a quarterly net loss of $15.5 million, compared with a net loss of $6.4 million for the 2008 first quarter. In addition to the impact of milder weather, the utility's results were negatively impacted by lower mark-to-market valuations of fuel and power contracts, and higher costs related to continuing infrastructure additions and improvements. These items more than offset an interim retail electricity price increase implemented at the beginning of this year and transmission rate increases implemented in 2008.
"Even with the current economy, Arizona is still growing. With today's growth and an eventual economic rebound, APS expects to add another 600,000 customers by 2025  a 55 percent increase over current levels," said Chairman Don Brandt. "We must continue preparing to meet this demand by investing in new infrastructure and technologies to ensure our customers' energy future continues to be highly reliable, as well as cleaner, more efficient and more responsive than ever before. To accomplish these goals, we will maintain a keen focus on energy efficiency, renewable energy expansion, productivity, customer technologies and financial strength."
 
As announced in early April, the Company's real estate subsidiary, SunCor, initiated a plan to dispose of a majority of its real estate assets through a series of strategic transactions. As a result of that decision, Pinnacle West's reported consolidated results for the 2009 first quarter include real estate charges totaling $127.4 million after-tax. Execution of the restructuring plan is currently underway and will allow SunCor to maximize the value of its assets, concentrate on the Phoenix market, and substantially eliminate SunCor's outstanding debt. The company currently plans to complete the transactions in 2009.
