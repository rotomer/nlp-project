Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits
(d) Exhibits.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, each registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99.1
PHOENIX  Pinnacle West Capital Corp. (NYSE: PNW) today reported consolidated net income attributable to common shareholders of $186.7 million, or $1.84 per diluted share of common stock, for the quarter ended September 30, 2009. This result compares with $151.6 million, or $1.50 per diluted share, for the same period in 2008.
The Company's on-going consolidated earnings in the 2009 third quarter were $199.1 million, or $1.96 per share, compared with $161.1million, or $1.59 per share, in the comparable 2008 quarter. On-going earnings for both quarters exclude results for the Company's real estate segment, which is being restructured through the sale of a substantial majority of its properties. A reconciliation of our reported earnings to on-going earnings is provided at the end of this release.
The 2009 third-quarter on-going results were positively impacted by the following factors:
 
These positive factors were offset in part by the following items:
Looking forward, the Company expects customer growth to average about 1 percent annually through 2011. Additionally, weather-normalized sales are expected to remain relatively flat through 2011 on a year-over-year comparison, due to the effects of APS' energy efficiency programs, and cyclical business conditions related to Arizona's housing market and the national economy.
"I am pleased with the third-quarter results from an operational perspective," said Pinnacle West Chairman Don Brandt. "In these challenging economic times, we remain keenly focused on controlling costs to help keep customer rates as low as possible, while providing clean, reliable and cost-effective electricity to power the State's energy needs.
"Additionally, we and our customers benefited from strong performance at the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station, which operated at full capacity throughout the quarter and generated its highest-ever summer production of about 11.5 million megawatt-hours of electricity."
 
Brandt added that Arizona Public Service Co. (APS) continues to develop programs that ensure clean energy sources and help customers use electricity more efficiently. "The ability to carry these programs forward and pay for them depends on positive outcomes in our proposed retail regulatory settlement," he said. "If approved as proposed, the settlement will increase our electricity prices by less than 1 percent over current rates for an average residential customer, and will provide significant benefits to customers, shareholders and other stakeholders, alike." The net price increase would reflect an early reset under the power supply adjustment mechanism, decreasing rates for fuel and purchased power.
For the third quarter of 2009, APS reported net income of $197.1 million, compared with net income of $159.8 million for the same period a year ago.
Pinnacle West's real estate segment reported a net loss of $12.4 million for the third quarter of 2009, compared with a net loss of $6.0 million in the prior-year period. The loss was related to additional real estate impairment charges totaling $22.6 million in the 2009 period, partially offset by the sale of certain real estate assets. The Company's real estate subsidiary, SunCor Development Co., continues to pursue the sale of its remaining assets
Real Estate Segment
.
The Company continues to estimate its on-going consolidated earnings for 2009 will be within a reasonable range around $2.30 per share, excluding the results of its real estate segment.
2009 and 2010 On-going Earnings Outlooks Unchanged
For 2010, the Company continues to estimate its on-going consolidated earnings will be within a reasonable range around $3.00 per share, excluding the impacts of its real estate segment.
The Company's earnings forecasts are subject to numerous risks, including those described under "Forward-Looking Statements" below and under "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2008.
