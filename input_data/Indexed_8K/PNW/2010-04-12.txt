Conditions of the Obligations of the Underwriters
          (a) On the date hereof, the Representatives shall have received a letter, dated the date hereof, of Deloitte & Touche LLP, confirming that they are independent registered public accountants within the meaning of the Act and the applicable published Rules and Regulations thereunder and stating to the effect that:
          (i) in their opinion, the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules audited by them and incorporated by reference in the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Act and the related published Rules and Regulations;
          (ii) they have performed the procedures specified by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for a review of interim financial information as described in Statement of Auditing Standards No. 100, Interim Financial Information, on any unaudited financial statements included in the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus;
          (iii) on the basis of the review referred to in clause (ii) above, a reading of the latest available interim financial statements of the Company, inquiries of officials of the Company who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters and other specified procedures, nothing came to their attention that caused them to believe that:
          (A) the unaudited condensed financial statements, if any, included in the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus do not comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Act and the related published Rules and Regulations or any material modifications should be made to such unaudited financial statements and summary of earnings for them to be in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles;
          (B) if any unaudited "capsule" information is contained in the Pricing Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, the unaudited consolidated operating revenues, gross income, net income and net income per share amounts or other amounts constituting such "capsule" information and described in such letter do not agree with the corresponding amounts set forth in the unaudited consolidated financial statements or were not determined on a basis substantially
 
consistent with that of the corresponding amounts in the audited statements of income;
          (C) at the date of the latest available balance sheet read by such accountants, or at a subsequent specified date not more than three business days prior to the date of such letter, there was any change in the amounts of common stock, redeemable preferred stock or non-redeemable preferred stock of the Company or any increase, exceeding $10,000,000, in long-term debt of the Company or, at the date of the most recent available unaudited financial statements, there was any decrease in consolidated net current assets or common stock equity as compared with amounts shown in the most recent financial statements included in the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, except in all cases for changes, increases or decreases that result from the declaration or payment of dividends; or
          (D) for the period from the closing date of the latest income statement included in the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus to the closing date of the latest available income statement read by such accountants, there were any decreases, as compared with the corresponding period of the previous year and with the period of corresponding length ended the date of the latest income statement included in the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, in the amounts of consolidated total revenues or net income;
except in all cases set forth in clause (C) and clause (D) above for changes, increases or decreases that the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus disclose have occurred or may occur or that are described in such letter; and
          (iv) they have compared specified dollar amounts (or percentages derived from such dollar amounts) and other financial information contained in the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus (in each case to the extent that such dollar amounts, percentages and other financial information are derived from the general accounting records of the Company and its subsidiaries subject to the internal controls of the Company's accounting system or are derived directly from such records by analysis or computation) with the results obtained from inquiries, a reading of such general accounting records and other procedures specified in such letter and have found such dollar amounts, percentages and other financial information to be in agreement with such results, except as otherwise specified in such letter.
All financial statements and schedules included in material incorporated by reference into the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus shall be deemed included in the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus for purposes of this Section 6(a).
          (b) Any Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus shall have been timely filed with the Commission in accordance with Section 4(a). The Company shall have complied with all filing requirements applicable to any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus. No stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or preventing or suspending the use of the Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus shall have been issued, no proceeding or
 
examination for such purpose or pursuant to Section 8A of the Act against the Company or related to the offering shall have been initiated or threatened by the Commission and no order directed to the adequacy of any document incorporated by reference in any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus shall have been issued. Any request of the Commission for inclusion of additional information in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or otherwise shall have been complied with or resolved to the reasonable satisfaction of the Representatives. The Commission shall not have notified the Company of any objection to the use of the form of the Registration Statement.
          (c) Subsequent to the execution of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date, (i) there shall not have occurred any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting particularly the consolidated financial position, business or properties of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole that, in the reasonable judgment of the Representatives, materially impairs the investment quality of the Shares, (ii) there shall not have occurred a suspension of trading in the Stock by the Commission or the NYSE or a suspension or material limitation in trading in securities generally on the NYSE, (iii) there shall not have occurred, in respect of the Company's securities, any downgrading or withdrawal, nor shall any notice have been given in respect of the Company's securities of any intended or potential downgrading or withdrawal or of any review for a possible change that does not indicate the direction of the possible change, and there shall have been no public announcement that any of the Company's securities have been placed on CreditWatch or Watchlist or under any similar surveillance or review, in each case with negative implications, by Standard & Poor's, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. or Moody's Investors Service, Inc., (iv) there shall not have occurred a general moratorium on commercial banking activities in New York declared by either federal or State of New York authorities, (v) there shall not have occurred any material disruption of settlements of securities or clearance services in the United States and (vi) there shall not have occurred any outbreak or escalation of major hostilities in which the United States is involved, any declaration of war by Congress or any other substantial national or international calamity or emergency if, in the judgment of the Representatives, the effect of any such outbreak, escalation, declaration, calamity or emergency makes it impractical or inadvisable to proceed with completion of the sale of and payment for the Shares. If the Underwriters elect not to purchase the Shares as a result of the occurrence of one of the events specified in this Section 6(c), the Representatives will promptly notify the Company.
          (d) The Underwriters shall have received an opinion of Snell & Wilmer L.L.P., counsel for the Company, dated the relevant Closing Date, to the effect that:
          (i) (A) the Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Arizona, and the Company has the requisite corporate power and corporate authority to conduct its business as such business is currently being conducted as described in each of the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus; and (B) the opinions expressed in clause (A) above as to the good standing of the Company are based solely on such counsel's review of a certificate of the Arizona Corporation Commission (the ""), dated a recent date, attesting to the continued corporate existence and good standing of the Company in the State of Arizona, a copy of which has been made available to the Underwriters and their counsel, and such
ACC

          (ii) the Company has authorized capital stock as set forth in each of the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus; and the Shares have been duly authorized, are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and conform in all material respects to the description thereof in each of the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus;
          (iii) (A) APS is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Arizona; (B) the opinions expressed in clause (A) above as to the good standing of APS are based solely on such counsel's review of a certificate of the ACC, dated a recent date, attesting to the continued corporate existence and good standing of APS in the State of Arizona, a copy of which has been made available to the Underwriters and their counsel, and such counsel's opinions with respect to such matters are rendered as of the date of such certificate and are limited accordingly; (C) APS is duly qualified as a foreign corporation to do business, and is in good standing, in the States of California, New Mexico and Texas; and (D) the opinion expressed in clause (C) above is based solely on such counsel's review of certain certificates of governmental authorities described in such opinion, copies of which have been made available to the Underwriters and their counsel, and such counsel's opinion with respect to such matters is rendered as of the date of such certificates and is limited accordingly;
          (iv) all of the issued shares of capital stock of APS are owned directly or indirectly by the Company, free and clear of all liens, encumbrances, equities or claims, other than liens for taxes, assessments or other governmental charges or levies not at the time delinquent or thereafter payable without penalty or being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and for which adequate reserves shall have been made;
          (v) the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company have been duly authorized by all requisite corporate action on the part of the Company, and this Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company;
          (vi) the issue and sale of the Shares and the performance by the Company of its obligations under this Agreement do not violate (a) the Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws of the Company, (b) to such counsel's knowledge, any judgment, order or decree of any court or governmental agency or body having jurisdiction over the Company, or (c) any federal or state law, rule or regulation applicable to the Company (excluding securities laws);
          (vii) the issue and sale of the Shares and the performance by the Company of its obligations under this Agreement will not cause a breach or default under any agreement to which the Company is a party that is filed as an exhibit to the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009 pursuant to Item 601(b)(4), Item 601(b)(10) or Item 601(b)(99) of Regulation S-K (it being understood that such counsel need express no opinion regarding compliance by the
 
Company with any financial covenants required to be maintained by the Company under any agreement or document);
          (viii) no consent, approval, authorization, order, registration or qualification of or with any federal or state governmental authority is required for the issue and sale of the Shares or the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except (a) such consents, approvals, authorizations, registrations or qualifications as may be required under state securities or blue sky laws, as to which laws such counsel shall not be required to express an opinion, and (b) the registration under the Act of the Shares;
          (ix) the statements set forth in each of the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus under the caption "Description Of Pinnacle West Common Stock", insofar as they purport to constitute a summary of the terms of the Stock, are accurate, complete and fair in all material respects;
          (x) the Company is not, and, after giving effect to the offering and sale of the Shares, will not be, an "investment company", as such term is defined in the Investment Company Act;
          (xi) to such counsel's knowledge, there are no legal or governmental proceedings required to be described in the Prospectus that are not described as required, nor any contracts or documents of a character required to be described in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package or the Prospectus or to be filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement that are not described and filed as required (it being understood that such counsel need express no opinion with respect to any Statement of Eligibility (Form T-1) under the Trust Indenture Act filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement); and
          (xii) the Registration Statement, as of the time it became effective and as of the latest Effective Date, and the Prospectus, as of the date of such counsel's opinion, in each case as amended by the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed with the Commission on or prior to the Closing Date, attaching this Agreement, a form of the Shares and an opinion of Snell & Wilmer L.L.P., and other than financial statements and schedules and other financial, statistical or accounting data included or incorporated by reference therein or omitted therefrom, as to which such counsel need express no opinion, appear on their face to be appropriately responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the Act and the Rules and Regulations; and, although such counsel does not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements or other information contained in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, except as expressly provided in Section 6(d)(ii) and Section 6(d)(ix), and has not independently verified any of such statements or other information, such counsel has no reason to believe that (in each case excluding financial statements and schedules and other financial, statistical or accounting data included or incorporated by reference therein or omitted therefrom, as to which such counsel need express no opinion):
 
          (A) the Registration Statement, as of the Effective Date, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading;
          (B) the Pricing Disclosure Package, as of the Applicable Time, included any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; or
          (C) the Prospectus, as of its date or at the date of such counsel's opinion, included or includes any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
     Whenever the opinions required by this Agreement are stated to be "to such counsel's knowledge", such statements are intended to signify that those attorneys in the firm responsible for preparing the opinion or who have given substantive attention to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, after consultation with such other attorneys in such firm who have worked on legal matters related to the Company and its subsidiaries as they considered appropriate, do not have current actual knowledge of the inaccuracy of such statement. However, except where expressly stated otherwise, such counsel need not undertake any special or independent investigation to determine the existence or absence of such facts, and no inference as to such counsel's knowledge of the existence or absence of such facts should be drawn from its representation of the Company in connection with this transaction or otherwise.
     In giving such opinion, Snell & Wilmer L.L.P. may rely (A) to the extent such counsel deems appropriate upon certificates of the Company as to any factual matters upon which any such opinions are based and (B) upon the opinion of Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP, delivered to the Underwriters and on which it is stated the Underwriters may rely at the Closing Date, as to all matters under PUHCA and the Federal Power Act, as amended.
          (e) The Underwriters shall have received from Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP, counsel for the Underwriters, an opinion or opinions, dated the relevant Closing Date, with respect to such matters as they may reasonably require, and the Company shall have furnished to such counsel such documents as they request for the purpose of enabling them to pass upon such matters.
          (f) The Underwriters shall have received a certificate of the President or any Vice President and a principal financial or accounting officer of the Company, dated the relevant Closing Date, in which such officers, to the best of their knowledge after reasonable investigation, shall state that (i) the representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement are true and correct, (ii) the Company has complied with all agreements and satisfied all conditions on its part to be performed or satisfied pursuant to this Agreement at or prior to such Closing Date, (iii) no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued, no proceedings or examinations for that purpose or pursuant to Section 8A of the Act against the Company or related to the offering have been instituted or are contemplated
 
by the Commission and the Commission has not notified the Company of any objection to the use of the form of the Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment thereto and (iv) subsequent to the date of the most recent financial statements in the Most Recent Preliminary Prospectus, there has been no material adverse change, or any development involving a prospective material adverse change that is reasonably likely to occur, in or affecting the consolidated financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries, taken as a whole, other than as set forth or contemplated in the Pricing Disclosure Package or as described in such certificate.
          (g) The Underwriters shall have received a letter of Deloitte & Touche LLP, dated the relevant Closing Date, which meets the requirements of Section 6(a), except that the specified date referred to in Section 6(a) will be a date not more than three days prior to the Closing Date for the purposes of this Section 6(g).
          (h) The Representatives shall have received signed lock-up agreements in the form attached hereto as hereto, dated on or prior to the date hereof, from each of the directors and executive officers of the Company (as defined under Section 16 of the Exchange Act and as set forth on hereto).
Exhibit D
Exhibit E
          (i) The Shares shall have been approved for listing on the NYSE subject to notice of issuance.
          (j) The Company will furnish the Underwriters with such conformed copies of such opinions, certificates, letters and documents as may be reasonably requested.

Indemnification and Contribution
          (a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, its directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls such Underwriter within the meaning of the Act against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter, such directors and officers or such controlling person may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse each Underwriter, such directors and officers and each such controlling person for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter, such directors and officers or such controlling person, as incurred, in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; , , that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in any of such documents in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for use therein, which information consists solely of the information specified in Section 7(b). This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability that the Company may otherwise have.
provided
however
 
          (b) Each Underwriter will severally indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who have signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company or any such director, officer or controlling person may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or the alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for use therein, and will reimburse any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred, as incurred, by the Company or any such director, officer or controlling person in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability that such Underwriter may otherwise have. The Company acknowledges that the statements set forth (i) in the last paragraph of text on the cover page of the Most Recent Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus, (ii) in the first paragraph under the heading "Underwriting  Commissions and Expenses" in the Most Recent Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus and (iii) under the headings "Underwriting  Stabilization, Short Positions and Penalty Bids" and "Underwriting  Electronic Distribution" in the Most Recent Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the several Underwriters for inclusion in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus and any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto.
          (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 7 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against an indemnifying party under this Section 7, notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof; , that the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have under Section 7(a) or Section 7(b) except to the extent that it has been materially prejudiced (including through the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses) by such failure; , , that the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to an indemnified party otherwise than under Section 7(a) or Section 7(b). In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it may wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, without the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its assumption of the defense thereof, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section 7 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and
provided
provided
further
 
the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties that are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in respect of the legal expenses of any indemnified party in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified parties. Such firm shall be designated in writing by the Representatives, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 7(a), and by the Company, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 7(b). An indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of a claim or action effected without its written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.
          (d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 7 is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any loss, claim, damage, liability or action described in Section 7(a) or Section 7(b), then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in Section 7(a) or Section 7(b) on the following basis: (i) if such loss, claim, damage, liability or action arises under Section 7(a), then (A) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Shares or (B) if the allocation provided by clause (A) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (A) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities as well as any other relevant equitable considerations; and (ii) if such loss, claim, damage, liability or action arises under Section 7(b), then in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriter on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. For purposes of clause (i) above, the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters. For purposes of clause (i) and clause (ii) above, the relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Company and each of the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7(d) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations
 
referred to above in this Section 7(d). The amount paid by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in the first sentence of this Section 7(d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim that is the subject of this Section 7(d). Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7(d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Shares underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations in this Section 7(d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.
     8. . If any Underwriter or Underwriters default in their obligations to purchase Shares pursuant to this Agreement and the number of Shares that such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase is 10% or less of the number of Shares that the Underwriters are obligated to purchase, the Representatives (or, if there are no Representatives, the Underwriters) may make arrangements satisfactory to the Company for the purchase of such Shares by other persons, including any of the Underwriters, but if no such arrangements are made by the Closing Date the non-defaulting Underwriters shall be obligated severally, in proportion to their respective commitments hereunder, to purchase the Shares that such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase. If any Underwriter or Underwriters so default and the number of Shares with respect to which such default or defaults occur is more than the above-described amount and arrangements satisfactory to the remaining Underwriters and the Company for the purchase of such Shares by other persons are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement will terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except as provided in Section 9. In any such case, either the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date, but in no event for longer than seven days, in order that the required changes, if any, in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Nothing herein will relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
Default of Underwriters; Termination by Underwriters
     If this Agreement shall be terminated by the Underwriters because of any failure or refusal on the part of the Company to comply with the terms or to fulfill any of the conditions of this Agreement, or if for any reason the Company shall be unable to perform its obligations under this Agreement, the Company shall not be liable to any Underwriter or to any member of any selling group for the loss of anticipated profits from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. However, in such an event, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters for all out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of their counsel) reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in connection with this Agreement and the offering contemplated hereunder; , , that if the Shares are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company solely as a result of the failure to satisfy the condition set forth in Section 6(c), the Company shall have no liability to the Underwriters except as provided in Section 4(j) and Section 7.
