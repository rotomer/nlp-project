Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits
(d) Exhibits.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, each registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99.1
PHOENIX  Pinnacle West Capital Corp. (NYSE: PNW) today reported a consolidated net loss attributable to common shareholders of $6.0 million, or $0.06 per diluted share of common stock, for the quarter ended March 31, 2010. This result compares with a net loss attributable to common shareholders of $156.5 million, or $1.55 per diluted share, for the same quarter in 2009.
Excluding results of the Company's real estate segment, the restructuring of which was announced last year, Pinnacle West's on-going consolidated earnings in the 2010 first quarter were $7.2 million, or $0.07 per share, compared with an on-going loss of $24.8 million or $0.25 per share, in the same period a year ago. A reconciliation of reported earnings to on-going earnings is provided at the end of this release.
"Our first quarter results support our full-year earnings guidance," said Pinnacle West Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Don Brandt. "We are focused on executing our renewables program, actively managing our costs and identifying additional efficiencies and savings throughout our organization."
The 2010 first-quarter on-going results were positively impacted by the following factors:
 
These positive factors were offset by increased operations and maintenance expenses, which decreased earnings by $0.04 per share. This increase was primarily related to higher labor expenses, offset in part by lower generation costs, including the timing of fossil-plant planned maintenance. The variance excludes costs associated with renewable energy and demand-side management programs, which are offset by comparable amounts of operating revenues.
A net decrease in weather-normalized kilowatt-hour sales reduced earnings by $0.02 per share. However, this decrease was offset by the effects of more favorable weather versus last year's quarter. The sales decrease was primarily related to the impacts of APS's energy efficiency programs and lower electricity consumption by commercial and industrial customers due to the current economic slowdown. Total retail electricity sales, excluding the effects of weather, decreased 1.7 percent in the 2010 first quarter compared to the corresponding 2009 period.
Arizona Public Service Co. (APS), the Company's principal subsidiary, reported 2010 first quarter net income attributable to common shareholder of $11.0 million, compared with a net loss of $15.5 million for the comparable 2009 quarter.
2010 and 2011 On-going Earnings Outlook
The Company continues to estimate its 2010 on-going consolidated earnings will be in the range of $2.95 to $3.10 per diluted share. Key factors and assumptions underlying the outlook remain unchanged, except for the following:
For 2011, the Company continues to estimate its on-going consolidated earnings will be within the guidance range provided for 2010 on-going consolidated earnings, with some opportunity for modestly exceeding that range.
