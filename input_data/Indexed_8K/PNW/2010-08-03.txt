(d) Exhibits.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, each registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99.1
PHOENIX  Pinnacle West Capital Corp. (NYSE: PNW) today reported consolidated net income attributable to common shareholders of $114.8 million, or $1.07 per diluted share of common stock, for the quarter ended June 30, 2010. This result compares with net income attributable to common shareholders of $68.3 million, or $0.68 per diluted share, for the same quarter in 2009.
Excluding results of discontinued operations related to the Company's real estate segment and its district cooling business, Pinnacle West's consolidated on-going earnings in the 2010 second quarter were $89.8 million, or $0.83 per share, compared with on-going earnings of $76.4 million or $0.75 per share, in the same period a year ago. A reconciliation of reported earnings to on-going earnings is provided at the end of this release.
"In spite of mild weather in the quarter, our emphases on controlling costs and focusing on a back-to-basics strategy helped us achieve strong operating and financial results," said Pinnacle West Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Don Brandt.
The second-quarter on-going results comparison was positively impacted by the following factors:
 
These positive factors were offset in part by the following items:
Consolidated on-going earnings exclude results from discontinued operations. Income from discontinued operations was $25.0 million, or $0.24 per share, for the second quarter of 2010, which compared favorably with a loss from discontinued operations of $8.0 million, or $0.07 per share, for the same quarter a year earlier. The changes were primarily attributable to disposal of non-core assets:
Arizona Public Service Co. (APS), the Company's principal subsidiary, reported 2010 second quarter net income attributable to common shareholder of $90.2 million, versus earnings of $78.5 million for the comparable 2009 quarter.
2010 and 2011 Earnings Outlook
The Company continues to expect its 2010 consolidated on-going earnings to be in the range of $2.95 to $3.10 per diluted share. Key factors and assumptions underlying the outlook remain unchanged, except for the following:
 
The Company also continues to estimate its 2011 consolidated on-going earnings will be within the 2010 guidance range with some opportunity for modestly exceeding that range.

In this press release, we refer to "on-going earnings." On-going earnings is a "non-GAAP financial measure," as defined in accordance with SEC rules. We believe on-going earnings provide investors with a useful indicator of our results that is comparable among periods because it excludes the effects of unusual items that may occur on an irregular basis. Investors should note that these non-GAAP financial measures involve judgments by management, including whether an item is classified as an unusual item. We use on-going earnings, or similar concepts, to measure our performance internally in reports for management.
This press release contains forward-looking statements regarding our 2010 and 2011 earnings outlook, and neither Pinnacle West nor APS assumes any obligation to update these statements, even if our internal estimates change, except as required by applicable law. These forward-looking statements are often identified by words such as "estimate," "predict," "may," "believe," "plan," "expect," "require," "intend," "assume" and similar words. Because actual results may differ materially from expectations, we caution you not to place undue reliance on these statements. A number of factors could cause future results to differ materially from historical results, or from outcomes currently expected or sought by Pinnacle West or APS. These factors include, but are not limited to:
These and other factors are discussed in Risk Factors described in Item 1A of the Pinnacle West/APS Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009, which readers should review carefully before placing any reliance on our financial statements, disclosures or our earnings outlook.
