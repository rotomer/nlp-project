Exhibit 99.1
PHOENIX  Pinnacle West Capital Corp. (NYSE: PNW) today reported consolidated on-going earnings of $226.7 million, or $2.08 per diluted share of common stock, for the quarter ended September 30, 2010, compared to on-going earnings of $198.4 million, or $1.96 per share, for the same quarter in 2009. The quarterly comparison excludes results of discontinued operations, primarily related to the Company's real estate segment. A reconciliation of on-going earnings to net income attributable to common shareholders is provided at the end of this release.
"Our financial and operating performance in the third quarter was solid, even with slow economic recovery," said Pinnacle West Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Don Brandt. "Focusing on our core utility business, our top priorities remain operational excellence, disciplined cost management and sound capital investment to provide a reliable, sustainable energy future for Arizona."
Pinnacle West's consolidated net income attributable to common shareholders in the 2010 third quarter was $233.9 million, or $2.14 per diluted share of common stock, compared with net income attributable to common shareholders of $186.7 million, or $1.84 per diluted share, in the same period a year ago.
 
The third-quarter on-going results comparison was positively impacted by the following factors:
These positive factors were partially offset by the following items:
Consolidated on-going earnings exclude results from discontinued operations, principally the Company's real estate operations. Income from discontinued operations was $7.2 million, or $0.06 per share, for the 2010 third-quarter, which compared favorably with a loss from discontinued operations of $11.7 million, or $0.12 per share, for the same quarter a year earlier.
APS, the Company's principal subsidiary, reported 2010 third-quarter net income attributable to common shareholder of $226.6 million versus earnings of $197.1 million for the comparable 2009 quarter.
During the quarter, APS announced 33 megawatts of new solar power plants to be built in Arizona. The facilities, which are expected to begin operating in mid- to late-2011, will produce enough power at peak production to serve 8,250 homes.
 
2010 and 2011 Earnings Outlook
The Company continues to expect its 2010 consolidated on-going earnings to be in the range of $2.95 to $3.10 per diluted share. Key factors and assumptions underlying the outlook remain unchanged, except for the following:
The Company also continues to estimate its 2011 consolidated on-going earnings will be within the 2010 guidance range with some opportunity for modestly exceeding that range.

In this press release, we refer to "on-going earnings." On-going earnings is a "non-GAAP financial measure," as defined in accordance with SEC rules. We believe on-going earnings provide investors with a useful indicator of our results that is comparable among periods because it excludes the effects of unusual items that may occur on an irregular basis. Investors should note that these non-GAAP financial measures involve judgments by management, including whether an item is classified as an unusual item. We use on-going earnings, or similar concepts, to measure our performance internally in reports for management.
This press release contains forward-looking statements regarding our 2010 and 2011 earnings outlook, and neither Pinnacle West nor APS assumes any obligation to update these statements, even if our internal estimates change, except as required by applicable law. These forward-looking statements are often identified by words such as "estimate," "predict," "may," "believe," "plan," "expect," "require," "intend," "assume" and similar words. Because actual results may differ materially from expectations, we caution you not to place undue reliance on these statements. A number of factors could cause future results to differ materially from historical results, or from outcomes currently expected or sought by Pinnacle West or APS. These factors include, but are not limited to:
 
These and other factors are discussed in Risk Factors described in Item 1A of the Pinnacle West/APS Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009, which readers should review carefully before placing any reliance on our financial statements, disclosures or our earnings outlook.
