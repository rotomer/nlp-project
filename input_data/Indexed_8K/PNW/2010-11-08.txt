On November 8, 2010, Arizona Public Service Company ("APS") and Southern California Edison ("SCE") entered into an asset purchase agreement (the "Agreement"), providing for the purchase by APS of SCE's interests in Units 4 and 5 of the Four Corners Power Plant near Farmington, New Mexico ("Four Corners"). The purchase price is $294 million, subject to certain adjustments. APS is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pinnacle West Capital Corporation ("Pinnacle West").
Four Corners consists of five coal-fired Units located on Navajo Nation land. APS owns 100% of Units 1- 3, with a combined generating capacity of 560 megawatts ("MW"). Units 4 and 5 each have a generating capacity of 770 MW. SCE owns a 48% interest in each of Units 4 and 5 (aggregating 739 MW) and APS owns a 15% interest in each Unit (aggregating 231 MW). The other owners of Units 4 and 5 are Public Service Company of New Mexico (13%), Salt River Project Agricultural Improvement and Power District (10%), El Paso Electric (7%) and Tucson Electric Power Company (7%). APS operates the plant on behalf of all participants.
Completion of the purchase by APS of SCE's interests, which is expected to occur in the second half of 2012, is subject to the receipt of approvals by SCE or APS from various regulatory agencies, including the Arizona Corporation Commission, the California Public Utilities Commission and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. APS and SCE intend to file applications with their respective commissions in the near future seeking requisite authority or approvals to complete the transaction. Closing is also conditioned on the execution of a new coal supply contract for the lease renewal period, expiration of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act and other typical closing conditions.
APS, on behalf of the Four Corners owners, has negotiated amendments to an existing facility lease with the Navajo Nation which would extend the Four Corners leasehold interest to 2041. Execution by the Navajo Nation of the lease amendments is a condition to closing of the purchase by APS of SCE's interests in Four Corners. The execution of these amendments by the Navajo Nation requires the approval of the Navajo Nation Tribal Council. The effectiveness of the amendments also requires the approval of the U.S. Department of the Interior, as does a related Federal rights-of-way grant which the Four Corners owners will pursue. A Federal environmental review will be conducted as part of the DOI review process.
Pursuant to a Co-Tenancy Agreement among the Four Corners owners, the other owners have a right of first refusal to purchase shares of SCE's interests proportional to their current ownership percentages. The exercise of this purchase right by any of the other owners must be exercised within 120 days of notice of the proposed sale to the owners. If any of the purchase rights are exercised, the amount available for purchase by APS would be reduced. Either party may terminate the Agreement if the closing conditions have not been met by December 31, 2012.
 
APS has announced that, if APS' purchase of SCE's interests in Units 4 and 5 at Four Corners is consummated, it will close Units 1, 2 and 3 at the plant. Such closure will reduce the plant's overall generating capacity from 2,100 MW to 1,540 MW. When applying for approval to purchase Units 4 and 5, APS will also request recovery of any unrecovered costs associated with the closure of Units 1, 2 and 3.
A copy of the press release announcing the Agreement and proposed Unit closures is attached as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein by reference.
This filing contains forward-looking statements regarding the future performance of APS within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. APS does not assume any obligation to update these statements, except as required by applicable law. These forward-looking statements are often identified by words such as "estimate," "predict," "may," "believe," "plan," "expect," "require," "intend," "assume" and similar words. A number of factors could cause future outcomes to differ materially from outcomes currently expected or sought by APS with respect to the transactions described herein. These factors include, but are not limited to, the parties' ability to obtain all necessary regulatory approvals on acceptable terms and to satisfy all other closing conditions. In addition, potential legislation and increased regulation concerning plant emissions, including the Environmental Protection Agency's determination of final regional haze rules related to Four Corners, could impact the economic viability of Four Corners as well as the willingness or ability of the Four Corner's owners to fund any required equipment upgrades. Other factors are discussed in Risk Factors described in Item 1A of the Pinnacle West Capital Corporation/APS Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009, which readers should review carefully. Because actual results may differ materially from expectations, we caution readers not to place undue reliance on these statements.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, each registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

(e) . Either Party may initiate final and binding arbitration with respect to the matters first submitted to mediation by providing Notice of a demand for binding arbitration before a single, neutral arbitrator (the "") at any time following the unsuccessful conclusion of the mediation provided for above. The Parties will cooperate with one another in selecting the Arbitrator within sixty (60) days after Notice of the demand for arbitration and will further cooperate in scheduling the arbitration to commence no later than one hundred eighty (180) days from the date of Notice of the demand. To be qualified as an Arbitrator, each candidate must be a retired judge of a trial court of any state or federal court, or retired justice of any appellate or supreme court.

(ii) The initial disclosure will occur within thirty (30) days after the initial conference with the Arbitrator or at such time as the Arbitrator may order;
(iii) Discovery may commence at any time after the Parties' initial disclosure;
(iv) The Parties will not be permitted to propound any interrogatories or requests for admissions;
(v) Discovery by each Party will be limited to twenty-five (25) document requests (with no subparts), three (3) lay witness depositions, and three (3) expert

(vi) Each Party is allowed a maximum of three (3) expert witnesses, excluding rebuttal experts;
(vii) Within sixty (60) days after the initial disclosure, or at such other time as the Arbitrator may order, the Parties shall exchange a list of all experts upon which they intend to rely at the arbitration proceeding;

(ix) Unless the Parties agree otherwise, all direct testimony will be in form of affidavits or declarations under penalty of perjury; and
(x) Each Party shall make available for cross examination at the arbitration hearing its witnesses whose direct testimony has been so submitted.
The Arbitrator will have the authority to grant any form of equitable or legal relief a Party might recover in a court action. The Parties acknowledge and agree that irreparable damage would occur if certain provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with the terms of the Agreement, that money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of these provisions of this Agreement, and that the Parties shall be entitled, without the requirement of posting a bond or other security, to specific performance and injunctive or other equitable relief as a remedy for a breach of this Agreement. Judgment on the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. The Arbitrator must, in any award, allocate all of the costs of the binding arbitration (other than each Party's individual attorneys' fees and costs related to the Party's participation in the arbitration, which fees and costs will be borne by such Party), including the fees of the Arbitrator and any expert witnesses, against the Party who did not prevail; provided that if neither Party prevails completely such costs shall be allocated in favor of the Party who substantially prevailed as determined by the Arbitrator. Until such award is made, however, the Parties will share equally in paying the costs of the arbitration.

Exhibit 99.1
PHOENIX  Arizona Public Service Company has entered into an agreement to purchase Southern California Edison's ownership in Units 4 and 5 of the Four Corners Power Plant near Farmington, N.M. If the transaction gains approval from state and federal regulators, APS will close the plant's older, less efficient Units 1, 2 and 3 and install additional emission controls on the remaining units, the company announced today.
APS will pay $294 million for the Southern California Edison share, which is substantially less than other generation alternatives.
"This course of action represents the best alternative for APS and its customers and provides a cleaner environment while preserving a needed reliable and affordable supply of energy for the Southwest," said Mark Schiavoni, APS Senior Vice President of Fossil Generation.
In announcing the agreement, Schiavoni said there will be no layoffs at the plant, which employs 549 workers (74 percent of whom are Navajo) and provides enough electricity for more than a half-million homes. The plant and the supporting mining operations have a $225 million annual impact on the New Mexico and Navajo economies.
"This proposal enables us to continue to support the Navajo Nation and the Farmington area with high-quality jobs that are important economic drivers for the region," said Schiavoni. Continued operation of Units 4 and 5 is expected to provide more than $6.3 billion in economic value to the region over the next 30 years, at least 70 percent of which will benefit the Navajo Nation and its citizens.
APS, the plant operator, owns 100 percent of Units 1, 2 and 3, which are subject to significant environmental upgrades under rules proposed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in October. "These rules would present a major economic challenge for continued operation and require us to look at alternatives for Units 1, 2 and 3," said Schiavoni.
As a result of the anticipated shutdown of Units 1, 2 and 3, capacity at the coal-fired station, one of the nation's largest, would be reduced by 560 megawatts from 2,100 MW to 1,540 MW (of which APS would own 970 MW). Emissions of NO would decline by 36 percent, mercury by 61 percent, particulates by 43 percent, CO by 30 percent and SO by 24 percent. APS would replace the energy lost through the closure of the three older units with 739 MW from Southern California Edison's 48 percent share of the newer, more efficient Units 4 and 5. APS currently owns 15 percent of the two units.

"Closing the three smaller, less efficient units and keeping the cleaner, more efficient Units 4 and 5 in operation would dramatically reduce the carbon footprint in the region and enable the plant to remain compliant with state and federal environmental standards," said Schiavoni. "As always, our commitment to outstanding performance and environmental stewardship at the plant remains unwavering."
The Four Corners plant meets or exceeds all current state and federal environmental regulations and has performed at a high level for more than four decades. Southern California Edison, however, has informed the plant's other owners that California state law requires it to end participation in the plant by 2016, when the current lease with the Navajo Nation expires.
The transaction requires approval from the Arizona Corporation Commission, the California Public Utilities Commission and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. In addition, the acquisition is contingent on the Navajo Nation approving a lease extension for the plant beyond 2016. It also requires successful negotiation of a new fuel contract with mine-operator BHP Billiton for the post-2016 period. Assuming timely receipt of required approvals and extensions of the land-lease and fuel contract, the companies are targeting closing the purchase by the end of 2012.
APS will submit a filing with the ACC in mid-November followed shortly thereafter with a filing at FERC.
"Installing emission control equipment at Units 1, 2 and 3, or shutting them down and seeking replacement power elsewhere, would have imposed substantial additional costs on our customers. The proposal to acquire Southern California Edison's share of Units 4 and 5 saves customers nearly $500 million over the next best alternative," said Jeff Guldner, APS Vice President of Regulation. "While reducing overall power plant emissions in the Southwest, this proposal maintains a healthy diversity in APS's generation portfolio as we integrate more renewable resources and manage our exposure to volatile fuel sources such as natural gas."
Other owners of Units 4 and 5 include Public Service of New Mexico, Salt River Project, El Paso Electric and Tucson Electric Power.
APS, Arizona's largest and longest-serving electricity utility, serves more than 1.1 million customers in 11 of the state's 15 counties. With headquarters in Phoenix, APS is the largest subsidiary of Pinnacle West Capital Corp. (NYSE: PNW).
