Arizona Corporation Commission ("ACC") Approves Decoupling Policy Statement
As previously disclosed in the Pinnacle West Capital Corporation/Arizona Public Service Company ("APS") Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2010, in October 2010 the Chairman of the ACC issued a draft decoupling policy statement for consideration by the commission. On December 15, 2010, the ACC unanimously approved a slightly modified decoupling policy statement supportive of using a revenue-per-customer methodology, which is the mechanism APS and a number of other parties also support. Decoupling refers to a ratemaking design which reduces or removes the linkage between sales and utility revenues and/or profits, reducing utility disincentives to the adoption of programs that benefit customers by saving energy. Mechanically, decoupling compares actual versus authorized revenues or revenue per customer over a period and either credits or collects any differences from customers in a subsequent period. The policy permits regulated utilities to file a decoupling proposal in their next general rate case. APS intends to include a decoupling model consistent with the policy statement for consideration in its upcoming general rate case, currently expected to be filed in mid-2011.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, each registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
