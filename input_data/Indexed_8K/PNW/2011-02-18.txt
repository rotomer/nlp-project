Arizona Public Service Company ("APS") Facility
On February 14, 2011, APS entered into an unsecured revolving credit facility with Barclays Bank PLC, as Agent and Issuing Bank, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, as Syndication Agent, Credit Suisse AG, Cayman Islands Branch, as Issuing Bank, and Bank of America, N.A. and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Co-Documentation Agents, and the lender parties thereto, allowing APS to borrow, repay and reborrow, from time to time, up to $500 million on or prior to February 13, 2015. On February 14, 2011, APS terminated its prior $489 million revolving credit facility with Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent and Issuing Bank, The Bank of New York, as Syndication Agent and Issuing Bank, Citibank, N.A., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Credit Suisse, Cayman Islands Branch, as Co-Documentation Agents, and the lender parties thereto, which was replaced by the new facility. The prior revolving credit facility would have expired on September 28, 2011. APS will use the new facility for general corporate purposes, including as a standby facility to support commercial paper issuances. The facility can also be used for letters of credit.
Borrowings under the facility will bear interest based on APS's then-current senior unsecured debt ratings.
Borrowings under the facility are conditioned on APS's ability to make certain representations at the time each borrowing is made, except for representations concerning no material adverse effect and certain litigation matters, which were made only at the time the facility was entered into. The facility includes customary covenants, including that APS maintain a maximum consolidated debt-to-capitalization ratio and comply with certain lien restrictions. The facility also includes customary events of default, including a cross default provision and a change of control provision relating to Pinnacle West Capital Corporation ("Pinnacle West" or the "Company"), the parent company of APS. If an event of default occurs, lenders holding a specified percentage of the commitments, or the administrative agent with such lenders' consent, may terminate the obligations of the lenders to make loans under the facility and the obligations of the issuing banks to issue letters of credit and may declare the obligations outstanding under the facility to be due and payable.
APS and its affiliates maintain normal banking and other relationships with the agents and various other lenders in the new facility and in the prior $489 million revolving credit facility that has been terminated.

Exhibit 99.1
PHOENIX  Pinnacle West Capital Corporation (NYSE: PNW) today reported consolidated on-going earnings of $7.1 million, or $0.06 per diluted share of common stock, for the quarter ended December 31, 2010. This result compares with an on-going loss of $16.1 million, or $0.16 per share, in the same 2009 period. The Company reported net income attributable to common shareholders of $7.4 million, or $0.07 per share, for the 2010 fourth quarter, compared with a consolidated net loss of $30.2 million, or $0.30 per diluted share, for the same quarter a year ago.
For the year 2010 as a whole, Pinnacle West reported consolidated on-going earnings of $330.4 million, or $3.08 per share, as compared to $233.3 million, or $2.30 per share, a year ago. Consolidated net income attributable to common shareholders for 2010 was $350.1 million, or $3.27 per diluted share, compared with 2009 net income of $68.3 million, or $0.67 per diluted share.
On-going earnings exclude results of discontinued real estate operations and a gain on the 2010 sale of a district cooling business and related operating results. Reconciliations of on-going earnings to net income attributable to common shareholders are provided at the end of this release.
"Our 2009 utility retail regulatory settlement, disciplined cost management and concentration on our core electricity business helped produce solid financial results that were in line with our expectations," said Pinnacle West Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Don Brandt. "In addition, our employees achieved superior operational performance across our business, particularly in the areas of customer satisfaction, reliability and safety."
 
Brandt cited the following examples of the Company's 2010 achievements:
The fourth-quarter on-going results comparison was positively impacted by the following major factors:
These positive factors were partially offset by the following items:
 
APS, the Company's principal subsidiary, recorded 2010 fourth-quarter net income attributable to common shareholder of $7.8 million versus a net loss of $8.9 million for the comparable 2009 quarter. For 2010 as a whole, APS net income attributable to common shareholder was $335.7 million compared with $251.2 million for 2009.

In this press release, we refer to "on-going earnings." On-going earnings is a "non-GAAP financial measure," as defined in accordance with SEC rules. We believe on-going earnings provide investors with a useful indicator of our results that is comparable among periods because it excludes the effects of unusual items that may occur on an irregular basis. Investors should note that these non-GAAP financial measures involve judgments by management, including whether an item is classified as an unusual item. We use on-going earnings, or similar concepts, to measure our performance internally in reports for management.
 
This press release contains forward-looking statements based on our current expectations, including statements regarding our 2011 earnings outlook. These forward-looking statements are often identified by words such as "estimate," "predict," "may," "believe," "plan," "expect," "require," "intend," "assume" and similar words. Because actual results may differ materially from expectations, we caution readers not to place undue reliance on these statements. A number of factors could cause future results to differ materially from historical results, or from outcomes currently expected or sought by Pinnacle West or APS. These factors include, but are not limited to:
These and other factors are discussed in Risk Factors described in Item 1A of the Pinnacle West/APS Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010, which readers should review carefully before placing any reliance on our financial statements, disclosures or our earnings outlook. Neither Pinnacle West nor APS assumes any obligation to update these statements, even if our internal estimates change, except as required by law.

Exhibit 99.4
Last Updated 2/18/11
The following discussion includes the earnings variance explanations for Pinnacle West Capital Corporation ("Pinnacle West") for the three months and twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. We suggest that this discussion be read in connection with the Pinnacle West/APS Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010. Additional operating and financial statistics and a glossary of terms are available on our website (www.pinnaclewest.com).
Pinnacle West's reportable business segment is our regulated electricity segment, which consists of traditional regulated retail and wholesale electricity businesses (primarily electricity service to Native Load customers) and related activities and includes electricity generation, transmission and distribution.
Our reportable business segments reflect a change from previously reported information. As of December 31, 2010, our real estate activities are no longer considered a segment requiring separate reporting or disclosure. In 2009 our real estate subsidiary, SunCor, began disposing of its homebuilding operations, master-planned communities, land parcels, commercial assets and golf courses in order to reduce its outstanding debt (see Note 23). At December 31, 2010, SunCor had total remaining assets of about $16 million, which includes approximately $3 million of assets held for sale. Additionally, all of SunCor's operations are reflected in discontinued operations.
Operating Results  Three-month period ended December 31, 2010 compared with three-month period ended December 31, 2009
Our consolidated net income attributable to common shareholders for the three months ended December 31, 2010 was $7 million, compared with a net loss of $30 million for the comparable prior-year period. The $37 million variance consists of a $23 million increase in income from continuing operations and a $14 million increase from discontinued operations (primarily real estate activities). As discussed in greater detail below, the improved results reflect an increase of approximately $20 million in regulated electricity segment net income primarily due to increased revenues related to APS's retail rate increases, partially offset by increased operating expenses.

Taxes other than income taxes
 
Last Updated 2/18/11
Income taxes were $4 million lower for the three months ended December 31, 2010 compared with the prior year primarily because of $4 million of income tax benefits related to prior years that were resolved in the current year and $2 million of income tax benefits related to the extension of the Federal R&D credit, partially offset by higher pretax income in the current-year period.
Income taxes
Discontinued Operations
As of December 31, 2010, all of SunCor's operations have been reclassified to discontinued operations. The income from discontinued operations related to real estate activities was $14 million higher for the three months ended December 31, 2010 compared with the prior-year period primarily because of real estate impairment charges recorded in the prior-year period.
Real estate activities
Operating Results  2010 compared with 2009
Our consolidated net income attributable to common shareholders for 2010 was $350 million, compared with $68 million for the comparable prior-year period. The improved results were primarily due to lower real estate impairment charges recorded in 2010 compared with the prior-year period by SunCor.
In addition, regulated electricity segment net income increased approximately $82 million from the prior-year period due to increased revenues related to APS's retail rate increases and other factors. Our consolidated results for 2010 also include a gain of $25 million after income taxes related to the sale of APSES' district cooling business.

Taxes other than income taxes
Interest charges, net of allowance for funds used during construction, decreased $8 million for the year ended 2010 compared with the prior year primarily because of higher rates in the current year for the allowance for equity and borrowed funds used during construction, partially offset by higher interest charges due to higher debt balances. Interest charges, net of allowance for funds used during construction are comprised of the regulated electricity segment portions of the line items interest expense and allowance for equity and borrowed funds used during construction from the Consolidated Statements of Income.
Interest charges, net of allowance for funds used during construction
Income taxes were $19 million higher for the year ended 2010 compared with the prior year primarily because of higher pretax income in the current-year period, partially offset by $17 million of income tax benefits related to prior years that were resolved in the current year. See Note 4.
Income taxes
All other
All other revenues increased $56 million partially offset by increased other expenses of $41 million resulting primarily from improved margins from APSES' products and services business. In addition, other income was higher due to investment losses at El Dorado in 2009.
Discontinued Operations
During the first quarter of 2009, SunCor's Board of Directors authorized a series of strategic transactions to dispose of SunCor's assets. This decision resulted in impairment charges of approximately $161 million after income taxes in 2009. As of December 31, 2010, all of SunCor's operations have been reclassified to discontinued operations (see Note 22). The after-tax impacts of the $6 million loss from real estate activities for the year ended 2010 includes real estate impairment charges of approximately $10 million (see Note 23) and other costs of $6 million, partially offset by a gain from debt restructuring of approximately $10 million (see Note 6).
Real estate activities
All other earnings from discontinued operations were $24 million higher for the year ended 2010 compared to the prior-year period primarily because of a gain of $25 million after income taxes related to the sale of APSES' district cooling business in 2010.
