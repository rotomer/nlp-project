Exhibit 99.1
NEWS
PHOENIX  Pinnacle West Capital Corp. (NYSE: PNW) today reported a consolidated net loss attributable to common shareholders of $15.1 million, or $0.14 per diluted share of common stock, for the quarter ended March 31, 2011. This result compares with a net loss attributable to common shareholders of $6.0 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, for the same quarter in 2010.
Pinnacle West's consolidated on-going loss in the 2011 first quarter was $14.8 million, or $0.14 per share, compared with on-going earnings of $6.9 million or $0.07 per share, in the same period a year ago. A reconciliation of net loss attributable to common shareholders to on-going earnings (loss) is provided at the end of this release.
"Our first-quarter results were in line with our expectations," said Pinnacle West Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Don Brandt. "Retail electricity sales improved modestly over this time last year and appear to indicate stabilized economic conditions in Arizona. The associated revenue growth, however, was more than offset by the planned timing and level of maintenance at our fossil plants in preparation for our peak summer season.
"We have made improvements over the past few years in customer satisfaction, operational excellence and cost management. We also have seen progress in Arizona's regulatory framework. Going forward, we intend to build on this positive momentum."
 
The 2011 first-quarter on-going results were positively impacted by the following factors:
These positive factors were more than offset by:
APS, the Company's principal subsidiary, reported a 2011 first-quarter net loss attributable to common shareholder of $12.1 million, compared with net income of $11.0 million for the comparable 2010 quarter.
2011 Earnings Outlook
Pinnacle West continues to expect its 2011 consolidated on-going earnings will be in the range of $3.00 to $3.15 per diluted share.

In this press release, we refer to "on-going earnings (loss)." On-going earnings (loss) is a "non-GAAP financial measure," as defined in accordance with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules. We believe on-going earnings (loss) provide investors with a useful indicator of our results that is comparable among periods because it excludes the effects of unusual items that may occur on an irregular basis. Investors should note that these non-GAAP financial measures involve judgments by management, including whether an item is classified as an unusual item. We use on-going earnings (loss), or similar concepts, to measure our performance internally in reports for management.

Because actual results may differ materially from expectations, we caution readers not to place undue reliance on these statements.

These factors include, but are not limited to:
These and other factors are discussed in Risk Factors described in Item 1A of the Pinnacle West/APS Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010, which readers should review carefully before placing any reliance on our financial statements, disclosures or our earnings outlook.
