Pinnacle West Capital Corporation (the "Company") is filing this Amendment No. 1 on Form 8-K/A to its Current Report on Form 8-K, which was filed on May 24, 2011 (the Original Form 8-K), to provide additional disclosures regarding the advisory vote on the frequency of advisory votes on executive compensation held at the Company's 2011 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.  This Amendment No. 1 does not amend or modify the Original Form 8-K in any other respect. Accordingly, this Amendment No. 1 should be read in conjunction with the Original Form 8-K.
 
Item 5.07.  Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.
 
As reported in the original Form 8-K, at the Company's Annual Meeting of Shareholders held on May 18, 2011, shareholders cast the highest number of votes for holding an advisory vote on executive compensation on an annual basis.  On June 24, 2011, our Board of Directors determined that the Company will hold future advisory votes on executive compensation on an annual basis until the Company next holds an advisory vote of shareholders on the frequency of such votes.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
