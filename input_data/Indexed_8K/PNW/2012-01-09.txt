Item 1.01               Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
 
On January 6, 2012, Arizona Public Service Company ("APS") and other parties to APS's pending general retail rate case entered into an agreement (the "Settlement Agreement") detailing the terms upon which the parties have agreed to settle the rate case.  The Settlement Agreement requires the approval of the Arizona Corporation Commission (the "ACC").  The ACC has scheduled an evidentiary hearing on the matter commencing on January 26, 2012.
 
The Settlement Agreement provides for a zero net change in base rates, consisting of: (1) a non-fuel base rate increase of $116.3 million; (2) a fuel-related base rate decrease of $153.1 million (to be implemented by a change in the base fuel rate from $0.03757 to $0.03207 per kWh); and (3) the transfer of cost recovery for certain renewable energy projects from the Renewable Energy Surcharge ("RES") to base rates in an estimated amount of $36.8 million.
 
APS also agreed not to file its next general rate case before May 31, 2015, and not to request that its next general retail rate increase be effective prior to July 1, 2016.  The Settlement Agreement allows APS to request a change to its base rates during the stay-out period in the event of an extraordinary event that, in the ACC's judgment, requires base rate relief in order to protect the public interest.  Nor is APS precluded from seeking rate relief, or any other party to the Settlement Agreement precluded from petitioning the ACC to examine the reasonableness of APS's rates, in the event of significant regulatory developments that materially impact the financial results expected under the terms of the Settlement Agreement.
 
Other key provisions of the Settlement Agreement include the following:
 
                 
An authorized return on common equity of 10.0%;
 
                 
A capital structure comprised of 46.06% debt and 53.94% common equity;
 
                 
A test year ended December 31, 2010, adjusted to include plant that is in service as of March 31, 2012;
 
                 
Deferral of property taxes above or below a specified 2010 test year level caused by changes to the Arizona property tax rate as follows:
 
                 
Deferral of 25% in 2012, 50% in 2013 and 75% for 2014 and subsequent years when property tax rates increase; and
 
                 
Deferral of 100% in all years when property tax rates decrease;
 
                 
A procedure to allow APS to request rate adjustments prior to its next general rate case related to APS's proposed acquisition (should it be consummated) of additional interests in Units 4 and 5 and the related closure of Units 1-3 of the Four Corners Power Plant;
 
                 
Implementation of a "Lost Fixed Cost Recovery" rate mechanism to support energy efficiency and distributed renewable generation;
                 
Modifications to the Environmental Improvement Surcharge ("EIS") to allow for the recovery of carrying costs for capital expenditures associated with government-mandated environmental controls, subject to an existing per kWh cap on cost recovery that could produce approximately $5 million annually;
 
                 
Modifications to the Power Supply Adjustor ("PSA"), including the elimination of the current 90/10 sharing provision;
 
                 
Allowing a negative credit that currently exists in the PSA to continue until February 2013, rather than being reset on the anticipated July 1, 2012 rate effective date;
 
                 
Modification of the Transmission Cost Adjustor to streamline the process for future transmission-related rate changes; and
 
                 
Implementation of various changes to rate schedules, including the adoption of an experimental "buy-through" rate that could allow certain large commercial and industrial customers to select alternative sources of generation to be supplied by APS.
 
If the Settlement Agreement is approved by the ACC, APS expects that its provisions will become effective on or about July 1, 2012.  As is the case with all such agreements, APS cannot predict whether the Settlement Agreement will be approved in the form filed.
