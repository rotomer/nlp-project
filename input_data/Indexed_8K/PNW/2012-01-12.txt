Conditions of the Obligations of the Underwriters
.  The obligations of the several Underwriters to purchase and pay for the Securities on the Closing Date will be subject to the accuracy of the representations and warranties on the part of the Company herein, to the accuracy of the statements of Company officers made pursuant to the provisions hereof, to the performance by the Company of its obligations hereunder and to the following additional conditions precedent:
 
(a)
                                 
On the date hereof, the Representative shall have received a letter, dated the date hereof, of Deloitte & Touche LLP, confirming that they are independent registered public accountants within the meaning of the Act and the applicable published Rules and Regulations thereunder and the applicable published rules and regulations of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("") and stating to the effect that:
PCAOB
 
(i)
                                    
in their opinion, the financial statements and financial statement schedule audited by them and incorporated by reference in the Pricing Disclosure
Package and the Prospectus comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Act and the related published Rules and Regulations;
 
(ii)
                                 
they have performed the procedures specified by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for a review of interim financial information as described in PCAOB AU 722, Interim Financial Information, on any unaudited financial statements included in the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus;
 
(iii)
                              
on the basis of the review referred to in clause (ii) above, a reading of the latest available interim financial statements of the Company, inquiries of officials of the Company who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters and other specified procedures, nothing came to their attention that caused them to believe that:
 
(A)
                             
the unaudited financial statements, if any, included in the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus do not comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Act and the related published Rules and Regulations or any material modifications should be made to such unaudited financial statements and summary of earnings for them to be in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles;
 
(B)
                               
if any unaudited "capsule" information is contained in the Pricing Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, the unaudited operating revenues, gross income, net income and net income per share amounts or other amounts constituting such "capsule" information and described in such letter do not agree with the corresponding amounts set forth in the unaudited financial statements or were not determined on a basis substantially consistent with that of the corresponding amounts in the audited statements of income;
 
(C)
                               
at the date of the latest available balance sheet read by such accountants, or at a subsequent specified date not more than three business days prior to the date of such letter, there was any change in the amounts of common stock, redeemable preferred stock or non-redeemable preferred stock of the Company or any increase, exceeding $10,000,000, in long-term debt of the Company or, at the date of the most recent available unaudited financial statements, there was any decrease in net current assets or common stock equity as compared with amounts shown in the most recent financial statements included in the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, except in all cases for changes, increases or decreases that result from the declaration or payment of dividends; or
 
(D)
                              
for the period from the closing date of the latest income statement included in the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus to the closing date of the latest available income statement read by such accountants, there were any decreases, as compared with the corresponding period of the previous year and with the period of corresponding length ended the date of the latest income statement included in the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, in the amounts of total revenues or net income;
 
except in all cases set forth in clause (C) and clause (D) above for changes, increases or decreases that the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus disclose have occurred or may occur or that are described in such letter; and
 
(iv)
                             
they have compared specified dollar amounts (or percentages derived from such dollar amounts) and other financial information contained in the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus (in each case to the extent that such dollar amounts, percentages and other financial information are derived from the general accounting records of the Company and its subsidiaries subject to the internal controls of the Company's accounting system or are derived directly from such records by analysis or computation) with the results obtained from inquiries, a reading of such general accounting records and other procedures specified in such letter and have found such dollar amounts, percentages and other financial information to be in agreement with such results, except as otherwise specified in such letter.
 
All financial statements and schedules included in material incorporated by reference into the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus shall be deemed included in the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus for purposes of this Section 6(a).
 
(b)
                                
Any Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus shall have been timely filed with the Commission in accordance with Section 4(a).  The Company shall have complied with all filing requirements applicable to any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus.  No stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or preventing or suspending the use of the Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus shall have been issued, no proceeding or examination for such purpose or pursuant to Section 8A of the Act against the Company or related to the offering shall have been initiated or threatened by the Commission and no order directed to the adequacy of any document incorporated by reference in any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus shall have been issued.  Any request of the Commission for inclusion of additional information in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or otherwise shall have been complied with or resolved to the reasonable satisfaction of the Representative.  The Commission shall not have notified the Company of any objection to the use of the form of the Registration Statement.
 
(c)
                                 
Subsequent to the execution of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date, (i) there shall not have occurred any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting particularly the financial position, business or properties of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole that, in the reasonable judgment of the Representative, materially impairs the investment quality of the Securities, (ii) there shall not have occurred a suspension or material limitation in trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange or in the Company's securities, (iii) there shall not have occurred, in respect of the Company's securities, any downgrading or withdrawal, nor shall any notice have been given in respect of the Company's securities of any intended or potential downgrading or withdrawal or of any review for a possible change that does not indicate the direction of the possible change, and there shall have been no public announcement that any of the Company's securities have been placed on CreditWatch or Watchlist or under any similar surveillance or review, in each case with negative implications, by Standard & Poor's Ratings Services, a Standard & Poor's Financial Services LLC business, Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or Fitch, Inc., (iv) there shall
not have occurred a general moratorium on commercial banking activities in New York declared by either federal or State of New York authorities, (v) there shall not have occurred any material disruption of commercial banking, settlements of securities or clearance services in the United States and (vi) there shall not have occurred any outbreak or escalation of major hostilities in which the United States is involved, any declaration of war by Congress or any other substantial national or international calamity or emergency if, in the judgment of the Representative, the effect of any such outbreak, escalation, declaration, calamity or emergency makes it impractical or inadvisable to proceed with completion of the sale of and payment for the Securities.  If the Underwriters elect not to purchase the Securities as a result of the occurrence of one of the events specified in this Section 6(c), the Representative will promptly notify the Company.
 
(d)
                                
The Underwriters shall have received an opinion of David P. Falck, Executive Vice President, General Counsel & Secretary of the Company, dated the Closing Date, to the effect that:

(vii)
                          
the issue and sale of the Securities and the performance by the Company of its obligations under this Agreement, the Indenture and the Securities will not cause a breach or default under (a) any agreement to which the Company is a party or by which the Company is bound that is filed as an exhibit to the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010, the Company's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarters ended March 31, 2011, June 30, 2011 and September 30, 2011 or the Company's Current Reports on Form 8-K filed since the date of filing of the above-referenced Annual Report on Form 10-K, in each case pursuant to Item 601(b)(4), Item 601(b)(10) or Item 601(b)(99) of Regulation S-K, (b) the Company's five-year unsecured revolving credit facility dated as of November 4, 2011 with Barclays Bank PLC, as Agent and Issuing Bank, or (c) any other indenture or mortgage or other deed of trust, loan agreement or other agreement or instrument to which the Company is a party or by which the Company is bound or to which any of the property or assets of the Company is subject, except, in the case of this clause (c), for any such breach or default that is not reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect (it being understood that such counsel need express no opinion as to any breach or default (x) arising under or based upon any covenant of a financial or numerical nature or requiring computation or (y) otherwise not ascertainable from the face of any such agreement, this Agreement or the Indenture; and it being further understood that the opinion in clause (c) is based solely on such counsel's personal knowledge after consultation with other lawyers under such counsel's supervision who are responsible for legal review of contracts);
(viii)

(ix)
                               
the statements set forth in each of the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus under the captions "Description Of APS Unsecured Debt Securities" and "Description Of The Notes", insofar as they purport to constitute a summary of the terms of the Securities and the Indenture, are accurate and complete in all material respects;
 
(x)
                                  
the Company is not, and, after giving effect to the offering and sale of the Securities, will not be, an "investment company" or an entity "controlled" by an "investment company", as such terms are defined in the Investment Company Act;
 
(xi)
                               
to such counsel's knowledge, there are no legal or governmental proceedings required to be described in the Prospectus that are not described as required, nor any contracts or documents of a character required to be described in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package, or the Prospectus or to be filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement that are not described and filed as required (it being understood that such counsel need express no opinion as to the statements of eligibility and qualification of the Trustee under the Trust Indenture Act);
 
(xii)
                            
the Registration Statement was automatically effective upon filing; any required filing of each prospectus relating to the Securities (including the Prospectus) pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the Rules and Regulations has been made in the manner and within the time period required by Rule 424(b) of the Rules and Regulations; all material required to be filed by the Company pursuant to Rule 433(d) of the Rules and Regulations has been filed with the Commission within the applicable time period prescribed for such filing by Rule 164 of the Rules and Regulations and Rule 433 of the Rules and Regulations (it being understood that such counsel need express no opinion as to any "free writing prospectus", as defined in Rule 405 of the Rules and Regulations, that any Underwriter uses, authorizes the use of, refers to or participates in the use of, except for a "free writing prospectus" that is (a) permitted by Section 5 of this Agreement and (b) required to be filed by the Company pursuant to Rule 433(d) of the Rules and Regulations); and, to the knowledge of such counsel, no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or any notice that would prevent its use has been issued and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or threatened; and
(xiii)
                         
the Registration Statement, as of the time it became effective and as of the date that the Company filed its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010 with the Commission, and the Prospectus, as of the date of such counsel's opinion, in each case as amended by the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed with the Commission on or prior to the Closing Date, with respect to the issuance and sale of the Securities, and other than financial statements and schedules and other financial, statistical or accounting data included or incorporated by reference therein or omitted therefrom, as to which such counsel need express no opinion, appear on their face to be appropriately responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the Act and the Rules and Regulations; and, although such counsel does not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements or other information contained in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, except as expressly provided in Section 6(d)(ii) and Section 6(d)(ix), and has not independently verified any of such statements or other information, such counsel has no reason to believe that (in each case excluding financial statements and schedules and other financial, statistical or accounting data included or incorporated by reference therein or omitted therefrom and the Statement of Eligibility (Form T-1) of the Trustee under the Indenture, as to all of which such counsel need express no opinion):
 
(A)
                             
the Registration Statement, as of the Effective Date, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading;
 
(B)
                               
the Pricing Disclosure Package, as of the Applicable Time, included any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; or
 
(C)
                               
the Prospectus, as of its date or at the date of such counsel's opinion, included or includes any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
 
In giving such opinion, (x) such counsel shall state that such opinion is limited to the federal laws of the United States and the law of the State of Arizona, (y) such counsel may rely to the extent such counsel deems appropriate upon the opinion of Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP, counsel for the Underwriters, as to all matters governed by the law of the State of New York and (z) such counsel may state that his opinions are subject to certain customary assumptions and qualifications acceptable to the Underwriters and their counsel.
 
(e)
                                 
The Underwriters shall have received an opinion of Keleher & McLeod, P.A., New Mexico counsel for the Company, dated the Closing Date, to the effect that:
 
(i)
                                    
the Company is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation, and is in good standing, in the State of New Mexico and has the requisite
corporate power and corporate authority from the State of New Mexico to conduct its business in the State of New Mexico as such business is currently being conducted; and
 
(ii)
                                 
the activities of the Company in the State of New Mexico to date do not constitute it a "public utility" as that term is defined in the relevant laws of the State of New Mexico, and, accordingly, no public utility franchises or certificates of convenience and necessity are necessary under New Mexico law with respect to the maintenance and operation of the Company's property and business as now conducted in the State of New Mexico and no approval, authorization or consent of the New Mexico Public Regulation Commission or any other public board or body of the State of New Mexico is required for the issuance and sale of the Securities on the terms and conditions set forth or contemplated in this Agreement, the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus or for the execution of the Most Recent Supplemental Indenture, except as may be required under New Mexico state securities or blue sky laws, as to which laws such counsel need express no opinion.
 
In giving such opinion, Keleher & McLeod, P.A. may rely to the extent such counsel deems appropriate upon certificates of the Company as to any factual matters upon which any such opinions are based and may rely upon the certificates of public officials concerning the legal existence and good standing of the Company.
 
(f)
                                   
The Underwriters shall have received from Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP, counsel for the Underwriters, an opinion or opinions, dated the Closing Date, with respect to such matters as they may reasonably require, and the Company shall have furnished to such counsel such documents as they request for the purpose of enabling them to pass upon such matters.
 
(g)
                                
The Underwriters shall have received a certificate of the President or any Vice President and a principal financial or accounting officer of the Company, dated the Closing Date, in which such officers, to the best of their knowledge after reasonable investigation, shall state that (i) the representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement are true and correct, (ii) the Company has complied with all agreements and satisfied all conditions on its part to be performed or satisfied pursuant to this Agreement at or prior to such Closing Date, (iii) no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued, no proceedings or examinations for that purpose or pursuant to Section 8A of the Act against the Company or related to the offering have been instituted or are contemplated by the Commission and the Commission has not notified the Company of any objection to the use of the form of the Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment thereto and (iv) subsequent to the date of the most recent financial statements in the Most Recent Preliminary Prospectus, there has been no material adverse change in or affecting the financial position or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, other than as set forth or contemplated in the Pricing Disclosure Package.

This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability that the Company may otherwise have.
provided
however
 
(b)
                                
Each Underwriter will severally indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who have signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company or any such director officer or controlling person may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or the alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in

This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability that such Underwriter may otherwise have.  The Company acknowledges that the statements set forth in the last paragraph of text on the cover page of the Most Recent Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus and in the third paragraph, the third sentence of the fifth paragraph, the fourth sentence of the fifth paragraph, the sixth paragraph, the seventh paragraph and the eighth paragraph of text under the caption "Underwriting" in the Most Recent Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the several Underwriters for inclusion in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus and any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto.
 
(c)
                                 
Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 7 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against an indemnifying party under this Section 7, notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof; , that the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have under Section 7(a) or Section 7(b) except to the extent that it has been materially prejudiced (including through the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses) by such failure; , , that the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to an indemnified party otherwise than under Section 7(a) or Section 7(b).  In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it may wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, without the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its assumption of the defense thereof, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section 7 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation.  Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties that are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party.  It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in respect of the legal expenses of any indemnified party in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any
provided
provided
further
local counsel) for all such indemnified parties.  Such firm shall be designated in writing by the Representative, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 7(a), and by the Company, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 7(b).  An indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of a claim or action effected without its written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.
 
(d)
                                
If the indemnification provided for in this Section 7 is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any loss, claim, damage, liability or action described in Section 7(a) or Section 7(b), then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in Section 7(a) or Section 7(b) on the following basis: (i) if such loss, claim, damage, liability or action arises under Section 7(a), then (A) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Securities or (B) if the allocation provided by clause (A) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (A) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities as well as any other relevant equitable considerations; and (ii) if such loss, claim, damage, liability or action arises under Section 7(b), then in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriter on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  For purposes of clause (i) above, the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters.  For purposes of clause (i) and clause (ii) above, the relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission.  The Company and each of the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7(d) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 7(d).  The amount paid by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in the first sentence of this Section 7(d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim that is the subject of this Section 7(d).  Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7(d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.  No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.  The Underwriters' obligations in this Section 7(d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.

Default of Underwriters; Termination by Underwriters
.  If any Underwriter or Underwriters default in their obligations to purchase Securities pursuant to this Agreement and the principal amount of Securities that such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase is 10% or less of the principal amount of Securities that the Underwriters are obligated to purchase, the Representative (or, if there is no Representative, the Underwriters) may make arrangements satisfactory to the Company for the purchase of such Securities by other persons, including any of the Underwriters, but if no such arrangements are made by the Closing Date the non-defaulting Underwriters shall be obligated severally, in proportion to their respective commitments hereunder, to purchase the Securities that such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase.  If any Underwriter or Underwriters so default and the aggregate principal amount of Securities with respect to which such default or defaults occur is more than the above-described amount and arrangements satisfactory to the remaining Underwriters and the Company for the purchase of such Securities by other persons are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement will terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except as provided in Section 9.  In any such case, either the Representative or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date, but in no event for longer than seven days, in order that the required changes, if any, in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected.  Nothing herein will relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
 
If this Agreement shall be terminated by the Underwriters because of any failure or refusal on the part of the Company to comply with the terms or to fulfill any of the conditions of this Agreement, or if for any reason the Company shall be unable to perform its obligations under this Agreement, the Company shall not be liable to any Underwriter or to any member of any selling group for the loss of anticipated profits from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.  However, in such an event, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters for all out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of their counsel) reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in connection with this Agreement and the offering contemplated hereunder; , , that if the Securities are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company solely as a result of the failure to satisfy the condition set forth in Section 6(c), the Company shall have no liability to the Underwriters except as provided in Section 4(j) and Section 7.

If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8, or if for any reason a purchase pursuant to this Agreement is not consummated, the Company shall remain responsible for the expenses to be paid or reimbursed by it pursuant to Section 4, and the respective obligations of the Company and the Underwriters pursuant to Section 7 shall remain in effect.

Exhibit 4.1
 
This THIRTEENTH SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURE, dated as of January 13, 2012, is between Arizona Public Service Company, a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of the State of Arizona (herein called the "Company"), having its principal office at 400 North Fifth Street, Phoenix, Arizona 85004, and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., successor to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (formerly known as The Chase Manhattan Bank), a national banking association, as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee") under the Indenture dated as of January 15, 1998 between the Company and the Trustee (the "Indenture").
 
The Company has executed and delivered the Indenture to the Trustee to provide for the issuance from time to time of its unsecured debentures, notes or other evidences of indebtedness (the "Securities"), said Securities to be issued in one or more series as provided in the Indenture.
 
Section 901(7) of the Indenture provides that, without the consent of any Holders, the Company and the Trustee may enter into one or more indentures supplemental to the Indenture for the purpose of establishing the form or terms of Securities of any series.
 
Pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, the Company desires to provide for the establishment of a new series of its Securities to be known as its 4.50% Notes due 2042 (herein called the "Notes"), the forms and substance of such Notes and the terms, provisions, and conditions thereof to be set forth as provided in the Indenture and this Thirteenth Supplemental Indenture.
 
All things necessary to make this Thirteenth Supplemental Indenture a valid agreement of the Company, and to make the Notes described herein, when executed by the Company and authenticated and delivered by the Trustee, the valid obligations of the Company, have been done.
 
NOW, THEREFORE, THIS THIRTEENTH SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURE WITNESSETH:
 
For and in consideration of the premises and the purchase of the Notes by the Holders thereof, and for the purpose of setting forth, as provided in the Indenture, the form and substance of each of the Notes and the terms, provisions, and conditions thereof, it is mutually agreed, for the equal and proportionate benefit of all Holders of the Notes, as applicable, as follows:
 
SECTION 101.
                   
Authentication and Delivery
.  There shall be and is hereby authorized a series of Securities designated the "4.50% Notes due 2042" initially limited in aggregate principal amount to $325,000,000, which amount shall be as set forth in any Company Order for the authentication and delivery of Notes.  The Notes shall mature and the principal shall be due and payable together with all accrued and unpaid interest thereon on April 1, 2042, and the Notes shall be issued in the form of registered Securities without coupons.
The foregoing principal amount of the Notes may be increased from time to time as permitted by Section 301 of the Indenture.  All Notes need not be issued at the same time and such series may be reopened at any time, without notice to, or the consent of, the then existing Holders, for issuance of additional Notes.  Any such additional Notes will be equal in rank and have the same respective maturity, payment terms, redemption features, and other terms as the Notes initially issued, except for the issue date, public offering price, payment of interest accruing prior to the issue date, and first payment of interest following the issue date of the additional Notes.
 
SECTION 102.
                   
Global Security
.  The Notes shall be issued in certificated form, except that the Notes shall be issued initially as a Global Security to and registered in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee of The Depository Trust Company, as Depositary therefor.  Any Notes to be issued or transferred to, or to be held by, Cede & Co. (or any successor thereof) for such purpose shall bear the depositary legend in substantially the form set forth at the top of the form of Note in Section 301 hereof (in lieu of that set forth in Section 204 of the Indenture), unless otherwise agreed by the Company, such agreement to be confirmed in writing to the Trustee.  Each such Global Security may be exchanged in whole or in part for Notes registered, and any transfer of such Global Security in whole or in part may be registered, in the name(s) of Persons other than such Depositary or a nominee thereof only under the circumstances set forth in clause (2) of the last paragraph of Section 305 of the Indenture, or such other circumstances in addition to or in lieu of those set forth in clause (2) of the last paragraph of Section 305 of the Indenture as to which the Company shall agree, such agreement to be confirmed in writing to the Trustee.  Upon the occurrence of any such event, the Notes will be issued in such names as the Depositary shall instruct the Trustee.
 
SECTION 103.
                   
Place of Payment and Place for Registration of Transfers and Exchange
. Principal of, and premium, if any, and interest on, the Notes will be payable, the transfer of Notes will be registrable and the Notes will be exchangeable for Notes bearing identical terms and provisions, at the office or agency of the Company in the Borough of Manhattan, The City and State of New York; , , that payment of interest may be made at the option of the Company by wire transfer to any Holder or by deposit to the account of the Holder of any such Notes if such account is maintained with the Trustee, in each case according to the written instructions given by such Holder on or prior to the applicable record date to the Trustee, which written instructions shall remain in effect until revised by such Holder by an instrument in writing delivered to the Trustee.
provided
however
 
SECTION 104.
                   
Payment of Interest
.  The Notes will bear interest at the rate of 4.50% per annum from January 13, 2012 or from the most recent Interest Payment Date (as hereinafter defined) to which interest has been paid or duly provided for until the principal thereof is paid or made available for payment, payable on April 1 and October 1 of each year (each, an "Interest Payment Date"), commencing on October 1, 2012, to the person in whose name such Note or any Predecessor Security is registered, at the close of business on March 15 and September 15, as the case may be, whether or not a Business Day, immediately preceding the Interest Payment Date. Any such interest installment not punctually paid or duly provided for shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Holders on such Regular Record Date, and may be paid to the Person in whose name such Note (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date to be fixed by the Trustee for the payment of such
Defaulted Interest, notice whereof shall be given to the Holders of the Notes not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date, or may be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Notes may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully described in the Indenture.
 
The amount of interest payable for any period will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.  Interest will accrue from January 13, 2012 or from the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for to, but not including, the relevant payment date.  In the event that any date on which interest is payable on the Notes is not a Business Day, then payment of interest payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day which is a Business Day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay), in each case with the same force and effect as if made on such date.  A "Business Day" shall mean any day except a Saturday, a Sunday or a legal holiday in The City of New York on which banking institutions are authorized or required by law, regulation or executive order to close.
 
SECTION 105.
                   
Redemption of the Notes
.  The Company may redeem all or any portion of the Notes, at its option, at any time or from time to time, upon notice as provided in the Indenture.  The Redemption Price for any of the Notes to be redeemed on any Redemption Date prior to October 1, 2041 will be equal to the greater of the following amounts:
 
(a)
                                 
100% of the principal amount of the Notes being redeemed on the Redemption Date; or
 
(b)
                                
the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Notes being redeemed on that Redemption Date (not including any portion of any payments of interest accrued to the Redemption Date) discounted to the Redemption Date on a semiannual basis at the Adjusted Treasury Rate plus 25 basis points as determined by a Reference Treasury Dealer appointed by the Company for such purpose;
 
plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the Redemption Date.  The Redemption Price for any of the Notes to be redeemed on any Redemption Date on or after October 1, 2041 will be equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes being redeemed on the Redemption Date plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the Redemption Date.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, installments of interest on the Notes that are due and payable on Interest Payment Dates falling on or prior to a Redemption Date will be payable on the Interest Payment Date to the Holders as of the close of business on the relevant record date in accordance with the terms of such Notes and the Indenture.  The Redemption Price will be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months.
 
For purposes of this Section 105, the following terms shall have the following meanings:
 
"" means, with respect to any applicable Redemption Date, the rate per annum equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such Redemption Date.
Adjusted Treasury Rate
"" means the U.S. Treasury security selected by a Reference Treasury Dealer appointed by the Company for such purpose as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Notes to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of such Notes.
Comparable Treasury Issue
 
"" means, with respect to any applicable Redemption Date, (A) if the Company obtains three or more Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such Redemption Date, after excluding the highest and lowest of such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, (B) if the Company obtains two such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of such quotations, or (C) if only one Reference Treasury Dealer Quotation is received, such quotation.
Comparable Treasury Price

Exhibit 5.1
 
Arizona Public Service Company 400 North 5th Street Phoenix, Arizona 85004
 
Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
I have supervised lawyers who have acted as in-house counsel for Arizona Public Service Company, an Arizona corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the Company's (a)  proposed offering of an indeterminate amount of debt securities, as contemplated by the registration statement on Form S-3 No.  333-158779-01 filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, on April 24, 2009 (the "Registration Statement"); and (b)  issuance and sale of $325,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 4.50% Notes due 2042 (the "Notes") pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, dated January 10, 2012 (the "Underwriting Agreement"), among the Company and the underwriters named therein, and the Indenture, dated as of January 15, 1998, as amended and supplemented to the date hereof and as further amended and supplemented by the Thirteenth Supplemental Indenture thereto, in substantially the form filed by the Company as Exhibit 4.1 to its Form 8-K Report, dated January 12, 2012 (the "Indenture").
 
I, or lawyers under my supervision, have reviewed the definitive prospectus, dated April 24, 2009, and the prospectus supplement, dated January 10, 2012 (the prospectus and prospectus supplement, and all material incorporated therein by reference being hereinafter referred to collectively as the "Prospectus"), relating to the Notes.  I, or lawyers under my supervision, have also reviewed the originals, or copies certified to my satisfaction, of such other documents and records and made such other investigation as I have deemed necessary or appropriate to render the opinions set forth below.  I have also relied upon certificates of public officials and relevant public records.
 
In my review, or the review by lawyers under my supervision, of the Indenture, any supplement thereto and the Notes and in rendering the opinions herein, I have assumed, without investigation: (i) the genuineness of the signatures not witnessed, the authenticity of documents submitted as originals, and the conformity to originals of documents submitted as copies; (ii) the legal competency and capacity of all natural persons executing such documents or otherwise involved in the issuance and sale of the Notes; (iii) that such documents accurately and completely describe and contain the parties' mutual intent, understanding, and business purposes,
 
 
and that there are no oral or written statements, agreements, understandings or negotiations, nor any usage of trade or course of prior dealing among the parties that directly or indirectly modify, define, amend, supplement or vary, or purport to modify, define, amend, supplement or vary, any of the terms of such documents or any of the parties' rights or obligations thereunder, by waiver or otherwise; (iv) that each entity who has executed or is executing any of such documents (other than the Company) had the power to enter into and perform its obligations under such documents, and that such documents have been duly authorized, executed or authenticated, and delivered by, and are valid, binding upon, and enforceable against, such entities, in accordance with their respective terms; (v) that no party will receive any interest, charges, fees, or other benefits or compensation in the nature of interest in connection with the transactions other than those that the Company has agreed in writing in such documents to pay; and (vi) that no fraud has occurred in connection with such transactions.
 
Based on the foregoing, and subject to the assumptions, qualifications and limitations expressed herein, it is my opinion that upon the issuance and delivery of the Notes in accordance with the Underwriting Agreement and the Indenture, and receipt by the Company of the consideration set forth in the Prospectus, the Notes will be validly issued and will constitute legal, valid, and binding obligations of the Company, except as the same may be limited by and subject to: (a) bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance and transfer, receivership, conservatorship, reorganization, arrangement, moratorium, or other similar laws relating to or affecting the rights of creditors generally; (b) general principles of equity (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law); and (c) concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing and the discretion of the court before which any matter may be brought.
 
The opinions expressed herein are based upon the law and facts in effect on the date hereof, and I assume no obligation to update, revise or supplement this opinion, regardless of whether changes in such facts or laws come to my attention after the deliver hereof.
 
Consent is hereby given to the use of this opinion as part of the Registration Statement, and to the use of my name wherever it appears in the Registration Statement and the related Prospectus.  In giving such consent, I do not thereby concede that I am included in the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended or the rules and regulations of the Commission promulgated thereunder.
