Item 8.01.  Other Events.
 
On April 18, 2012, the Arizona Corporation Commission ("ACC") voted to allow Arizona Public Service Company ("APS") to move forward with its purchase of Southern California Edison's ("SCE") interest in Units 4 and 5 of the Four Corners Power Plant near Farmington, New Mexico. The ACC reserved the right to review the prudence of the transaction for cost recovery purposes in a future proceeding if the purchase closes. The ACC also authorized an accounting deferral of certain costs associated with the purchase until any such cost recovery proceeding concludes.
 
The California Public Utilities Commission approved the purchase transaction in March 2012.  The purchase remains subject to several additional closing conditions, including negotiation and execution of a new coal supply contract on terms reasonably acceptable to APS, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approval and the expiration of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976.  APS cannot predict whether all of the conditions necessary to consummate the purchase of SCE's interest will be met such that the closing can occur.
 
Additional information regarding the proposed transaction is contained in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations" in the Pinnacle West Capital Corporation/APS Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, each registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
