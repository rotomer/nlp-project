NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
BACKGROUND
         The unaudited pro forma combined financial statements have been prepared to give effect to the merger of Pepco and Conectiv resulting in both becoming wholly owned subsidiaries of Pepco Holdings, Inc. The transaction will be accounted for as an acquisition of Conectiv by Pepco under the purchase method of accounting. The unaudited pro forma financial information is derived from the December 31, 2001 historical financial statements of Pepco and Conectiv. The Conectiv historical financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the presentation in Pepco's financial statements. Additionally, Conectiv's historical balance sheet includes pro forma adjustments to reflect the ACE power plant sale. The accompanying unaudited pro forma balance sheet assumes that the acquisition was consummated on December 31, 2001 and the statement of income assumes that the acquisition was consummated on January 1, 2001.          This unaudited pro forma combined financial information should be read in conjunction with the separate historical financial statements for Pepco and Conectiv, and their notes thereto.
The unaudited pro forma combined financial statements are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations or financial position that would have been achieved had the transaction reflected therein been consummated as of the date indicated, or of the results of operations or financial position for any future periods or dates. PRO FORMA ADJUSTMENTS
(a)    The purpose of this adjustment is to record the total consideration of $2,196 paid by Pepco Holdings,          Inc. for Conectiv and to set up the "Investment in Conectiv" account. The consideration consists of          50% cash and 50% in Pepco Holdings, Inc. stock.
(b)    The purpose of this adjustment is to eliminate Conectiv's historical equity accounts in consolidation. (c)     The purpose of this adjustment is to calculate and record the Goodwill generated from the           acquisition of Conectiv (amounts in millions).
(d)     The purpose of this adjustment is to reflect the change in the $1 par value of Pepco's common stock           to a $.01 par value.
(e)     The purpose of this adjustment is to eliminate the cost of Pepco's common stock held in treasury. (f)     The purpose of this adjustment is to reflect Pepco Holdings, Inc. borrowings of $700 million. These           funds will be used to partially fund the acquisition of Conectiv. (g)     The purpose of this adjustment is to record pro forma depreciation on the excess of the fair value of           Conectiv's PP&E vs. its book value using an estimated depreciation rate of 3% ($217 x .03 = $6.5. The           pro forma tax benefit of this entry, using a 40% tax rate, is $2.6 million. (h)                       
Determination of the number of Pepco Holdings, Inc. shares to be
issued to existing Conectiv shareholders
