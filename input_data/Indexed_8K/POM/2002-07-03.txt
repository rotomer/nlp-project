BACKGROUND
         The unaudited pro forma combined financial statements have been prepared to give effect to the merger of Pepco and Conectiv resulting in both becoming wholly owned subsidiaries of Pepco Holdings, Inc. The transaction will be accounted for as an acquisition of Conectiv by Pepco under the purchase method of accounting. The unaudited pro forma financial information is derived from the December 31, 2001 historical financial statements of Pepco and Conectiv. The Conectiv historical financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the presentation in Pepco's financial statements. Additionally, Conectiv's historical balance sheet includes pro forma adjustments to reflect the ACE power plant sale. The accompanying unaudited pro forma balance sheet assumes that the acquisition was consummated on December 31, 2001 and the statement of income assumes that the acquisition was consummated on January 1, 2001.          This unaudited pro forma combined financial information should be read in conjunction with the separate historical financial statements for Pepco and Conectiv, and their notes thereto.
The unaudited pro forma combined financial statements are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations or financial position that would have been achieved had the transaction reflected therein been consummated as of the date indicated, or of the results of operations or financial position for any future periods or dates.
