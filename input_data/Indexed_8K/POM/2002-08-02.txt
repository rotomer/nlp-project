ARTICLE I                                                                           Name The name of the corporation is Pepco Holdings, Inc. (the "Corporation").

The name of the Corporation's registered agent at that address is The Corporation Trust Company.                                                                    ARTICLE III                                                                       Purpose The purposes of the Corporation are to hold the voting securities of other companies and to engage in any other lawful business or activity for which corporations may be incorporated under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. The Corporation shall have all the powers and privileges that are lawful for a corporation to have and exercise under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.                                                                          ARTICLE IV                                                            Authorized Number of Shares A. . The total number of shares of stock which the Corporation shall have the authority to issue is 440,000,000 shares, of which 400,000,000 shares shall be common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Common Stock"), and 40,000,000 shares shall be preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Preferred Stock"). B. . The Board of Directors is authorized by resolution to provide from time to time for the issuance of shares of Common Stock. The voting powers and other powers, preferences and rights of the Common Stock, and the qualifications and restrictions thereon, shall be as follows:             (1) . Subject to any rights of holders of Preferred Stock, the Board of Directors              may declare and pay dividends on the Common Stock (payable in cash, stock or other             property) from time to time from any lawfully available funds, property or shares and in             such amount and subject to such conditions as may be determined by the Board of             Directors.              (2) . Subject to any rights of holders of Preferred Stock to vote on a matter             as a class or series, each outstanding share of Common Stock shall be entitled to one vote             on each matter submitted to a vote of holders of Common Stock at a meeting of             stockholders. Cumulative voting for the election of directors of the Corporation shall not             be permitted.              (3) . In the event of any liquidation, dissolution             or winding up of the Corporation, after payment (or making provision for payment) of the             debts and liabilities of the Corporation and payment of the full preferential amounts to             which the holders of any series of Preferred Stock are entitled, unless otherwise provided             by the terms of any series of Preferred Stock, the holders of Common Stock shall be             entitled to receive the net balance of any remaining assets of the Corporation. C. . The Board of Directors is authorized by resolution to provide from time to time for the issuance of shares of Preferred Stock in series and to fix, from time to time before issuance, the number of shares of each series, the designation, preferences, privileges, voting powers and other rights of the shares of each series of Preferred Stock and the restrictions or qualifications thereof. The authority of the Board of Directors with respect to each series shall include, but shall not be limited to, the following:             (1) the serial designation, authorized number of shares and the stated value;             (2) the dividend rate, if any, the date or dates or conditions upon which the dividends             will be payable, the relative priority the dividends on such shares shall bear to dividends             or other distributions payable on the shares of any other class or series of stock of the             Corporation and the extent to which the dividends may be cumulative;             (3) whether the shares of such series shall be subject to redemption, the price or prices at             which shares may be redeemed and any terms, conditions and limitations upon any             redemption;             (4) the rights of the holders of shares of such series in the event of dissolution,             liquidation or winding up of the Corporation;             (5) any sinking fund provisions for redemption or purchase of shares of any series;             (6) the terms and conditions, if any, on which shares may be converted into, or             exchanged for, shares of other capital stock, or of other series of Preferred Stock, of             the Corporation;             (7) the voting rights, if any, for the shares of each series in addition to the voting rights             provided by law; and

            (8) any other preference, relative, participating, optional or other special rights and the             qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, as shall not be inconsistent with law,             this Article IV or any resolution of the Board of Directors pursuant hereto. D. . The holders of Common Stock or Preferred Stock shall not have a preemptive right to acquire authorized but unissued shares or securities convertible into shares or carrying a right to subscribe to or acquire shares, except under such terms and conditions as may be provided by the Board of Directors in its sole judgment.                                                                     ARTICLE V                                                                        Directors A. . The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by, or under the direction of, a Board of Directors, which shall exercise all the powers of the Corporation except as are by law or by the Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws of the Corporation conferred upon or reserved to the stockholders of the Corporation. B. . The number of directors of the Corporation shall be specified in the Bylaws. The number of directors shall not be less than six (6) nor more than fifteen (15). The number of directors may be increased or decreased from time to time as provided in the Bylaws so long as no decrease shall have the effect of shortening the term of any incumbent director. C. .             (1) The Board of Directors shall be divided into three classes: Class I, Class II and Class             III. Each class (a "Class") shall consist, as nearly as possible, of one-third of the number             of directors constituting the entire Board. The initial Class I directors shall be elected to             hold office for a term to expire at the 2003 annual meeting of the stockholders; the initial             Class II directors shall be elected to hold office for a term to expire at the 2004 annual             meeting of the stockholders; and the initial Class III directors shall be elected to hold             office for a term to expire at the 2005 annual meeting of the stockholders; and in the case             of each Class, until their successors are duly elected and qualified, subject, however, to             death, resignation, retirement, such age and service limitations as may be set forth in the             Bylaws, disqualification and removal from office. At each succeeding annual meeting of             stockholders beginning in 2003, successors to the Class of directors whose terms expire             at that annual meeting shall be elected for a three-year term.             (2) If the number of directors is changed, any increase or decrease in directors shall be             apportioned among the Classes so as to maintain all Classes as equal in number as             possible, and any additional director elected to any Class shall hold office for a term             which shall coincide with the terms of the other directors in such Class (subject to the             provisions of applicable law), but in no case will a decrease in the number of directors             shorten the term of any incumbent director. D. .             (1) Any vacancy on the Board of Directors that results other than by reason of an increase             in the authorized number of directors elected by all of the stockholders having the right to             vote as a single class may be filled by a majority of the directors then in office, although             less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director.             (2) Any vacancy on the Board of Directors that results from an increase in the authorized             number of directors elected by all of the stockholders having the right to vote as a single             class may be filled by a majority of the entire Board of Directors.             (3) The term of any director elected by the Board of Directors to fill a vacancy not             resulting from an increase in the number of directors shall expire at the next stockholders'             meeting at which directors are elected, and the remainder of such term, if any, shall be             filled by a director elected at such meeting. E. . Directors of the Corporation may be removed only for cause and only upon the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors (considered for this purpose as one class) cast at a meeting of the stockholders called for that purpose. F. . The Board of Directors of the Corporation shall have the power to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the Bylaws of the Corporation. Article II of the Bylaws (Directors) may be amended, altered or repealed by action of the stockholders only upon the affirmative vote of the holders of two-thirds of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors (considered for this purpose as one class) cast at a meeting of the shareholders called for that purpose. G. . Any provision within this Article V, Directors, may be amended or repealed by the stockholders of the Corporation only upon the affirmative vote of the holders of two-thirds of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors (considered for this purpose as one class) cast at a meeting of the stockholders called for that purpose.                                                                    ARTICLE VI                     Limitation on Director Liability A person who is or was a director of the Corporation shall not be personally liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except for liability (1) for any breach of the director's duty of loyalty to the Corporation or its stockholders, (2) for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (3) under Section 174 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware or (4) for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit. If the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware is amended to authorize corporate action further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of directors, then the liability of the directors of the Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as so amended. The elimination and limitation of liability provided herein shall continue after a director has ceased to occupy such position as to acts or omissions occurring during such director's term or terms of office, and no amendment, repeal or modification of this Article VI shall apply to or have any effect on the liability or alleged liability of any director of the Corporation for or with respect to any acts or omissions of such director occurring prior to such amendment, repeal or modification.                                                                                ARTICLE VII                                                                     Stockholders Subject to the rights of the holders of any class or series of Preferred Stock, any action required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders of the Corporation must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Corporation and may not be effected by any consent in writing by such stockholders. Subject to the rights of the holders of any class or series of Preferred Stock, special meetings of stockholders of the Corporation may be called only by the Board of Directors pursuant to a resolution approved by a majority of the entire Board of Directors.

Right to Indemnification
(1) With respect to an officer, director or employee of the Corporation, the Corporation             shall indemnify, and with respect to any other individual the Corporation may indemnify,             any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened,             pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative             or investigative (hereafter, a "proceeding"), by reason of the fact that he or she, or the             person of whom he or she is the legal representative, is, or was, a director, officer,             employee or agent of the Corporation or is or was serving at the request of the             Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership,             joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit             plans, whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action or inaction in an official             capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or while serving at             the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another             corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with             respect to employee benefit plans, to the fullest extent authorized by the General             Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as the same exists or may hereafter be             amended (but in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment             permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than said law permitted             the Corporation to provide prior to such amendment), against all expenses, liability and             loss (including attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and             amounts paid or to be paid in settlement)reasonably incurred or suffered by such person             in connection therewith, and any such indemnification shall continue as to a person who             has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of his             or her heirs, executors and administrators; provided, however, that, except as provided in             this Article VI, Section B, the Corporation shall not be required to indemnify any such             person seeking indemnification in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated             by such person unless initiation of such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized in             advance by the Board of Directors. Any indemnification under this Article VI, Section B             (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the             specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the director, officer, employee             or agent is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standards             of conduct set forth in the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. Such a             determination shall be made: (a) by a majority vote of directors who are not parties to             such action, suit or proceeding, even though less than a quorum; (b) by a committee of             such directors designated by a majority vote of such directors, even though less than a             quorum; (c) if there are no such directors or if such directors so direct, by independent             legal counsel (compensated by the Corporation) in a written opinion; (d) by the             stockholders; or (e) in any other manner permitted by the General Corporation Law of the             State of Delaware. The right to indemnification conferred in this Article VI, Section B,             shall be a contract right and shall include the right to be paid by the Corporation the             expenses incurred in defending any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition;             provided, however, that, if the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware             requires, the payment of such expenses incurred by a director, officer, employee or agent             in his or her capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation (and not             in any other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such person while a director,             officer, employee or agent, including, without limitation, service to an employee benefit             plan) in advance of the final disposition of a proceeding shall be made only upon delivery             to the Corporation of an undertaking, by or on behalf of such director, officer, employee             or agent, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined that such             director, officer, employee or agent is not entitled to be indemnified under this Section B             or otherwise.
            (2) If a claim under paragraph (1) of this Section B is not paid in full by the Corporation             within 30 days after a written claim has been received by the Corporation, the claimant             may at any time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid             amount of the claim, and, if successful in whole or in part, the claimant shall be entitled             to be paid also the expense of prosecuting such claim. It shall be a defense to any such             action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred in defending             any proceeding in advance of its final disposition where the required undertaking, if any             is required, has been tendered to the Corporation) that the claimant has not met the             standard of conduct which makes it permissible under the General Corporation Law of             the State of Delaware for the Corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount             claimed, but the burden of proving such defense shall be on the Corporation. Neither the             failure of the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, a committee thereof,             independent legal counsel or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the             commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the             circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in             the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, nor an actual determination by the             Corporation (including its Board of Directors, a committee thereof, independent legal             counsel or its stockholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of             conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the claimant has not             met the applicable standard of conduct. In any suit brought by the claimant to enforce a             right to indemnification or to an advancement of expenses hereunder, or brought by the             Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an             undertaking, the burden of proving that the claimant is not entitled to be indemnified, or             to such advancement of expenses, under this Article VI or otherwise shall be on the             Corporation.
            (3) The rights to indemnification and the payment of expenses incurred in defending a             proceeding in advance of its final disposition conferred in this Article VI, Section B, shall             not be exclusive of any other right which any person may have or hereafter acquire under             any statute, provision of the Certificate of Incorporation, bylaw, agreement, vote of             stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise.
            (4) The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any             director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or of another corporation,             partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against any such expense, liability or             loss, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person             against such expense, liability or loss under the General Corporation Law of the State of             Delaware.
            (5) The Corporation may enter into an indemnity agreement with any director, officer,             employee or agent of the Corporation, or of another corporation, partnership, joint             venture, trust or other enterprise, upon terms and conditions that the Board of Directors             deems appropriate, as long as the provisions of the agreement are not impermissible             under applicable law.
            (6) Any amendment or repeal of this Article VI, Section B, shall not be retroactive in             effect.
            (7) In case any provision in this Article VI, Section B, shall be determined at any time to             be unenforceable in any respect, the other provisions shall not in any way be affected or             impaired thereby, and the affected provision shall be given the fullest possible             enforcement in the circumstances, it being the intention of the Corporation to afford             indemnification and advancement of expenses to the persons indemnified hereby to the             fullest extent permitted by law.

Section 2. Notice             Notice of any meeting of stockholders shall be given in writing or by electronic transmission in accordance with applicable law to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at such meeting at the address of the stockholder as it appears on the records of the Corporation, except as otherwise provided by applicable law. Such notice shall state the time and place of the meeting and the means of remote communication, if any, by which stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such meeting, and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called. Notices of special meetings and of annual meetings shall be given not less than ten days nor more than 60 days before the meeting. Any previously scheduled annual or special meeting of stockholders may be postponed by action of the Board of Directors taken prior to the time previously scheduled for the meeting. Section 3.

At any continuation of the adjourned meeting at which a quorum is present, any business may be transacted which may have been transacted at the meeting originally scheduled. If such adjournment is for more than 30 days or, if after the adjournment, a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting in accordance with these Bylaws. Section 4. Order of Business             4.1  The Chairman of the Board of Directors, or in the absence of the Chairman, the President, or in their absence, a Director designated by the Board of Directors, shall call meetings of the stockholders to order and shall act as chairman of the meeting. The Secretary, or in the absence of the Secretary, an Assistant Secretary, shall act as secretary of the meeting of the stockholders, but in the absence of the Secretary and Assistant Secretary at a meeting of the stockholders the chairman of the meeting may appoint any person to act as secretary of the meeting.             4.2  The chairman of the meeting shall have the right to determine the order of business at the meeting, to prescribe the rules and procedures for the conduct of the meeting and to do all things necessary or desirable for the proper conduct of the meeting, including maintenance of order and safety and limitations on the time allotted to questions or comments on the affairs of the Corporation.             4.3  The only business that may be conducted at an annual meeting of stockholders is that business which has been brought before the meeting: (i) by or at the direction of the chairman of the meeting; (ii) pursuant to the notice of the meeting; or (iii) by any stockholder who is a holder of record as of the record date of the meeting who is entitled to vote at the meeting and who complies with the procedures set forth in Section 4.4. The business conducted at a special meeting of stockholders shall be confined to the purpose or purposes stated in the notice of such meeting.             4.4  In addition to any other applicable requirements, for business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder, the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of the Corporation. To be timely, a stockholder's notice must be received at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not less than 100 days, nor more than 120 days, prior to the first anniversary of the immediately preceding annual meeting of the stockholders (for purposes of the annual meeting of the stockholders in 2003, the first anniversary of the immediately preceding annual meeting of the stockholders shall be deemed to be April 25, 2003); provided, however, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is more than 30 days before or after such anniversary date, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so received not later than the close of business on the tenth day following the earlier of the date on which notice or public announcement of the date of the meeting was first given or made by the Corporation. A stockholder's notice to the Secretary shall set forth (i) a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the annual meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the annual meeting, (ii) the name and record address of the stockholder proposing such business, (iii) the class, series and number of shares of the Corporation that are owned beneficially and of record by the stockholder and (iv) any material interest of the stockholder in such business. Notwithstanding anything in these Bylaws to the contrary, no business shall be conducted at the annual meeting except in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Article I, Section 4.4; provided, however, that nothing in this Article I, Section 4.4 shall be deemed to preclude discussion by any stockholder of any business properly brought before the annual meeting in accordance with such procedures. The chairman of an annual meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine that business was not properly brought before the meeting in accordance with the provisions of this Article I, Section 4.4, and, if he should so determine, he shall so declare to the meeting, and any such business not properly brought before the meeting shall not be transacted. Section 5. Voting             5.1  At meetings of stockholders, except as otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, every stockholder shall be entitled to one vote for each share of stock outstanding in the name of the stockholder on the books of the Corporation on the date on which stockholders entitled to vote are determined. Each stockholder may be represented and vote by a proxy or proxies authorized by any valid means permitted by applicable law. If two or more persons are authorized to act as proxies, a majority of the proxies present at the meeting may exercise all of the powers conferred by such authorization unless such authorization provides otherwise. No proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from its date unless the proxy provides for a longer period. If any proxy is authorized for a specific meeting, such proxy shall not be voted at any meeting or continuation of an adjourned meeting other than that for which the proxy is authorized.             5.2  In all matters acted upon by stockholders, voting shall be (i) by written ballot or (ii) by any other process that the Board of Directors may authorize, each to the extent permitted by applicable law.             5.3  Except as otherwise required by applicable law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, the presence, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the aggregate voting power of the stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereat shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at each meeting of stockholders. If authorized by the Board of Directors (and subject to such guidelines and procedures as the Board of Directors may adopt), stockholders and proxyholders not physically present at a meeting of stockholders may participate in a meeting of stockholders and shall be deemed present in person and may vote at a meeting of stockholders by means of remote communication in accordance with applicable law. If such majority shall not be present at a meeting of stockholders, a majority in interest of the stockholders present shall have the power to adjourn the meeting.             5.4  Except as otherwise required by applicable law or the Certificate of Incorporation, (i) Directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast at a meeting of stockholders at which a quorum is present by the stockholders present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote in the election and (ii) whenever any corporate action other than the election of Directors is to be taken by the stockholders it shall be authorized by a majority of the votes cast at a meeting of stockholders at which a quorum is present by the stockholders present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote thereon.                                                                     ARTICLE II                                                                        Directors Section 1.

Such nominations, other than those made by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or by a nominating committee or person appointed by the Board of Directors, shall be made pursuant to timely notice in writing to the Secretary of the Corporation. To be timely, a stockholder's notice must be received at the principal executive offices of the Corporation (i) in the case of an annual meeting, not less than 100 days, nor more than 120 days, prior to the first anniversary of the immediately preceding annual meeting of the stockholders (for purposes of the annual meeting of the stockholders in 2003, the first anniversary of the immediately preceding annual meeting of the stockholders shall be deemed to be April 25, 2003); provided, however, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is more than 30 days before or after such anniversary date, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so received not later than the close of business on the tenth day following the earlier of the date on which notice or public announcement of the date of the meeting was first given or made by the Corporation, and (ii) in the case of a special meeting of the stockholders called for the purpose of electing Directors not later than the close of business on the tenth day following the earlier of the date on which notice or public announcement of the date of the meeting was first given or made by the Corporation.

The Corporation may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information as may reasonably be required by the Corporation to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as a Director of the Corporation. No person shall be eligible for election as a Director of the Corporation unless nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth herein. The chairman of the meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine that a nomination was not made in accordance with the foregoing procedure, and, if he should so determine, he shall so declare to the meeting, and the defective nomination shall be disregarded.             1.3  The Board of Directors, as soon as is reasonably practicable after the initial election of Directors by the stockholders in each year, shall elect one of its number Chairman of the Board of Directors, who may be, but is not required to be, an officer or employee of the Corporation.

The Board of Directors may, in its discretion, require the owner of the lost, destroyed or stolen certificate to give to the Corporation satisfactory evidence that the certificate was lost, destroyed or stolen.
