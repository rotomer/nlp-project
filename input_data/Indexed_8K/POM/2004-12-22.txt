Item 2.01  Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets
On December 21, 2004, Pepco Holdings, Inc. ("PHI"), through its wholly owned subsidiary, Pepco Communications, L.L.C. ("Pepcom"), completed the sale of Pepcom's 50% membership interest in Starpower Communications, LLC ("Starpower").  Pepcom sold its Starpower membership interest for $29 million in cash to RCN Telecom Services of Washington, D.C., Inc. ("RCN"), a wholly owned subsidiary of RCN Corporation that owns the other 50% interest in Starpower.  Starpower provides cable and telecommunication services to households in the Washington, D.C. area.   RCN Corporation is a publicly held telecommunications company with headquarters in New Jersey.
As previously reported, RCN elected to purchase Pepcom's Starpower membership interest under a "right of first refusal" provision in the Starpower operating agreement between RCN and Pepcom and, as a result of RCN's election, Pepcom will pay a $1 million "break-up" fee to the third party with which Pepcom entered into a Starpower membership interest purchase agreement in July 2004.  
Pepcom and RCN formed Starpower as a joint venture in 1997, and each owned a 50% membership interest in Starpower from that time until the completion of this transaction.  With the completion of this transaction, neither Pepcom nor any other affiliate of PHI has any ownership interest in or management responsibility with respect to Starpower.
