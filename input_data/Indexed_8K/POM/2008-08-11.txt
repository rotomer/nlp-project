Pepco Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: POM) today reported second quarter 2008 consolidated earnings of $15.0 million, or 7 cents per share, compared to $57.2 million, or 30 cents per share, in the second quarter of 2007.  Excluding special items (as described below), earnings for the second quarter 2008 would have been $107.9 million, or 53 cents per share.  There were no special items in the second quarter of 2007.  The weighted average number of basic shares outstanding for the second quarter of 2008 was 201.1 million compared to 193.0 million for the second quarter of 2007.
 
The earnings increase for the second quarter of 2008, excluding special items, as compared to the 2007 quarter was driven by improved performance across the companys operating businesses.  Higher Power Delivery earnings resulted from the impact of the distribution base rate orders issued in Maryland in June 2007 and in the District of Columbia in January 2008, the impact of higher transmission rates, and favorable income tax adjustments, partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expenses.  Conectiv Energy realized higher earnings primarily due to higher spark spreads, higher capacity prices, and a mark-to-market gain related to economic coal hedges.  Higher Pepco Energy Services earnings were due to a mark-to-market gain related to certain economic hedges of PJM congestion risk, higher generation output, and more favorable congestion costs.
 
Our operating businesses performed well across the board in the second quarter reflecting continued progress in the execution of our strategy, said Dennis R. Wraase, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.  Power Delivery is seeing the positive impacts of our distribution rate cases and infrastructure investments.  Conectiv Energy had another strong quarter as our generating assets capitalized on higher spark spreads and capacity prices.  At Pepco Energy Services, we saw 9% electric sales growth reflecting our continued expansion into new markets.  For the remainder of 2008, we will remain focused on executing our business plan and building on our strong year-to-date results.  He added, During the second quarter we took a non-cash charge related to changes in our assessment of our tax position associated with our cross-border energy lease investments.  While a charge was taken to comply with the accounting rules, we continue to believe that the tax treatment we applied to these investments was appropriate based on applicable statutes, regulations and case law and we intend to continue to defend vigorously this position.

For the six months ended June 30, 2008, consolidated earnings were $114.2 million, or 57 cents per share, compared to $108.8 million, or 56 cents per share, for the same period in the prior year.  Excluding special items (as described below), earnings for the six months ended June 30, 2008, would have been $207.1 million, or $1.03 per share.  There were no special items in the six months ended June 30, 2007.  The weighted average number of basic shares outstanding for the six months ended June 30, 2008 was 200.9 million compared to 192.6 million for the same period in the prior year.
 
The increase in earnings for the six months ended June 30, 2008, excluding special items, compared to earnings for the same period in the prior year was driven by higher Power Delivery earnings from the impact of the distribution base rate orders in Maryland and the District of Columbia, the impact of higher transmission rates, and favorable income tax adjustments, partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expenses and lower weather related kWh sales.  Conectiv Energy realized higher earnings primarily due to opportunities resulting from its generating units operating flexibility and dual-fuel capability and its firm natural gas transportation and storage positions, coupled with increasing fuel prices and volatility.  Higher capacity prices and mark-to-market gains related to economic fuel and power hedges also contributed to the increase in earnings.  Higher Pepco Energy Services earnings were due to more favorable congestion costs, a mark-to-market gain related to certain economic hedges of PJM congestion risk, and increased generation output.

The tax payment that would be required based on the assumption changes is approximately $107.4 million plus $10.0 million of after-tax interest.  PHI has not made such tax payment to date.  Whether PHI makes a payment of this amount, or any amount, will depend on a number of factors including the companys litigation strategy.
