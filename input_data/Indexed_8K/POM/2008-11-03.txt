Item 2.02                      Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
 
On November 3, 2008, Pepco Holdings, Inc. issued a news release announcing its third quarter 2008 operating results.
 
 
Item 9.01                    Financial Statements and Exhibits.

Pepco Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: POM) today reported third quarter 2008 consolidated earnings of $118.8 million, or 59 cents per share, compared to $167.6 million, or 87 cents per share, in the third quarter of 2007.  There were no special items in the third quarter of 2008.  Excluding special items (as described below), earnings for the third quarter of 2007 would have been $129.9 million, or 68 cents per share.  The weighted average number of basic shares outstanding for the third quarter of 2008 was 201.5 million compared to 193.3 million for the third quarter of 2007.
 
The earnings decrease for the third quarter of 2008 as compared to the 2007 quarter, excluding special items, was driven by lower Power Delivery earnings due to lower kWh sales and higher operation and maintenance expenses, partially offset by the impact of the distribution base rate order issued in the District of Columbia in January 2008 and favorable income tax adjustments.  Lower Pepco Energy Services earnings were due to mark-to-market losses related to economic hedges of PJM congestion risk and power, as well as lower generation output.  Conectiv Energy realized higher earnings primarily due to gains from fuel hedges, higher capacity prices, higher energy marketing margins, and a mark-to-market gain related to economic coal hedges.  Partially offsetting factors at Conectiv Energy were lower spark spreads, lower generation output, lower emission credit sales, and lower load as a result of mild weather.
 
During the third quarter, our results were adversely affected by lower sales in our Power Delivery business caused by both milder weather and lower non-weather related customer usage said Dennis R. Wraase, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.  While we experienced customer growth of about 0.6 percent in our service territory, weather adjusted kWh sales decreased by two percent.  The Bill Stabilization Adjustment mechanism we have in place in Maryland provided some insulation from changes in electricity usage.  I am pleased that during the quarter Delaware also approved a revenue decoupling rate structure to be implemented at the time of Delmarva Powers next base rate case.  We expect the recessionary pressures on the economy to continue to impact demand and customer growth.  He added, During this period of unprecedented volatility in the credit and capital markets, a major focus for our industry has become the access to adequate capital resources and liquidity.  At the end of the quarter, Pepco Holdings and its subsidiaries had $787 million of cash and credit capacity to meet our liquidity requirements.  As we move forward with executing our business plan, we will adjust our construction expenditures to align with lower demand growth.  We recognize that flexibility around spending plans is prudent in this uncertain environment.

For the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2008, consolidated earnings were $233.0 million, or $1.16 per share, compared to $276.4 million, or $1.43 per share, for the same period in the prior year.  Excluding special items (as described below), earnings for the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2008, would have been $325.9 million, or $1.62 per share, compared to $238.7 million, or $1.24 per share, for the first nine months of 2007.  The weighted average number of basic shares outstanding for the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2008 was 201.1 million compared to 192.8 million for the same period in the prior year.
 
The increase in earnings for the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2008, compared to earnings for the same period in the prior year, excluding special items, was driven by higher Power Delivery earnings from the impact of the distribution base rate orders in Maryland and the District of Columbia, the impact of higher transmission rates, and favorable income tax adjustments, partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expenses and lower weather related kWh sales.  Conectiv Energy realized higher earnings primarily due to opportunities resulting from its generating units operating flexibility and dual-fuel capability and its firm natural gas transportation and storage positions, coupled with increasing fuel prices and volatility.  Higher capacity prices and mark-to-market gains related to economic fuel and power hedges also contributed to the increase in earnings.  The increase in Pepco Energy Services earnings was primarily due to more favorable congestion costs.

The portion of these funds that Pepco ultimately retains will depend on the customer sharing arrangements with respect to the funds approved by the Maryland Public Service Commission and the District of Columbia Public Service Commission.
