Indemnification of Company, Directors and Officers
 
           (c)           .  Each indemnified party shall give notice as promptly as reasonably practicable to each indemnifying party of any action commenced against it in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure to so notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve such indemnifying party from any liability hereunder to the extent it is not materially prejudiced as a result thereof and in any event shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement.  In the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 6(a), counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by the Representatives, and, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 6(b), counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by the Company.

compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification could be sought under this Section 6 or contribution could be sought under Section 7 hereof (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
 
           SECTION 7.     
Contribution.
 
If the indemnification provided for in Section 6 hereof is for any reason unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount of such losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by such indemnified party, (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
 
The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth on the cover of the Prospectus bear to the aggregate initial public offering price of the Securities as set forth on such cover.
 
The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by any Underwriters and the parties relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
 
The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 7.  The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by an indemnified party and referred to above in this Section 7 shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
 
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
 
 
19
 
No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
 
For purposes of this Section 7, each person, if any, who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company.  The Underwriters respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several (and not joint) in proportion to the number of Initial Securities set forth opposite their respective names in Schedule A hereto.
 
           SECTION 8.      .
Representations, Warranties and Agreements to Survive
 
All of the respective representations, warranties and agreements of the Company and the Underwriters contained in this Agreement, or in certificates of officers of the Company delivered pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or controlling person of any Underwriter, or by or on behalf of the Company, or any director, officer or controlling person of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.
 
           SECTION 9.      .
Termination of Agreement
 
           (a)           .  The Representatives may terminate this Agreement, by notice to the Company, at any time at or prior to the Closing Time, or at any time after the Closing Time and at or prior to any Date of Delivery, (i) if there has been (A) since the date of the latest audited balance sheet included in the Disclosure Package and except as disclosed therein or (B) since the Applicable Time, any Material Adverse Change, or (ii) if there has occurred any material adverse change in the financial markets in the United States or in the international financial markets, any outbreak of hostilities or escalation thereof or other calamity or crisis or any change or development involving a prospective change in national or international political, financial or economic conditions, in each case the effect of which is such as to make it, in the judgment of the Representatives, impracticable or inadvisable to offer, sell or deliver the Securities or to enforce contracts for the sale of the Securities, or (iii) if trading in any securities of the Company has been suspended or materially limited by the Commission or the New York Stock Exchange, or if trading generally on the New York Stock Exchange or the NYSE Alternext U.S. or in the NASDAQ Global Market or the NASDAQ Global Select Market has been suspended or materially limited, or minimum or maximum prices for trading have been fixed, or maximum ranges for prices have been required, by either of such exchanges or Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. with respect to such markets or by order of the Commission or any other governmental authority, or (iv) a material disruption has occurred in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States, or (v) if a banking moratorium has been declared by either Federal or New York authorities.
Termination; General
 
(b)           .  If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to this Section, such termination shall be without liability of any party to any other party except as provided in Section 4 hereof; and provided, further, that Sections 1, 6, 7 and 8 shall survive such termination and remain in full force and effect.

If, however, the non-defaulting Underwriters shall not have completed such arrangements within such 24 hour period, then:
Defaulted Securities
 
(i)           if the number of Defaulted Securities does not exceed 10% of the aggregate number of Securities to be purchased hereunder, each of the non-defaulting Underwriters shall be obligated, severally and not jointly, to purchase the full amount thereof in the proportions that their respective underwriting obligations hereunder bear to the underwriting obligations of all non defaulting Underwriters, or
 
(ii)           if the number of Defaulted Securities exceeds 10% of the aggregate number of Securities to be purchased hereunder, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except as provided in Section 4 and except that Sections 1, 6, 7 and 8 shall survive any such termination and remain in full force and effect with respect to any non-defaulting Underwriter.
 
No action taken pursuant to this Section shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of its default.
 
In the event of any such default which does not result in a termination of this Agreement, either the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Time or the relevant Date of Delivery for a period not exceeding seven days (but, in the case of a Date of Delivery, not beyond the 30 day after the date of this Agreement) in order to effect any required changes in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements.

As Representatives of the Several Underwriters
 
Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
I am Senior Vice President and General Counsel of Pepco Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the Company), and have acted as counsel to the Company in connection with the issuance and sale by the Company of 14,000,000 shares (the Securities) of its common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the Common Stock), pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, dated November 5, 2008 (the Purchase Agreement), among the Company and the Underwriters (as defined in the Purchase Agreement).  This opinion is being delivered to you in accordance with Section 5(a)(ii) of the Purchase Agreement.  Unless otherwise defined herein, capitalized terms used herein have the respective meanings provided in the Purchase Agreement.
 
In connection with rendering the opinions set forth herein, I, or my representatives, have reviewed:
 
(i)           the Purchase Agreement;
 
(ii)           the Registration Statement on Form S-3, Registration No. 333-145691, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the Commission) on August 24, 2007 (the Registration Statement), registering, , the Securities for sale under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the 1933 Act);
inter alia
 
(iii)           the preliminary prospectus, consisting of the prospectus, dated August 24, 2007 (the Base Prospectus), as supplemented by a preliminary prospectus supplement, dated November 5, 2008, with respect to the offer and sale of the Securities, filed with the Commission on November 5, 2008, pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the 1933 Act (the Pricing Prospectus);
 
 
 
 
(iv)           the issuer free writing prospectus, dated November 5, 2008, filed with the Commission on November 5, 2008, pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the 1933 Act (the FWP);
 
(v)           the information with respect to the price per share to be paid by the Underwriters for the Initial Securities and the Option Securities pursuant to the Purchase Agreement (such information, together with the FWP and the Pricing Prospectus, the Disclosure Package);
 
(vi)           the final prospectus, consisting of the Base Prospectus, as supplemented by a final prospectus supplement, dated November 5, 2008, with respect to the offer and sale of the Securities, filed with the Commission on November 6, 2008, pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the 1933 Act (the Prospectus); and
 
(vii)           a copy of Certificate of Stock No. [  ] representing the Securities.
 
I, or my representatives, also have examined or caused to be examined originals, or copies that have been certified or otherwise identified to my or their satisfaction as being true copies, of such other instruments, certificates and other documents or records as I or they have deemed necessary or appropriate to enable me to render the opinions set forth below.  In my or my representatives review and examination, I or they have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted to me or them as originals, and the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to me or them as copies.
 
Based upon the foregoing, and subject to the reservations and exceptions set forth herein, I am of the opinion that:
 
1.           The Company has been duly incorporated and is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware.
 
2.           The Company is duly qualified as a foreign corporation to transact business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which such qualification is required, whether by reason of the ownership or leasing of property or the conduct of business, except where the failure so to qualify or to be in good standing would not result in a Material Adverse Effect.
 
3.           Each Designated Subsidiary has been duly incorporated and is an existing corporation in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation, with corporate power and authority to own its properties and conduct its business as described in the Prospectus; and each Designated Subsidiary is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation in good standing in all other jurisdictions in which its ownership or lease of property or the conduct of its business requires such qualification, except where the failure so to qualify or to be in good standing would not result in a Material Adverse Effect; all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of each Designated Subsidiary has been duly authorized and validly issued and is fully paid and nonassessable; the capital stock of each Designated Subsidiary owned by the Company, directly or through subsidiaries, is owned free from any liens or encumbrances; and, to the best of my knowledge, the capital stock of each other subsidiary owned by the Company, directly or through subsidiaries, is owned free from any liens or encumbrances.
 
 
 
 
4.           All of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable; and none of the outstanding shares of Common Stock was issued in violation of the preemptive or other similar rights of any securityholder of the Company.
 
5.           The Company has corporate power and authority to own or lease and operate its properties and to conduct its business as described in the Prospectus and to enter into and perform its obligations under the Purchase Agreement.
 
6.           The Companys entry into and performance of its obligations under the Purchase Agreement and its issuance and sale of the Securities has been approved by requisite corporate action.
 
7.           The execution, delivery and performance of the Purchase Agreement by the Company, and the issuance and sale of the Securities by the Company, will not result in a breach or violation of any of the terms and provisions of, or constitute a default or Repayment Event under, or result in the creation or imposition of any lien, charge or encumbrance upon any property or assets of the Company under, (i) any statute, any rule, regulation or order of any governmental agency or body or any court having jurisdiction over the Company or any subsidiary of the Company or any of their properties that in my experience customarily applies to transactions of the type contemplated by the Purchase Agreement and the Securities, (ii) any agreement or instrument to which the Company or any such subsidiary is a party or by which the Company or any such subsidiary is bound or to which any of the properties of the Company or any such subsidiary is subject, or (iii) the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company or any such subsidiary, except, in the cases of clauses (i) and (ii) above, for any such breach, violation, default, Repayment Event or lien, charge or encumbrance upon any property or assets of the Company, that would not result in a Material Adverse Effect.
 
8.           No consent, approval, authorization or order of, or filing with, any governmental agency or body or any court is required for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement in connection with the offering, issuance, sale or delivery of the Securities by the Company, except such as have already been obtained or such as may be required under state securities laws, and the Company has complied, in all material respects, with all terms and conditions contained in all such consents, approvals, authorizations and orders as have been obtained.
 
9.           The Securities have been duly authorized by the Company and, when issued and delivered by the Company pursuant to the Purchase Agreement against payment of the consideration set forth in the Purchase Agreement, will be validly issued and fully paid and nonassessable, and no holder of the Securities is or will be subject to personal liability in respect of liabilities of the Company solely by reason of being a holder of Securities.
 
10.           The issuance of the Securities is not subject to the preemptive rights of any securityholder of the Company.
 
11.           The Registration Statement is effective under the 1933 Act, and, to the best of my knowledge, no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement
 
 
 
 
has been issued under Section 8(d) of the 1933 Act and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted by the Commission or are pending or threatened by the Commission.  The FWP has been filed in the manner and within the time period required by Rule 433(d) under the 1933 Act, and the Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus have been filed in the manner and within the time period required by Rule 424(b) under the 1933 Act.
 
12.           The documents incorporated by reference in the Prospectus (other than the financial statements, including the notes thereto, the financial schedules and the other financial data included or incorporated by reference therein and with respect to the Statement of Eligibility on Form T-1 filed as Exhibit 25.01 to the Registration Statement, as to which I express no opinion), when they were filed with the Commission, complied as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the 1934 Act and the 1934 Act Regulations.
 
13.           The form of certificate used to evidence the Securities complies in all material respects with all applicable statutory requirements, with any applicable requirements of the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company and with the requirements of the New York Stock Exchange.
 
14.           Except as disclosed in the Prospectus, there is not pending or, to the best of my knowledge, threatened, action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation, to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party, or to which the property of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is subject, before or brought by any court or governmental agency or body, domestic or foreign, which could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, or which could reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect the consummation of the transactions contemplated in the Purchase Agreement or the performance by the Company of its obligations thereunder.
 
I am not passing upon and do not assume responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus and make no representations that I have independently verified the accuracy, completeness or fairness of such statements, except insofar as such statements refer specifically to me.  However, based on my or my representatives examination of the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, on my general familiarity with the affairs of the Company and on my or my representatives participation in conferences with officials and other representatives of, and other counsel for, the Company, with PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the independent accountants of the Company, and with your representatives and your counsel, I do not believe that (a) the Registration Statement, on the date of the effectiveness of the Registration Statement as provided in Rule 430B(f)(2) under the 1933 Act, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, (b) the Disclosure Package, as of the Applicable Time, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or (c) the Prospectus, as of its date contained, or as of the date hereof contains, an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.  The foregoing statement is subject to the qualification that that I am not expressing opinion or belief on the financial
 
 
 
 
statements, including the notes thereto, the financial schedules and the other financial data included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus or with respect to the Statement of Eligibility on Form T-1 filed as Exhibit 25.01 to the Registration Statement.
 
I am a member of the Bar of the District of Columbia, and I express no opinion herein as to any laws other than the laws of the District of Columbia, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, the federal laws of the United States and, with respect to the opinions set forth in paragraph 3, the Virginia Stock Corporation Act, the Maryland General Corporation Law and the New Jersey Business Corporation Act.
 
The opinions contained herein are rendered solely for your benefit and may not be relied on by any other person, except that I hereby authorize Dewey & LeBoeuf LLP, in connection with rendering its opinion to you on the date hereof relating to the offer and sale of the Securities, to rely on this opinion with respect to matters governed by the laws of the District of Columbia, the State of Delaware (except such matters that relate expressly to the Company, are governed by the Delaware General Corporation Law and are expressly addressed therein), the Virginia Stock Corporation Act, the Maryland General Corporation Law and the New Jersey Business Corporation Act. The opinions expressed in this letter are limited to the matters set forth herein, and no opinion should be inferred beyond those opinions expressly stated.  I assume no obligation to advise you of any facts that come to my attention, or any changes in law, subsequent to the date hereof.
 
 
    Very truly yours,

We have reviewed:
 
(i)           the Purchase Agreement;
 
(ii)           the Registration Statement on Form S-3, Registration No. 333-145691, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the Commission) on August 24, 2007 (the Registration Statement), registering, , the Securities for sale under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the 1933 Act);
inter alia
 
(iii)           the preliminary prospectus, consisting of the prospectus, dated August 24, 2007 (the Base Prospectus), as supplemented by a preliminary prospectus supplement, dated
 
 
 
 
November 5, 2008, with respect to the offer and sale of the Securities, filed with the Commission on November 5, 2008, pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the 1933 Act (the Pricing Prospectus);
 
(iv)           the issuer free writing prospectus, dated November 5, 2008, filed with the Commission on November 5, 2008, pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the 1933 Act (the FWP);
 
(v)           the information with respect to the price per share to be paid by the Underwriters for the Initial Securities and the Option Securities pursuant to the Purchase Agreement (such information, together with the FWP and the Pricing Prospectus, the Disclosure Package);
 
(vi)           the final prospectus, consisting of the Base Prospectus, as supplemented by a final prospectus supplement, dated November 5, 2008, with respect to the offer and sale of the Securities, filed with the Commission on November 6, 2008, pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the 1933 Act (the Prospectus); and
 
(vii)           a copy of Certificate of Stock No. [  ] representing the Securities.
 
We also have reviewed such corporate records, certificates and other documents, and such questions of law, as we have deemed necessary or appropriate for the purposes of rendering this opinion.
 
We have assumed that all signatures are genuine, that all documents submitted to us as originals are authentic and that all copies of documents submitted to us conform to the originals.  We have assumed further that (i) the Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, (ii) the Company has all legal right, power and authority and has obtained all authorizations and approvals of governmental authorities necessary (A) to issue and sell the Securities and (B) to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under the Purchase Agreement, and (iii) the Securities will constitute valid securities within the meaning of Section 8-110(a)(1) of the Delaware Uniform Commercial Code.
 
We have made no investigation for the purpose of verifying the assumptions set forth herein.
 
We have relied as to certain matters on information obtained from public officials, officers of the Company and other sources believed by us to be responsible, and on information regarding the Company contained in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus.
 
As used in this opinion, all references to the Registration Statement, the Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus include all material incorporated by reference therein, to the extent not modified or superseded by statements and other information in the Registration Statement, Pricing Prospectus or Prospectus or in later filed material so incorporated.  In addition, the qualification in paragraph 3 of this letter to the best of our knowledge means the actual knowledge, but not constructive or imputed knowledge, of the attorneys in our firm who have given substantive attention to the transaction that is the subject of this opinion, without any representation or implication that any inquiry has been made with respect to such statements.
 
 
 
 
Based upon the foregoing, and subject to the qualifications set forth below, we are of the opinion that:
 
1.           The Purchase Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company.
 
2.           The Securities have been duly authorized by the Company and, when issued and delivered by the Company pursuant to the Purchase Agreement against payment of the consideration set forth in the Purchase Agreement, will be validly issued and fully paid and nonassessable, and no holder of the Securities is or will be subject to personal liability in respect of liabilities of the Company solely by reason of being a holder of Securities.
 
3.           The Registration Statement is effective under the 1933 Act and, to the best of our knowledge, no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued under the 1933 Act and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or are pending or threatened by the Commission.  The FWP has been filed in the manner and within the time period required by Rule 433(d) under the 1933 Act, and the Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus have each been filed in the manner and within the time period required by Rule 424(b) under the 1933 Act.
 
4.           The Registration Statement, on the date of the effectiveness of the Registration Statement as provided in Rule 430B(f)(2) under the 1933 Act, and the Prospectus, as of the date thereof (excluding the documents incorporated in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus by reference and other than the financial statements, including the notes thereto, the financial schedules and the other financial and statistical data included therein and with respect to the Statement of Eligibility on Form T-1 filed as Exhibit 25.01 to the Registration Statement, as to which we express no opinion), complied as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the 1933 Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder.
 
5.           The information in the Prospectus under Description of Common Stock, and in the Registration Statement under Item 15, to the extent that it constitutes matters of law, summaries of the Companys certificate of incorporation and bylaws or legal conclusions, has been reviewed by us and is accurate in all material respects.
 
6.           The Company is not, and upon the issuance and sale of the Securities as contemplated by the Prospectus and the application of the net proceeds therefrom as described in the Prospectus, will not be, an investment company or an entity controlled by an investment company, as such terms are defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
 
In addition, as special counsel to the Company, we reviewed the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus and participated in discussions with your representatives and those of the Company, your counsel and the Companys accountants.  On the basis of the information which was reviewed by us in the course of the performance of the services referred to above, considered in the light of our understanding of the applicable law and the experience we have gained through our practice under the Federal securities laws, we confirm to you that nothing came to our attention in the course of such review which has caused us to believe that (a) the Registration Statement, on the date of the effectiveness of the
 
 
 
 
Registration Statement as provided in Rule 430B(f)(2) under the 1933 Act, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, (b) the Disclosure Package, as of the Applicable Time (as specified in the Purchase Agreement), contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or (c) the Prospectus, as of its date, contained, or as of the date hereof contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
 
The limitations inherent in the independent verification of factual matters and the character of determinations involved in the registration process are such, however, that we do not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, except as specified in paragraph 5 above.  Also, we do not express any opinion or belief as to the financial statements, including the notes thereto, the financial schedules and the other financial and statistical data included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus or with respect to the Statement of Eligibility on Form T-1 filed as Exhibit 25.01 to the Registration Statement.
 
We are members of the bar of the District of Columbia and the State of New York.  We do not express any opinion herein on any laws other than the laws of the State of New York, the Delaware General Corporation Law and, to the extent expressly referred to herein, the Federal laws of the United States.
 
This letter is solely for your benefit and may not be disclosed to or relied upon by any other person without our written consent.
 
 
Very truly yours,
