Pepco Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: POM) today reported second quarter 2009 consolidated earnings of $25 million, or 11 cents per share, compared to $15 million, or 7 cents per share, in the second quarter of 2008.  There were no special items in the second quarter of 2009.  Excluding special items (as described below under the heading Special Items) for the second quarter 2008, earnings would have been $108 million, or 53 cents per share.  The weighted average number of basic shares outstanding for the second quarter of 2009 was 220 million compared to 201 million for the second quarter of 2008.
 
The earnings decrease for the second quarter of 2009, as compared to the 2008 quarter, excluding special items, was driven by lower Power Delivery and Conectiv Energy earnings.  The lower Power Delivery earnings were due to lower distribution sales caused by mild weather and lower non-weather related customer usage, as well as lower Atlantic City Electric basic generation service revenue relating to unbilled revenue.  The decline in Power Delivery earnings also resulted from the recognition of lower benefits from income tax adjustments, higher operation and maintenance expense primarily due to increased pension expense, and higher interest expense primarily due to the debt financing completed late last year.  The lower Conectiv Energy earnings were primarily due to significantly lower generation output and reduced spark spreads and dark spreads.
 
During the quarter, the demand for power was dampened significantly by recessionary pressures and mild weather, and the energy markets continued to be challenging, said Joseph M. Rigby, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer.  Weather-adjusted regulated kilowatt hour sales were down over four percent and generation output was down 44 percent.  Rigby also noted that despite managing controllable costs, Power Delivery operation and maintenance expense was pressured by higher pension costs.
 
Rigby also cited progress during the second quarter on several key value creation initiatives that position the company for longer-term growth.  We filed two of the four distribution rate cases we expect to file this year, and the District of Columbia passed legislation approving advanced metering infrastructure, further advancing our Blueprint for the Future project.  Also, today we filed applications with the Department of Energy seeking  $266 million in smart grid related stimulus funds.  On the transmission front, the PJM Interconnection confirmed the need for our Mid-Atlantic Power Pathway transmission line, and we expect to begin construction later this year.

For the six months ended June 30, 2009, consolidated earnings were $70 million, or 32 cents per share, compared to $114 million, or 57 cents per share, for the same period in the prior year.  Excluding special items (as described below under the heading Special Items), earnings for the six months ended June 30, 2009, would have been $62 million, or 28 cents per share, compared to $207 million, or $1.03 per share, for the first six months of 2008.  The weighted average number of basic shares outstanding for the six months ended June 30, 2009 was 220 million compared to 201 million for the same period in the prior year.
 
The decrease in earnings for the six months ended June 30, 2009, compared to earnings for the same period in the prior year, excluding special items, was driven by lower Power Delivery and Conectiv Energy earnings.  The lower Power Delivery earnings were due to the recognition of lower benefits from income tax adjustments, higher operation and maintenance expense primarily due to increased pension expense, and higher interest expense primarily due to the debt financing completed late last year.  The decline in Power Delivery earnings also resulted from lower distribution sales caused by lower non-weather related customer usage, and lower Atlantic City Electric basic generation service revenue relating to unbilled revenue.  The lower Conectiv Energy earnings were due to significantly lower generation output, reduced spark spreads and dark spreads, fewer opportunities to benefit from generating unit operating flexibility and dual-fuel capability, and fewer remarketing activities around firm natural gas transportation and storage positions, due to less favorable energy prices and less price volatility than were experienced during the first quarter of 2008.  The performance of economic fuel hedges was also a factor.
