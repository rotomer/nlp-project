Pepco Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: POM) today reported third quarter 2009 consolidated earnings of $124 million, or 56 cents per share, compared to $119 million, or 59 cents per share, in the third quarter of 2008.  Excluding special items (as described below), earnings for the third quarter of 2009 would have been $97 million, or 44 cents per share.  There were no special items in the third quarter of 2008.  The weighted average number of basic shares outstanding for the third quarter of 2009 was 221 million compared to 202 million for the third quarter of 2008.
 
The earnings decrease for the third quarter of 2009, as compared to the 2008 quarter, excluding special items, was driven by lower Power Delivery and Conectiv Energy earnings.  The lower Power Delivery earnings were due to higher operation and maintenance expense primarily as the result of increased pension expense and higher interest expense driven by the debt financing completed late last year.  The lower Conectiv Energy earnings were primarily due to lower generation output, reduced spark spreads and dark spreads, and the performance of economic fuel hedges.  Partially offsetting these decreases were higher earnings at Pepco Energy Services driven by favorable electric supply costs and lower losses on energy derivative contracts.
 
During the quarter, the energy markets continued to be challenging, said Joseph M. Rigby, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer.  Generation output was down 16 percent and energy margins were down 57 percent.  Rigby also noted that excluding the increase in pension expense, Power Delivery operation and maintenance expense would have been relatively flat, demonstrating the continued focus on managing controllable costs.
 
Rigby also cited progress during the third quarter on several key value creation initiatives that the company believes will position it for growth over the longer-term.  We filed two additional distribution rate cases, bringing the total number of cases underway to four, and the District of Columbia Public Service Commission adopted the revenue decoupling mechanism proposed by Pepco.  With the implementation of this mechanism in the District of Columbia on Nov. 1, approximately 60 percent of our distribution revenue will be decoupled from electric sales, providing for more predictable utility revenues and aligning the interests of our utilities with those of our customers in terms of energy efficiency programs.  I am also very pleased with the recently announced DOE federal stimulus funds award of $168 million, allowing us to accelerate the delivery of Smart Grid benefits to our customers.
 
 
 
 
For the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2009, consolidated earnings were $194 million, or 88 cents per share, compared to $233 million, or $1.16 per share, for the same period in the prior year.  Excluding special items (as described below), earnings for the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2009, would have been $159 million, or 72 cents per share, compared to $326 million, or $1.62 per share, for the first nine months of 2008.  The weighted average number of basic shares outstanding for the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2009 was 220 million compared to 201 million for the same period in the prior year.The decrease in earnings for the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2009, compared to earnings for the same period in the prior year, excluding special items, was driven by essentially the same factors that drove the quarterly results.
