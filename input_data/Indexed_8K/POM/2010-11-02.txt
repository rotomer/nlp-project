Pepco Holdings, Inc.
Form 8-K
See Item 2.03 below.
On October 27, 2010, Pepco Holdings, Inc. (the Company) entered into two bilateral credit agreements, one for an aggregate principal amount of revolving loans of up to $125 million with The Bank of Nova Scotia (the Scotia credit agreement), and the other for an aggregate principal amount of revolving loans of up to $75 million with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (the JPM credit agreement, and together with the Scotia credit agreement, the credit agreements).  Neither credit agreement provides for the issuance of letters of credit.  All indebtedness incurred under the credit agreements is unsecured, and the expiration date of each credit agreement is October 26, 2011. The Scotia credit agreement and the JPM credit agreeme nt are filed herewith as Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2, respectively.
The credit agreements replace a $400 million credit facility which expired on October 15, 2010, and a $50 million bilateral credit agreement that will expire in November 2010 (the expired facilities).  This net reduction of $250 million in the Companys available credit facilities reflects progress in winding down the retail energy supply business and disposing of the Conectiv Energy segment.  As a result of these activities, the level of liquidity and collateral needed to support these businesses has decreased.
The terms of credit agreements are identical and are substantially the same terms and conditions as the expired facilities.  The interest rate payable by the Company on funds borrowed under each credit agreement is, at its election, based on either (a) the corresponding Eurodollar rate plus a margin of 2.0%, or (b) the highest of (i) the prevailing prime rate, (ii) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.5% or (iii) the one-month Eurodollar rate plus 1.0%, plus a margin of 1.0%.
The Company intends to use the proceeds of loans drawn under the credit agreements for general corporate purposes.  In order to obtain loans under the respective credit agreement, certain representations and warranties made by the Company at the time such credit agreement was entered into also must be true at the time that such credit agreement is utilized, and the Company must be in compliance with specified covenants, including (i) the requirement that the Company maintain a ratio of total indebtedness to total capitalization of 65% or less, computed in accordance with the terms of the respective credit agreement, which calculation excludes from the definition of total indebtedness certain trust preferred securities and deferrable interest subordinated debt (not to exceed 15% of total capitalization), (ii) a restriction on sales or other dispositions of assets, other than certain permitted sales and dispositions, and (iii) a restriction on the incurrence of liens on the assets of the Company or any of its significant subsidiaries other than permitted liens.  The absence of a material adverse change in the Companys business, property, and results of operations or financial condition is not a condition to the availability of credit under either credit agreement.  The credit agreements do not include any ratings triggers.
The failure to satisfy any of the covenants or the occurrence of other specified events that constitute an event of default could result in the acceleration of the repayment obligations of the Company under the respective credit agreement.  The events of default in each credit agreement

include (i) the failure of the Company or any of its significant subsidiaries to pay when due certain indebtedness under other borrowing arrangements, or the acceleration of such indebtedness, (ii) certain bankruptcy events, judgments or decrees against the Company or its significant subsidiaries, and (iii) a change in control (as defined in the credit agreements) of the Company or the failure of the Company to own all of the voting stock of its regulated utility subsidiaries (Potomac Electric Power Company, Delmarva Power & Light Company and Atlantic City Electric Company).
Both The Bank of Nova Scotia and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. or their affiliates have provided investment or commercial banking services to the Company and its affiliates, including as an underwriter of their securities, in the past and are likely to do so in the future.  They receive customary fees and commissions for those services.

IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT PROCEDURES FOR OPENING A NEW ACCOUNT. To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify and record information that identifies each person or entity that opens an account, including any deposit account, treasury management account, loan, other extension of credit or other financial services product.  What this means for the Borrower:  When a borrower opens an account, if such borrower is an individual, the Lender will ask for such borrowers name, residential address, tax identification number, date of birth and other information that will allow the Lender to identify such borrower, and, if a borrower is not an individual, the Lender will ask for such borrowers name, tax id entification number, business address and other information that will allow the Lender to identify such borrower.  The Lender may also ask, if a borrower is an individual, to see such borrowers drivers license or other identifying documents, and, if the borrower is not an individual, to see the borrowers legal organizational documents or other identifying documents.
           Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any Loan Document, the interest paid or agreed to be paid under the Loan Documents shall not exceed the maximum rate of non-usurious interest permitted by applicable law (the Maximum Rate).  If the Lender shall receive interest in an amount that exceeds the Maximum Rate, the excess interest shall be applied to the principal of the Loans or, if it exceeds such unpaid principal, refunded to the Borrower.  In determining whether the interest contracted for, charged, or received by the Lender exceeds the Maximum Rate, such Person may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, (a) characterize any payment that is not principal as an expense, fee, or premium rather than interest, (b) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof, and (c) amortize, prorate, allocate, and spread in equal or unequal parts the total amount of interest throughout the contemplated term of the Obligations hereunder.

           To the extent that the Lender exercises its right of setoff, and such payment or the proceeds of such setoff or any part thereof is subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the Lender in its discretion) to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party, in connection with any proceeding under any debtor relief law or otherwise, then to t he extent of such recovery, the obligation or part thereof originally intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as if such payment had not been made or such setoff had not occurred.

IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT PROCEDURES FOR OPENING A NEW ACCOUNT. To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify and record information that identifies each person or entity that opens an account, including any deposit account, treasury management account, loan, other extension of credit or other financial services product.  What this means for the Borrower:  When a borrower opens an account, if such borrower is an individual, the Lender will ask for such borrowers name, residential address, tax identification number, date of birth and other information that will allow the Lender to identify such borrower, and, if a borrower is not an individual, the Lender will ask for such borrowers name, tax id entification number, business address and other information that will allow the Lender to identify such borrower.  The Lender may also ask, if a borrower is an individual, to see such borrowers drivers license or other identifying documents, and, if the borrower is not an individual, to see the borrowers legal organizational documents or other identifying documents.
           Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any Loan Document, the interest paid or agreed to be paid under the Loan Documents shall not exceed the maximum rate of non-usurious interest permitted by applicable law (the Maximum Rate).  If the Lender shall receive interest in an amount that exceeds the Maximum Rate, the excess interest shall be applied to the principal of the Loans or, if it exceeds such unpaid principal, refunded to the Borrower.  In determining whether the interest contracted for, charged, or received by the Lender exceeds the Maximum Rate, such Person may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, (a) characterize any payment that is not principal as an expense, fee, or premium rather than interest, (b) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof, and (c) amortize, prorate, allocate, and spread in equal or unequal parts the total amount of interest throughout the contemplated term of the Obligations hereunder.

           To the extent that the Lender exercises its right of setoff, and such payment or the proceeds of such setoff or any part thereof is subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the Lender in its discretion) to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party, in connection with any proceeding under any debtor relief law or otherwise, then to t he extent of such recovery, the obligation or part thereof originally intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as if such payment had not been made or such setoff had not occurred.
