(e)           On December 20, 2011, Pepco Holdings, Inc. (the "Company") entered into an employment agreement (the Agreement) with Joseph M. Rigby, the Company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer.  The Agreement, which is effective January 1, 2012 (the Effective Date), replaces the employment agreement entered into with Mr. Rigby in 2008 (the "Prior Agreement").  The Companys independent directors, based upon the recommendation of the Companys Compensation/Human Resources Committee (the Committee) and advice from the Committees independent compensation consultant, authorized the execution and delivery of the Agreement with Mr. Rigby.  The Agreement includes provisions intended to further align Mr. Rigbys compensation with improvements in the Companys service reliability and customer satisfaction goals, as well as and initiatives related to succession planning and talent management as established by the Committee and to remove certain provisions identified as problematic pay practices.  The following is a description of the material terms and conditions of the Agreement, which description is qualified by reference to a copy of the Agreement attached as Exhibit 10 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
The Agreement has a term of three years and expires on December 31, 2014.  The Prior Agreement provided for an initial three-year term with annual renewals thereafter unless either party elected to terminate the Prior Agreement.  Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, Mr. Rigby is required to devote his knowledge, skill and best efforts in the performance of his duties to the Company, other than civic and charitable commitments that do not conflict with the Companys business.  To the extent Mr. Rigby elects to serve on the board of any public company, other than the board of directors of the Company (the Board) or one of its subsidiaries, Mr. Rigby is required to obtain the prior consent of the Board.
For his full time service as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, Mr. Rigby will be entitled to an annual salary of $985,000 effective January 1, 2012.  Mr. Rigby is entitled to receive under the Companys incentive compensation plans incentive awards if and to the extent that the Board determines in good faith that his performance merits payment of such awards, and to participate in a manner similar to other senior executives of the Company in its retirement plans, supplemental retirement benefit plans, savings plans, deferred compensation plans, health, welfare and insurance plans and other plans and programs provided by the Company from time to time for its senior executives.  Mr. Rigby is also entitled to receive such perquisites and other personal benefits as are provided by the Company from time to time to its senior executives generally.  The Company also agreed to pay on Mr. Rigbys behalf the costs of any supplemental life or disability insurance coverage generally offered by the Company from time to time to its senior executives.
The Agreement provides a supplement to Mr. Rigbys annual annuity benefit under the Companys Supplemental Retirement Plan (the 2011 SERP) equal to 1.65% of Mr. Rigbys 5-year average base pay and bonus multiplied by years of service as determined under the Companys defined benefit plans.  For all other executives, the 2011 SERP provides for an annual benefit equal to 1.45% of the 5-year average base pay and bonus multiplied by years of service.  The Agreement provides that the Board will conduct an annnual review of Mr. Rigbys total compensation, and may make such changes in such compensation as it deems appropriate in its sole discretion, provided that it may not decrease his salary over the term of the Agreement.
If at any time during the term of the Agreement the Company terminates Mr. Rigbys employment other than for cause (cause is defined as (i) intentional fraud or material misappropriation with respect to the business or assets of the Company, (ii) the persistent refusal or willful failure to perform substantially
 
2 
 
duties and responsibilities to the Company after notice of, and an opportunity to remedy, such failure have been given, or (iii) conduct that constitutes disloyalty to the Company or that materially damages the property, business or reputation of the Company), Mr. Rigby will be entitled to:
 
3 
 
If, at any time during the term of the Agreement, Mr. Rigby terminates his employment under any of the following circumstances (Good Reason), he will receive under his Agreement the same benefits that he would have received had the Company terminated his employment without cause as described above: (i) his base salary is reduced (other than a reduction consistent and proportional with the overall reduction, due to extraordinary business conditions, in the compensation of all other senior executives of the Company), (ii) he is not in good faith considered for incentive awards under the Companys plans in which senior executives are eligible to participate, (iii) the Company fails to provide him with retirement, fringe and supplemental benefits in a manner similar to other senior executives, (iv) the Company relocates Mr. Rigbys place of employment to a location further than 50 miles from Washington, D.C. (other than the Washington, D.C. or Wilmington, Delaware metropolitan areas), or (v) he is removed from the position of Chief Executive Officer (other than due to his disability).
Upon Mr. Rigbys resignation (other than for Good Reason) or upon his death or disability (which shall be deemed to have occurred if he becomes entitled to long-term disability benefits under the Companys disability plan or policy), or in the event of termination of his employment for cause prior to termination of the Agreement, Mr. Rigby will not be entitled to further compensation under the Agreement, except as provided in the Agreement with respect to salary, vacation pay and annual bonus earned but not paid prior to such termination or awards or benefits to which he may be entitled under the Companys benefit plans.
By entering into the Agreement, Mr. Rigby relinquished the right to receive under the Prior Agreement (i) a severance payment in an amount equal to three times his combined salary and bonus, that would have been payable regardless of when during the term of the Prior Agreement Mr. Rigbys employment had terminated, and (ii) a lump sum supplemental retirement benefit payable in cash equal to the present value of such benefit that would have been obtained by adding three additional years of age and three additional years of service, which would have been payable upon termination of Mr. Rigbys employment by the Company without cause or upon Mr. Rigbys resignation for good reason.  In addition, Mr. Rigby relinquished the right to receive a gross-up payment for any excise tax payments he would have incurred had any payments made to him in connection with a termination of his employment been determined to be payments related to a change in control within the meaning of Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code.
Unless prohibited by applicable law,  for a period equal to the longer of one year following termination of employment and the remainder of the term of the Agreement, the Company has also agreed to reimburse Mr. Rigby for the cost of purchasing a health insurance policy comparable to the Company-sponsored healthcare plan in which Mr. Rigby was enrolled immediately prior to termination of employment to the extent the Company is not providing or paying for such coverage.  Furthermore, if Mr. Rigbys employment is terminated without cause, or Mr. Rigby resigns for Good Reason, following a change of control, the Company shall, for a period of 24 months after such termination, unless prohibited by applicable law, either (i) provide him with healthcare, life insurance and disability benefits no less favorable than those benefits as in effect immediately prior to the termination or (ii) reimburse Mr. Rigby for the costs of obtaining such benefits.
The Agreement also contains confidentiality, non-compete and non-solicitation covenants, all of which contain terms that are customary in agreements of this type.  Mr. Rigby has also agreed to be bound by and comply with, to the extent they may be applicable to him, any of the clawback provisions of (i) Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or (ii) policies adopted by the Company in accordance with future rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 10D of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which was enacted as part of the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.

As an inducement for Mr. Rigby to enter into the Agreement and remain in his current position for an additional three-year period, the Agreement provides for contingent retention awards consisting of restricted stock units.    Each restricted stock unit is a contractual right to receive at the time of settlement one share of the Companys common stock (the Common Stock).  The contingent retention awards are comprised of service-based and performance-based awards, as described in greater detail below.
The portion of the total contingent retention awards under the Agreement that is subject to vesting based on continued service with the Company will be made on the Effective Date.  The number of restricted stock units subject to such award will be determined by dividing $1.5 million by the closing price of a share of Common Stock on the last trading day prior to January 1, 2012.  One-third of the restricted stock units will vest on January 1, 2013, and the remaining two-thirds of the restricted stock units will vest ratably, on a day-to-day basis, over the two-year period beginning on January 1, 2013, in each case so long as Mr. Rigby remains employed by the Company.  Except as set forth below, to the extent Mr. Rigbys employment terminates prior to the end of the term of the Agreement, the unvested portion of this restricted stock award will be forfeited.  The unvested portion of this award will be immediately vested in full in the event of the termination of Mr. Rigbys employment due to death or disability, termination of employment by the Company without cause, Mr. Rigbys resignation for Good Reason, or his retirement with the consent of the Board.
The portion of the contingent retention awards under the Agreement that is subject to vesting based on performance and continued employment with the Company will be divided into three separate awards.  The three separate awards will be made as soon as practicable after the Effective Date and each of the first and second anniversaries thereof, respectively (so long as Mr. Rigby continues to be employed by the Company on each such date).  Each separate award shall consist of, such number of restricted stock units equal to $750,000, divided by the closing price of a share of Common Stock on the last trading day prior to January 1, 2012.  The vesting of each separate award, in whole or in part, shall be contingent on the extent to which performance goals to be established for the performance period covered by the award are achieved.  An award shall be forfeited if Mr. Rigbys employment with the Company ends prior to the completion of the performance period, other than in the case of the termination of his employment due to death or disability, termination of such employment by the Company without cause, his resignation for Good Reason, or his retirement with the consent of the Board.  In each such case, the restricted stock units shall vest at the end of the performance period to the extent that the performance goals are achieved.
The Committee has adopted specified performance criteria, which shall serve as the basis for the performance goals to be established for each of the three separate performance-based contingent retention awards, including: (i) reliability of electric service to customers; (ii) residential customer satisfaction; (iii) Smart Grid deployment and customer benefits; (iv) Company reputation within its service territories; and (v) management recruitment and talent development.
Mr. Rigby is required to hold the vested restricted stock units attributable to both the service-based and the performance-based retention awards under the Agreement until his employment with the Company terminates, except that he may elect to surrender vested restricted stock units as permitted by the Agreement to satisfy applicable tax withholding obligations.  All vested restricted stock units will be credited with dividend equivalents in the form of additional fully-vested restricted stock units.  At the time of the termination of his employment, the restricted stock units will be settled by the issuance to Mr. Rigby of a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the number of vested restricted stock units.

4 
 
(iii)
 
With respect to any outstanding restricted stock award or restricted stock unit award under the LTIP, whether made before, on or after the Effective Date (other than the award provided for in Section 5(a), which shall be governed by the terms set forth herein and in the Service-Based Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement) the vesting of which is contingent solely on the continued employment of the Executive for a specified period (a Service Period):
 
(A)
 
If the Service Period ends on or prior to the last day of the Term of this Agreement, the award shall vest in full (to the extent not previously vested) on the date the Executives employment terminates.

Except as otherwise provided in clause (C) below, if the Performance Period ends after the last day of the Term of this Agreement, the award shall be prorated after the end of the Performance Period, with the vested portion of the award being the product of (1) the number of shares that the Executive would have been entitled to receive had he remained employed through the end of the Performance Period, as determined in good faith by the Committee based on the extent to which the performance goals have been achieved, and (2) a fraction (x) the numerator of which is the number of days elapsed from the commencement date of the Performance Period through the termination date and (y) the denominator of which is the number of days in the Performance Period.
 
 
5 
 
(C)
 
If a Covered Termination occurs within one year following a Change of Control, each outstanding Performance Award shall vest on the date the Executives employment terminates and the amount of the award shall be determined on the assumptions that (i) the Executive had remained employed through the end of the Performance Period and (ii) the target level of performance had been achieved.
 
(v)
 
For a period equal to the longer of (i) one year following the termination of the Executives employment and (ii) the remainder of the Term of this Agreement, the Company shall reimburse the Executive for the cost of purchasing a health insurance policy that is comparable to the Company-sponsored healthcare plan in which the Executive was enrolled immediately prior to the termination of his employment to the extent the Company is not otherwise providing or paying for such coverage, including in accordance with paragraph (b) of this Section 6.

(b)
 
If, during the Term of this Agreement, a Covered Termination occurs following a Change of Control, the Company shall, for a period of 24 months following the Covered Termination either, at the discretion of the Company, (A) provide the Executive with healthcare, life insurance and disability benefits no less favorable than those benefits as in effect immediately prior to the Covered Termination or (B) reimburse the Executive for the costs of obtaining such benefits, except that this provision shall not apply to the extent applicable law precludes the Company from providing such benefits to the Executive because the Company is not providing comparable benefits to other employees or former employees.
 
(c)
 
For purposes of this Agreement, the term Change of Control shall have the meaning ascribed to such term in the LTIP (i) in the case of Section 6(a), as of the date of the applicable award is made and (ii) in the case of Section 6(b), as of the date hereof.
 
(d)
 
Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Section 6:
 
(i)
 
 If the Companys independent registered public accounting firm (the Independent Accountant) determines that if the payments and benefits to be provided under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section 6 (and any other payments or benefits provided or to be provided to the Executive under any applicable plan, program, agreement or arrangement maintained, contributed to or entered into by the Company or any group or entity whose actions result in a change of ownership or effective control (as those terms are defined in Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), and the regulations promulgated thereunder) or any affiliate of the Company) (a Payment or collectively Payments) were provided to the Executive (A) the Executive would incur an excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code (such excise tax, together with any interest and penalties, are hereinafter collectively referred to as the Excise Tax), and (B) the net after tax benefits to the Executive attributable to the Payments would not be at least $10,000 greater than the net after tax benefits that would accrue to the Executive if the Payments that would otherwise cause the Executive to be
 
 
6 
 
subject to the Excise Tax were not provided, the Payments shall be reduced so that the Payments provided to the Executive are the greatest (as determined by the Independent Accountant) that may be provided without any such Payment being subject to the Excise Tax.  If the Payments are to be reduced under this paragraph (d), then (1) Payments not subject to Section 409A of the Code shall be reduced in the order designated by the Executive and (2) if and to the extent necessary after the reductions in clause (1), Payments subject to Section 409A shall be reduced in reverse chronological order (such that Payments due later are reduced before Payments due earlier).
(ii)
 
If the Executive receives reduced Payments pursuant to this paragraph (d), or if it had been determined that no such reduction was required, but it nonetheless is established pursuant to the final determination of a court or an Internal Revenue Service proceeding that, notwithstanding the good faith of the Executive and the Company in applying the terms of this paragraph (d), the aggregate Payments to the Executive would result in any Payment being subject to the Excise Tax, and that a reduction pursuant to this paragraph (d) should have occurred, then the Executive shall be deemed for all purposes to have received a loan made on the date of the receipt of the Payments in an amount such that, after taking into consideration such loan, no portion of the aggregate Payments would be subject to the Excise Tax.  The Executive shall have an obligation to repay such loan to the Company on demand, together with interest on such amount at the applicable Federal rate (as defined in Section 1274(d) of the Code) from the date of the Executives receipt of such loan until the date of such repayment.
 
(iii)
 
If the Payments are reduced or are to be reduced pursuant to this paragraph (d), and it is subsequently determined that the Payments were or are to be reduced pursuant to this paragraph (d) to a greater extent than was or is necessary to avoid the Excise Tax or it is subsequently determined that the Payments should not be or should not have been reduced pursuant to this paragraph (d), then the Company shall promptly pay to the Executive the amount necessary so that, after such adjustment, the Executive will have received or be entitled to receive the maximum Payments payable under this paragraph (d), together with interest at the applicable Federal rate (as defined in Section 1274(d) of the Code) on amounts that were incorrectly reduced pursuant to this paragraph (d), except that no Payments shall be made under this subparagraph to the extent that such Payments would impermissibly change the time and form of deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code.
 
(e)
 
In the event of a Covered Termination, except as otherwise provided in this Section 6, the Executives rights in respect of all awards and benefits to which the Executive may be entitled shall be determined in accordance with the terms and condition of the Company plans or arrangements under which such awards or benefits are provided.
 
7.
 
.

 (a)
   
   
 
The Executive may voluntarily terminate his employment for Good Reason if the following requirements are satisfied:
 
(i)
 
the Executive shall have given a written notice to the Company stating that the Executive intends to terminate his employment for Good Reason and
 
 
7 
 
describing therein in reasonable detail the act(s) or failure(s) constituting Good Reason (a Resignation for Good Reason Notice),
(ii)
 
the Resignation for Good Reason Notice must have been received by the Secretary of the Company within 60 days after the Executive knows or reasonably should have known of the act or failure (or the last in a series of acts or failures) identified by the Executive as constituting Good Reason,
 
(iii)
