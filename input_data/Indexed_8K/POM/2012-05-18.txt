(e)           On May 18, 2012, the following compensatory plans and arrangements of Pepco Holdings, Inc. (PHI) were approved.
Pepco Holdings, Inc. 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan
In December 2011, the Board of Directors of PHI (the Board) adopted the Pepco Holdings, Inc. 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the 2012 LTIP), subject to the approval of the 2012 LTIP by stockholders at PHIs 2012 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the Annual Meeting).  On May 18, 2012, the stockholders approved the 2012 LTIP at the Annual Meeting.
The purpose of the 2012 LTIP is to provide for long-term incentives to attract, retain and reward highly competent officers (including executive officers) and key employees of PHI and its subsidiaries, as well as directors of PHI who are not employees or officers of PHI or any subsidiary.  For a description of the material terms and conditions of the 2012 LTIP (including the specific performance goal criteria set forth thereunder), see Proposal 3:  Approval of the Pepco Holdings, Inc. 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan -- Summary of Terms of the 2012 LTIP included in PHIs definitive Proxy Statement dated March 28, 2012 (the Proxy Statement), which description has been filed herewith as Exhibit 99.1 hereto and is incorporated by reference in response to this Item 5.02(e).  Such description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the 2012 Plan, a copy of which is included as an exhibit to this Form 8-K.
On May 18, 2012, the Compensation/Human Resources Committee of the Board approved forms of restricted stock unit agreements to be used in connection with grants of time-based and performance-based restricted stock unit awards under the 2012 Plan to officers (including executive officers) and key employees of PHI and its subsidiaries.  Each such form has been filed herewith as an exhibit to this Form 8-K.
Pepco Holdings, Inc. Amended and Restated Annual Executive Incentive Compensation Plan
In December 2011, the Board adopted the Pepco Holdings, Inc. Amended and Restated Annual Executive Incentive Compensation Plan (the EICP), effective as of January 1, 2012, which replaced in its entirety the terms of the prior Pepco Holdings, Inc. Annual Executive Incentive Compensation Plan.  The EICP is a cash-based incentive program designed to align executive compensation with the performance of PHI and its subsidiaries.  The EICP is also intended to, among other things, reinforce a high-performance culture at PHI by tying executive compensation to measurable achievement of participants.  Awards under the EICP to certain of PHIs executive officers covered by Section 162(m) are intended to allow the deduction thereof for Federal income tax purposes under Section 162(m).
PHI has selected participants in the EICP and assigned them opportunities and performance goals with respect to the 2012 calendar year, subject to stockholder approval of the EICP at the Annual Meeting.  For a description of the terms and conditions of the EICP (including the specific performance goal criteria set forth thereunder), see Proposal 5:  Approval of the Pepco Holdings, Inc. Amended and Restated Annual Executive Incentive Compensation Plan -- Summary of Terms of the Amended EICP in the Proxy Statement, which description has been attached as Exhibit 99.2 hereto and is incorporated by reference in response to this Item 5.02(e).  Such description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the EICP, a copy of which is included as an exhibit to this Form 8-K.

NOW, THEREFORE
 
1.           . The RSU Award is a Service-Based Award under the Plan consisting of ___________ Restricted Stock Units.  The Restricted Stock Units are notional units of measurement denominated in shares of Stock (i.e., one Restricted Stock Unit is equivalent in value to one share of Stock, subject to the terms hereof).

Restricted Stock Unit Award
 
2.           . This RSU Award shall vest, as follows:
Vesting
 
(a)           On the ____ anniversary of the Date of Grant (the Vesting Date), this RSU Award shall vest in full, provided that the Participant remains continuously employed by the Company or a Subsidiary beginning on the Date of Grant and ending on the Vesting Date.  Except as otherwise provided by Section 2(b), 2(c) or 3 hereof, if the employment of the Participant by the Company or any Subsidiary terminates prior to the Vesting Date, this RSU Award shall be immediately forfeited in its entirety.  The ___-year vesting period described in this Section 2(a) shall be referred to herein as the Restriction Period.
 
(b)           Upon (i) the Termination of the Participants employment without Cause, or (ii) the death or Disability of the Participant during the Restriction Period and prior to any termination of the Participants employment with the Company or any Subsidiary, a portion of the RSU Award shall vest, which portion shall equal the number of Restricted Stock Units covered by this Agreement multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of days in the Restriction Period during which the Participant was continuously employed by the Company or a Subsidiary, and the denominator of which
 
 
 
 
shall be the total number of days in the Restriction Period.  The remaining portion of this RSU Award shall immediately be forfeited.
 
(c)           The Committee may, in its sole discretion, provide that, upon the retirement of the Participant (as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion), all or part of the Restricted Stock Units covered by this RSU Award shall vest.  Any such action by the Committee must be made in writing prior to the effective date of the Participants retirement.
 
Any Restricted Stock Units associated with this RSU Award as to which the vesting requirement of this Section 2 has been satisfied shall be payable in accordance with Section 5 hereof.
 
3.           .  Notwithstanding the foregoing (but subject to compliance with the provisions of Section 17 hereof), if the Participant is terminated by the Company or a Subsidiary as an employee or if the Participant terminates such employment for Good Reason, in each case within 12 months following a Change in Control and within the Restriction Period, all of the Restricted Stock Units represented hereby shall vest upon such termination and be payable in accordance with Section 5 hereof.
Accelerated Vesting
 
4.           .  Dividend Equivalents under the Plan have been granted in conjunction with this RSU Award, such that any dividend paid in cash on shares of Stock will be credited to the Participant as Dividend Equivalents as if the Restricted Stock Units represented hereby were outstanding shares of Stock.  Such credit shall be made in the form of additional whole and/or fractional Restricted Stock Units, based on the Fair Market Value of the Stock on the trading day immediately prior to the date of payment of any such dividend.  All such additional Restricted Stock Units shall be subject to the same vesting and forfeiture provisions applicable to the Restricted Stock Units in respect of which they were credited and shall be paid in accordance with Section 5 hereof.
Dividend Equivalents
 
5.           .  Payment of vested Restricted Stock Units (which shall include Restricted Stock Units credited pursuant to Dividend Equivalents described in Section 4) shall be made within thirty (30) days following the earlier of (i) the Vesting Date; or (ii) the vesting of this RSU Award in whole or in part pursuant to Sections 2(b), 2(c) or 3 hereof, but subject in each case, as applicable, to any delay that may be required under Section 16 hereof.  The vested Restricted Stock Units shall be paid in the form of one share of Stock for each Restricted Stock Unit, minus deductions for applicable minimum statutory withholding taxes as set forth in Section 11 of this Agreement.
Payment of Award
 
6.           .  None of the Restricted Stock Units covered hereby (including any Dividend Equivalents described in Section 4) may be assigned or alienated, and shall not be subject to attachment or other legal process except (i) to the extent specifically mandated and directed by applicable state or Federal statute; or (ii) as provided in Section 11 this Agreement with respect to withholding of applicable taxes.  Any attempted disposition of this RSU Award or the Restricted Stock Units (or any interest herein) in violation of this Section 6 shall be null and void.
Nontransferability of Award
 
7.           . The terms and conditions included in the Plan are incorporated herein by reference, and to the extent that any conflict or ambiguity may exist
Terms and Conditions
 
 
 
 
between the terms and conditions included in this Agreement and the terms and conditions included in the Plan, the terms and conditions included in the Plan shall control. By execution of this Agreement, the Participant acknowledges receipt of a copy of the Plan and further agrees to be bound thereby and by the actions of the Committee and/or the Board pursuant to the Plan.
 
8.           . The Restricted Stock Units granted pursuant to this RSU Award, whether or not vested, will not confer any voting rights or any other rights of a stockholder of the Company upon the Participant, and the Participant will not acquire any voting rights or any other rights of a stockholder of the Company unless and until such Restricted Stock Units have vested and shares of Stock underlying such Restricted Stock Units have been issued and delivered to the Participant.  The Company shall not be required to issue or transfer any certificates representing shares of Stock upon vesting of the RSU Award until all applicable requirements of any law, rule or regulation have been compiled with, and any required government agency approvals have been obtained.  Further, no issue or transfer of such certificates shall occur until such shares of Stock have been duly listed on any securities exchange on which the Stock may then be listed.
No Rights as a Stockholder
 
9.           .  Upon vesting of the RSU Award and payment of Stock pursuant to Section 5 hereof, the Participant shall be provided with the certificate(s) or certificate number(s) evidencing ownership of the shares of such Stock, subject to the implementation of an arrangement with the Participant to effectuate all necessary tax withholding.  If the shares of Stock evidenced by such certificate(s) were not offered and sold to the Participant in a transaction registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), the certificate(s) may include a legend noting that the Stock may not be sold or transferred by the Participant unless such Stock is registered for resale or unless the Participant meets an exemption from registration under the Securities Act. The Company shall follow all requisite procedures to deliver such certificates to the Participant; provided, however, that such delivery may be postponed to enable the Company to comply with any applicable procedures, regulations or listing requirements of any government agency, stock exchange, transfer agent or regulatory agency.
Stock Issuable Upon Vesting
 
10.           .  This Agreement shall not constitute a contract of employment between the Company or any Subsidiary and the Participant.  The Participants right, if any, to serve the Company as a director, officer, employee or otherwise shall not be enlarged or otherwise affected by this Agreement or his or her designation as a participant under the Plan.
No Employment Right; Tenure
 
11.           . The Participant acknowledges this RSU Award may give rise to a tax liability and a withholding obligation associated therewith, and that no shares of Stock shall be issuable to the Participant hereunder until such withholding obligation is satisfied in full.  In accordance with Section 19.C. of the Plan, the Company or a Subsidiary may withhold up to, but no more than, the minimum applicable statutory federal, state and/or local taxes (collectively, Tax Withholding Requirements) at such time and upon such terms and conditions as required by law or determined by the Company or a Subsidiary.  Subject to compliance with any requirements of applicable law, the Participant shall have all or any portion of any Tax Withholding Requirements that may be payable in respect of the RSU Award satisfied when due through the payment by the Participant of cash to the Company or a Subsidiary, funded by the disposition on the Participants behalf or for the Participants account of shares of Stock which
Tax Withholding
 
 
 
 
would otherwise be delivered to the Participant having an aggregate fair market value equal to the aggregate amount of such Tax Withholding Requirements.
 
12.           .  The Company currently has an effective registration statement on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission with respect to the shares of Stock subject to the RSU Award. The Company intends to maintain the effectiveness of this registration statement but has no obligation to the Participant to do so.  If the registration statement ceases to be effective, the Participant will not be able to transfer or sell shares of Stock, which were issued to the Participant pursuant to the RSU Award at a time that such registration statement was not effective, unless exemptions from registration under applicable securities laws are available.  Such exemptions from registration are very limited and might not be available.  The Participant agrees that any resale of shares of Stock issued pursuant to the RSU Award shall comply in all respects with the requirements of all applicable securities laws, rules and regulations (including, without limitation, the provisions of the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and the respective rules and regulations promulgated thereunder) and any other law, rule or regulation applicable thereto, as such laws, rules, and regulations may be amended from time to time. The Company shall not be obligated to either issue shares of Stock or permit the resale of any such shares if such issuance or resale would violate any such requirements.
Securities Law Compliance
 
13.           . Any gain realized by the Participant pursuant to this Agreement shall not be taken into account as compensation in the determination of the Participants benefits under any pension, savings, group insurance, or other benefit plan maintained by the Company or a Subsidiary, except as determined by the board of directors of such company or as expressly provided under the terms of such other plan. The Participant acknowledges that receipt of this Agreement or any prior agreement under the Plan shall not entitle the Participant to any other benefits under the Plan or any plans maintained by the Company or a Subsidiary.
Other Plans and Agreements
 
14.           . The Committee shall have complete discretion in the exercise of its rights, powers, and duties under this Agreement and the Plan. Any interpretation or construction of any provision of, and the determination of any question arising under, this Agreement shall be made by the Committee in its sole discretion and shall be final, conclusive, and binding.  The Committee may designate any individual or individuals to perform any of its functions hereunder.
Committee Authority
 
15.           .  The Restricted Stock Units under this RSU Award shall be subject to the provisions of Section 19.H. of the Plan relating to adjustments for changes to the Companys capitalization.  The RSU Award shall not affect the right of the Company or any Subsidiary to reclassify, recapitalize or otherwise change its capital or debt structure or to merge, consolidate, convey any or all of its assets, dissolve, liquidate, windup or otherwise reorganize.
Changes in Capitalization
 
16.           .  This Agreement shall be interpreted to ensure, to the fullest extent possible, that the payments contemplated hereby comply with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, including the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder (Section 409A).  However, if the RSU Award is determined to be subject to Section 409A and any payment is triggered by a separation from service, the payment will, if the Participant is a
Section 409A
 
 
 
 
specified employee (as determined under Section 409A) and to the extent required by Section 409A, be delayed until the date that is one day after the six month anniversary of such separation from service.
 
17.           .  If the Participant is subject to the provisions of (i) Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002; (ii) any policies adopted by the Company in accordance with rules that may be promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 10D of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended; and (iii) any other existing or future applicable law, rule, regulation, stock exchange rule, or policy of the Board providing for the forfeiture or recoupment of equity-based compensation granted by the Company (individually or collectively, the Clawback Rules), this Award and the Restricted Stock Units described herein, as well as any shares of Common Stock issued hereunder (and any proceeds from the sale or disposition thereof), are subject to potential forfeiture or clawback to the fullest extent called for by the Clawback Rules.  By accepting this Award, the Participant agrees to return to the Company the full amount required by the Clawback Rules.
Clawback Rules
 
18.           . This Agreement shall be construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to the choice of law principles thereof.
Governing Law
 
19.           .  This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of, and be binding on, the Company and its successors and assigns, and the Participant and his or her heirs, administrators, executors, other legal representatives and permitted assigns, whether so expressed or not.
Binding Effect
 
20.           .  No waiver of any provision of this Agreement will be valid unless in writing and signed by the person against whom such waiver is sought to be enforced, nor will failure to enforce any right under this Agreement constitute a continuing waiver of the same or a waiver of any other right hereunder.
No Waiver
 
21.           .  The Participant hereby agrees to take whatever additional action and execute and deliver all agreements, instruments and other documents the Company may deem necessary or advisable to carry out or effect any of the obligations or restrictions imposed on the Participant or the RSU Award pursuant to the express provisions of the Agreement and/or the Plan.
Further Assurances
 
22.           .  Capitalized terms used herein but not otherwise defined in this Agreement shall have the meanings ascribed to them under the Plan.

Section 162(m) Compliance
 
(a)           In no event shall this RSU Award vest in whole or in part unless the Committee has certified in writing that the Performance Goals hereunder shall have been satisfied, and the retirement, Disability or death of the Participant shall serve only to reduce the number of Restricted Stock Units that may be received if and when such Performance Goals are satisfied.
 
(b)           No adjustment that is otherwise permitted under this Agreement shall be made to this RSU Award in whole or in part if such adjustment would prevent the RSU Award (or any other Award, whether to the Participant or any other participant in the Plan) from satisfying the requirements for performance-based compensation of Section 162(m).
 
14.           . Any gain realized by the Participant pursuant to this Agreement shall not be taken into account as compensation in the determination of the Participants benefits under any pension, savings, group insurance, or other benefit plan maintained by the Company or a Subsidiary, except as determined by the board of directors of such company or as expressly provided under the terms of such other plan. The Participant acknowledges that receipt of this Agreement or any prior agreement under the Plan shall not entitle the Participant to any other benefits under the Plan or any plans maintained by the Company or a Subsidiary.
Other Plans and Agreements
 
15.           . The Committee shall have complete discretion in the exercise of its rights, powers, and duties under this Agreement and the Plan.

Accordingly, except as otherwise provided in Section 7.D. of the Plan, in no event shall payment be made later than the 15th day of the third month after the end of the first calendar year in which the RSU Award is no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture within the meaning of Section 409A.  However, if the RSU Award is determined to be subject to Section 409A and any payment is triggered by a separation from service, the payment will, if the Participant is a specified employee (as determined under Section 409A) and to the extent required by Section 409A, be delayed until the date that is one day after the six month anniversary of such separation from service.

WHEREAS,
 
, in consideration of the mutual covenants hereinafter set forth and for other good and valuable consideration, the Company and the Participant agree as follows:
NOW, THEREFORE
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(a)
 
The Restricted Stock Units under this RSU Award shall vest only (i) except as provided in Section 3 hereof, to the extent that the Performance Goals are satisfied as provided in , and (ii) except as otherwise provided in Sections 2(c), 2(d) or 3 hereof, if the Participant remains continuously employed by the Company or a Subsidiary until the end of the Performance Period.
Schedule A
 
(b)           Except as otherwise provided by Sections 2(c), 2(d) or 3 hereof, if the employment of the Participant by the Company or any Subsidiary terminates prior to the end of the Restriction Period, this RSU Award shall be immediately forfeited in its entirety.
 
(c)           Upon (i) the Termination of the Participants employment without Cause, or (ii) the Disability or death of the Participant during the Restriction Period and prior to any termination of Participants employment with the Company or any Subsidiary, the number of Restricted Stock Units, if any, payable under this RSU Award shall equal the number of Restricted Stock Units that otherwise would be paid, if any, following the Restriction Period (based on the achievement of the Performance Goals as determined under Section 1(b)), multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of days in the Restriction Period during which the Participant was continuously employed by the Company or a Subsidiary, and the denominator of which shall be the total number of days in the Restriction Period.  The remaining portion of this RSU Award that does not vest in accordance with this Section 2(c) shall immediately be forfeited.
 
(d)           The Committee may, in its sole discretion, provide that, upon the retirement of the Participant (as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion), all or part of the Restricted Stock Units covered by this RSU Award shall be payable under this RSU Award, subject to the satisfaction of the Performance Goals as provided in .  Any such action by the Committee must be made in writing prior to the effective date of the Participants retirement.
Schedule A
 
Any portion of this RSU Award as to which the vesting requirements of this Section 2 have been satisfied shall be payable in accordance with Section 5 hereof.
 
3.           .  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary (but subject to compliance with the provisions of Section 17 hereof), if the Participant is terminated by the Company or a Subsidiary as an employee, or if the Participant terminates such employment for Good Reason, in each case within 12 months following a Change in Control and within the Restriction Period, then without regard to the extent to which the Performance Goals are achieved, a portion of the Restricted Stock Units represented hereby shall vest and be payable in accordance with Section 5 hereof, which portion shall equal such number of Restricted Stock Units multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of days of the Performance Period that have elapsed as of such Change in Control (or, in the case of a termination of employment for Good Reason, as of the date of such termination), and the denominator of which shall be the total number of days in the Performance Period.  For purposes of this Section 3, it will have been assumed that all of the performance-based vesting
Accelerated Vesting
 
 
 
 
requirements have been achieved at the target, or 100%, level, as provided on attached hereto.
Schedule A
 
4.           . Dividend Equivalents under the Plan have been granted in conjunction with this RSU Award, such that any dividend paid in cash on shares of Stock will be credited to the Participant as Dividend Equivalents as if the Restricted Stock Units represented hereby were outstanding shares of Stock.  Such credit shall be made in the form of additional whole and/or fractional Restricted Stock Units, based on the Fair Market Value of the Stock on the trading day immediately prior to the date of payment of any such dividend.  All such additional Restricted Stock Units shall be subject to the same vesting and forfeiture requirements applicable to the Restricted Stock Units in respect of which they were credited and shall be paid in accordance with Section 5 hereof.  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary (except Section 3), no dividends credited in the form of Restricted Stock Units shall be paid to the Participant with respect to Restricted Stock Units under this RSU Award if the Performance Goals with respect hereto have not been satisfied.
Dividend Equivalents
 
5.           .  Payment of vested Restricted Stock Units (which shall include Restricted Stock Units credited pursuant to Dividend Equivalents described in Section 4) shall be made within thirty (30) days following (i) the satisfaction of all of the applicable vesting requirements under Section 2 hereof and the determination of the number of Restricted Stock Units, if any, payable under this RSU Award, or (ii) accelerated vesting under Section 3 hereof; that the timing of all payments hereunder shall be made in compliance with Section 17.  The vested Restricted Stock Units shall be paid in the form of one share of Stock for each Restricted Stock Unit, minus deductions for applicable minimum statutory withholding taxes as set forth in Section 11 of this Agreement.
Payment of Award
provided, however,
 
6.           .  None of the Restricted Stock Units covered hereby (including any Dividend Equivalents described in Section 4) may be assigned or alienated, and shall not be subject to attachment or other legal process except (i) to the extent specifically mandated and directed by applicable state or Federal statute; (ii) as provided in Section 11 this Agreement with respect to withholding of applicable taxes; or (iii) pursuant to a Permitted Transfer.  Any attempted disposition of this RSU Award or the Restricted Stock Units (or any interest herein) in violation of this Section 6 shall be null and void.
Nontransferability of Award
 
7.           . The terms and conditions included in the Plan are incorporated herein by reference, and to the extent that any conflict or ambiguity may exist between the terms and conditions included in this Agreement and the terms and conditions included in the Plan, the terms and conditions included in the Plan shall control. By execution of this Agreement, the Participant acknowledges receipt of a copy of the Plan and further agrees to be bound thereby and by the actions of the Committee and/or the Board pursuant to the Plan.
Terms and Conditions
 
8.           . The Restricted Stock Units granted pursuant to this RSU Award, whether or not vested, will not confer any voting rights or any other rights of a stockholder of the Company upon the Participant, and the Participant will not acquire any voting rights or any other rights of a stockholder of the Company unless and until such Restricted Stock Units have vested and shares of Stock underlying such Restricted Stock Units have been issued and delivered to the Participant.  The Company shall not be required to issue or transfer any certificates representing shares of Stock upon vesting of the RSU Award until all applicable
No Rights as a Stockholder
 
 
 
 
requirements of any law, rule or regulation have been compiled with, and any required government agency approvals have been obtained.  Further, no issue or transfer of such certificates shall occur until such shares of Stock have been duly listed on any securities exchange on which the Stock may then be listed.
 
9.           .  Upon vesting of the RSU Award and payment of Stock pursuant to Section 5 hereof, the Participant shall be provided with the certificate(s) or certificate number(s) evidencing ownership of the shares of such Stock, subject to the implementation of an arrangement with the Participant to effectuate all necessary tax withholding.  If the shares of Stock evidenced by such certificate(s) were not offered and sold to the Participant in a transaction registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), the certificate(s) may include a legend noting that the Stock may not be sold or transferred by the Participant unless such Stock is registered for resale or unless the Participant meets an exemption from registration under the Securities Act. The Company shall follow all requisite procedures to deliver such certificates to the Participant; provided, however, that such delivery may be postponed to enable the Company to comply with any applicable procedures, regulations or listing requirements of any government agency, stock exchange, transfer agent or regulatory agency.
Stock Issuable Upon Vesting
 
10.           .  This Agreement shall not constitute a contract of employment between the Company or any Subsidiary and the Participant.  The Participants right, if any, to serve the Company as a director, officer, employee or otherwise shall not be enlarged or otherwise affected by this Agreement or his or her designation as a participant under the Plan.
No Employment Right; Tenure
 
11.           . The Participant acknowledges this RSU Award may give rise to a tax liability and a withholding obligation associated therewith, and that no shares of Stock shall be issuable to the Participant hereunder until such withholding obligation is satisfied in full.  In accordance with Section 19.C. of the Plan, the Company or a Subsidiary may withhold up to, but no more than, the minimum applicable statutory federal, state and/or local taxes (collectively, Tax Withholding Requirements) at such time and upon such terms and conditions as required by law or determined by the Company or a Subsidiary.  Subject to compliance with any requirements of applicable law, the Participant shall have all or any portion of any Tax Withholding Requirements that may be payable in respect of the RSU Award satisfied when due through the payment by the Participant of cash to the Company or a Subsidiary, funded by the disposition on the Participants behalf or for the Participants account of shares of Stock which would otherwise be delivered to the Participant having an aggregate fair market value equal to the aggregate amount of such Tax Withholding Requirements.
Tax Withholding
 
12.           .  The Company currently has an effective registration statement on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission with respect to the shares of Stock subject to the RSU Award. The Company intends to maintain the effectiveness of this registration statement but has no obligation to the Participant to do so.  If the registration statement ceases to be effective, the Participant will not be able to transfer or sell shares of Stock, which were issued to the Participant pursuant to the RSU Award at a time that such registration statement was not effective, unless exemptions from registration under applicable securities laws are available.  Such exemptions from registration are very limited and might not be available.  The Participant agrees that any resale of shares of Stock issued pursuant to the
Securities Law Compliance
 
 
 
 
RSU Award shall comply in all respects with the requirements of all applicable securities laws, rules and regulations (including, without limitation, the provisions of the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and the respective rules and regulations promulgated thereunder) and any other law, rule or regulation applicable thereto, as such laws, rules, and regulations may be amended from time to time. The Company shall not be obligated to either issue shares of Stock or permit the resale of any such shares if such issuance or resale would violate any such requirements.
 
13.           . Any gain realized by the Participant pursuant to this Agreement shall not be taken into account as compensation in the determination of the Participants benefits under any pension, savings, group insurance, or other benefit plan maintained by the Company or a Subsidiary, except as determined by the board of directors of such company or as expressly provided under the terms of such other plan. The Participant acknowledges that receipt of this Agreement or any prior agreement under the Plan shall not entitle the Participant to any other benefits under the Plan or any plans maintained by the Company or a Subsidiary.
Other Plans and Agreements
 
14.           . The Committee shall have complete discretion in the exercise of its rights, powers, and duties under this Agreement and the Plan.

Exhibit 99.1
Summary of Terms of the 2012 LTIP
Administration
The Compensation Committee will generally be the administrator of the 2012 LTIP and has sole authority to generally make all determinations advisable for the administration of the 2012 LTIP in order to achieve its stated objectives. The 2012 LTIP provides that, in lieu of the Compensation Committee, the Board may elect to assume responsibility for and perform any or all of the functions of the Compensation Committee under the 2012 LTIP, except that (1) the Compensation Committee must carry out any function that is related to a performance-based award covered by Section 162(m) of the Code, and (2) the Board will administer director awards under the 2012 LTIP (as discussed in more detail below under Director Awards). Throughout the remainder of this section, unless the context indicates otherwise, we refer to the Compensation Committee to mean either the Compensation Committee or the Board, as appropriate.
The Compensation Committee will designate officers and key employees who will be granted awards under the 2012 LTIP, and will designate non-employee directors who will be granted director awards, as well as the size and types of awards, the terms and conditions pursuant to which awards are granted, exercised or forfeited, and the form and content of the award agreements representing such awards. The Compensation Committee will be authorized to establish, administer and waive terms, conditions and performance goals of outstanding awards and to accelerate the vesting or exercisability of awards, in each case, subject to limitations contained in the 2012 LTIP. In the case of any award intended to be eligible for the performance-based compensation exception under Section 162(m) of the Code, the Compensation Committee will exercise its discretion consistent with the requirements for qualifying the award for that exception. The Compensation Committee will determine all questions of interpretation and application of the 2012 LTIP. The Compensation Committees determinations will be final and binding on a participant and not subject to further appeal.
Except as noted above, the Compensation Committee must be comprised of two or more members of the Board, each of whom must be an outside director within the meaning of the regulations promulgated under Section 162(m) of the Code and a non-employee director within the meaning of Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act. Currently, the members of the Compensation Committee are Messrs. Dunn (Chairman), Harker and Heintz, Ms. Krumsiek, and Mr. Ross, each of whom is an outside director and a non-employee director as described above.
Limits on Awards
The number of shares of common stock that may be issued under the 2012 LTIP may not exceed, in the aggregate, 8,000,000 shares. Of the aggregate number of shares eligible for issuance under the 2012 LTIP, the number of shares of common stock that may be issued pursuant to incentive stock options, or ISOs, is 8,000,000. The shares of common stock that may be issued under the 2012 LTIP will be either authorized and unissued shares or previously issued shares that have been reacquired and are held as treasury stock. For purposes of determining the number of shares of common stock available for issuance under the 2012 LTIP, whenever an award lapses, is cancelled or forfeited, is delivered or surrendered to us as part or full payment for the exercise of an option, or the rights of the participant to whom an award was granted terminate (except with respect to an option that lapses due to the exercise of a related stock appreciation right, or SAR), the shares subject to such award will again be available for future awards under the 2012 LTIP. The total number of shares available to be issued under the 2012 LTIP will be appropriately adjusted in the event of any change in the outstanding shares

Participation
The Compensation Committee may grant awards under the 2012 LTIP to officers or key employees of PHI or any subsidiary, including such officers or employees who are members of the Board. The Compensation Committee may also grant director awards under the 2012 LTIP to directors of PHI who are not employees or officers of PHI or any subsidiary. However, only employees of the Company and its subsidiaries will be eligible to receive ISOs under the 2012 LTIP. As of March 23, 2012, approximately 62 persons are eligible to participate in the 2012 LTIP.
Term of the 2012 LTIP
If the 2012 LTIP is approved by stockholders at the Annual Meeting, the effective date of the 2012 LTIP will be the date of the Annual Meeting. Unless earlier terminated by the Board, the 2012 LTIP shall terminate on the tenth anniversary of the effective date, but the 2012 LTIP shall remain in effect thereafter solely to settle all matters related to the payment of outstanding awards and the termination of the 2012 LTIP.
Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Unit Awards
General
Restricted stock awards are shares of common stock that are awarded to a participant subject to the satisfaction of the terms and conditions established by the Compensation Committee. During a specified period of time, or restriction period, shares of restricted stock bear a legend prohibiting the sale, transfer, pledge, assignment or hypothecation of the shares until the expiration of the restriction period. Upon issuance to the participant of shares of restricted stock, the participant will have the right to vote such shares, and, unless otherwise provided in the award agreement, to receive the dividends paid on such shares.
A restricted stock unit, or RSU, is a contractual right to receive upon vesting of the RSU an amount payable in cash or shares of common stock, as determined by the Compensation Committee. No shares of common stock are issued to the participant on the date of grant of an RSU, and the participant does not have any voting or dividend rights with respect to shares underlying an RSU award until any shares of common stock are issued to the participant (although the Compensation Committee may award dividend equivalents in connection with the grant of an RSU).
In general, awards of restricted stock or RSUs will be issued without the payment of any consideration by the participant. Such awards may be time-based or performance-based. Time-based awards vest taking into account only the period of time that the participant performs services for PHI or any subsidiary after the date of grant. Performance-based awards require the satisfaction of performance objectives, criteria or other requirements in order for the award to vest, in addition to continued employment with PHI or a subsidiary. Each award of restricted stock and RSUs shall be subject to such other terms and conditions consistent with the 2012 LTIP as shall be determined by the Compensation Committee and set forth in an award agreement.

Vesting and Forfeiture
.                                    At the time a time-based award of restricted stock or RSUs is granted, the Compensation Committee will, in its discretion, establish a restriction period applicable to such award. Each award may have a different restriction period. Upon completion of the restriction period with respect to a restricted stock award, all restrictions will lapse and a new certificate or certificates for the shares will be issued to the participant without the restrictive legend. The lapse of restrictions with respect to a time-based award of RSUs shall cause the award to be paid as provided in the award agreement.
Time-Based
 
Awards
If a participant ceases employment or service as a director during the restriction period, the award of time- based restricted stock or RSUs will be forfeited as provided below:
At the time a performance-based award of restricted stock or RSUs is granted, the Compensation Committee will establish both a restriction period and a performance period applicable to such award. The performance period is the period during which performance relative to defined objectives is measured to determine whether the award will vest in whole or in part. Each award may have different restriction and performance periods, and performance periods may overlap.
Performance-Based
 
Awards.    
No later than 90 days after the beginning of a performance period, the Compensation Committee must determine one or more performance objectives associated with the performance-based award of restricted stock or RSUs, as well as the number of shares of restricted stock or the number of RSUs that comprise the award. As soon as practicable after the end of the performance period, the Compensation Committee will determine whether and to what extent the target performance objectives were achieved and whether the other material terms of the award were satisfied. A performance-based restricted stock or RSU award may be forfeited as provided below:
 
 3
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the restriction period will not lapse with respect to the unforfeited portion of any performance-based award until the Compensation Committee determines whether the performance objectives for that award were achieved. If the Compensation Committee determines with respect to a restricted stock award that common stock may be retained as a result of achieving the performance objectives, PHI will issue to the participant a new share certificate without the restrictive legend. With respect to an award of RSUs, PHI will make a payment to the participant in cash, shares of common stock, or a combination thereof, in accordance with the terms of the award agreement or as otherwise determined by the Compensation Committee. Unless the Compensation Committee determines otherwise, payment will be made in full no later than the 15th day of the third month after the end of the first calendar year in which the RSU is no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code.
Stock Options and SARs
General
Under the 2012 LTIP, a stock option award gives the participant the right, during a specified period of time, or option period, to purchase a specified number of shares of common stock in the future at a set exercise price, with such other terms and conditions as specified in the 2012 LTIP or in a stock option agreement between the Company and the participant.
Under the 2012 LTIP, a SAR is an award that gives a participant the right to receive from the Company, during a specified period of time, or exercise period, an amount in cash, common stock, or a combination thereof, equal to (1) the number of shares for which the SAR is exercised, multiplied by (2) the excess of (A) the fair market value of a share of the common stock on the trading day preceding the exercise date over (B) the exercise price of the SAR (which must be greater than or equal to the fair market value of a share of common stock on the date of grant). SARs may be granted under the 2012 LTIP alone or together with specific stock options granted under the 2012 LTIP.
Duration
Subject to certain exceptions, the latest date on which a participant may exercise an option or SAR will be the first to occur of (1) ten years after the date of grant, (2) the expiration of the option period or exercise period, as the case may be, or (3) the effective date of any termination (as defined under the 2012 LTIP) of the participant. However, under the Code, an ISO that is granted to a participant who beneficially owns 10% or more of the common stock may not be exercised after the fifth anniversary of the date of grant.
In the event of a participants retirement (as determined by the Compensation Committee) or disability (as defined in the 2012 LTIP), the option or SAR will lapse as provided under the first to occur of either clauses (1) or (2) above. In the event of a participants death, the option or SAR will lapse at the end of the option period or exercise period. However, in the event of the retirement (as determined by the Compensation Committee), disability or death of a participant, the Compensation

To the extent that a SAR is issued in tandem with an option and either the SAR or the option is exercised, the other component of the tandem award will be deemed to have lapsed immediately upon such exercise.
Vesting
The Compensation Committee shall determine the option period or exercise period with respect to an option or SAR. No option or SAR may be exercised after it lapses. An option may be exercised in whole or in part at any time, except as otherwise provided in the 2012 LTIP or in the stock option agreement. In the case of an ISO, the aggregate fair market value of common stock for which all ISOs held by a participant are first exercisable in any calendar year may not exceed $100,000, or such other amount as determined under the Code.
A SAR issued in tandem with an option will be exercisable to the extent the related option is exercisable. No such SAR or option may be exercisable during the six-month period after their respective dates of grant except in the case of the participants disability or death. Nonetheless, in the event of a tender offer for the common stock or the submission of a proposal to PHIs stockholders to merge or consolidate PHI with another company, the Compensation Committee may, in its sole discretion, declare any outstanding option or SAR to be immediately exercisable.
Option Price; Exercise Price
The per share option price (or in the case of a SAR, the exercise price), will be set by the Compensation Committee, but may not be less than 100% (110% in the case of an ISO granted to a 10% stockholder) of the fair market value of a share of common stock on the date of grant.
Payment of Option Price; Settlement of SARs
Upon exercise, the option price may be paid in the form of cash, or, if permitted by the stock option agreement, by delivery of other shares of common stock, or any combination thereof. The stock option agreement may provide that, in lieu of tendering the option price in cash, the participant will receive the number of shares subject to an exercise, less such amount of shares having a fair market value equal to the aggregate option price.  If the stock option agreement permits payment of the option price by delivery of other shares of common stock, such shares must have been held by the participant for at least six months.
The Compensation Committee may direct in the award agreement that, upon exercise of a SAR, payment in settlement of the SAR will be in cash, shares of common stock, or a combination thereof.
Failure to Exercise a SAR
In the event that a participant fails to exercise a SAR by the end of the last day of the exercise period (or the last day of the option period, for a SAR issued in tandem with an option), then, to the extent that the SAR is exercisable, the SAR will be deemed to have been exercised by the participant on the last day of the exercise period or option period, as applicable. However, a SAR will not be

Performance Shares and Performance Units
A performance share award represents a contractual right to receive one share of common stock based upon achievement of specified performance objectives. A performance unit award is a similar contractual right to receive an amount to be determined by the Compensation Committee, which may be in the form of, among other things, cash, property or other shares. No shares of common stock are issued to the participant when a performance share or performance unit award is granted, and the participant does not receive any voting or dividend rights with respect to shares underlying such awards until shares of common stock are actually issued to the participant (although the Compensation Committee may award dividend equivalents in connection with the grant of these awards).
The Compensation Committee will determine the performance period and performance objectives, and the extent to which such awards vest, in substantially the same manner as required for performance-based RSUs. Each award of performance shares is payable solely in common stock. An award of performance units will be payable when determined by the Compensation Committee. A performance share or performance unit award will also be forfeited under the same conditions as performance-based RSUs.
Unrestricted Stock Awards
The 2012 LTIP permits grants of unrestricted stock awards. These are grants of common stock that are not subject to time-based or performance-based conditions. An award of unrestricted stock will not be subject to any restriction on sale or other transfer by a participant, other than any restrictions that may be required by applicable law.
Director Awards
Subject to such terms and conditions as may be established by the Board, including without limitation in connection with any minimum standards or requirements for participation or ownership of common stock established or approved by the Board, the Board may grant one or more director awards, in lieu of some or all of such directors cash compensation. Director awards may consist of grants of options, SARs, restricted stock, RSUs, performance shares, performance units or unrestricted stock. Director awards may be made to any PHI director who is not an employee of PHI or any subsidiary thereof. The Board shall determine the date of the director award and number of shares of common stock subject thereto.  Except as otherwise provided in the 2012 LTIP with respect to a director award, all of the applicable provisions of the 2012 LTIP with respect to a particular type of award shall apply to a director award.
Deferral of Awards under the 2012 LTIP
The 2012 LTIP provides that the Compensation Committee may establish at any time and from time to time, such rules, guidelines and procedures as the Compensation Committee shall deem appropriate pursuant to which any one or more participants would be required or permitted to elect to defer to a later date the time at which any payment or settlement of any award shall occur. Furthermore, the Compensation Committee may authorize in respect of any award the payment or settlement of which has been deferred the accrual of interest equivalent credits or dividend equivalents during the deferral period to be paid at such times and on such terms and conditions as the Compensation Committee shall establish. However, no deferral or election to defer shall be authorized if such deferral

In December 2011, a deferral program was established under the 2012 LTIP, whereby non-employee directors were permitted to make, on or before December 31, 2011, an irrevocable election to defer the receipt of common stock subject to any RSUs, performance shares or performance units that may be granted to eligible directors under the 2012 LTIP. The deferral program permits an eligible director to defer the receipt of any common stock that may be payable pursuant to the vesting of a director award (and any associated dividend equivalents) until (1) the date the director ceases to be a director of PHI, (2) the January 31 after the date the director ceases to be a director of PHI, or (3) a specified date on or after January 31, 2015. Such deferred payments will be made in a lump sum solely in shares of common stock. Dividend equivalents shall be credited, when and as paid as dividends by the Board, in additional units of the same type and tenor as the stock-based award. The deferral program was approved by the Board subject to stockholder approval of the 2012 LTIP at the Annual Meeting.
Dividend Equivalents
The 2012 LTIP provides that dividend equivalents may be granted without consideration from the participant in conjunction with the grant or deferral of restricted stock awards, RSU awards, performance share awards, performance unit awards or any director awards (other than a director award in the form of an option or SAR). Dividend equivalents with respect to a performance-based award will normally be granted during a performance period associated with that award, except they may be granted under a performance-based restricted stock award in conjunction with the award of additional shares of common stock if the target performance objectives are exceeded (subject to compliance with Section 162(m) of the Code).
Each dividend equivalent will entitle the participant to receive an amount equal to the dividend paid with respect to a share of common stock on each dividend payment date from the date of grant to the date the dividend equivalent lapses. The Compensation Committee may direct the payment of such amount at such times and in such form and manner as determined by the Committee, but no payment shall be made as to any dividend equivalent associated with a performance-based award under the 2012 LTIP, unless the Compensation Committee has determined that the target performance objectives with respect thereto have been achieved or exceeded. If granted in connection with a time-based award, a dividend equivalent will lapse on the date established by the Compensation Committee on the date of grant of the dividend equivalent. With respect to performance-based awards, each dividend equivalent will lapse when the Compensation Committee determines that the target performance objectives with respect to a performance-based award have not been achieved or exceeded.
Change in Control
If a participant has a qualifying termination (as defined in the 2012 LTIP), the participant will be eligible to receive an accelerated payout or accelerated vesting of an award as described below. For purposes of this provision, a qualifying termination means the termination by PHI or any subsidiary of the participant as an employee or the removal of the participant as a director, or a participant terminating his or her employment with PHI or any subsidiary for good reason (as defined in the 2012 LTIP) within 12 months following a change in control involving PHI. The effect of a change in control on a participants outstanding award will be as follows:
 
7 
 
 
 
Any accelerated payout described above will be made within 30 days after the date of the qualifying termination, except as provided below. The accelerated option period or exercise period will begin on the date of the participants termination. If the original award provided for a payout in common stock, any accelerated payout will be made in common stock. With respect to any compensation that is subject to Section 409A of the Code, the accelerated payout will not be made until the participant separates from service within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, and, in the case of participant who is a specified employee (as determined under Section 409A of the Code), any payment that would otherwise be made within six months after the participants separation from employment will be paid in the seventh month following the participants separation.
Changes in Capitalization
In the event of any change in the outstanding shares of common stock by reason of any stock dividend or split, recapitalization, reorganization, combination, division or exchange of shares, or other similar changes, appropriate adjustments shall be made in the shares of common stock previously awarded to the participants, the option price per share for options and the exercise price for SARs. Moreover, the aggregate number of shares of common stock which may be awarded pursuant to the 2012 LTIP (both as to any individual participant and in the aggregate) shall be adjusted appropriately. Additional shares of common stock issued to a participant as the result of any such change shall bear the same restrictions as the shares of common stock to which they relate.
Transferability of Awards
Awards under the 2012 LTIP generally may not be sold, assigned or otherwise transferred except:

Clawback Provisions
If a participant under the 2012 LTIP is subject to the clawback provisions of either the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 or is covered under a policy adopted by PHI in accordance with rules promulgated by the SEC under the Dodd-Frank Act, an award agreement shall require the participant to comply with all provisions and requirements of such clawback rules.
Amendment and Termination
The Board may at any time and from time to time alter, amend, suspend, or terminate the 2012 LTIP, in whole or in part, but it cannot take any action that, without the consent of the participant to whom any outstanding award was previously granted, adversely affect the rights of such participant concerning such award, except to the extent that such termination, suspension, or amendment of the 2012 LTIP or the award:
Without approval of the stockholders of the Company, the Board may not amend the 2012 LTIP by:
Tax Provisions Under the 2012 LTIP
Section 409A of the Code
Awards under the 2012 LTIP are intended either to be exempt from the rules of Section 409A of the Code or to satisfy those rules, and the 2012 LTIP shall be construed accordingly. However, if any award under the 2012 LTIP does not qualify for favorable tax treatment under Section 409A of the Code or any provision of federal, state, local or foreign law, the Company shall not be liable to any participant for any tax the participant might owe as a result of the grant, holding, vesting, exercise or payment of any award.

Section 162(m) of the Code
If a performance-based award under the 2012 LTIP is granted to an executive officer of PHI or any subsidiary who, for a given performance period, is (or would be if the participant remained employed until the last day of the performance period), or in the opinion of the Compensation Committee, is likely to be, a covered employee within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code, the Compensation Committee may intend that an award to such a covered executive is to qualify as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code. In that case, the Compensation Committee would be required to establish performance objectives that comply with Section 162(m) of the Code.
Business Criteria under the 2012 LTIP for Performance Objectives
The performance objectives for any performance-based award that is intended to qualify as performance- based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code must be based on one or more business criteria that relate to the individual, groups of individuals, a product or service line, business unit, division or subsidiary or the Company as a whole, individually or in any combination (each of which business criteria may be relative to a specified goal, to historical performance of the Company or a product or service line, business unit, division or subsidiary, or to the performance of any other corporation or group of corporations or a product or service line, business unit, division or subsidiary thereof). Performance objectives will be based on one or more of the following criteria:
 
10 
 
A performance-based award to a covered executive that is intended to comply with Section 162(m) of the Code will not be paid unless the applicable performance objectives have been satisfied. The Compensation Committee must certify in writing as to the satisfaction of the applicable performance objectives prior to the payment of such a performance-based award. The Compensation Committee, in its sole discretion, may reduce (but not increase) the amount of any such performance-based award to a covered executive. No covered executive may receive options, SARs, awards of performance-based restricted stock or RSUs, awards of performance units or performance shares, where the aggregate number of shares subject to or underlying such awards exceeds 5,000,000 during the ten-year period during which awards may be made under the 2012 LTIP. Subject to avoiding adverse tax consequences under Section 409A of the Code, the Compensation Committee, in its sole discretion, may defer payment of a participants benefit under the 2012 LTIP if and to the extent that the sum of the participants 2012 LTIP benefits, plus all other compensation paid or payable to the participant for the fiscal year in which such benefit would otherwise be paid, exceeds the maximum amount of compensation that the Company may deduct under Section 162(m) of the Code with respect to the participant for the year. If deferred by the Compensation Committee, such award benefit will be paid in the first fiscal year of the Company in which the sum of such benefit and all other compensation paid or payable to the participant does not exceed the maximum amount of compensation deductible by the Company under Section 162(m) of the Code.

Exhibit 99.2
Summary of Terms of the Amended EICP
Plan Administration
The Amended EICP will be administered by the Compensation Committee or the Board (or its designee), except that, to the extent required for an award to a covered executive to qualify as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code, the Amended EICP shall be administered by the Compensation Committee, which must consist solely of two or more outside directors as defined under Section 162(m) of the Code. Throughout the remainder of this section, unless the context indicates otherwise, we refer to the Compensation Committee to mean either the Compensation Committee or the Board (or its designee), as appropriate.
The Compensation Committee will select the persons eligible to participate in the Amended EICP, approve performance goals, approve target payout levels and maximum award opportunities, approve the proportion of each award among categories of performance goals, determine whether awards should be made to participants and establish future service requirements as a condition to vesting in full of an award. The Compensation Committee has the discretion to adjust or eliminate awards and to make such other determinations and interpretations and take such actions as it deems necessary or desirable. The term award (as used throughout this Proposal 5) refers to a cash incentive payment made to a participant under the Amended EICP.
Effective Date and Termination
The Amended EICP is effective as of January 1, 2012, subject to stockholder approval of the Amended EICP at the Annual Meeting, and no award may be paid to a covered executive before such stockholder approval is obtained. No award shall be made in respect of any calendar year that begins on or after January 1, 2022.
Participation
Participants in the Amended EICP for any calendar year may include any executive or employee of the Company or any subsidiary selected by the Compensation Committee, upon the recommendation of the Companys chief executive officer, to participate in the Amended EICP. Plan participants for a year are normally (but not required to be) selected on or before January 31 of that year, although the Compensation Committee may, subject to compliance with Section 162(m) of the Code, permit additional eligible persons to become participants during a year. As of March 23, 2012, approximately 51 persons are eligible to participate in the Amended EICP. In January 2012, certain of our employees were granted target and maximum award opportunities (as described in the following subsection) under the Amended EICP, subject to stockholder approval of the Amended EICP. See  Calendar Year 2012 Opportunities under the Amended EICP.
Targets and Performance Goals
The Compensation Committee shall establish, with the advice and recommendation of the chief executive officer, target incentive opportunities, which are amounts established annually (expressed as a percentage of base salary) payable to participants if all established performance goals are met, and maximum award opportunities, which are maximum incentive payments given under the Amended EICP to participants during that year. The Compensation Committee may also establish future service requirements that must be met as a condition to the payment of an award. The maximum award that may be paid in any single year to any covered executive is $3,000,000.
Whether a participant receives an award under the Amended EICP will depend upon, in part, the achievement of one or more performance goals selected from among one or more of the following categories: corporate performance goals, business unit performance goals and individual performance goals. The business criteria for each category of performance goals are listed below:
 
1 
 
A.       Corporate performance goals:
B.       Business unit performance goals:
 
2 
 
C.       Individual performance goals:
These will be based on one or more individual performance measures related to the Company or any subsidiary, or the Companys or any subsidiarys business, which shall be measured solely in terms of quantitative targets related to the Company, any subsidiary or the Companys or any subsidiarys businesses, including without limitation:
Except with respect to covered executives, award opportunities and performance goals for a year normally are (but are not required to be) determined on or before January 31 of that year. For covered executives, award opportunities and performance goals must be determined by the Compensation Committee in writing no later than the end of the 90-day period beginning on the first day of the year and while their outcome is substantially uncertain.
Payment of Awards under the Amended EICP
A participant in the Amended EICP will be eligible to receive an award based on the level of achievement, as determined by the Compensation Committee, of the performance goals associated with that participants award opportunities. Awards earned by a covered executive under the Amended EICP may only be paid after the Compensation Committee has certified in writing the achievement of the performance goals that results in an award to that covered executive. In no event shall any award under the Amended EICP be paid unless the performance goals and any applicable future service requirements for that award have been satisfied. An award earned under the Amended EICP will be paid prior to the expiration of two and one-half months following (i) the end of the year to which the award relate or (ii) if later, the end of the year in which any applicable future service requirement was satisfied. Payment will be made in cash in a lump sum, except that a participant may elect to defer payment of any award in whole or in part under the terms of a deferred compensation plan that permits such deferral, assuming that the deferral would not cause adverse tax consequences under Section 409A of the Code. The Compensation Committee has the right to adjust or eliminate awards in its discretion, except that no upward adjustment may be made to a covered executives award if it would prevent the award from being performance-related compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code.
Termination Events
Except as otherwise required for an award to a covered executive to be considered performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code, the Amended EICP provides for the following adjustments of awards in the event of the termination, retirement, death or disability of a participant during a calendar year with respect to an award opportunity:
 
3 
 
To the extent that any award is reduced or eliminated as noted above, the Compensation Committee may reallocate the amount of such award to other participants, other than to a covered executive if such reallocation would prevent any award to a covered executive from being performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code.
Amendment and Termination
The Amended EICP may be amended, suspended or terminated by the Board at any time, provided that such amendment, suspension or termination will be subject to approval by our stockholders if and to the extent required by applicable law, rule or regulation, or to ensure that compensation to a covered executive will qualify as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code.
Clawback Provisions
If a participant is subject to the compensation recovery provisions of either the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 or is covered under a policy adopted by the Company in accordance with rules promulgated by the SEC under the Dodd-Frank Act, an award agreement shall require the participant to comply with all provisions and requirements of such compensation recovery rules.
