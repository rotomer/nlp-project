On January 15, 2004, PPG Industries Chief Financial Officer, William H. Hernandez, stated that PPG may begin repurchasing PPG Industries shares, from time to time, in market transactions of small amounts. The repurchases will be made under a previously announced and unused ten million share repurchase program. As required by new SEC rules, PPG will report any share repurchases quarterly, beginning with the Company's Form 10-Q to be filed for the quarter ending March 31, 2004.
 
 
Statements in this Form 8-K relating to matters that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements reflecting current views with respect to future events. Many factors could cause future events to differ significantly from those anticipated in current views. Among those factors are the risks and uncertainties discussed in PPG's other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
