As reported in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed by PPG Industries Inc. ("PPG" or "the Company") on January 2, 2008, PPG completed the acquisition of SigmaKalon (BC) Holdco B.V. ("SigmaKalon") on January 2, 2008. Pursuant to Item 9.01, this Form 8-K/A amends the initial Form 8-K and is being filed in order to include the audited historical financial statements of SigmaKalon and the related pro forma financial information that were excluded from the initial Form 8-K as permitted by Item 9.01 of Form 8-K. In accordance with Securities Exchange Act Rule 12b-15, the complete text of Items 2.01 and 9.01 as amended are set forth below.
 
On January 2, 2008, PPG completed the acquisition of SigmaKalon, a worldwide coatings producer based in Uithoorn, Netherlands, from global private investment firm Bain Capital. SigmaKalon produces architectural, protective, marine and industrial coatings and operates 22 major manufacturing facilities as well as a number of smaller facilities across Europe and other key markets around the world. SigmaKalon sells architectural coatings directly to professional painters through a combination of approximately 500 company-owned stores, approximately 3,000 independent distributors, home centers, paint dealers and directly to customers.
The total transaction value, including assumed debt, was approximately 2.2 billion (US$3.2 billion), consisting of cash paid to the seller of $1,673 million and debt assumed of $1,517 million. The cash paid to the seller consisted of 717 million ($1,056 million) and $617 million. The Company funded the acquisition through issuance of commercial paper and by borrowings under its three year 650,000,000 revolving credit facility with several banks and financial institutions and Societe Generale, as facility agent for the lenders, and a bridge loan agreement in the amount of 1,000,000,000 with multiple lenders and Credit Suisse, as administrative agent for those lenders.
A copy of the Company's press release announcing completion of the acquisition was attached as Exhibit 99 to the Company's initial 8-K filed January 2, 2008, and is incorporated by reference herein.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of SigmaKalon (BC) Holdco B.V. and its subsidiaries as of 31 December 2007 and the related consolidated income statement, statement of changes in equity and the statement of cash flow for the year then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
As discussed in Note 2.1, the accompanying financial statements do not include comparative figures for the prior year as required by IAS 1 "Presentation of Financial Statements". In our opinion, inclusion of comparative figures is necessary to obtain a proper understanding of the current period's financial statements.
In our opinion, except for the exclusion of comparative information as discussed in the preceding paragraph, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of SigmaKalon (BC) Holdco B.V. and its subsidiaries at 31 December 2007 and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the year then ended in conformity with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union.
International Financial Reporting Standards, as adopted by the European Union, vary in certain significant respects from accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Information relating to the nature and the effect of such differences is presented in Note 33 to the consolidated financial statements.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
 
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of derivative financial instruments at fair value through the income statement.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying the Group's accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are disclosed in Note 4.
Interpretations and amendments to published standards effective in 2007

Standards and interpretations to published standards that are not yet effective and not relevant for the Group's operations
 
 
(a) Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies generally accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are de-consolidated from the date that control ceases.
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange, plus costs directly attributable to the acquisition. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any minority interest. The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Group's share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognized directly in the income statement.
The interest of minority shareholder's in the acquiree is initially measured at the minority's proportion of the net fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognized.
Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealized gains on transactions between group companies are eliminated. Unrealized losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
(b) Associates
Associates are all entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control, generally accompanying a shareholding of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. Investments in associates are accounted for by the equity method of accounting and are initially recognized at cost.
 
SigmaKalon (BC) Holdco B.V.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
 
The Group's share of its associates' post-acquisition profits or losses is recognized in the income statement, and its share of post-acquisition movements in equity is recognized in equity. The cumulative post-acquisition movements are adjusted against the carrying amount of the investment.
When the Group's share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, including any other unsecured receivables, the Group does not recognize further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.
Unrealized gains on transactions between the Group and its associates are eliminated to the extent of the Group's interest in the associates. Unrealized losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. Accounting policies of associates have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
(c) Joint ventures
Joint ventures are all entities in which the Group has joint control, generally accompanying a shareholding of 50% of the voting rights. Joint ventures are accounted for by the equity method of accounting and are initially recognized at cost.
The Group's share of its joint ventures' post-acquisition profits or losses is recognized in the income statement, and its share of post-acquisition movements in equity is recognized in equity. The cumulative post-acquisition movements are adjusted against the carrying amount of the investment.
When the Group's share of losses in a joint venture equals or exceeds its interest in the joint venture, including any other unsecured receivables, the Group does not recognize further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the joint venture.
Unrealized gains on transactions between the Group and its joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Group's interest in the joint ventures. Unrealized losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. Accounting policies of joint ventures have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.

A business segment is a group of assets and operations engaged in providing products that are subject to risks and returns that are different from those of other business segments.
A geographical segment is engaged in providing products within a particular economic environment that are subject to risks and returns that are different from those of other geographical segments.
 
(a) Functional and presentation currency
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group's entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (the functional currency'). The consolidated financial statements are presented in euros, which is the Company's functional and presentation currency.
(b) Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date and non-monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the appropriate historical rates. Gains and losses arising on exchange are included in net profit or loss for the period, except when deferred in equity as qualifying cash flow hedges.
(c) Group companies
The results and financial position of all the group entities (none of which has the currency of a hyperinflationary economy) that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows:
(i) assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet;
 
SigmaKalon (BC) Holdco B.V.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
 
(ii) income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates (unless this average is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the dates of the transactions); and
(iii) all resulting exchange differences are recognized as a separate component of equity.
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign entities are taken to equity. When a foreign operation is sold, such exchange differences are recognized in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
 
Land and buildings held for use in the production or supply of goods or services, or for administrative purposes, are stated at their historical cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment charges. Historical cost includes expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the items.
Subsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amount or recognized as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.
Land is not depreciated. Depreciation on other assets is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate their cost to their residual values over their estimated useful lives, as follows:
 
The assets' residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date.
An asset's carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset's carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount (Note 2.7).
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with the carrying amount. These are included in the income statement.
 
(a) Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Group's share of the net identifiable assets of the acquired subsidiary at the date of
 
SigmaKalon (BC) Holdco B.V.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
 
acquisition. Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets. Goodwill on acquisitions of associates is included in investments in associates. Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and stated at historical cost less accumulated impairment charges.
(b) Trademarks
Trademarks that have an indefinite useful life are tested annually for impairment and stated at historical cost less accumulated impairment charges.
One of the Group's trademarks has a definite useful life. It is stated at historical cost less accumulated amortization and impairment charges. Amortization is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the cost of the trademark over its estimated useful life (3 years).
(c) (Un)patented technology
(Un)patented technology has a definite useful life and is stated at historical cost less accumulated amortization and impairment charges. Amortization is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the cost of (un)patented technology over its estimated useful life (2-10 years).
(d) Noncontractual customer relationship
Noncontractual customer relationship has a definite useful life and is stated at historical cost less accumulated amortization and impairment charges. Amortization is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the cost of the noncontractual customer relationship over its estimated useful life (5 years).
(e) Computer software and licenses
Acquired computer software licenses are capitalized on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the specific software. These costs are amortized over their estimated useful lives (3-5 years).
Costs associated with maintaining computer software programmes are recognized as an expense as incurred. Software development costs that will probably generate economic benefits exceeding costs beyond one year are recognized as intangible assets. Direct costs include the software development employee costs and an appropriate portion of relevant overheads.
Computer software development costs recognized as assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives (5 years).
 
Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortization and are tested annually for impairment. Assets that are subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's fair value less cost to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash
 
SigmaKalon (BC) Holdco B.V.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
 
flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows ("cash-generating units").
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount and an impairment loss is recognized in the income statement immediately.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, limited to the amount of the original write-down. A reversal of an impairment loss is not allowed for goodwill. A reversal of an impairment loss for all other assets is recognized as income immediately.
 
The Group classifies its financial assets in the following categories: at fair value through profit or loss or loans and receivables. The classification depends on the purpose for which the financial assets were acquired. Management determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition.
(a) Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are financial assets held for trading. A financial asset is classified in this category if acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short term. Derivatives are classified as held for trading, unless they are designated as hedges. Assets in this category are classified as current assets.
(b) Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date. These are classified as non-current assets. The Group's loans and receivables are classified as trade and other receivables in the balance sheet and cash and cash equivalents.
Regular purchases and sales of financial assets are recognized on the trade-date  the date on which the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset. For all financial assets not carried at fair value through profit or loss, investments are initially recognized at fair value plus transaction costs for all financial assets not carried at fair value through profit or loss. Financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss are initially recognized at fair value, and transaction costs are expensed in the income statement. Financial assets are derecognized when the rights to receive cash flows from the investments have expired or have been transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership. Available-for-sale financial assets and financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are subsequently carried at fair value. Loans and receivables are carried at amortized cost using the effective interest method.
 
SigmaKalon (BC) Holdco B.V.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
 
Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of the financial assets at fair value through profit or loss' category are presented in the income statement within finance cost-net, in the period in which they arise. Dividend income from financial assets at fair value through profit or loss is recognized in the income statement as part of other income when the Group's right to receive payments is established.
The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired.
Impairment testing of trade receivables is described in Note 2.11.
 
Derivatives are initially recognized at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at their fair value. The method of recognizing the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged.
The Group designates certain derivatives as either: (1) hedges of the fair value of recognized assets or liabilities or a firm commitment or (2) hedges of a particular risk associated with a recognized asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transactions (cash flow hedges).
For cash flow hedges, the Group determines at inception of the transaction if the relationship between the hedging instruments and the hedged items qualifies for hedge accounting and if so, whether hedge accounting will be applied.
If hedge accounting is applied, the Group documents at the inception of the transaction the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. The Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items.
The fair values of various derivative instruments used for hedging purposes are disclosed in Note 11. Movements on the hedging reserve in shareholders' equity are shown in Note 16. The full fair value of a hedging derivative is classified as a non-current asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is more than 12 months, and as a current asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is less than 12 months. Trading derivatives are classified as a current asset or liability.
 
SigmaKalon (BC) Holdco B.V.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
 
(a) Derivatives at fair value through profit and loss
Certain derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting. Changes in the fair value of any of these instruments are recognized directly in the income statement within finance cost-net.
(b) Fair value hedges
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk. No derivatives have been designated as hedges of the fair value of recognized asset or liability or a firm commitment
(c) Cash flow hedge
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognized in equity. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognized immediately in the income statement within operating profit.
For hedges on forecasted sales transactions, amounts accumulated in equity are recycled as sales in the income statement in the periods when the hedged item affects profit or loss.
However, when the forecast transaction that is hedged results in the recognition of a non-financial asset (for example, inventory) or a liability, the gains and losses previously deferred in equity are transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the asset or liability.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognized when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognized in the income statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement.
 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost is determined using the weighted average cost method. The cost of finished goods and work in progress comprises raw materials, direct labor, other direct costs and related production overheads (based on normal operating capacity). Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less applicable variable selling expenses.
Vendor rebates in the form of volume or other purchase discounts of which it is probable that the rebate will be earned, and the amount can be estimated reliably, are reflected in the carrying value of the inventory when earned and as a component of cost of goods sold when the inventory is sold.
 
Trade receivables are recognized initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment. A
 
SigmaKalon (BC) Holdco B.V.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
 
provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables. Significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganization, and default or delinquency in payments (for example, more than 180 days after date of invoice) are considered indicators that the trade receivable is impaired. The amount of the provision is the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate. The amount of the provision is recognized in the income statement within selling and distribution expenses. The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account. When a trade receivable is uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance account for trade receivables. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against selling and distribution expenses in the income statement.
 
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks and other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities on the balance sheet.
 
Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
 
Trade payables are recognized initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method.
 
Borrowings are recognized initially at their fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortized cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognized in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.
Borrowing costs incurred for the construction of any qualifying asset are capitalized during the period of time that is required to complete and prepare the asset for its intended use. Other borrowing costs are expensed in the year in which they occur.
 
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date in the countries where the company's subsidiaries and associates operate and generate taxable income. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.
 
SigmaKalon (BC) Holdco B.V.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
 
Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. However, the deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realized or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
Deferred income tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilized.
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
 
(a) Pension obligations
In accordance with the laws and practices of each country, the Group participates in pension and early retirement schemes. These plans provide benefits based on various factors such as length of service, salaries and contributions paid.
In addition to mandatory social arrangements, plans can either be defined contribution or defined benefit pension plans and may be entirely or partially funded with investments made in various non Group instruments such as mutual funds and securities.
For defined contribution plans, expenses correspond to the contributions paid.
The liability recognized in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of plan assets, together with adjustments for unrecognized actuarial gains or losses and past service costs. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to the income statement over the employees' expected average remaining working lives.
 
SigmaKalon (BC) Holdco B.V.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
 
Past service costs are recognized immediately in the income statement, unless the changes to the pension plan are conditional on the employees remaining in service for a specified period of time (the vesting period). In this case, the past service costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
For defined contribution plans, the Group pays contributions to publicly or privately administered pension insurance plans on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis. The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. The contributions are recognized as employee benefit expense when they are due. Prepaid contributions are recognized as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available.
(b) Jubilee awards and post-retirement healthcare benefits
Certain employees of the Group are entitled to jubilee awards. Jubilee awards are paid to employees upon completion of a certain number of years of service.
A number of companies in the Group provide post-retirement healthcare benefits to their retirees. The entitlement to these benefits is usually conditional on the employee remaining in service up to retirement age and the completion of a minimum service period.
Jubilee awards and post-retirement healthcare benefits are not funded.
The expected costs of these benefits are accrued over the period of employment using an accounting methodology similar to that for defined benefit pension plans. Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments, and changes in actuarial assumptions, are charged or credited to the income statement in the year that they arise. These obligations are valued annually by independent qualified actuaries.
(c) Termination benefits
Termination benefits are payable when employment is terminated before the normal retirement date, or whenever an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits. The Group recognizes termination benefits when it is demonstrably committed to either: terminating the employment of current employees according to a detailed formal plan without possibility of withdrawal; or providing termination benefits as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy. Benefits falling due more than 12 months after balance sheet date are discounted to their present value.
(d) Profit-sharing and bonus plans
The Group recognizes a liability and expenses for bonuses and profit-sharing. The Group recognizes a provision where it is contractually obliged or where there is a past practice that has created a constructive obligation.
 
Provisions for environmental costs, warranty costs, restructuring costs and legal claims are recognized when: the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events; it is more likely than not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the
 
SigmaKalon (BC) Holdco B.V.

obligation; and the amount can be reliably estimated. Where there are a number of similar obligations, the likelihood that an outflow will be required in settlement is determined by considering the class of obligations as a whole. A provision is recognized even if the likelihood of an outflow with respect to any one item included in the same class of obligations may be small.
The Group recognizes provisions for costs related to restructuring measures. These costs comprise of lease termination penalties, an onerous property lease contract and employment termination payments. Provisions for restructuring costs are recognized when the Group has a detailed formal plan for the restructuring that has been communicated to affected parties. Payments falling due more than 12 months after balance sheet date are discounted to their present value at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.
Provisions for warranty costs are recognized at the date of sale of the relevant products, at the management's best estimate of the outflow required to settle the Group's liability.
No provisions are recognized for future operating losses.
 
Revenue comprises of the fair value for the sale of goods, net of value-added tax, rebates and discounts and after elimination of sales within the Group. Revenue is recognized as follows:
(a) Sale of goods
Revenue from product sales is recognized at the time the product is shipped or delivered, significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have been transferred to the customer and collectibility of the related receivables is reasonably assured. Upon shipment, the Group also provides for the estimated costs that may be incurred for product warranties.
(b) Royalty income
Royalty income is recognized on an accrual basis in accordance with the substance of the relevant agreements.
(c) Dividend income
Dividend income is recognized when the right to receive payment is established.
 
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor) are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Leases of property, plant and equipment where the Group has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. Finance leases are capitalized at the lease's inception at the lower of the fair value of the leased property and the present value

of the minimum lease payments. Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance charges so as to achieve a constant rate on the finance balance outstanding. The corresponding rental obligations, net of finance charges, are separately presented on the face of the balance sheet. The interest element of the finance cost is charged to the income statement over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period. The property, plant and equipment acquired under finance leases is depreciated over the lease term or, if ownership of the asset transfers, over the useful life of the assets.
 
Research costs are expensed as incurred. Development costs are recognized as intangible assets when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the developed item will flow to the Group and the cost and future economic benefits of the item can be measured reliably. All other development costs are expensed as incurred.
 
The Group is involved in environmental investigation and remediation activities at some of its current and former sites. The estimated future costs for environmental obligations are accrued for and classified under provisions for other liabilities and charges when commitments or clean-up plans have been developed and the remediation cost can be reasonably estimated based on industry standards and historical experience. When it is not possible to predict the outcome of the pending environmental exposures, such exposures are disclosed as contingent liabilities. All accrued amounts are recorded on a discounted basis, where the effect of the time value of money is material.
 
Dividend distribution to the Company's shareholders is recognized as a liability in the Group's financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Company's shareholders.
 
 
The Group's activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including currency risk), credit risk, liquidity risk and cash flow interest-rate risk. The Group's overall risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimize potential adverse effects on the Group's financial performance. The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
Risk management is carried out by a central treasury department ("Group Treasury") under policies approved by the Chief Financial Officer. Group Treasury identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks in close co-operation with the Group's operating units. The policies provide written principles for overall risk management, as well as written policies covering specific areas, such as foreign exchange risk, interest-rate risk, credit risk, use of derivative financial instruments and investing excess liquidity.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
 
(a) Market risk
(i) Foreign exchange risk
The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily with respect to the UK pound and the US dollar. Foreign exchange risk arises from commercial transactions, recognized assets and liabilities and net investments in foreign operations.
Management has set up a policy to require group companies to manage their transactional foreign exchange risk. Foreign exchange risk arises when future cash flows generated by recognized assets or liabilities are denominated in a currency that is not the entity's functional currency. The group companies are required to hedge their foreign exchange risk exposure to the extent possible with legal entities centrally managed by Group Treasury, alternatively with local affiliates of international, reputable banks. The residual exposure at Group Treasury level arising from its hedging activities with the subsidiaries is then combined by currency with the assets and liabilities arising from the cash management activities located in a cross currency notional cash pool.
Acting as an in-house bank, Group Treasury also manages a large array of intercompany loans in the adequate amounts of foreign currencies to optimize cash repatriation in order to reduce foreign exchange risk on outstanding cash balances in foreign currencies. In addition, a part of the Group's senior debt is denominated in foreign currencies in order to match foreign exchange exposures.
The specific foreign exchange risk arising from long term contracts is hedged by relevant entities in the Group by means of forward contracts transacted with local banks. Such forward contracts are managed to match the highly probable cash flows arising from signed contracts. The Group applies cash flow hedge accounting on the US dollar denominated contracts entered into by its Korean subsidiary and one of its Chinese subsidiaries.
Group Treasury's risk management policy is to hedge between 75% and 100% of anticipated cash flows (mainly sales and purchase of inventory which are not denominated in functional currency) in each major foreign currency. Approximately 90% of projected sales in each major currency qualify as highly probable' forecast transactions for hedge accounting purposes.
Each subsidiary designates contracts with Group Treasury as fair value hedges or cash flow hedges, as appropriate. External foreign exchange contracts are designated at group level as hedges of foreign exchange risk on specific assets, liabilities or future transactions on a net basis.
At December 31, 2007, if the UK pound and the US dollar would have weakened respectively strengthened by 10 % against the euro with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit for the year and equity as per year-end would have been  3 higher respectively lower, mainly as a result foreign exchange results on translation of UK pound denominated borrowings.

(ii) Commodity risk
The Group is exposed to limited commodity price risk, mainly in solvents, biocides and functional pigments. As these risks are relatively modest in comparison with the whole raw materials portfolio, the Group's risk management policy is to contain the price volatility risk principally within its relationships with suppliers and customers. The Group does not use the futures markets and any forward purchase is normally limited to no more than 3 months' stock of minor materials that can readily be absorbed into the costing structure.
(iii) Cash flow interest-rate risk
The Group has no significant interest-bearing assets. The Group's interest-rate risk arises from long-term borrowings. Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the Group to cash flow risk, whereas borrowings issued at fixed rates expose the Group to fair value risk. Group policy is to fix through interest rate swaps a substantial part of the long term debt service requirements. As of December 31, 2007, more than 64 % of such funding requirements were at fixed rates.
The Group manages its cash flow interest-rate risk by using floating-to-fixed interest-rate swaps. Such interest-rate swaps have the economic effect of converting borrowings from floating rates to fixed rates. Generally, the Group raises long-term borrowings at floating rates and swaps them into fixed rates that are lower than those available if the Group borrowed at fixed rates directly.
At December 31, 2007, if interest rates on the Group's floating interest rate assets and liabilities would have been 10 basis points higher/lower with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit for the year would have been  0 lower/higher:
 
(b) Credit risk
Credit risk is managed on a group basis. Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and deposits with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to customers, including outstanding receivables and committed transactions.
The majority of the excess cash balances are daily pooled and deposited at ABN AMRO N.V. (Moody's: AA2 rating). Derivatives are only concluded with banks that have at least an A rating.
 
SigmaKalon (BC) Holdco B.V.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
 
There is no significant concentration of credit risk with respect to customers, as the Group has a large number of internationally dispersed customers. If customers are independently rated, these ratings are used. Otherwise, if there is no independent rating, risk control assesses the credit quality of the customer, taking into account its financial position, past experience and other factors. Individual risk limits are set based on internal or external ratings in accordance with limits set by the Board. The utilization of credit limits is regularly monitored.
The Group has a collective credit insurance for the receivables of subsidiaries in six countries. This insurance policy covers insolvency and protects against default from solvent clients, and includes additional coverage when credit limit requests have been performed by the insurer. This credit insurance policy allows the subsidiaries to sell to customers, safeguarding the Group against the consequences of customer insolvency and non-payment. This protection can give a competitive advantage because it allows the Group to increase credit lines to customers.
On a monthly basis, management analyses the ageing and impairment of trade receivables.
(c) Liquidity risk
Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and cash equivalents, the availability of funding through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities and the ability to close out market positions. Due to the dynamic nature of the underlying businesses, Group Treasury aims to maintain flexibility in funding by keeping committed credit lines available.
Management monitors rolling forecasts of the Group's liquidity reserve on the basis of expected cash flow.
The table below analyses the Group's financial liabilities and net-settled derivative financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date. The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows including interest. The majority of the Group's borrowings are subject to floating interest rates payments, for which the Group has concluded interest rate swap contracts to hedge these borrowings against changes in interest rates. Until December 31, 2007, the floating rate borrowings were repriced every 3 months and the interest rate swap contracts every 6 months. As of January 2, 2008 all interest rate swaps have been settled in cash with a bank (see Note 32).
 
SigmaKalon (BC) Holdco B.V.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
 
The Group's liquidity is also subject to compliance with certain financial covenants based on debt coverage by earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA') and interest cover ratios. On a monthly basis, management reviews these ratios. Management assesses the risk of breach of such ratios to be immaterial due to their relative stability combined with a substantial margin between actual and contractual ratios on a historical basis.
Following the acquisition of the Group on January 2, 2008 by PPG Industries, Inc. the existing credit facility has been redeemed at that date and replaced by intercompany loans from the new ultimate shareholder. As a consequence of this redemption the credit facility has been classified as short-term.
 
The Group's objectives when managing capital are:
 
 
 
 
Techniques, such as estimated discounted cash flows, are used to determine the fair value of the financial instruments. The fair value of interest-rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows. The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using forward exchange market rates at the balance sheet date. The fair value of options is determined using the Black-Scholes model.
 
SigmaKalon (BC) Holdco B.V.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
 
The nominal value less provision for impairments of trade receivables and payables are assumed to approximate their fair values. The fair value of financial liabilities for disclosure purposes is estimated by discounting the future contractual cash flows at the current market interest rate that is available to the Group for similar financial instruments.
 
Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates often differ from the related actual results. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below.
(a) Impairment goodwill and other intangible assets with an indefinite useful life
The Group tests annually whether goodwill or other intangible assets with an indefinite useful life has suffered any impairment. The impairment tests include judgments regarding the level of testing, and assumptions used in determining future cash flows and discount rates.
(b) Income taxes
The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes. There are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business. The Group recognizes liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made.
As per December 31, 2007 deferred tax assets and liabilities amounted to  72 and  77, respectively.
The Group did not recognize deferred income tax assets of  16 related to net operating losses amounting to  47, because management determined it will not be probable that the deferred tax assets will be able to be used against future taxable income. Additional information is disclosed in Notes 20 and 26.
(c) Employee benefit obligations
The present value of the employee benefit obligations depends on a number of factors that are determined on an actuarial basis using a number of assumptions. The assumptions used in determining the net cost (income) for employee benefits include the expected long-term rate of return on the relevant plans assets rates of compensation, state pension and pension increases in assessing benefit obligations and the discount rate. Any changes in these assumptions will impact the carrying amount of pension obligations.
 
SigmaKalon (BC) Holdco B.V.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
 
The assumption for the expected return on plan assets is determined on a uniform basis, taking into consideration long-term historical returns, asset allocation and future estimates of long-term investment returns.
The Group determines the appropriate discount rate at the end of each year. This is the interest rate that should be used to determine the present value of estimated future cash outflows expected to be required to settle the employee benefit obligations. In determining the appropriate discount rate, the Group considers the interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating the terms of the related employee benefit liability. Other key assumptions for employee benefit obligations are based in part on current market conditions.
As per December 31, 2007 the net employee benefit obligation amounted to  127. Additional information is disclosed in Note 21.
(d) Warranty claims
The Group offers product warranties for certain products. The specific terms and conditions of such warranties vary depending on the product or customer contract requirements. Management estimates and accrues the costs of unsettled product warranty claims based on historical results and experience. Management periodically assesses the adequacy of the provision for warranty claims and adjusts it as necessary. As per December 31, 2007 the provision for warranty claims amounted to  16. Additional information is disclosed in Note 22.

The Group is engaged in several restructuring programs in order to centralize its business, streamline production and reduce costs.
In 2007, the Group announced to stop its activities in Portugal. The provision at December 31, 2007 amounted to  1. The costs of this plan amounted to  2 for severance payments, scrap costs of inventory and impairment of assets.
On December 23, 2005, the Group purchased an industrial coatings manufacturer in the Netherlands and announced the transfer of its own industrial coatings business to the newly acquired site. In 2005, the Group provided for a non-cancellable property lease contract that became onerous as a result, for post-closure severance payments and for other qualified exit costs amounting to  4. In 2007, the Group added  1 to increase the provision for the non-cancellable property lease. The provision at December 31, 2007 amounted to  4. Payments made in 2007 amounted to  1.
In December 2003, the Group started a restructuring in Belgium as part of its strategic plan to improve operating efficiencies and reduce cost structures by eliminating higher-cost facilities. In 2007, the group sold a production facility in Belgium to a third party. In

connection with this sale, the Group increased its provision by  2 for severance payments. The provision at December 31, 2007 amounted to  5. This provision relates to payments for severance and related termination benefits, which will be made to former employees on a monthly basis for a period up to 15 years, depending on the employee's age.

Property, plant and equipment include the following amounts on assets leased under a finance lease:
 
 
 
Goodwill is tested for impairment at least once a year or when changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. Under the impairment test, the fair value of the cash-generating unit that contains the goodwill is compared to its book value, including the goodwill. Any excess of book value over fair value is recorded as an impairment of goodwill. This fair value of the cash-generating unit is calculated based on discounted future cash flows. The cash flow projections are based on financial budgets approved by management covering a three-year period. Cash flows beyond the three-year period are extrapolated using estimated growth rates.
Trademarks have been valued by applying a relief-from-royalty approach upon recognition and for the annual impairment test. This method assumes that if a trademark was not owned by the company, it would have to be used through a royalty agreement. For impairment testing purposes, the recoverable amount is estimated based on discounted future cash flows.
Customer relationships have been valued by the multiperiod-excess-earning method and (un)patented technology have been valued by the relief-from-royalty approach.

Based on the Group's accounting policies, the financial instruments are categorized as follows:
 
 
 
Trading derivatives are classified as a current asset or liability. The full fair value of a hedging derivative is classified as a non-current asset or liability if the remaining maturity of the hedged item is more than 12 months and as a current asset or liability if the maturity of the hedged item is less than 12 months.
(a) Interest-rate swaps
The Group has fourteen separate interest rate swap contracts. At December 31, 2007 the interest rate swap contracts had a total notional amount of  610 and  45, in total  671. All contracts were concluded with banks to hedge a portion of the Group's variable interest-rate borrowings against changes in interest rates. The Group agreed to pay interest at fixed rates. For these contracts hedge accounting is not applied.
 
SigmaKalon (BC) Holdco B.V.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
 
During the year ended December 31, 2007, the change in fair value of the interest rate swap contracts amounting to  4 negative has been recorded in the income statement.
At December 31, 2007, the fixed interest rates vary from 2.5% to 4.5%. The floating rates are Euribor and Libor.
(b) Hedges of contracted and highly probable sales transactions
During 2007, the Group entered, on top of 6 existing ones, into 25 new separate forward foreign exchange rate contracts with a bank to hedge a portion of the Korean Won ("KRW") to USD exchange rate risk arising from the future settlement of the contracted and highly probable forecasted USD denominated sales in the period January 1, 2007 September 30, 2010. During 2007, 7 of these contracts have been settled. For these contracts, hedge accounting is applied. As of December 31, 2007, the fair value of these contracts totaled  1 negative. The effective portion of the changes in the fair values of these contracts directly recognized in equity amounts to  1 negative. There was no ineffectiveness to be recorded from any transactions accounted for using hedge accounting. The amount released to sales was  0.
During 2007, the Group entered into 24 separate forward foreign exchange rate contracts with a bank to hedge a portion of the Chinese Yuan ("CNY") to USD exchange rate risk arising from the future settlement of the contracted and highly probable forecasted USD denominated sales in the period November 1, 2007- December 31, 2009. During 2007, 1 of these contracts was settled.
For these contracts, hedge accounting is applied. As of December 31, 2007, the fair value of these contracts totaled  1. The effective portion of the changes in the fair values of these contracts directly recognized in equity amounts to  1. There was no ineffectiveness to be recorded from any transactions accounted for using hedge accounting. The amount released to sales was  0.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the fair value of the derivative assets in the balance sheet. As the Group has entered into derivatives with only A or better rated financial institutions, the Group considers this risk to be immaterial.

Movements in the provision for impairment of trade receivables are as follows:
 
The creation and release of the provision for impaired receivables have been included in selling and distribution costs in the income statement (Note 23). The accretion of the discount is included in finance costs in the income statement (Note 25). Amounts are generally written off against the allowance account when there is no expectation of recovering additional cash.
The other classes within trade and other receivables do not contain impaired assets.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the outstanding balance of each class of receivable mentioned above. There is no concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables, as the Group has a large number of customers, internationally dispersed. The Group does not hold any collateral as security.
To further improve the Group's cash flow management, a Securitization program has been set up in 2006, a receivables-based financing (See Note 18).

The following assets have been pledged as collateral:
 
The Group has the following undrawn borrowing facilities:
 
The Group's credit facility provides for borrowings up to  1,297, which are collateralized by the assets of the Group. The facility consists of Term Loans A, Term Loans B, Term Loans C, Term Loans D, a working capital facility (Revolver), Securitization Facility, Mezzanine Facility and Acquisition Facility.
The credit facility expires in 2015 (Termination date) and carries a commitment fee of 0.4% to 1.25% per annum for the undrawn balance. The costs incurred to enter into the credit facility in 2005 amounted to  31. These debt issue costs are amortized over the remaining lifetime of the facility using the effective interest method.
The Group has a trade receivable securitization program under which funds are raised by pledging trade receivables from subsidiaries in the Netherlands, Belgium, the UK and France as security for short-term borrowings. Both trade receivables and borrowings related to this program are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The transactions under this program are treated as collaterized borrowings. The short-term borrowings are issued in EUR and GBP, reflecting the currency of the pledged receivables. The amount of short-term borrowings outstanding against the receivables pledged fluctuates as a result of invoices outstanding. The debt issue costs of this securitization program amounted to  1 and are amortized over the remaining lifetime of the facility using the effective interest method. The securitization program includes a number of reserves to cover any default, dilution, concentration, currency and interest risks. Furthermore, it includes three early

At December 31, 2007, the receivables collateralized under this program amounts to  216. The trade receivables related to this program are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
The usage of the respective credit facilities at balance sheet date is as follows:
 
Term Loans A and C consist of tranches denominated in EUR and GBP.
Term Loans A bear interest at Euribor and Libor plus 2.00% per annum. Term Loans A are repayable semi-annually in June and December through June 2012.
Term Loans B bear interest at Euribor plus 2.50% per annum and are repayable on Termination date.
Term Loans C bear interest at Euribor and Libor plus 3.25% per annum and are repayable on Termination date.
Term Loans D bear interest at Euribor plus 5.50% and are repayable on Termination date.
The maximum facility for the Securitization Facility amounts to  150. The Securitization Facility is secured by the Group's securitized receivables in the Netherlands, Belgium, the UK and France. In 2007, interest rates for the secured part were between 4.40% and 5.68% for the EUR denominated borrowings and between 6.00% and 7.69% for the GBP denominated borrowings.
The maximum facility for the Revolver amounts to  120. The interest amounts to Euribor plus 2.00% per annum and for the ancillary part of the Revolver to Euribor plus 2.00% per annum.
The Mezzanine Facility is repayable at maturity in December 2015. Interest amounts to Euribor plus 3.50% per annum and a Payment in Kind (PIK) margin of 6.50% per annum on the principal amount. This PIK margin is added to the principal amount and will be repayable at maturity.

The Acquisition Facility is repayable semi-annually beginning December 2008 through June 2012 and bears interest at Euribor plus 2.00% per annum. The maximum availability of the Acquisition Facility amounts to  200.
The credit facilities are subject to affirmative and negative covenants, including specific financial covenants the Group is required to maintain which are monitored by the lenders.
As a consequence of the repayment of the credit facilities on January 2, 2008 the debt issue costs are fully amortized, except for those debt issue costs related to the securitization program ( 1) (See Note 32).
Amortization of debt issue costs for the year ended December 31, 2007 amounted to  4. As of December 31, 2007, the unamortized debt issue costs totalling  22, were considered impaired and a loss on extinguishment on the debt was recorded.
The majority of the borrowings of the Group is subject to floating interest rate payments. In order to offset variations in cash flows from future floating rate interest payments the Group has entered into interest-rate swap contracts (see note 11). The interest rate swap contracts have a total notional amount of  610 and  45 as per December 31, 2007.
The exposure of the Group's borrowings to interest rate changes divided by the maturity of the Group's borrowings is as follows:
 
The fair value of the Group's (floating rate) borrowings is influenced by changes in the creditworthiness of the Group. However, no reliable estimate of the credit spread demanded by counterparties can be determined. Therefore the carrying amount is the best approximation of the fair value of the Group's borrowings.
The carrying amount of the Group's borrowings is denominated in the following currencies:

Finance lease obligations are mainly denominated in EUR and GBP.
The fair values of the Group's lease obligations approximate their carrying amount.
The maturity of finance lease obligations is as follows:
 
 
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred income taxes relate to the same fiscal authority. The offset amounts are as follows:

The movement in deferred tax assets and liabilities during the year, without taking into consideration the offsetting of balances within the same tax jurisdiction, is as follows:
 
 
Deferred income tax assets are recognized for tax loss carry forwards to the extent that the realization of the related tax benefit through the future taxable profits is probable. The Group did not recognize deferred income tax assets of  16 in respect of losses amounting to  47 that can be carried forward against future taxable income.
At December 31, 2007, the Group had approximately  93 of tax operating loss carry forwards available to offset future taxable income which generally do not expire.
 
In accordance with the laws and practices of each country, the Group participates in employee benefits plans offering retirement, death and disability, healthcare and special termination benefits. These plans provide benefits based on various factors such as length of service, salaries and contributions paid.
 
SigmaKalon (BC) Holdco B.V.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
 
The main plans are in the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and Germany. In the United Kingdom and Germany the Group has defined benefit pension plans and in the Netherlands a combination of defined contribution and defined benefit plans. In the Netherlands there is a conditional early retirement plan ("VUT") for people who are 62 years old and born before January 1, 1950. The early retirement age will gradually change from 62 to 65. The VUT is not funded.
The plan assets of the Dutch pension plan are held in a separate account with an insurance company. The plan in the United Kingdom is held by a separate Trust company in the United Kingdom and the German plan is held by the Group. The German plan is not funded. The plan assets of the plans in the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and Germany represent approximately 95% of the total plan assets and the liabilities represent approximately 88% of the employee benefit obligation. The allocation of the fair value of the plan assets is as follows:
 
The liability recognized in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of the plan assets, together with unrecognized actuarial gains or losses and past service costs. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximately to terms of related pension liability.
Cumulative actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions in excess of the greater of 10% of the value of plan assets or 10% of the defined benefit obligation are spread to income over the employees' expected average remaining working lives.
Changes in the related pension benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in the assumptions.

The movement in the liability recognized in the balance sheet is as follows:
 
The discount rate is based on high quality corporate bonds in the euro zone and in the United Kingdom with maturities equal to the average duration of the benefit obligations. The expected return on assets is determined per asset category (fixed rate and equity instruments). The expected return on fixed rate instruments is derived from actual interest rates on the balance sheet date for similar interest bearing securities. The return on equity instruments is based on the return on fixed rate instruments plus a premium, as historically the return of equity instruments exceeds that on fixed interest. The expected return on assets in 2007 increased as the market interest increased compared to 2006.

Employee benefits
According to IFRS, past service cost that arises on pension plan amendment (both positive and negative amendments) is recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested. If the benefits are already vested, past service cost is recognized as an expense immediately. Under US GAAP, the recognition of past service cost related to positive plan amendments is recognized over the remaining service lives of active employees. Past service cost related to negative plan amendments should be deferred and used first to offset previous positive past service costs. Excess, if any, should be recognized in the same manner as positive plan amendments.
Under FAS 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans', the funded status of the pension plan must be recorded in the balance sheet as of December 31, 2007. As a result of FAS 158, the unrecognized net gains and

Goodwill and intangible fixed assets
For the period from February 28, 2003 (date of inception) to December 31, 2003 the consolidated financial statements of the Group were prepared in accordance with IAS 22 Business Combinations. In accordance with the provisions of IAS 22 no customer relationship is recognized in a business combination and goodwill and trademarks are amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of 20 years. Under US GAAP, customer relationships can be recognized in a business combination and goodwill and indefinite-lived trademarks should not be amortized but tested annually for impairment.
In connection with the acquisition of the paint business of TotalFinaElf S.A. at February 28, 2003,  110 of goodwill was recognized under IFRS and  78 under US GAAP. Amortization on goodwill and trademarks for the period from February 28, 2003 to December 31, 2003 amounted to  4 and  5, respectively, under IFRS and none under US GAAP. Customer relationships recognized under US GAAP amounted to  45 (and the relating deferred tax liability to  12). Amortization of customer relationships under US GAAP for the year ended December 31, 2007 amounted to  9. As of December 31, 2007, accumulated amortization on customer relationships was  42.
For the year ended December 31, 2004, the Group early adopted IFRS 3 (issued 2004) Business Combinations. In accordance with the provisions of IFRS 3, the Group ceased to amortize goodwill and indefinite-lived trademarks from January 1, 2004 onwards.
Due to the amortization of trademarks for the period from February 28, 2003 to December 31, 2003 under IFRS, the impairment on trademarks for the year ended December 31, 2004 was  3 lower than the impairment under US GAAP.
Reversal of impairments
Under IFRS, at each reporting date an assessment should be made whether there is an indication that a previously recognized impairment loss may no longer exist or may have decreased. If there is such an indication and the recoverable amount of the impaired asset subsequently increases, the impairment loss is reversed when there has been a change in estimates used to determine the recoverable amount since the last impairment loss recognized.
Under US GAAP, reversal of previously recognized impairment losses is not allowed.
Under IFRS, previously recognized impairment losses on trademarks of  7 have been reversed.
Minority interest business combinations
Under IFRS, the minority interest in the acquired identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities is stated at net fair value.
 
SigmaKalon (BC) Holdco B.V.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
 
Under US GAAP, the minority interest in the acquired identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities is stated at the pre-acquisition carrying value.
As a result, the minority interest on the difference between the net fair value and the pre-acquisition value of the minority interest's portion of land and buildings ( 1) and trademarks ( 1) has not been recognized under US GAAP in the purchase price allocation for HCH s.r.o., Ease International Ltd and Varrossieau Suriname N.V. (Note 30). The impact of lower depreciation and amortization under US GAAP was not significant in 2007.
The effects of the above mentioned differences on the goodwill, customer relationship, trademarks and related net deferred tax balances as of December 31, 2007 are as follows:
 
Negative goodwill on acquisition of minority interests
During the year ended December 31, 2005, the Group acquired 25% of the outstanding shares in its listed Polish subsidiary, Polifarb Cieszyn Wroclaw S.A from minority shareholders. The book value of the minority interest at the time of the acquisition of the shares was  2 higher than the cash paid for the shares.
Under IFRS, this negative goodwill has been directly recognized under finance costs in the consolidated income statement.
Under US GAAP, tangible and intangible assets have been reduced on a pro-rata basis for this amount. This reduction is released to the consolidated income statement over the remaining lifetime of the reduced tangible and intangible assets.
As a result, tangible and intangible assets under US GAAP were  1 lower than under IFRS. The impact of lower depreciation and amortization under US GAAP was not significant in 2007.
Discounting of provisions
During the year ended December 31, 2006, the Group recognized under IFRS a provision for a specific claim of  5 at a discounted value. The anticipated cash outflows amount
 
SigmaKalon (BC) Holdco B.V.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
 
to  6. Under US GAAP provisions may only be discounted when the timing of the cash flows is fixed. Consequently, the provision recognized under US GAAP was  1 higher than under IFRS. The impact of change in discounting under US GAAP was not significant in 2007.
Classification of debt issue cost
Under IFRS, debt issue costs are factored into the carrying value of the borrowings. Under US GAAP, unamortized debt issue costs are reported as an asset.
Under IFRS, at December 31, 2007 unamortized debt issue costs amounted to  1 (December 31, 2006:  27).
For US GAAP purposes, the write-off of the debt issue costs can only be recognized in the period when the debt is considered extinguished. Since the debt was not extinguished as of December 31, 2007, the unamortized debt issue costs should continue to be amortized pursuant to the life assumed when the debt was initially recorded. Under US GAAP there is no loss on extinguishment on the debt untill repayment of the debt. For US GAAP, the unamortized debt issue costs amounted to  23 as of December 31, 2007.
Income taxes
The Group adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48, ("FIN 48") on January 1, 2007. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute criteria for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. As a result of the adoptation of FIN 48, the Company recognized a  6 increase in the liability for uncertain tax positions, which was accounted for as a decrease to equity on January 1, 2007.
Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes
As of December 31, 2007, the Company's liability for uncertain tax positions totalled  7. The Group believes that no settlement of certain tax uncertainties will occur within the next twelve month; accordingly, none of the unrecognized gross tax benefit is considered a current liability as December 31, 2007. The amount primarily represents unrecognized tax benefits comprised of items related to assessed income tax audits, as well as settlement negotiations currently in progress.
The Group's major income tax jurisdictions are the Netherlands, France and UK. For all these countries income tax, the Group remains subject to examination for 2004 and subsequent years.
The Group's continuing practice is to recognize penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. As of December 31, 2007 and January 1, 2007, no penalties have been accrued.
 
SigmaKalon (BC) Holdco B.V.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
 
Under IFRS, uncertain tax positions are recognized using the best estimate of the tax amount expected to be paid by the Group. As of December 31, 2007, the uncertain tax position amounted to  0.
Mandatory Redeemable Preferred Stock
The Group's parent company has issued convertible preferred equity certificates ("CPECs)" with a par value of  108.80.
Dividends
Holders of CPECs are entitled to receive cumulative dividends when and if declared by the Manager, prior and in preference to any declaration or payment of any dividends on the common stock, at the rate of 5.903% per annum of the sum of such CPECs par value plus any accrued and unpaid dividends thereon.
Redemption
The Group's controlling interest can cause the Group's parent company to redeem any or all CPECs prior to the mandatory redemption date by paying an amount equal to or greater of the par value for such holder's outstanding CPECs, plus any accrued and unpaid dividends, or the fair value (as determined by the Manager) of the Class A Ordinary Shares into which CPECs are convertible.
The early redemption feature based on the fair value of the Class A Ordinary Shares is an embedded derivative requiring separate accounting. The increase in fair value of  484 was recorded as finance costs in the income statement of the Group's parent company. The fair value of the derivative at December 31, 2007 is  825 which is also reflected in the Group's parent company financial statements.
The fair value of the early redemption feature is dependent upon the fair value of the Group. Had the Group's controlling interest caused an early redemption, the Group may have been required to obtain outside financing to satisfy the obligation of its parent. Upon acquisition of the Group by PPG Industries, Inc. on January 2, 2008, the CPECs were settled.
Classification differences between US GAAP and IFRS
Classification of minority interest
Under IFRS, minority interest is presented within total equity on the balance sheet and within profit and loss on the income statement. Under US GAAP, it is presented as a separate item on the balance sheet outside of equity and excluded from income within the income statement.
 
SigmaKalon (BC) Holdco B.V.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
 
Classification of current deferred tax assets
Under IFRS, all deferred tax assets are classified as non-current in the balance sheet. Under US GAAP, certain deferred tax assets that are expected to be recovered within 12 months would be separately stated in the balance sheet under current assets.
Deferred tax assets expected to be recovered within 12 months as per December 31, 2007 amounted to  30.

The unaudited condensed combined pro forma balance sheet is presented to give effect to the acquisition of SigmaKalon as if it had occurred on December 31, 2007. This pro forma information is based on, and should be read in conjunction with, the historical financial statements of PPG for the year ended December 31, 2007, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on February 21, 2008, and the historical financial statements of SigmaKalon for the year ended December 31, 2007, which are included elsewhere in this Form 8-K/A. We have not adjusted the historical financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2007 of either PPG or SigmaKalon for any costs recognized during the year that may be considered to be nonrecurring.
The unaudited condensed combined pro forma statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2007, combines information from the audited historical consolidated statement of income of PPG for the year ended December 31, 2007, and the U.S. GAAP historical consolidated income statement information of SigmaKalon for the year ended December 31, 2007. The unaudited condensed combined pro forma balance sheet combines information from the audited historical consolidated balance sheet of PPG as of December 31, 2007 and U.S. GAAP historical consolidated balance sheet information of SigmaKalon as of December 31, 2007.
The historical U.S. GAAP SigmaKalon balance sheet information included in the unaudited condensed combined pro forma financial statements was derived from SigmaKalon's audited balance sheet as of December 31, 2007 prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, as adopted by the European Union ("IFRS"). The historical balance sheet information was converted to U.S. GAAP and translated into U.S. dollars using an exchange rate of 1 = U.S. $1.460. Certain amounts in the SigmaKalon historical balance sheet information were reclassified to be consistent with PPG's balance sheet presentation. The historical U.S. GAAP SigmaKalon consolidated income statement information included in the unaudited condensed combined pro forma financial statements was derived from SigmaKalon's audited consolidated income statement for the year ended December 31, 2007, prepared in accordance with IFRS. The historical income statement information was converted to U.S. GAAP and translated into U.S. dollars using an exchange rate of 1 = U.S. $1.375. Certain amounts in the SigmaKalon historical income statement information were reclassified to be consistent with PPG's income statement presentation. Reconciliations of equity as of December 31, 2007 and net income for the year ended December 31, 2007 between IFRS and U.S. GAAP in euros are included in a note to the SigmaKalon historical financial statements included elsewhere in this Current Report on Form 8-K/A.
 
The allocation of the preliminary purchase price as reflected in these condensed combined pro forma financial statements has been based upon preliminary estimates of the total purchase paid to Bain Capital by PPG and preliminary estimates of the fair value of the SigmaKalon assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of the acquisition. Management is currently assessing the fair values of in-process research and development, tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed. This preliminary allocation of the purchase price is dependent upon certain estimates and assumptions including but not limited to determining the timing and estimated costs to complete the in-process research and development projects, estimating future cash flows, and developing appropriate discount rates. The fair value estimates for the purchase price allocation are preliminary and have been made solely for the purpose of developing such pro forma condensed combined financial statements.
A final determination of the fair value of the SigmaKalon in-process research and development and tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed will be based on valuations of the actual net tangible and intangible assets of SigmaKalon and on-going research and development projects that existed as of the date of the acquisition, and such valuations could change significantly upon the completion of further analyses and asset valuations from those used in the unaudited condensed combined pro forma financial statements presented below. The final valuation is expected to be completed as soon as practicable but no later than December 31, 2008.
The unaudited condensed combined pro forma financial statements were prepared using the assumptions described below and in the related notes. The historical financial information has been adjusted to give effect to pro forma events that are 1) directly attributable to the acquisition, 2) factually supportable, and 3) with respect to the statement of income, expected to have a continuing impact on the combined results. The unaudited condensed combined pro forma financial statements do not include liabilities resulting from acquisition planning, nor do they include certain cost savings or operating synergies (or costs associated with realizing such savings or synergies) that may result from the acquisition. Amounts preliminarily allocated to goodwill may significantly increase or decrease and amounts allocated to intangible assets with finite lives may increase or decrease significantly, which could result in a material increase or decrease in amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets from that which is estimated in these unaudited condensed combined pro forma financial statements. Therefore, the actual amounts recorded may differ materially from the information presented in the accompanying unaudited condensed combined pro forma financial statements.
The unaudited condensed combined pro forma financial statements are provided for illustrative purposes only. They do not purport to represent what PPG's consolidated results of operations and financial position would have been had the transaction actually occurred as of the dates indicated, and they do not purport to project PPG's future consolidated results of operations or financial position.

1. Basis of Presentation
These unaudited condensed combined pro forma financial statements reflect a preliminary allocation of the purchase price as if the transaction had been completed on January 1, 2007. The preliminary allocations are subject to change based on finalization of the fair values of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed. A purchase price of $1,673 million was paid to the seller and was allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed as follows:
 
 
 
The useful lives for acquired customer relationships, technology and trade names are estimated to be 17 years, 9 years and 13 years, respectively. The estimated useful lives will ultimately be based on finalization of valuation results.
 
Note 2. Pro Forma Adjustments
Statement of Income
(a) Represents the estimated incremental impact on depreciation expense related to acquired tangible assets of SigmaKalon.
(b) Represents the incremental impact on earnings for interest costs on $1,673 million of borrowings incurred to acquire SigmaKalon. An interest rate of 5.36% was assumed. The adjustment for incremental interest costs would have been $2 million higher had the assumed interest rate been 5.49%, and it would have been $4 million higher had the assumed interest rate been 5.61%.
(c) Represents the estimated incremental impact on amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets of SigmaKalon. A change of $50 million to intangible assets will affect net income by $2 million.
(d) Represents the tax effect on the pro forma earnings adjustments. The U.S. tax rate of 39% was applied to the incremental interest costs and a tax rate of 30%, estimating European statutory tax rates, was applied to the adjustments for amortization and depreciation.
