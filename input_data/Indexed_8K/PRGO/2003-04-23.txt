Item 7(c). Exhibits Exhibit 99 Press Release for Third Quarter Fiscal 2003 Earnings
ITEM 9. Regulation FD Disclosure This information is being provided under Item 12, Disclosure of Results of Operations and Financial Condition. On April 23, 2003, the Perrigo Company released earnings for third quarter fiscal 2003. The earnings release contains a non-GAAP measure which is defined as a financial measure of the Company's performance that excludes or includes amounts thereby differentiating it from the most directly comparable measure presented in the financial statements that are calculated and presented in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the Company has provided a reconciliation within its earnings release to the most directly comparable GAAP measure for this non-GAAP measure. The Company excludes unusual litigation income when monitoring and evaluating the on-going financial results and trends of its business due to its non-recurring nature. The Company believes this information is also useful for investors since excluding this non-recurring item provides important insight into the Company's ongoing operations. The press release related to Perrigo's earnings is attached as Exhibit 99.
SIGNATURES Pursuant to the requirement of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

EXHIBIT 99 [PERRIGO LOGO] NEWS RELEASE FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE FOR RELEASE: Ernest J. Schenk, Manager, Investor Relations and Communication (269) 673-9212 CONTACT: E-mail: eschenk@perrigo.com PERRIGO COMPANY REPORTS THIRD QUARTER FISCAL 2003 EARNINGS OF $0.20 PER SHARE ALLEGAN, Michigan -- April 23, 2003 -- The Perrigo Company (Nasdaq: PRGO) today announced results for the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2003 ended March 29, 2003. Perrigo Company (Nasdaq: PRGO) (in thousands, except per share amounts) Net sales for the third quarter were $202.6 million, an increase of two percent compared with $198.5 million last year. Net income was $14.1 million, or $0.20 per share, compared with net income of $17.9 million, or $0.24 per share a year ago, which included income from the settlement of a lawsuit of $5.0 million after-tax, or $0.07 per share. Without the lawsuit settlement, earnings on an operating basis were $12.9 million, or $0.17 per share, last year. Commenting on the third quarter, David T. Gibbons, Perrigo President and Chief Executive Officer, said, "We delivered excellent results this quarter. Our improved operational efficiency and rising productivity were significant contributors to higher gross profits. Higher-than-anticipated sales volume and good product mix also helped profits. Lastly, we benefited from good expense control and improved results at our Mexican operation. Cash flow from operations was $45 million during the quarter and stands at $82 million year-to-date. We continue to be virtually debt-free and remain in a very strong financial position." Net sales for the nine months ended March 29, 2003, were $643.4 million compared with $644.3 million a year ago. Net income for the nine months improved to $49.7 million, or $0.70 per share, from $44.9 million, or $0.60 per share for last year. Excluding proceeds from a lawsuit settlement in the first quarter this year of $2.0 million after-tax, or $0.03 per share, and income from the settlement of a lawsuit last year of $5.0 million after-tax, or $0.07 per share, net income on an operating basis increased 20 percent to $47.7 million, or $0.67 per share, from $39.9 million, or 515 Eastern Ave. Allegan, Michigan 49010 (269) 673-8451
$0.53 per share, for the prior year. Commenting further, Mr. Gibbons stated, "Over the past few quarters, our earnings have been driven by operational benefits, specifically, improved operating efficiencies and supply chain management. We have been making good progress, not driven by any single initiative, but from contributions across many functional areas. I am very proud of our employees' combined efforts, and I'm pleased that we continue to outpace our own goals. We feel very good about our operational momentum, and look forward to the upcoming launch of store brand equivalents to the branded allergy medication Claritin(R). "In line with our historical seasonal pattern, we anticipate sequentially lower fourth-quarter sales and margins and expect earnings of $0.04 to $0.05 per share. With year-to-date results of $0.70 per share, we now project earnings of $0.74 to $0.75 for the full year, compared with $0.60 per share for fiscal 2003, restated for expensing of stock options." The Company noted that, effective with the fiscal second quarter ended December 28, 2002, it elected to expense stock option compensation. All prior periods have been restated to reflect the compensation cost that would have been recognized had the stock option expense been applied to all awards granted after July 1, 1995. Please refer to the restated results in the summary table at the end of this announcement.
