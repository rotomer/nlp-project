Item 7(c). Exhibits Exhibit 99 Press Release: "PERRIGO COMPANY REPORTS FISCAL 2003 EARNINGS OF $0.76 PER SHARE"
ITEM 12. Disclosure of Results of Operations and Financial Condition On August 11, 2003, the Perrigo Company released earnings for fourth quarter and year end for fiscal 2003. The earnings release contains a non-GAAP measure which is defined as a financial measure of the Company's performance that excludes or includes amounts thereby differentiating it from the most directly comparable measure presented in the financial statements that are calculated and presented in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the Company has provided a reconciliation within its earnings release to the most directly comparable GAAP measure for this non-GAAP measure. The Company excludes unusual litigation income and restructuring and impairment charges related to the Mexico operations when monitoring and evaluating the on-going financial results and trends of its business due to the non-recurring nature of this item. The Company believes this information is also useful for investors since excluding these non-recurring items provide important insight into the Company's ongoing operations. The press release related to Perrigo's earnings is attached as Exhibit 99.
SIGNATURES Pursuant to the requirement of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized. PERRIGO COMPANY (Registrant) By: /s/ Douglas R. Schrank ---------------------------------- Dated: August 11, 2003 Douglas R.

Exhibit Index Exhibit 99 - Press Release issued by Perrigo Company on August 11, 2003.

Exhibit 99 Perrigo Company (Nasdaq: PRGO) (in thousands, except per share amounts) Fourth Quarter Year-To-Date 2003 2002 2003 2002 Sales $182,635 $182,021 $825,987 $826,322 Net Income $4,324 $(71) $54,048 $44,790 Diluted EPS $0.06 - $0.76 $0.60 Diluted Shares 71,439 72,307 71,158 74,606 Fiscal Year 2003 Sales for the twelve months ended June 28, 2003 were $826.0 million compared with $826.3 million in fiscal 2002. Net income increased 21 percent to $54.0 million, or $0.76 per share, from $44.8 million or $0.60 per share last year. On an operating basis, excluding certain items in both years, net income was $52.0 million, or $0.73 per share in fiscal 2003, an increase in net income of 20 percent, compared with net income of $43.6 million, or $0.58 per share, for the prior year. Reported net income in fiscal 2003 included after-tax income of $2.0 million, or $0.03 per share, from a vitamin litigation settlement. Reported net income in fiscal 2002 included after-tax income of $17.9 million, or $0.24 per share, from vitamin litigation and an after-tax charge of $16.6 million, or $0.22 per share, related to a restructuring of operations in Mexico. Chief Executive Officer, David T. Gibbons, commented, "We are very pleased to report strong fiscal 2003 results which reflect Perrigo's progress in strengthening its fundamentals. Earnings were up more than 20 percent as we continue to realize the payback from the investments made in our quality processes and manufacturing operations over the past two years. Our increased operational efficiencies along with business simplification and expense control initiatives were key factors in the significant gain in gross profits and net earnings." Mr. Gibbons continued, "We generated $80 million in cash from operations and stayed virtually debt-free, keeping us in a very strong financial position. This strong and predictable cash generation enabled us to repurchase 3.3 million shares during the year and allowed us to begin paying a cash dividend for the first time. In June, we began shipping the store brand version of Claritin-D(R) 24 Hour and look forward to providing additional store brand equivalents of this leading allergy relief product during fiscal 2004." Fiscal 2003 Fourth Quarter For the fourth quarter, sales were $182.6 million, a slight increase over sales of $182.0 million a year ago. Net income was $4.3 million, or $0.06 per share, compared with breakeven last year. On an operating basis, excluding certain items last year, net income was $3.7 million, or $0.05 per share. Reported net income included after-tax income of $12.9 million, or $0.17 per share, from vitamin litigation settlements and a charge of $16.6 million after-tax, or $0.22 per share, related to the restructuring of operations in Mexico. Fiscal Year 2004 Outlook Mr. Gibbons stated, "While we deliberately gave up some volume in fiscal 2003 to improve profits, as we look out to 2004 we see the opportunity for top-line growth. Our core over-the-counter (OTC) pharmaceutical and nutritional businesses remain strong, and with our new initiatives for growth we anticipate an increase in revenues of approximately three to five percent. "In 2004, we will continue to build on our consumer pharmaceutical foundation as a focus for future growth. We are committed to continuing to enhance our mission of providing affordable consumer healthcare options. We now have the quality, R&D and manufacturing resources to expand our pharmaceutical business. Our strong financial position allows us to invest $5 to $7 million toward this initiative in 2004, primarily in increased R&D for the development of generic prescription drug products. Because of the anticipated eight to ten percent earnings growth and strong cash flow in our core business, we expect 2004 earnings to be at or slightly above current levels, despite this investment for our long-term growth. We see generic prescription drugs as a natural progression that will enhance our already strong position in the OTC pharmaceutical market and will provide substantial new growth. "Implementing this new strategic direction requires a realignment of internal resources and our senior management structure. Effective immediately, John Hendrickson, Executive Vice President, Operations, will become Executive Vice President and General Manager, Perrigo Consumer Healthcare. In his new role, John will have responsibility for all functional operations within our OTC pharmaceutical and nutritional businesses. He has led our pursuit of operational excellence and has played a major role in Perrigo's strong results over the past few years. "Mark Olesnavage, Executive Vice President, Sales, Marketing and Scientific Affairs, will become Executive Vice President and General Manager, Perrigo Pharmaceuticals. In this role, Mark will be responsible for the planning, development and execution of the launch and growth of our generic Rx drug efforts. He has an extensive background in marketing, operations and business development in 22 years with Perrigo and has worked extensively with our customers to bring them a wide range of product and service solutions to consumer healthcare. He also has been an active member of the Generic Pharmaceutical Industry Association Board over the last ten years. Both John and Mark will report directly to me." With the fiscal second quarter ended December 28, 2002, Perrigo began expensing stock option compensation. All prior periods have been adjusted to reflect the compensation cost that would have been recognized had the stock option expense been applied to all awards granted after July 1, 1995.
