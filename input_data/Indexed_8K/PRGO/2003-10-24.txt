Exhibit 99.1 Perrigo Company Reports First Quarter Fiscal 2004 Earnings of $0.23 Per Share ALLEGAN, Mich., Oct. 24 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- The Perrigo Company (Nasdaq: PRGO) today announced results for the first quarter of fiscal 2004 ended September 27, 2003. Perrigo Company (Nasdaq: PRGO) (In thousands, except per share amounts) Fiscal 2004 Fiscal 2003 1st Quarter Ended 1st Quarter Ended 9/27/03 9/28/02 Sales $209,805 $213,215 Net Income $16,508 $18,778 Diluted EPS $0.23 $0.26 Diluted Shares 71,809 71,745 Net sales for fiscal 2004's first quarter were $209.8 million, a decrease of two percent from $213.2 million last year. Net income was $16.5 million, or $0.23 per share, compared with $18.8 million, or $0.26 per share, a year ago. Earnings from operations last year were $16.8 million, or $0.23 per share, excluding a lawsuit settlement in the first quarter which added $2.0 million after-tax, or $0.03 per share. Commenting on first quarter results, David T. Gibbons, Perrigo Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, "Sales in the first quarter were disappointing, largely the result of weakness in the cough/cold category, where we did not experience the anticipated seasonal shipments of products that address cough, cold and flu indications. This reflects our retail partners' commitment to lean inventories and their confidence in our customer service capabilities. The lack of inventory building at retail was also reflected in lower gross margins, as we did not have the level of production throughput that we anticipated. At this early stage of the cough and cold season, we still believe we can achieve revenue growth of three to five percent for the full year. "The Company continues its strong performance in generating cash, controlling inventories and managing the business. Customer service continues at historic high levels despite our inventories being down. During the quarter, we benefited from strong sales in two new products. Following its June launch, our loratadine tablet product, comparable to the national brand Claritin-D(R) 24 Hour, continued to sell well. In the nutritional segment we were pleased with the sell-in of our new branded diet aid product, Dr. Steven Rosenblatt's Starch Blocker. "Research and development expense was up only slightly as outlays for the internal development of generic prescription drug products were not yet material," said Gibbons. "During the quarter, we agreed to provide funding to a contract research and development firm for the development of 10 to 12 generic drugs over the next two years. We are excited about this step in building a generic prescription drug product portfolio." Perrigo will host a conference call to discuss first quarter fiscal 2004 results at 11:00 a.m. (ET) today.
