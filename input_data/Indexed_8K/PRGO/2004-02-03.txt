ITEM 12. Disclosure of Results of Operations and Financial Condition On February 3, 2004, the Perrigo Company released earnings for the second quarter of fiscal 2004. The earnings release contains a non-GAAP measure which is defined as a financial measure of the Company's performance that excludes or includes amounts thereby differentiating it from the most directly comparable measure presented in the financial statements that are calculated and presented in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the Company has provided a reconciliation within its earnings release to the most directly comparable GAAP measure for this non-GAAP measure. The Company excludes unusual litigation income and a one-time tax benefit when monitoring and evaluating the on-going financial results and trends of its business due to the non-recurring nature of these items. The Company believes this information is also useful for investors since excluding these non-recurring items provides important insight into the Company's ongoing operations. The press release related to Perrigo's earnings is attached as Exhibit 99. The information in this Report is being furnished and shall not be deemed "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that Section. The information in this Report shall not be deemed incorporated by reference into any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.

Exhibit 99 Perrigo Company Reports Record Second Quarter Fiscal 2004 Results ALLEGAN, Mich., Feb. 3 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- The Perrigo Company (Nasdaq: PRGO) today announced record results for the second quarter and six months ended Dec. 27, 2003. Perrigo Company (in thousands, except per share amounts) Second Quarter Year-To-Date 2004 2003 2004 2003 Sales $245,094 $227,521 $454,899 $440,736 Net Income $38,235 $16,814 $54,743 $35,592 Diluted Shares 71,500 70,394 71,568 71,003 Diluted EPS $0.53 $0.24 $0.76 $0.50 Second Quarter Results Net sales for the second quarter were $245.1 million, compared with $227.5 million last year, an increase of eight percent. Net income increased to $38.2 million, or $0.53 per share, compared with $16.8 million, or $0.24 per share, a year ago. The current quarter results include a one-time income tax benefit of $13.1 million, or $0.18 per share, resulting from the conclusion of a routine Federal tax examination of tax years 1998, 1999 and 2000. Excluding this one-time benefit, net income was a record $25.1 million, or $0.35 per share, an increase of 49 percent, compared with last year. Commenting on results from operations for the second quarter, David T. Gibbons, Perrigo Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, "We are pleased with the excellent results delivered this quarter. Sales volume was stronger than anticipated due to new product sales and the early onset and widespread nature of influenza this year, which resulted in increased sales of cough/cold and analgesic products. "Perrigo continues to make good progress in improving operational efficiencies. The volume growth in the second quarter demonstrates how our focus on lower costs and increased productivity gives us strong operating leverage, resulting in a 49 percent increase in net income from operations this quarter. These same strategies were key contributors to the increase in year-to-date operating cash flow to $60 million, a 58 percent increase compared with $38 million last year." Six Months Results Net sales for the six months ended Dec. 27, 2003 were $454.9 million, an increase of three percent, compared with $440.7 million last year. Net income for the six months was $54.7 million, or $0.76 per share, compared with $35.6 million, or $0.50 per share, last year. Excluding the tax benefit of $13.1 million, or $0.18 per share, in the current year and a favorable lawsuit settlement of $2 million after-tax, or $0.03 per share, last year, net income was $41.6 million, or $0.58 per share, compared with $33.6 million, or $0.47 per share, a year ago. Outlook Commenting on the outlook for the balance of fiscal 2004, Mr. Gibbons said, "While the pattern of reported incidences of cough, cold and flu indicates the peak for this season has passed, we believe the second quarter earnings gain will be largely incremental to the full year. As a result, we now anticipate earnings for fiscal 2004 of $0.80 to $0.83 per share, before the one-time income tax benefit of $0.18 per share. Including the tax benefit, we expect earnings to range from $0.98 to $1.01 per share." Peter Black Acquisition The Company announced the acquisition of Peter Black Pharmaceuticals, Ltd., for $13.4 million in cash on Dec. 12, 2003. Peter Black is the largest manufacturer of store brand vitamin and nutritional supplement products for grocery stores, pharmacies and contract customers in the United Kingdom.
