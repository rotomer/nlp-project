ITEM 12. Disclosure of Results of Operations and Financial Condition On April 23, 2004, the Perrigo Company released earnings for the third quarter of fiscal 2004. The earnings release contains a non-GAAP measure which is defined as a financial measure of the Company's performance that excludes or includes amounts thereby differentiating it from the most directly comparable measure presented in the financial statements that are calculated and presented in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the Company has provided a reconciliation within its earnings release to the most directly comparable GAAP measure for this non-GAAP measure. The Company excludes unusual litigation income and a one-time tax benefit when monitoring and evaluating the on-going financial results and trends of its business due to the non-recurring nature of these items. The Company believes this information is also useful for investors since excluding these non-recurring items provides important insight into the Company's ongoing operations. The press release related to Perrigo's earnings is attached as Exhibit 99. The information in this Report is being furnished and shall not be deemed "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that Section.

Exhibit 99 Perrigo Company Reports Third Quarter Fiscal 2004 Earnings Revenues Increase 14 Percent; Net Income Increases 26 Percent To $17.7 Million ALLEGAN, Mich., April 23 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- The Perrigo Company (Nasdaq: PRGO) today announced results for the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2004 ended March 27, 2004. Perrigo Company (in thousands, except per share amounts) Third Quarter Year-To-Date 2004 2003 2004 2003 Sales $230,740 $202,616 $685,639 $643,352 Net Income $17,739 $14,132 $72,482 $49,724 Diluted Shares 72,598 70,601 72,035 70,967 Diluted EPS $0.24 $0.20 $1.01 $0.70 Net sales for the third quarter were $230.7 million, compared with $202.6 million last year, an increase of 14 percent. Net income was $17.7 million, or $0.24 per share, compared with net income of $14.1 million, or $0.20 per share, a year ago. Commenting on third quarter results, Perrigo Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, David T. Gibbons, said, "Our third quarter results were driven by strong growth in revenues, coming primarily from new products launched earlier in the year, new products shipping in the current period, and revenue from Peter Black Pharmaceuticals, a United Kingdom-based nutritional business acquired in December 2003. In the quarter, we recorded strong sales of loratadine D24, the store brand equivalent to Claritin-D(R) 24; had strong initial shipments of loratadine syrup and loratadine quick dissolve tablets; and experienced growth in the vitamin category. "We are pleased with the excellent results for the quarter and the past nine months. Sales volume to date has exceeded expectations as new products have been well received and we were able to refill the cough and cold product pipeline following December's unusually high peak in demand. The incremental volume has translated into greater leverage with operating income improving by 15 percent to $90.6 million from $78.6 million last year. Both sales and profit growth contributed to operating cash flow to date of $104 million up 27 percent from $82 million last year." Net sales for the nine months ended March 27, 2004 were $685.6 million, an increase of seven percent, compared with $643.4 million last year. Net income for the nine months was $72.5 million, or $1.01 per share, compared with $49.7 million, or $0.70 per share, last year. Excluding a tax benefit of $13.1 million, or $0.18 per share, in the current year and a favorable lawsuit settlement of $2 million after-tax, or $0.03 per share, last year, net income was $59.4 million, or $0.83 per share, compared with $47.7 million, or $0.67 per share, a year ago. In the third quarter, the Company received final approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for three new products granted through the FDA's Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) process. 1. Ibuprofen Chewable Tablets - In January 2004, the FDA determined that Ibuprofen Chewable Tablets, 50 mg and 100 mg, produced by Perrigo, are bioequivalent to Children's Motrin(R) Tablets, 50 mg, and Junior Strength Motrin(R) Tablets, 100 mg, marketed by McNeil Consumer Products Company. With this approval, Perrigo is eligible for 180 days of market exclusivity. Annual retail sales for the branded products are approximately $21 million. 2. Naproxen Sodium/Pseudoephedrine Tablets - In March 2004, the FDA determined that Naproxen Sodium and Pseudoephedrine Hydrocholoride Extended- release Tablets, 200 mg/120 mg, produced by Perrigo, are bioequivalent to Aleve(R) Cold and Sinus Extended-release Tablets, 200 mg/120 mg, marketed by Bayer Healthcare, LLC. Annual retail sales for the branded product exceed $20 million. 3. Miconazole Nitrate Cream - In March 2004, the FDA determined that Miconazole Nitrate Cream USP, 4%/2% Combination Pack, produced by Perrigo, is bioequivalent to Monistat(R) 3 Combination Pack, marketed by McNeil Personal Products Company. Annual retail sales for the branded product are approximately $18 million. Over the past seven months, seven approvals have been granted to the Company and its alliance partners for ANDA products. Annual retail sales for the equivalent national brand products currently exceed $220 million. Commenting on the outlook for the fourth quarter and full year, Mr. Gibbons stated, "Consistent with historical seasonality, we expect sequentially lower fourth quarter sales and profits and expect earnings to range from $0.07 to $0.09 per share. With year-to-date earnings of $1.01 per share, including an income tax benefit of $0.18 per share, we now expect earnings of $1.08 to $1.10 for the full year, compared with $0.76 per share for fiscal 2003, an increase of more than 40 percent.
