ITEM 12. Disclosure of Results of Operations and Financial Condition On August 10, 2004, the Perrigo Company released earnings for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2004. The earnings release contains a non-GAAP measure which is defined as a financial measure of the Company's performance that excludes or includes amounts thereby differentiating it from the most directly comparable measure presented in the financial statements that are calculated and presented in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the Company has provided a reconciliation within its earnings release to the most directly comparable GAAP measure for this non-GAAP measure. The Company excludes unusual litigation income, a one-time tax benefit and an FTC related charge when monitoring and evaluating the on-going financial results and trends of its business due to the non-recurring nature of these items. The Company believes this information is also useful for investors since excluding these non-recurring items provides important insight into the Company's ongoing operations. The press release related to Perrigo's earnings is attached as Exhibit 99. The information in this Report is being furnished and shall not be deemed "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that Section. The information in this Report shall not be deemed incorporated by reference into any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.

Exhibit 99 Perrigo Company Reports Fiscal Year 2004 Earnings of $1.11 Per Share ALLEGAN, Mich., Aug. 10 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- The Perrigo Company (Nasdaq: PRGO) today announced results for the full year and fourth quarter ended June 26, 2004. Perrigo Company (in thousands, except per share amounts) Fourth Quarter Year-To-Date 2004 2003 2004 2003 Sales $206,125 $184,403 $898,204 $834,100 Net Income $8,085 $4,324 $80,567 $54,048 Diluted EPS $0.11 $0.06 $1.11 $0.76 Diluted Shares 73,277 71,439 72,289 71,158 Fiscal Year 2004 Sales for the twelve months ended June 26, 2004 were $898.2 million, compared with $834.1 million last year, an increase of eight percent. Net income increased 49 percent to a record $80.6 million, or $1.11 per share, from $54.0 million, or $0.76 per share a year ago. On an operating basis, excluding a tax benefit of $13.1 million, or $0.18 per share, and an after-tax charge of $3.4 million, or $0.05 per share, related to an FTC investigation, net income was $70.9 million, or $0.98 per share. This is an increase in net income of 36 percent, compared with net income of $52.0 million, or $0.73 per share, for the prior year. The results for the prior year on an operating basis exclude the benefit of a favorable vitamin litigation settlement of $2 million after-tax, or $0.03 per share. Commenting on the results, Perrigo Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, David T. Gibbons, said, "We are very pleased to report record earnings in fiscal 2004, which were the result of good revenue growth and continued operational excellence. In 2004, we received seven FDA new product approvals and launched a broad range of products including national brand equivalents, Rx-to-OTC switches and innovative brand name nutritional offerings. The loratadine family of OTC allergy/sinus medications, in particular, were a key contributor to the overall revenue increase. Growth also resulted from our December 2003 acquisition of Peter Black Pharmaceuticals, a United Kingdom-based nutritional business. "Sales and earnings growth were significant factors in the strong cash flow from operations of $119 million, up 49 percent from $80 million last year. This strong cash flow allowed us to increase our quarterly dividend, invest in our new generic drug business, acquire the Peter Black operation, fund $28 million in capital projects and end the year with $171 million in cash and investment securities on the balance sheet," said Mr. Gibbons. Fiscal Fourth Quarter For the fourth quarter, sales were $206.1 million, an increase of 12 percent, compared with $184.4 million last year. Net income was $8.1 million, or $0.11 per share, compared with $4.3 million, or $0.06 per share a year ago. Subsequent to the fiscal year-end, the Company announced it is negotiating a settlement with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in order to close the FTC's investigation into a 1998 agreement with Perrigo and New Jersey-based Alpharma Inc. The Company recorded a $4.75 million charge, $3.4 million after-tax, or $0.05 per share, which is expected to resolve all claims by the FTC and state governments. On an operating basis, excluding the FTC charge, net income was $11.5 million, or $0.16 per share, in the fourth quarter. "In addition to incremental revenues from Peter Black and new products, fourth quarter results benefited from increased production levels. The higher production reflects the decision to build inventories earlier in order to improve service levels through the peak demand of the next cough, cold season," noted Gibbons. Other Developments On June 10, the Company announced that it had no present intention to exercise its option to acquire a controlling interest in Lannett Company, a manufacturer of generic pharmaceuticals. The option was allowed to expire on August 6. On July 15, the Company entered into a purchase agreement to acquire certain assets of APG, Inc., an Elkhart, Indiana-based contract manufacturer of aerosol products. The purchased assets include inventories, receivables and formulations for anti-fungal foot products. The transaction is expected to close on or before September 1, and is expected to add approximately $4 million in sales in fiscal 2005. Fiscal Year 2005 Commenting on the outlook for the year ahead, Mr. Gibbons said, "We look forward to continued growth in our core businesses and further development of our start-up generic prescription drug business in fiscal 2005. Perrigo Consumer Healthcare continues to successfully focus on the fundamentals of quality, service and operational excellence, while supporting the launch and marketing of important new products. With this strong domestic business and improved prospects for our U.K. and Mexico operations, we anticipate an increase in revenues of four to five percent. "We remain committed to growing the Perrigo Pharmaceutical business through internal development or an appropriate acquisition. To develop a pipeline of prescription generic drug products, we will utilize our strong financial position to invest between $10 and $12 million in 2005, up from $5 million in 2004, primarily in R&D. Concurrent with internal development, we will continue to seek potential acquisition candidates which could accelerate our market entry. On a consolidated basis, we expect earnings growth of three to five percent, despite the increased investment in the pharmaceutical business."
