Exhibit 99 Perrigo Company Reports First Quarter Fiscal 2005 Earnings of $0.24 Per Share ALLEGAN, Mich., Oct. 26 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- The Perrigo Company (Nasdaq: PRGO) today announced results for the first quarter of fiscal 2005 ended Sept. 25, 2004. Perrigo Company (In thousands, except per share amounts) Fiscal 2005 Fiscal 2004 1st Quarter Ended 1st Quarter Ended 9/25/04 9/27/03 Sales $227,719 $211,839 Net Income $17,578 $16,508 Diluted EPS $0.24 $0.23 Diluted Shares 73,043 71,809 Net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2005 were $227.7 million, an increase of eight percent from $211.8 million last year. Net income was $17.6 million, or $0.24 per share, compared with $16.5 million, or $0.23 per share, a year ago. David T. Gibbons, Perrigo Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, "We are pleased with our consolidated first quarter results and the good start to fiscal 2005. The increase in earnings is attributable to the strong performance of the U.S.-based Consumer Healthcare segment, which experienced volume growth in the allergy, cough/cold and vitamin categories and good control of expenses." Consumer Healthcare Consumer Healthcare net sales increased four percent to $199.5 million, compared with $192.8 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2004. The increase was due to the strong sales of the loratadine family of allergy medications, the sell-in of cough/cold products and higher unit sales of vitamins. Operating income increased 12 percent, or $2.9 million, to $27.8 million, compared with $24.9 million last year. Mr. Gibbons stated, "Our Consumer Healthcare business again demonstrated excellent operating leverage. Sales increased four percent, gross margin increased seven percent and operating income was up 12 percent. Our purchasing initiatives and manufacturing productivity projects are paying off." Pharmaceuticals The Pharmaceuticals segment recorded operating expenses of $1.3 million, compared with $0.3 million a year ago as the Company continued to fund its start-up generic prescription drug business. United Kingdom First quarter net sales of the United Kingdom Operations increased $10.6 million to $23.2 million. The December 2003 acquisition of Peter Black Pharmaceuticals accounted for approximately $9 million of the increase and currency fluctuations accounted for approximately $2 million. Operating income declined from $0.4 million last year to $0.2 million this year. The implementation of the merger integration plan for the Wrafton and Peter Black businesses continues to reduce the United Kingdom breakeven operating level. The turnaround will be evident in improved operating income over the last three quarters of fiscal 2005. Mexico The Mexico Operations experienced a sales decline of $1.5 million, compared with the first quarter last year, due to lower volume of government and distributor sales. The disappointing sales led to a loss for the quarter. The business is making good progress in changing its business model, with retail store brand sales growing 30 percent in the quarter, and now representing one-third of total sales. New Product Approvals On Oct. 5, the Company announced it had received final approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for over-the-counter Nicotine Gum and prescription Ibuprofen Oral Suspension, granted through the FDA's Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) process. Mr. Gibbons noted, "While ibuprofen suspension is a relatively small product, it is significant in that it is our first generic prescription drug approval. We are pleased with the quick approval of the filing and our first step forward in the generic Rx field." Outlook Commenting on the first quarter, Mr. Gibbons noted, "We were a user of cash as we built additional inventory to help get us ready to meet our customers' delivery requirements and aggressive promotional programs during the upcoming cold and flu season. We are confident that inventories and receivables will be managed downward over the course of the season, as we have done in the past. "For the full year, we look forward to continued growth in our core businesses, improvements in our operations outside the U.S., and further progress in developing our new generic drug business. We continue to expect year-over-year revenue growth of four to five percent and earnings growth of three to five percent, even as we invest in our generic drug initiative," said Gibbons.
