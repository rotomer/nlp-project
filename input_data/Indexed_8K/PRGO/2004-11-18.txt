Item 1.01. Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement
On November 14, 2004, Perrigo Company, a Michigan corporation ("Perrigo"), Perrigo Israel Opportunities Ltd. ("Merger Sub"), an Israeli company and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Perrigo, and Agis Industries (1983) Ltd., an Israeli public company ("Agis"), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement"). A copy of the Merger Agreement is filed herewith as Exhibit 2.1 and is incorporated herein by reference. Pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into Agis, with Agis continuing as the surviving corporation and becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Perrigo (the "Merger"). The Board of Directors of Perrigo has unanimously approved the Merger and the Merger Agreement and recommended that the Perrigo shareholders approve the issuance of shares of Perrigo common stock in the Merger.
In connection with the Merger, each ordinary share of Agis that is outstanding at the effective time of the Merger (the "Effective Time"), other than shares held in treasury by Agis or owned by Perrigo or any wholly owned subsidiary of Agis or Perrigo, will be converted into the right to receive (i) 0.8011 shares of common stock of Perrigo, and (ii) $14.93 in cash without interest. Each outstanding option to purchase Agis ordinary shares (an "Agis Stock Option") will be assumed by Perrigo and converted at the Effective Time into an option to acquire Perrigo common stock. Each Agis Stock Option will become exercisable for that number of whole shares of Perrigo common stock equal to 1.6022 multiplied by the number of Agis ordinary shares subject to such Agis Stock Option and the exercise price for each Agis Stock Option shall be proportionately reduced. No fractional shares of Perrigo common stock will be issued as a result of the Merger.
The completion of the Merger is subject to various customary conditions, including obtaining the approval of the Perrigo and Agis shareholders, the expiration of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act and obtaining other customary regulatory approvals.
In connection with the Merger and concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, Perrigo entered into (i) a Registration Rights Agreement (the "Registration Rights Agreement") with Moshe Arkin, (ii) a Nominating Agreement (the "Nominating Agreement") with Mr. Arkin providing Mr. Arkin with the right to designate directors to the Board of Directors of Perrigo in the manner set forth therein at the time of the closing of the Merger, (iii) an Undertaking Agreement (the "Undertaking Agreement") with Mr. Arkin, pursuant to which, among other things, Mr. Arkin has agreed to vote all Agis shares owned by him in favor of the Merger and (iv) a Lock-Up Agreement (the "Lock-Up Agreement") with Mr. Arkin, pursuant to which Mr. Arkin has agreed to certain restrictions with respect to the sale or other disposition of Perrigo common stock received by him in the Merger. In addition, in connection with the Merger and concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, Agis entered into a Voting Agreement (the "Voting Agreement"), pursuant to which, among other things, a certain shareholder of Perrigo has agreed to vote all Perrigo shares owned by such shareholder in favor of the Merger.

This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement") is made and entered into as of November 14, 2004 among Perrigo Company, a Michigan corporation ("Buyer"), Perrigo Israel Opportunities Ltd., an Israeli company and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Buyer ("Merger Sub"), and Agis Industries (1983) Ltd., an Israeli public company (the "Company").
     WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Buyer, Merger Sub and the Company have each determined that it is in the best interests of their respective shareholders for Buyer to acquire the Company upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement;
     WHEREAS, in furtherance of such acquisition, the Boards of Directors of Buyer, Merger Sub and the Company have each unanimously (without taking into consideration directors required to abstain from such vote pursuant to the Israeli Companies Law-5759-1999 (together with the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the "Israeli Companies Law")) approved this Agreement and the merger (the "Merger") of Merger Sub with and into the Company in accordance with Sections 314 through 327 of the Israeli Companies Law, and the Israeli Securities Law, 1968 (together with the regulations promulgated thereunder, the "Israeli Securities Law"), and upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement;
     WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has: (i) determined that this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement are fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and its shareholders, and that, considering the financial position of the merging companies, no reasonable concern exists that the Surviving Corporation (as defined herein) will be unable to fulfill the obligations of the Company to its creditors; (ii) approved this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby; and (iii) determined to recommend that the shareholders of the Company approve this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby;
     WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Buyer and Merger Sub have each unanimously: (i) determined that this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement are fair to, and in the best interests of, their respective companies and shareholders, and that, considering the financial position of the merging companies, no reasonable concern exists that the Surviving Corporation will be unable to fulfill the obligations of Merger Sub to its creditors; (ii) approved this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby; and (iii) determined to recommend that the shareholders of their respective companies approve, in the case of Buyer, the issuance of the Buyer Common Stock (as defined herein) pursuant to this Agreement, and, in the case of Merger Sub, this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby;
     WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, as a condition and inducement to Buyer's willingness to enter into this Agreement, Buyer is
 
entering into (i) an Undertaking Agreement (the "Undertaking Agreement") with Moshe Arkin (the "Principal Shareholder") and the Company pursuant to which, among other things, the Principal Shareholder has agreed, subject to the terms and conditions therein, to retain unencumbered all shares of capital stock of the Company owned by him, to vote or deliver written consents with respect to all such shares in favor of approval of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger) and vote or deliver written consents with respect to all such shares against any transaction that is reasonably likely to impair the ability of Buyer, Merger Sub or the Company to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger); and (ii) a Lock-Up Agreement (the "Lock-Up Agreement") with the Principal Shareholder pursuant to which the Principal Shareholder has agreed to certain restrictions with respect to the sale or other disposition of Buyer Common Stock received by the Principal Shareholder in the Merger;
     WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, as a condition and inducement to the Company's willingness to enter into this Agreement, the Company is entering into a Voting Agreement (the "Buyer Voting Agreement") with a certain shareholder of Buyer (the "Buyer Shareholder") pursuant to which, among other things, such Buyer Shareholder has agreed, subject to the terms and conditions therein, to vote or deliver written consents with respect to all shares of capital stock of Buyer owned by such shareholder in favor of approval of the issuance of the Buyer Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement; and
     WHEREAS, Buyer intends to operate the Surviving Corporation's business in Israel in substantially the same manner as the business has been operated by the Company in the past.
     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises, the mutual covenants, promises and representations set forth herein, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:
     1.1     The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the Israeli Companies Law, at the Effective Time (as defined herein), Merger Sub (as the target company (Chevrat Yaad) in the Merger) shall be merged with and into the Company (as the absorbing company (Chevra Koletet) in the Merger). As a result of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as the Surviving Corporation (the "Surviving Corporation") and shall (a) become a wholly owned direct or indirect subsidiary of Buyer, (b) be governed by the laws of the State of Israel, (c) maintain a registered office in the State of Israel and (d) succeed to and assume all of the rights, properties and obligations of Merger Sub and the Company in accordance with the Israeli Companies Law. Buyer, as the sole direct or indirect shareholder of Merger Sub, shall approve or
 
cause to be approved the Merger and this Agreement at the general shareholders meeting of Merger Sub as promptly as practicable following the execution hereof.
     1.2     Effective Time; Closing Date. The closing of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "Closing") shall take place at the offices of Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP, 101 Park Avenue, New York, NY 10178, at a time and on a date to be designated by the parties (the time and date upon which the Closing actually occurs is referred to herein as the "Closing Date"), which shall be no later than the fifth business day after the later to occur of: (a) the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VI (other than those conditions which by their terms are to be satisfied or waived as of the Closing); or (b) the 71st day after the delivery of the Merger Proposal (as defined herein) to the office of the Companies Registrar of the State of Israel (the "Companies Registrar"), or at such other time, date and location as the parties hereto shall mutually agree. On or before the Closing Date, Merger Sub and the Company shall each, in coordination with each other, deliver to the Companies Registrar a notice (the "Merger Notice") informing the Companies Registrar that the Merger was approved by the general shareholders meetings of Merger Sub and the Company, respectively. The Merger shall become effective upon the issuance by the Companies Registrar of a certificate evidencing the completion of the Merger in accordance with section 323(5) of the Israeli Companies Law. The time at which the Merger becomes effective is referred to herein as the "Effective Time".
     1.3     Effects of the Merger. At the Effective Time, without any action on the part of Buyer, Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of any of the following securities, the following shall occur:
               (a)     Conversion of Company Shares. Each Ordinary Share, NIS 1.00 par value per share, of the Company (collectively, the "Company Shares") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than any Company Shares held in the treasury of the Company or owned by Buyer or any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company or Buyer immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall automatically be converted into and represent the right to receive the following (the "Merger Consideration"): (i) 0.8011 shares of common stock, without par value, of Buyer (the "Buyer Common Stock"); and (ii) $14.93 in cash, in each case payable without interest to the holder of such Company Share upon surrender, in the manner provided in Section 1.4, of the certificate that formerly evidenced such Company Share. Upon the issuance of any Buyer Common Stock hereunder, and pursuant to Buyer's existing Rights Agreement dated as of April 10, 1996 (as the same may be amended from time to time, the "Rights Agreement") between Buyer and State Street Bank & Trust Company, as rights agent, one Preferred Share Purchase Right issuable pursuant to the Rights Agreement or any other right issued in substitution therefor (a "Right") shall be issued together with and shall attach to each share of Buyer Common Stock issued pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, unless the Rights shall have expired or been redeemed prior to the Effective Time. References in this Agreement to Buyer Common Stock shall include, unless the context requires otherwise, the Rights.
 
               (b)     Buyer-Owned Stock and Stock Held in Treasury. Each Company Share held in the treasury of the Company or owned by Buyer or any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company or of Buyer immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and retired without any conversion or consideration paid in respect thereof, and shall cease to exist.
               (c)     Stock Options. Effective as of the Effective Time, each outstanding option or right to acquire Company Shares then outstanding (each, a "Company Stock Option"), whether or not then exercisable, shall be assumed by Buyer and converted into an option to purchase shares of Buyer Common Stock in accordance with this Section 1.3(c). Each Company Stock Option so converted shall continue to have, and be subject to, the same material terms and conditions (including vesting schedule) as set forth in the applicable agreement pursuant to which such Company Stock Option was granted immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that, as of the Effective Time, (i) each Company Stock Option shall be exercisable for that number of whole shares of Buyer Common Stock equal to the product of the number of Company Shares that were issuable upon exercise of such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by 1.6022 (the "Exchange Ratio"), rounded to the nearest whole number of shares of Buyer Common Stock, and (ii) the per share exercise price for each share of Buyer Common Stock issuable upon exercise of each Company Stock Option so converted shall be equal to the quotient determined by dividing the exercise price per Company Share at which such Company Stock Option was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time (expressed in U.S. Dollars based on the exchange rate in effect as of the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the date hereof) by the Exchange Ratio, rounded to the nearest whole cent. If not otherwise covered by a registration statement on Form S-8 in place as of the Effective Time, then as promptly as practicable, but in no event later than 60 days after the Closing, Buyer shall register the shares of Buyer Common Stock issuable upon exercise of Company Stock Option converted pursuant to this Section 1.3(c) by filing an effective registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor form) or another appropriate form with the SEC (as defined herein), and Buyer shall use reasonable best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement and maintain the current status of the prospectus with respect thereto for so long as such options remain outstanding. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain any and all consents necessary to allow for the conversion of the Company Stock Options as provided in this Section 1.3(c).
               (d)     Articles of Association. At the Effective Time, the Articles of Association of the Company shall be the Articles of Association of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with the Israeli Companies Law and such Articles of Association.
               (e)     Directors and Officers. The initial directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time, each to hold office in accordance with the Articles of Association of the Surviving Corporation until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified. The initial officers of the Surviving Corporation shall be the officers of Merger Sub
 
immediately prior to the Effective Time, each to hold office in accordance with the Articles of Association of the Surviving Corporation until their respective successors are duly appointed.
               (f)     Capital Stock of Merger Sub. Each Ordinary Share, NIS 1.00 par value per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable Ordinary Share, NIS 1.00 par value per share, of the Surviving Corporation. Each certificate evidencing ownership of such shares of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, as of the Effective Time, evidence ownership of such shares of the Surviving Corporation.
               (g)     Adjustments to Merger Consideration. The Merger Consideration shall be adjusted to reflect appropriately the effect of any forward or reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities exercisable or exchangeable for or convertible into Buyer Common Stock or Company Shares), cash dividends (other than any regular quarterly Buyer dividend of no more than $0.04 per share of Buyer Common Stock), stock issuance or sale, reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other like change with respect to Buyer Common Stock or Company Shares occurring on or after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time.
               (h)     Fractional Shares. No fraction of a share of Buyer Common Stock will be issued to represent any fractional share interests in Buyer Common Stock to be delivered hereunder in exchange for Company Shares, but in lieu thereof each holder of shares of Company Shares who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of Buyer Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock that otherwise would be received by such holder) shall, upon surrender by such holder of each Certificate (as defined herein) held thereby, receive from Buyer an amount of cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent), without interest, equal to the product of (i) such fraction, multiplied by (ii) $18.638. The parties hereto acknowledge that payment of the cash consideration in lieu of issuing fractional shares is not separately bargained for consideration, but merely represents a mechanical rounding off for purposes of simplifying the corporate and accounting complexities that would otherwise be caused by the issuance of fractional shares.
     1.4     Surrender of Certificates.
               (a)     Exchange Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, Buyer shall appoint a bank or trust company that maintains an office in Israel reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent") for the exchange of the Merger Consideration upon surrender of certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented issued and outstanding Company Shares that were converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.3 (the "Certificates").
               (b)     Buyer to Provide Merger Consideration. At or prior to the Effective Time, Buyer shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, for exchange in
 
accordance with this Article I, the Merger Consideration and cash in an amount sufficient for payment in lieu of fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock to which holders of Company Shares may be entitled pursuant to Section 1.3(h) and any dividends or distributions to which holders of Company Shares may be entitled pursuant to Section 1.4(d) (collectively, the "Exchange Fund"). In the event the cash in the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to fully satisfy all of the payment obligations to be made by the Exchange Agent hereunder (including pursuant to Section 1.3(h) and 1.4(d)), Buyer shall promptly make available to the Exchange Agent the amounts so required to satisfy such payment obligations in full. The Exchange Agent shall deliver the Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock and any dividends or other distributions contemplated to be paid for Company Shares pursuant to this Agreement out of the Exchange Fund. Except as contemplated by this Section 1.4, the Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.
          (c)     Exchange Procedures. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but no later than three business days thereafter), Buyer shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record as of the Effective Time of a Certificate (i) a letter of transmittal (in the English and Hebrew languages) in customary form (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificate shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificate to the Exchange Agent), that shall also be in such form and have such other provisions as Buyer and the Company may reasonably specify, and (ii) instructions (in the English and Hebrew languages) for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificate in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, the holders of such Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 1.3(h) and any dividends or other distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 1.4(d), and the Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. Until so surrendered, outstanding Certificates will be deemed from and after the Effective Time to evidence only the right to receive, upon surrender and without interest, the Merger Consideration into which the Company Shares theretofore represented by such Certificates shall have been converted pursuant to Section 1.3, cash in lieu of fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock pursuant to Section 1.3(h) and any dividends or other distributions pursuant to Section 1.4(d).
               (d)     Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares. No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the date hereof with respect to Buyer Common Stock with a record date at or after the Effective Time will be paid to the holders of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of Buyer Common Stock represented thereby until the surrender of such Certificate in accordance with this Section 1.4. Subject to applicable law, following surrender of any such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall promptly deliver to the record holder thereof, without interest, certificates representing whole shares of Buyer Common Stock issued in exchange therefor along with payment of the amount of cash, if any, into which the aggregate number of Company Shares previously represented by such certificate surrendered shall
 
have been converted pursuant to this Agreement, cash payable in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 1.3(h) and the amount of any such dividends or other distributions with a record date at or after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Buyer Common Stock.
               (e)     Transfers of Ownership. If certificates representing shares of Buyer Common Stock are to be issued in a name other than that in which the Certificates surrendered in exchange therefor are registered, it will be a condition of the issuance thereof that the Certificates so surrendered will be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the persons requesting such exchange will have paid to Buyer or any agent designated by it any transfer or other Taxes (as defined herein) required by reason of the issuance of certificates representing shares of Buyer Common Stock in any name other than that of the registered holder of the Certificates surrendered, or established to the satisfaction of Buyer or any agent designated by it that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.
               (f)     Required Withholding. Each of the Exchange Agent and Buyer shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or former holder of Company Shares such amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld therefrom (i) if and to the extent required under the Israeli Tax Ordinance and the regulations promulgated thereunder, the Israeli Income Tax Ruling (as defined herein) or any other provision of Israeli law, statute, regulation, administrative ruling, pronouncement or other authority or judicial opinion or (ii) if required under section 3401 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or any similar provision of United States federal, state or local or foreign Tax Law, but only to the extent that any consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement is treated as compensation for services. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.
               (g)     No Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 1.4, neither the Exchange Agent, Buyer nor any party hereto shall be liable to a holder of shares of Buyer Common Stock or Company Shares for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.
     1.5     Company's Transfer Books Closed; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Shares. At the Effective Time: (a) the share transfer books of the Company shall be deemed closed, and no transfer of any certificates theretofore representing Company Shares shall thereafter be made or consummated; and (b) all holders of Certificates shall cease to have any rights as shareholders of the Company except for any right to receive the Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock pursuant to Section 1.3(h) and any dividends or other distributions pursuant to Section 1.4(d). All shares of Buyer Common Stock issued in accordance with the terms hereof (including any cash paid in respect thereof pursuant to Section 1.3(h) or
 
1.4(d)) shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company Shares.
     1.6     Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Buyer or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable amount as Buyer or the Exchange Agent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against them with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration into which the Company Shares represented by such Certificate immediately prior to the Effective Time shall have been converted pursuant to Section 1.3, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock payable to the holder thereof pursuant to Section 1.3(h) and any dividends or other distributions payable to the holder thereof pursuant to Section 1.4(d).
     1.7     Termination of Exchange Fund. Promptly following the date that is 180 days after the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Exchange Agent to deliver to Buyer any portion of the Exchange Fund which has not been disbursed to holders of Company Shares (including all interest and other income received by the Exchange Agent in respect of the Exchange Fund), and thereafter each holder of a Certificate may surrender such Certificate to Buyer or the Surviving Corporation and (subject to abandoned property, escheat and other similar laws) receive in consideration therefor the Merger Consideration into which the Company Shares represented by such Certificate immediately prior to the Effective Time shall have been converted pursuant to Section 1.3, without interest, cash in lieu of fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock pursuant to Section 1.3(h) and any dividends or other distributions pursuant to Section 1.4(d), but such holder shall have no greater rights against Buyer or the Surviving Corporation than may be accorded to general creditors of Buyer or the Surviving Corporation under applicable law.
     1.8     Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action. If, at any time after the Closing Date, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, the officers and directors of the Company, Merger Sub and Buyer will take any and all such lawful and necessary action.
     The Company represents and warrants to Buyer as follows:
     2.1     Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries.
               (a)     Each of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (as defined herein) is a corporation duly organized and validly existing and, where such concept is applicable, in good standing, under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation and has the requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its assets and properties and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, except where the
 
failure to be in good standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect (as defined herein) on the Company. Each of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries is in possession of all franchises, grants, authorizations, licenses, permits, easements, consents, certificates, approvals and orders ("Approvals") necessary to own, lease and operate the properties it purports to own, operate or lease and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, except where the failure to have such Approvals would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. Each of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed as a foreign corporation to do business, and, where such concept is applicable, is in good standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its activities makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except where the failure to be so duly qualified or licensed and in good standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. For the purposes of this Agreement, "Material Adverse Effect" means, with respect to any party hereto, any event, change, circumstance or state of facts which individually or in the aggregate has or would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the business, assets, liabilities, properties, condition (financial or otherwise) or results of operations of such party and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, materially impair the ability of such party to perform any of its obligations hereunder or prevent or materially delay the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated hereby; provided, however, that the term "Material Adverse Effect" shall exclude events, changes, circumstances and states of facts (i) that result or arise from events, changes, circumstances or states of facts generally affecting any industry in which such party operates or the economy in any of the countries in which such party operates, (ii) that result or arise from events, changes, circumstances or states of facts affecting general worldwide economic or capital market conditions, which in the case of each of the immediately preceding clause (i) and this clause (ii) do not materially disproportionately affect such party, (iii) specifically related to the results of pre-clinical and clinical testing (including bioequivalence testing), United States Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") review of regulatory submissions (except to the extent that review issues relate to general FDA compliance considerations, such as compliance with good manufacturing practice requirements), including the approval by the FDA of any products of any third party that are competitive with products of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, and patent litigation for drugs that are pending or planned to be submitted for approval under abbreviated new drug applications or section 505(b)(2) applications, or (iv) that result or arise from the execution of this Agreement or the announcement of the transactions contemplated hereby.
               (b)     Section 2.1(b) of that certain Schedule dated as of the date hereof, signed by a duly authorized officer of the Company and delivered to Buyer on the date hereof (the "Company Disclosure Schedule"), lists each of the Company's subsidiaries (each, a "Company Subsidiary" and, collectively, the "Company Subsidiaries"), the jurisdiction of incorporation of each Company Subsidiary and the Company's equity interest therein, and, if not directly or indirectly wholly owned by the Company, to the Knowledge (as defined herein) of the Company, the identity and ownership interest of each of the other owners of such Company Subsidiary. Except as set forth in Section
 
2.1(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, as of the date hereof neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has agreed, is obligated to make or is bound (or has bound its property) by any written or oral agreement, contract, subcontract, lease, binding understanding, instrument, note, option, warranty, purchase order, license, sublicense, insurance policy, benefit plan, commitment, arrangement or undertaking of any nature under applicable law (a "Contract") under which it is or is reasonably likely to become obligated to make any future investment in or capital contribution to any other entity in excess of $100,000 in the aggregate with other such Contracts. Other than the Company's interests in the Company Subsidiaries, and except as set forth in Section 2.1(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary directly or indirectly owns any equity or similar interest in or any interest convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for any equity or similar interest in, any corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust, association, unincorporated organization or other legal entity.

                    (i)     "Acquisition Proposal" shall mean any inquiry, offer, proposal, indication of interest, signed agreement or public announcement, as the case may be, by any third party that relates to (A) any merger, consolidation, recapitalization, liquidation or other direct or indirect business combination involving the Company or any transaction or series of transactions involving the issuance or acquisition of shares of capital stock or other equity securities of the Company representing 15% or more (by voting power) of the outstanding capital stock of the Company, (B) any tender or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any person, together with all affiliates thereof, beneficially owning (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) shares of capital stock or other equity securities of the Company representing 15% or more (by voting power) of the outstanding capital stock of the Company or (C) the acquisition, license, purchase or other disposition of 15% or more of the consolidated business or assets of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (including the capital stock or assets of any Company Subsidiary) outside the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice; and
                    (ii)     "Superior Proposal" shall mean any bona fide written Acquisition Proposal (provided, that for the purposes of this definition, (A) the applicable percentages in clauses (A) and (B) of the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be 50% as opposed to 15% and (B) any acquisition, license, purchase or other disposition referred to in clause (C) of the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be for all or a majority of the consolidated business and assets of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (including the capital stock or assets of any Company

               (f)     The Company agrees not to release or permit the release of any person from, or to waive or permit the waiver of any provision of, any confidentiality (other than those entered into in the ordinary course of business), "standstill" or similar agreement to which any of the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party (except that the Company shall be permitted to release or permit the release of such person from any standstill obligation if such action is required in order for the Company's Board of Directors to exercise its rights under, and consistent with, Sections 5.6(b) and 5.7(b)) and will promptly provide Buyer with a copy of such agreements. The Company will use its best efforts to enforce or cause to be enforced each such agreement at the request of Buyer.
     5.7     Board Recommendation.
               (a)     Subject to Section 5.7(b), neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw, qualify, modify or amend (or publicly propose to withdraw, qualify, modify or amend) in any manner adverse to Buyer, the Company Recommendation or take any action or make any statement, filing or release, in connection with the Company Shareholders Meeting or otherwise, inconsistent with the Company Recommendation (it being understood that taking a neutral position or no position with respect to an Acquisition Proposal shall each be considered an adverse modification of the Company Recommendation) or (ii) approve or recommend (or propose publicly to approve or recommend) any Acquisition Proposal (each of the foregoing is referred to herein as a "Company Change in Recommendation").
               (b)     Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 5.7(a), if, prior to the Company Shareholders Meeting, the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith that the failure to make a Company Change in Recommendation would result
 
in a breach by the Board of Directors of the Company of its fiduciary duties to the Company's shareholders under applicable Law, and (i) the Board of Directors of the Company has consulted with its outside counsel and an additional law firm with expertise in corporate transactions in the State of Israel and (ii) if such determination is based on the value of the Merger Consideration but is not being made in connection with a Superior Proposal, the Board of Directors of the Company has consulted with a financial advisor of internationally recognized reputation with regard to, among other things, the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Merger Consideration as of the date of such determination to the holders of Company Shares, then the Board of Directors of the Company may make a Company Change in Recommendation. In addition to the foregoing requirements, in the event of a Company Change in Recommendation resulting from a Superior Proposal, the Board of Directors of the Company may make a Company Change in Recommendation only (i) after the Company provides to Buyer a written notice (a "Notice of Superior Proposal") (A) advising Buyer that the Board of Directors of the Company has received, and intends to accept, a Superior Proposal, (B) specifying the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal, including the amount that the Company's shareholders will receive per Company Share (valuing any non-cash consideration at what the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with its independent financial advisor, to be the fair value of such non-cash consideration) and including a copy thereof with all accompanying documentation, and (C) identifying the person making such Superior Proposal, (ii) after cooperating in good faith with Buyer for a period of not less than five business days to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would enable the Company to proceed with the Company Recommendation without a Company Change in Recommendation (provided, however, that any determination by Buyer to propose to make such adjustment to the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall be at the discretion of Buyer at the time), and (iii) if Buyer does not, within five business days of Buyer's receipt of the Notice of Superior Proposal, make an offer that the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith (after consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) to be as favorable to the Company's shareholders as such Superior Proposal.
               (c)     Neither the Board of Directors of Buyer nor any committee thereof shall withdraw, qualify, modify or amend (or publicly propose to withdraw, qualify, modify or amend) in any manner adverse to the Company, the Buyer Recommendation or make any statement, filing or release, in connection with the Buyer Shareholders Meeting or otherwise, inconsistent with the Buyer Recommendation (it being understood that taking a neutral position or no position shall each be considered an adverse modification of the Buyer Recommendation) (each of the foregoing is referred to herein as a "Buyer Change in Recommendation").
     5.8     Public Disclosure. Except for the joint announcement of the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the timing and content of which have been mutually agreed by the parties hereto, no party hereto shall issue any press release or otherwise make any public announcement with respect to this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby or an Acquisition Proposal without first consulting with the other parties and providing the other parties with reasonable opportunity to review
 
and comment upon such press release or public announcement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if such an announcement is required by applicable law or any listing agreement with a national securities exchange or quotation system (including Nasdaq and the TASE) the party required to make such announcement shall provide notice to and a copy of such as promptly as practicable in advance of such announcement and, to the extent practicable, take the views of the other party in respect of such announcement into account prior to making such announcement. The parties hereto have agreed to the text of the joint press release announcing the execution and delivery of this Agreement.
     5.9     Commercially Reasonable Efforts.
               (a)     Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties hereto shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things under such party's control or which such party is required to do under this Agreement to consummate and make effective, as soon as reasonably practicable, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company and its Board of Directors shall, if any takeover statute or similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to the Merger, this Agreement or any of the transactions hereby, use all commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on the Merger, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.
               (b)     Each of the parties hereto shall, (i) as promptly as practicable and before the expiration of any relevant legal deadline, but in no event later than fifteen business days following the execution and delivery of this Agreement, file with the United States Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") and the United States Department of Justice (the "DOJ"), the notification and report form required for the transactions contemplated hereby and any supplemental information requested in connection therewith pursuant to the HSR Act, which forms shall specifically request early termination of the waiting period prescribed by the HSR Act, and (ii) as promptly as practicable and before the expiration of any legal deadline, file with any other Governmental Entity, any other filings, reports, information and documentation required for the transactions contemplated hereby pursuant to any other antitrust, competition or trade regulatory law of any Governmental Entity (collectively, "Antitrust Laws"). Each of the parties hereto shall furnish to each other's counsel such necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other may request in connection with its preparation of any filing or submission that is necessary under the HSR Act and any other Antitrust Laws.
               (c)     Each of the parties hereto shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain promptly any clearance required under the HSR Act and any other Antitrust Laws for the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and shall keep each other apprised of the status of any communications with, and any inquiries or requests for additional information from, the FTC and the DOJ and other Governmental Entities and shall comply promptly with any
 
such inquiry or request; provided, however, that neither Buyer nor any affiliate thereof shall be required to consent to any divestiture or any other structural or conduct relief. Each of the parties hereto shall promptly and timely respond to a request for additional information from the DOJ or the FTC.
               (d)     Each of the parties hereto commits to instruct its counsel to cooperate with each other and use commercially reasonable efforts to facilitate and expedite the identification and resolution of any such issues and, consequently, the expiration of the applicable HSR Act waiting period and the waiting periods under any other Antitrust Laws at the earliest practicable dates. Such commercially reasonable efforts and cooperation include, without limitation, counsel's undertaking (i) to keep each other appropriately informed of communications from and to personnel of the reviewing antitrust authority, and (ii) to confer with each other regarding appropriate contacts with and response to personnel of such antitrust authority.
               (e)     Each party hereto shall (i) give the other parties prompt notice of the commencement of any legal or other proceeding by or before any Governmental Entity (including the Israeli Restrictive Trade Practices Commissioner, the OCS, the Investment Center, the ISA, the Companies Registrar, the Israeli Lands Authority, the FTC, the DOJ and the SEC) with respect to the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) promptly inform the other parties of any communication with any Governmental Entity regarding the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (iii) keep the other parties informed as to the status of any such proceeding or communication. The parties to this Agreement will consult and cooperate with one another in connection with any analysis, appearance, discussion, presentation, memorandum, brief, argument, opinion or proposal made or submitted in connection with any proceeding or communication relating to the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In addition, except as may be prohibited by any Governmental Entity or by any legal requirement, in connection with any such proceeding relating to any such Governmental Entity, each party hereto will permit authorized representatives of the other party to be present at each meeting or conference or telephone call relating to any such proceeding and to have access to and be consulted in connection with any document, opinion or proposal made or submitted to any Governmental Entity in connection with any such proceeding.
     5.10     Indemnification.
               (a)     From and after the Effective Time, Buyer shall cause the Surviving Corporation to indemnify and hold harmless all current and former directors and officers of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to the fullest extent permitted by Law for acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time (including without limitation acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby) in their capacities as such. Buyer shall cause the Surviving Corporation to fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations pursuant to any indemnification agreements between the Company and its directors and officers in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, any indemnification provisions under the Company Charter Documents as in effect on the
 
date hereof and the indemnification resolutions adopted by the shareholders of the Company on November 12, 1992, in each case to the maximum extent permitted by Law.
               (b)     Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will endeavor to enter into a directors' and officers' liability insurance policy covering those persons who, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, are covered by the Company's directors' and officers' liability insurance policy (the "Insured Parties") on terms no less favorable to the Insured Parties than those of the Company's present directors' and officers' liability insurance policy (such policy, a "Company D&O Policy"), for a period of seven years after the Effective Time, at a cost not to exceed $700,000. If the Company is unable to obtain such a Company D&O Policy prior to the Effective Time, Buyer shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect, for a period of seven years after the Closing Date, a Company D&O Policy; provided, however, that in no event shall Buyer be required to expend annually more than 300% of the annual premium currently paid by the Company for such coverage (and if the cost for such coverage is in excess of such amount Buyer shall be required only to maintain such coverage as is available for such amount).
               (c)     In the event that Buyer or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all its properties and assets to any person, Buyer shall cause proper provisions to be made so that the successors and assigns of Buyer or the Surviving Corporation assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.10. The obligations of Buyer and the Surviving Corporation under this Section 5.10 shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any indemnitee to whom this Section 5.10 applies without the express written consent of such affected indemnitee (it being expressly agreed that the indemnitees to whom this Section 5.10 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section 5.10).
     5.11     Company Affiliate Agreement. As soon as practicable after the date hereof and in any event not fewer than 30 days prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall deliver to Buyer a list setting forth the names of all persons the Company expects to be, as of the date of the Company Shareholders Meeting, its "affiliates" for purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the delivery to Buyer of letter agreements in substantially the form of Exhibit B hereto from each person identified in the list delivered by the Company pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence.
 
     5.12     Nasdaq Listing. Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of Buyer Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to be approved for listing upon the Effective Time on Nasdaq or on such other national securities exchange as the Buyer Common Stock is listed.
     5.13     Employee Matters.
               (a)     Following the Effective Time, Buyer shall cause the Surviving Corporation to honor all Company Employee Plans and Company Employment Agreements disclosed herein in accordance with their respective terms as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time. It is the intention of Buyer to, immediately following the Effective Time, continue the employment of Company Employees who are employed by the Company and its subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "Post-Merger Employees"). Buyer shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide Post-Merger Employees whose employment is continued by the Surviving Corporation, for a period of one year following the Effective Time, with compensation and benefits that are no less favorable in the aggregate than those provided to such Company Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time.
               (b)     To the extent permitted by Law and the terms of any employee benefit plan or arrangements maintained by Buyer or any subsidiary of Buyer in which a Post-Merger Employee becomes eligible to participate (other than equity-based compensation plans) (the "Post-Merger Plans"), Buyer shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, give Post-Merger Employees full credit for purposes of eligibility, vesting and amount of benefits under Post-Merger Plans in which such Post-Merger Employee becomes eligible to participate in after the Closing Date; provided, however, that in no event shall the Post-Merger Employee be entitled to any credit to the extent that it would result in duplication of benefits.
               (c)     Buyer Restricted Stock. As of the Effective Time, Buyer shall grant to selected Post-Merger Employees shares of Buyer Common Stock (the "Buyer Restricted Stock") having an aggregate value, based on the closing price of Buyer Common Stock on the business day immediately preceding the Closing Date, of $4,100,000. The Buyer Restricted Stock shall be granted pursuant to and subject to the terms of the LTIP and, subject to the continued employment of the Post-Merger Employee, shall vest in three annual installments on each of the first three anniversaries of the Closing Date (each such date, a "Vesting Date"); provided, however, that if on or prior to the final Vesting Date, (i) the Post-Merger Employee's employment is terminated by the Company (other than for cause) or (ii) if the Post-Merger Employee terminates his or her employment for "good reason" (as defined herein), then notwithstanding anything in the LTIP to the contrary all unvested Buyer Restricted Stock awarded to such Post-Merger Employee shall vest immediately upon such termination of employment. For the purposes of this Agreement, "good reason" means a reduction in such Post-Merger Employee's annual base salary or the relocation of such Post-Merger Employee's principal place of employment to a location more than 50 miles from such Post-Merger Employee's principal place of employment immediately prior to the Effective Time.
 
               (d)     Special Bonuses. On the Closing Date, the Company may distribute bonuses to selected Post-Merger Employees in an aggregate amount not to exceed $2,750,000 (collectively, the "Special Bonuses"); provided, however, that the aggregate amount of Special Bonuses shall be reduced by the aggregate amount of bonuses set forth next to the names of the individuals set forth on Section 5.13 of the Company Disclosure Schedule.
               (e)     Retention Agreements. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company may enter into retention agreements, in substantially the form made available to Buyer prior to the date hereof, with selected Company Employees (the "Retention Agreements") providing for payments to such Company Employees generally no earlier than six months, and no later than three years, following the Closing date, subject to continued employment through the payment date; provided, however, that the aggregate payments under the Retention Agreements shall in no event exceed $1,750,000.
               (f)     Mutual Agreement. Prior to the Effective Time, the chief executive officers of each of Buyer and the Company shall mutually agree upon the selection of Post-Merger Employees who are eligible for Buyer Restricted Stock, Special Bonuses and Retention Payments (which employees may include the Company's three most senior executives), the apportionment of the Buyer Restricted Stock, Special Bonuses and Retention Payments, and the timing of the Retention Payments; provided, however, that shares of Buyer Restricted Stock having an aggregate value as determined in accordance with Section 5.13(c) of $1,000,000 and Special Bonuses in the aggregate amount of $1,000,000 shall not be subject to such mutual agreement and shall instead be apportioned to Post-Merger Employees as determined by the Company.
               (g)     To the extent not paid by the Company prior to the Effective Time, Buyer shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to distribute annual bonuses with respect to 2004 to eligible Post-Merger Employees, at times and in such amounts to be determined in accordance with past practice of the Company as determined by the chief executive officer of the Company or his designee.
               (h)     Nothing in this Section 5.13, express or implied, shall confer upon any Company Employee, or any legal representative or beneficiary thereof, any rights or remedies, including any right to employment or continued employment for any specified period, or compensation or benefits of any nature or kind whatsoever under this Agreement. Nothing in this Section 5.13, express or implied, shall be construed to prevent the Buyer from terminating or modifying to any extent or in any respect any benefit plan that the Buyer may establish or maintain.
     5.14     Section 16 Matters. Buyer and the Company agree that, in order to most effectively compensate and retain the Company Insiders (as defined herein) in connection with the Merger, both prior to and after the Effective Time, it is desirable that the conversion of Shares into shares of Buyer Common Stock in the Merger by the Company Insiders be exempted from liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted by Law, and for that compensatory and retentive purpose agree to the provisions of this Section 5.14. Assuming that the Company delivers to Buyer the
 
Section 16 Information in a timely fashion, the Board of Directors of Buyer, or a committee of Non-Employee Directors thereof (as such term is defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act), shall adopt a resolution providing that the receipt by the Company Insiders of Buyer Common Stock in exchange for Company Shares pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to the extent such securities are listed in the Section 16 Information, are intended to be exempt from liability pursuant to Section 16(b) under the Exchange Act. For the purposes of this Agreement: "Section 16 Information" shall mean information accurate in all material respects regarding the Company Insiders, the number of Shares held by each such Company Insider and elected by such Company Insiders to be exchanged for Buyer Common Stock in the Merger; and "Company Insiders" shall mean those officers and directors of the Company who may be subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act on or following the Effective Time and who are listed in the Section 16 Information.
     5.15     Resignations. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain resignations from the directors of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries designated by Buyer from their positions as directors of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries effective as of the Effective Time.
     6.1     Conditions to Obligations of Each Party to Effect the Merger. The respective obligations of each party to this Agreement to effect the Merger shall be subject to the satisfaction at or prior to the Closing Date of the following conditions, any of which may be waived, in writing, by mutual agreement of Buyer and the Company:

               (b)     No Order; Antitrust Approvals. No Governmental Entity shall have enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any statute, rule, regulation, executive order, decree, injunction or other order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) which is in effect and which has the effect of making the Merger illegal or otherwise prohibiting consummation of the Merger. The waiting period under the HSR Act shall have expired or been terminated, and all foreign antitrust approvals, if any, required to be obtained prior to the Merger in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby shall have been obtained.
               (c)     Israeli Governmental Entity Approvals. All Israeli Governmental Entity approvals required pursuant to Israeli legal requirements for the consummation of

     6.2     Additional Conditions to Obligations of the Company.

The Company shall have received a certificate with respect to the foregoing signed on behalf of each of Buyer and Merger Sub by an executive officer of Buyer or Merger Sub, respectively.
               (b)     Agreements and Covenants.

Each of Buyer and Merger Sub shall have received a certificate with respect to the foregoing signed on behalf of the Company by an executive officer of the Company.
               (b)     Agreements and Covenants.

               (a)     by mutual written consent duly authorized by the Boards of Directors of Buyer and the Company;
               (b)     by either the Company or Buyer if the Merger shall not have been consummated prior to August 31, 2005 (the "Termination Date") for any reason; provided, however, that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 7.1(b) shall not be available to any party whose action or failure to act has been a principal cause of or resulted in the failure of the Merger to occur on or before such date;
 
               (c)     by either the Company or Buyer if a Governmental Entity shall have issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any other action, in any case having the effect of permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Merger, which order, decree, ruling or other action shall have become final and nonappealable;

               (f)     by either Buyer or the Company, if there shall have been a breach by the other of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or obligations contained in this Agreement, which breach would result in the failure to satisfy by the Termination Date one or more of the conditions set forth in Section 6.2(a) or (b) (in the case of a breach by Buyer) or Section 6.3(a) or (b) (in the case of a breach by the Company), and in any such case such breach shall be incapable of being cured or, if capable of being cured, shall not have been cured within 30 days after written notice thereof shall have been received by the party alleged to be in breach;

                    (i)     Section 7.1(e) prior to the Company Shareholders Meeting or 7.1(j); or
                    (ii)     Section 7.1(d)(i), and (A) after the date hereof and prior to the Company Shareholder Meeting at which the Company failed to obtain the requisite vote there shall be outstanding or there shall have been publicly announced a plan or proposal with respect to an Acquisition Proposal and (B)(1) within 12 months after such
 
termination the Company shall have entered into a definitive agreement with respect to such Acquisition Proposal (substituting "20%" for "15%" in the definition thereof) or (2) within six months after such termination the Company shall have entered into a definitive agreement with respect to any transaction or series of transactions which, had such been proposed during the term of this Agreement, would have constituted an Acquisition Proposal (substituting "50%" for "15%" in the definition thereof), provided that the transactions contemplated by the Acquisition Proposal described in the immediately preceding clause (1) or (2), as applicable, are subsequently consummated; or
                    (iii)     Section 7.1(b), to the extent resulting from a material breach by the Company, or Section 7.1(f), to the extent terminated by Buyer, and, in any such case, (A) after the date hereof and prior to or at the time of such termination, there shall be outstanding, there shall have been under consideration by the Company or there shall have been publicly announced a plan or proposal with respect to an Acquisition Proposal and (B)(1) within 12 months after termination of the Agreement the Company shall have entered into a definitive agreement with respect to such Acquisition Proposal (substituting "20%" for "15%" in the definition thereof) or (2) within six months after such termination the Company shall have entered into a definitive agreement with respect to any transaction or series of transactions which, had such been proposed during the term of this Agreement, would have constituted an Acquisition Proposal (substituting "50%" for "15%" in the definition thereof), provided that the transactions contemplated by the Acquisition Proposal described in the immediately preceding clause (1) or (2), as applicable, are subsequently consummated;
then Buyer would suffer direct and substantial damages, which damages cannot be determined with reasonable certainty and, in order to compensate Buyer for such damages the Company shall pay to Buyer the amount of $25,000,000 by wire transfer in immediately available funds to an account designated by Buyer as liquidated damages (the "Termination Fee"). The Termination Fee shall be due and payable (A) in the case of any termination by Buyer, within three business days of termination of this Agreement and (B) in the case of any termination by the Company, immediately prior to (and as condition to) such termination; provided, however, that in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) of this Section 7.3(b), the Termination Fee shall be due and payable immediately prior to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Acquisition Proposal. It is specifically agreed that the amount to be paid pursuant to this Section 7.3(b) represents liquidated damages and not a penalty.
               (c)     If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(i) in circumstances under which the provisions of Section 7.3(b)(ii) are inapplicable, then the Company shall pay to Buyer an amount equal to lesser of (i) Buyer's out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including without limitation all attorneys', accountants and investment bankers' fees and expenses) and (ii) $5,000,000, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by Buyer within three business days of such termination.
               (d)     If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(ii), then Buyer shall pay to the Company an amount equal to lesser of (i) the Company's out-of-pocket
 
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including without limitation all attorneys', accountants' and investment bankers' fees and expenses) and (ii) $5,000,000, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by the Company within three business days of such termination.
                    (e)     The remedies provided under Sections 7.3(b), 7.3(c) and 7.3(d) shall be exclusive of all other remedies at law or in equity; provided, however, that in the event of a willful breach by a party of any of its representations or warranties or willful failure to comply with any of its covenants or obligations contained in this Agreement, such remedies shall be non-exclusive and the other party shall be entitled to pursue any other remedy at law or in equity in respect of such breach or failure to comply.
     7.4     Amendment. Subject to applicable law, this Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto at any time by execution of an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of Buyer, Merger Sub and the Company; provided, however, that after the vote by the shareholders of the Company, there shall not be made any amendment that by law requires further approval by such shareholders without the further approval of such shareholders.

At any time prior to the Closing Date, any party hereto may, to the extent legally allowed, (i) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made to such party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (iii) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions for the benefit of such party contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. Delay in exercising any right under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right.
     8.1     Non-Survival of Representations and Warranties. The representations and warranties of the Company, Buyer and Merger Sub contained in this Agreement shall terminate and be of not further force and effect as of the Closing, and only the covenants that by their terms contemplate performance after the Closing shall survive the Closing.

The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts, including, without limitation, assisting with sales efforts and the selection of appropriate underwriters, to cause the registration statement to become effective in respect of each Demand Registration in accordance with the intended method of distribution set forth in the written request delivered by the Shareholder as expeditiously as possible (but in any event, subject to this Section 2.1, within 120 days of receipt of such written request, and the Company shall file such registration statement within 60 days of receipt of such request).
     (b)   Limitations on Registration on Request. Subject to Section 2.1(a), the Company shall only be required to effect a maximum of three (3) Demand Registrations; provided, however, that the first Demand Request may not be made before the earlier of the (x) termination of the Lock-up Agreement in accordance with its terms or (y) 120 days prior to the second anniversary of the Closing Date, and further, provided, that the Company shall not be required to file (i) more than one such Demand Registration in any twelve-month period or (ii) any such Demand Registration within 120 days following the date of effectiveness of any registration statement relating to a Demand Registration.
     (c)   Registration Statement Form. Demand Registrations under this Section 2.1 shall be on such appropriate registration form of the Commission as selected by the Company.
     (d)   Expenses. Subject to Section 2.1(g), the Shareholder shall pay all Registration Expenses incurred in connection with any registration requested pursuant to this Section 2.1; provided, however, that Shareholder shall not be obligated to pay fees and expenses of counsel to the Company in excess of $50,000 per each Demand Registration.
     (e)   Effective Registration Statement. A Demand Registration requested pursuant to this Section 2.1 shall be deemed to have been effected (including for purposes of paragraph (b) of this Section 2.1) if a registration statement with respect thereto has become effective and has been kept continuously effective for a period of 90 days (or such shorter period which shall terminate when all the Registrable Securities covered by such registration statement have been sold pursuant thereto). A Demand Registration which is not effected, subject to Section 2.1(g), shall not reduce the number of Demand Registrations permitted hereunder.
 
     (f)   Selection of Underwriters. The Managing Underwriters for each underwritten offering of Registrable Securities to be registered pursuant to a Demand Registration shall be a nationally or regionally recognized investment bank that is selected by the Shareholder (subject to the approval by the Company, which approval may not be unreasonably delayed or withheld).
     (g)   Right to Withdraw. If the Managing Underwriters of any underwritten offering shall advise the Company and the Shareholder that the Registrable Securities covered by the registration statement cannot be sold in such offering within a price range acceptable to the Shareholder, then the Shareholder shall have the right to notify the Company in writing that he has determined that the registration statement shall be abandoned or withdrawn, in which event the Company shall abandon or withdraw such registration statement. In the event of any such abandonment or withdrawal, such request shall be counted as a Demand Registration for purposes of the requests for registration to which the Shareholder is entitled pursuant to this Section 2.1.
     (h)   Postponement. The Company shall be entitled once in any twelve-month period to postpone for a reasonable period of time (but not exceeding an aggregate of 60 days, any such period, a "Black-Out Period") the filing or effectiveness of any registration statement required to be prepared and filed by it pursuant to this Section 2.1 if the Company determines, in its reasonable judgment and based on the advice of its counsel, that such registration and offering would materially interfere with any material financing or other material transaction involving the Company, or if there is an event or state of facts relating to the Company that is material to the Company (and would reasonably likely be required to be disclosed in such registration statement) the disclosure of which would, in the reasonable judgment of the Company, be materially adverse to its interests, and promptly delivers to the Shareholder in such offering a certificate signed by the Company's chief executive officer or chief financial officer (a "Delay Notice") stating such determination, containing a general statement of the reasons for such postponement and an estimate of the anticipated delay (but the Company shall not be required to include in such notice any reference to or description of the facts based upon which the Company is delivering such Delay Notice). If the Company shall so postpone the filing of a registration statement, (i) the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to limit the delay to as short a period as is practicable, and (ii) the Shareholder shall have the right to withdraw the Demand Registration request by giving written notice to the Company within 10 Business Days of receipt of a Delay Notice and, in the event of such withdrawal, such Demand Registration shall not be counted for purposes of requests for Demand Registration to which the Shareholder is entitled pursuant to this Section 2.1. The Company shall be obligated to pay all Registration Expenses in such event.
2.2   Incidental Registration.
     (a)   Right to Include Registrable Securities. If the Company at any time proposes to register any of its common stock for its own account (a "Company Registration") or the account of any other stockholder under the Securities Act by registration on Form S-1, S-2, or S-3 or any successor or similar form(s) (except registrations on any such form or similar form(s) solely for registration of securities in connection with an employee benefit plan or dividend reinvestment plan or a merger or consolidation or incidental to an issuance of
 
securities under Rule 144A under the Securities Act), it will each such time give prompt written notice to the Shareholder of its intention to do so and of the Shareholder's rights under this Section 2.2. Upon the written request of the Shareholder (which request shall specify the maximum number of Registrable Securities intended to be disposed of by the Shareholder) made as promptly as practicable and in any event within 10 days after the receipt of any such notice, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to effect the registration under the Securities Act of all Registrable Securities which the Company has been so requested to register by the Shareholder; provided, however, that in the case of a Company Registration, if, at any time after giving written notice of its intention to register any securities and prior to the effective date of the registration statement filed in connection with such registration, the Company shall determine for any reason not to register or to delay registration of such securities, the Company shall give the Shareholder written notice of such determination and (i) in the case of a determination not to register, shall be relieved of its obligation to register any Registrable Securities in connection with such registration (but not from any obligation of the Company to pay its portion of the Registration Expenses in connection therewith), without prejudice, however, to the rights of the Shareholder to request that such registration be effected as a registration under Section 2.1 and (ii) in the case of a determination to delay registering, shall be permitted to delay registering any Registrable Securities, for the same period as the delay in registering such other securities. No registration effected under this Section 2.2 shall relieve the Company of its obligation to effect any registration upon request under Section 2.1. The Shareholder will pay Registration Expenses in proportion to the number of Registrable Securities intended to be disposed of by the Shareholder to the total number of shares of Common Stock included in the Company Registration in connection with any registration of Registrable Securities requested pursuant to this Section 2.2.
     (b)   Right to Withdraw. The Shareholder shall have the right to withdraw its request for inclusion of its Registrable Securities in any registration statement pursuant to this Section 2.2 at any time prior to the execution of an underwriting agreement with respect thereto by giving written notice to the Company of its request to withdraw.
     (c)   Priority in Incidental Registrations. In the case of a Company Registration, if the Managing Underwriters of any underwritten offering shall inform the Company by letter of its belief that the number of Registrable Securities requested to be included in such registration, when added to the number of other securities to be offered by the Company in such registration, would materially adversely affect such offering, then the Company shall include in such registration, to the extent of the number which the Company is so advised can be sold in (or during the time of) such offering without so materially adversely affecting such offering, securities in the following priority: (A) securities proposed to be included by the Company, (B) the Registrable Securities requested by the Shareholder to be included in such registration pursuant to this Section 2.2, and (C) any securities of the Company requested to be included in such registration by any other holder having the right to include securities, on a pro rata basis, based on the number of shares of Common Stock held, or obtainable by exercise or conversion of other securities of the Company, by such holder.
     (d)   Plan of Distribution. Any participation by the Shareholder in a Company Registration shall be in accordance with the Company's plan of distribution.
 
     (e)   The right of Shareholder to request inclusion of its Registrable Securities in any registration statement pursuant to this Section 2.2 shall terminate immediately if the Lock-up Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms.
     2.3   Registration Procedures. If and whenever the Company is required, pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, to effect the registration of any Registrable Securities under the Securities Act in accordance with Sections 2.1 or 2.2, the following procedures shall apply:
(a) The Company shall:
(b)   The Company shall give notice to the Shareholder:
 
     (c)   The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain as soon as possible the withdrawal of any order suspending the effectiveness of the registration statement or the qualification of the securities therein for sale in any jurisdiction.
     (d)   The Company shall promptly deliver to the Shareholder as many copies of the prospectus (including a preliminary prospectus) included in the registration statement and any amendment or supplement thereto as the Shareholder may reasonably request. The Company consents to the use of the prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto by the Shareholder in connection with the offering and sale of the Registrable Securities pursuant to this Agreement (except during any Black-Out Period).
     (e)   Prior to any offering of Registrable Securities pursuant to a registration statement, the Company shall arrange for the qualification of the Registrable Securities for sale under the laws of such jurisdictions as the Shareholder shall reasonably request and shall maintain such qualification in effect so long as required; provided that in no event shall the Company be obligated to qualify to do business in any jurisdiction where it is not then so qualified, to consent generally to the service of process in such jurisdiction, or to take any action in connection therewith that would subject it to taxation.
     (f)   Upon the occurrence of any event contemplated by subsections (b)(iii) or (v) above, the Company shall promptly prepare a post-effective amendment to the registration statement or an amendment or supplement to the related prospectus or file any other required document so that the registration statement and the prospectus will not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of the prospectus, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made) not misleading.
     (g)   The Company shall comply with all applicable rules and regulations of the Commission and shall make generally available to its security holders an earnings statement satisfying the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act as soon as practicable after the effective date of the registration statement and in any event no later than 45 days after the end of a 12-month period (or 90 days, if such period is a fiscal year) beginning with the first month of the Company's first fiscal quarter commencing after the effective date of the registration statement.
     (h)   In connection with any underwritten offering effected hereunder, the Company shall:
 
 
     The Shareholder agrees that, upon receipt of any notice from the Company of the happening of any event of the kind described in paragraph (b)(iii) or (v) of this Section 2.3, the Shareholder will, to the extent appropriate, discontinue its disposition of Registrable Securities pursuant to the registration statement relating to such Registrable Securities until, in the case of paragraph (b)(v) of this Section 2.3, its receipt of the supplemented or amended prospectus contemplated by paragraph (b)(v) of this Section 2.3 and, if so directed by the Company, will deliver to the Company (at the Company's expense) all copies, other than permanent file copies, then in its possession, of the prospectus relating to such Registrable Securities current at the time of receipt of such notice. If the disposition by the Shareholder of its securities is discontinued pursuant to the foregoing sentence, the Company shall extend the period of effectiveness of the registration statement by the number of days during the period from and including the date of the giving of notice to and including the date when the Shareholder shall have received copies of the supplemented or amended prospectus contemplated by paragraph (b)(v) of this Section 2.3; and, if the Company shall not so extend such period, the request pursuant to which such registration statement was filed shall not be counted for purposes of the requests for registration to which the Shareholder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.1 hereof.
     It shall be a condition precedent to the obligation of the Company to take any action pursuant to this Agreement in respect of the Registrable Securities which are to be registered at the request of the Shareholder that the Shareholder shall furnish to the Company within ten days of the Company's request such information regarding the Shareholder and the Registrable Securities held by the Shareholder as the Company shall reasonably request and as shall be required in connection with the action taken by the Company.
2.4   Indemnification and Contribution.
     (a)   Indemnification by the Company. The Company agrees that in the event of any registration of any securities of the Company pursuant to this Agreement, the Company shall, and hereby does, indemnify and hold harmless the Shareholder, and each other Person who participates as an underwriter in the offering or sale of such securities and each other Person, if any, who controls any such underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act, against any losses, claims, damages, or liabilities, joint or several, to which the Shareholder or any such underwriter or controlling Person may become subject under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof), arise out of or are based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in any registration statement under which such securities were registered under the Securities Act on the effective date thereof, any preliminary prospectus, final prospectus or summary prospectus contained therein, or any amendment or supplement thereto or (ii) any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of any prospectus, in light of the circumstances in which they were made) not misleading, and the Company shall reimburse the Shareholder and each such underwriter and controlling Person for any legal or any other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, liability, action or proceeding or (iii) any violation by the
 
Company of any federal, state or common law rule or regulation applicable to the Company and relating to action required of or inaction by the Company in connection with any such registration; provided, however, that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the Shareholder to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage, liability (or action or proceeding in respect thereof) or expense arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in such registration statement, any such preliminary prospectus, final prospectus, summary prospectus, amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company expressly for use in connection with such registration by or on behalf of the Shareholder; provided, further, that as to any preliminary prospectus with respect to an underwritten registration, the provisions of this Section 2.4 shall not inure to the benefit of the Shareholder on account of any loss, claim, damage, liability or action arising from the sale of Common Shares to any person by the Shareholder if the Shareholder failed to send or give a copy of the final prospectus to that person, and the untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact in such preliminary prospectus thereto was corrected in the final prospectus. Such indemnity shall remain in full force regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Shareholder or any such underwriter or controlling Person and shall survive the delivery of and the payment for the Common Shares sold by the Shareholder.
     (b)   Indemnification by the Shareholder. In connection with any registration statement in which the Shareholder includes Registrable Securities the Shareholder hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless, severally and not jointly (in the same manner and to the same extent as set forth in paragraph (a) of this Section 2.4), the Company, and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company and each other Person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act, with respect to any statement or alleged statement in or omission or alleged omission from such registration statement, any preliminary prospectus, final prospectus or summary prospectus contained therein, or any amendment or supplement thereto, but only to the extent such statement or alleged statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of the Shareholder specifically stating that it is for use in the preparation of such registration statement, preliminary prospectus, final prospectus, summary prospectus, amendment or supplement. Such indemnity shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Company or any such director, officer or controlling Person and shall survive the delivery of and the payment for the Common Shares sold by the Shareholder.
     (c)   Notices of Claims, etc. Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party of notice of the commencement of any action or proceeding involving a claim referred to in the preceding subsections of this Section 2.4, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against an indemnifying party, give written notice to the latter of the commencement of such action or proceeding; provided, however, that the failure of any indemnified party to give notice as provided herein shall not relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations under the preceding subsections of this Section 2.4, except to the extent that the indemnifying party is not otherwise aware of the claim and is actually materially prejudiced by such failure to give notice, and shall not relieve the indemnifying party from any liability which it may have to the indemnified party otherwise than under this Section 2.4. In case any such action or proceeding is brought against an indemnified party, the indemnifying party shall (i)
 
have the right to assume the defense of such action, including the employment of counsel to be chosen by the indemnifying party which is reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party, and (ii) be responsible for payment of expenses in connection with such action or proceeding. The indemnified party shall have the right to employ its own counsel (including local counsel) in any such case, but the legal fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of the indemnified party unless (i) the employment of such counsel shall have been authorized in writing by the indemnifying party in connection with the defense of such action, (ii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to take charge of the defense of such action within a reasonable period of time after notice of the institution of such action, (iii) the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be defenses available to it or them that are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party (in which case the indemnifying party shall not have the right to direct the defense of such action on behalf of the indemnified party), or (iv) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, in any of which events such fees and expenses shall be borne by the indemnifying party. No indemnifying party, in the defense of any such claim or litigation, shall, except with the consent of each indemnified party, consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement that (i) does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the plaintiff to such indemnified party of a release from all liability in respect to such claim or litigation or (ii) provides for relief other than the payment of monetary damages (and such monetary damages shall be paid in full by the indemnifying party).
     (d)   Contribution. If the indemnification provided for in this Section 2.4 shall for any reason be held by a court to be unavailable to an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) hereof in respect of any loss, claim, damage or liability, or any action in respect thereof, then, in lieu of the amount paid or payable under subsection (a) or (b) hereof, the indemnified party and the indemnifying party under subsection (a) or (b) hereof shall contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating the same), (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party on the one hand, and the indemnified party on the other, which resulted in such loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof, with respect to the statements or omissions which resulted in such loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations, or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law or if the allocation provided in this clause (ii) provides a greater amount to the indemnified party than clause (i) above, in such proportion as shall be appropriate to reflect not only the relative fault but also the relative benefits received by the indemnifying party and the indemnified party from the offering of the securities covered by such registration statement as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this Section 2.4(d) were to be determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to in the preceding sentence of this Section 2.4(d). No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. In addition, no Person shall be obligated to contribute hereunder any amounts in payment for any settlement of any action or claim effected without such Person's consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.
 
     (e)   Other Indemnification. The indemnification agreements contained in this Section 2.4 shall be in addition to any other rights to indemnification or contribution which any indemnified party may have pursuant to law or contract and shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any indemnified party and shall survive the delivery of and the payment for the Common Shares sold by the Shareholder.
     (f)   Indemnification Payments. The indemnification and contribution required by this Section 2.4 shall be made by periodic payments of the amount thereof during the course of the investigation or defense, as and when bills are received or expenses, losses, damages or liabilities are incurred.
2.5   Stop Transfer Orders. In connection with the offering of any Registrable Securities registered pursuant to this Agreement, the Company shall instruct any transfer agent and registrar of such Registrable Securities to release any stop transfer orders with respect to any such Registrable Securities.
2.6   Limitation on Sale or Distribution of Other Securities.
     (a)   The Shareholder (regardless of whether the Shareholder is participating in such registration) agrees, to the extent requested in writing by a Managing Underwriter of any underwritten registration effected pursuant to and in compliance with Section 2.1 or 2.2, not to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of, including any sale pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act, any shares of Common Stock, or any other security of the Company convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for Common Stock (other than as part of such underwritten public offering) during the time period reasonably requested by the Managing Underwriters, not to exceed 90 days and subject to any registration rights to which the Shareholder would otherwise be entitled pursuant to Section 2.2.
     (b)   Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Agreement, the Company shall not be obligated to register the Registrable Securities of the Shareholder (i) if the Shareholder or any underwriter of such Registrable Securities shall fail to furnish to the Company necessary information in respect of the distribution of such Registrable Securities, or (ii) in the case of a Company Registration, if such registration involves an underwritten offering, such Registrable Securities are not included in such underwritten offering on the same terms and conditions as shall be applicable to the other securities of the Company being sold through underwriters in the registration or the Shareholder fails to enter into an underwriting agreement in customary form with the underwriter or underwriters selected for such underwritten offering.
2.7   No Required Sale. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to create an independent obligation on the part of the Shareholder to sell any Registrable Securities pursuant to any effective registration statement.
2.8   Exchange Act Compliance. If the Company is subject to the requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, the Company shall file all reports required to be filed by it under the Exchange Act and it will take such further action as the Shareholder may reasonably request so as to enable the Shareholder to sell Registrable Securities
 
without registration under the Securities Act pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act, as such rule may be in effect from time-to-time, or any similar or successor rule or regulation hereafter promulgated by the Commission.
3.   Miscellaneous.
     3.1   Amendments and Waivers. (i) Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived if such amendment or waiver is in writing and signed, in the case of an amendment, by the Company and the Shareholder or, in the case of a waiver, by the party or parties against whom the waiver is to be provided.
(ii)   No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder (other than a failure or delay beyond a period of time specified herein) shall operate as a waiver thereof and no single or partial exercise thereof shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
     The undersigned is an owner of record or beneficially of certain common shares of Agis Industries (1983) Ltd. ("Company Shares") or securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for Company Shares. Pursuant to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of the date hereof among Perrigo Company ("Buyer"), Perrigo Israel Opportunities Ltd. and Agis Industries (1983) Ltd. (the "Merger Agreement"; capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined shall have the meaning set forth in the Merger Agreement) at the Effective Time, each Company Share owned by the undersigned as of the Effective Time shall automatically be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. The undersigned recognizes that the Merger will be of benefit to the undersigned and all holders of Company Shares. The undersigned acknowledges that Buyer is relying on the representations and agreements of the undersigned contained in this agreement in entering into the Merger Agreement with Agis Industries (1983) Ltd. and Perrigo Israel Opportunities Ltd. and consummating the transactions contemplated thereby. The undersigned represents and warrants to the Buyer that (i) he has the requisite legal capacity to execute and deliver this agreement and to perform his obligations hereunder; (ii) this agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the undersigned and upon its execution and delivery by all parties hereto, will constitute the valid and legally binding obligations of the undersigned, enforceable in accordance with its terms except as enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting or relating to creditors rights generally, and the availability of injunctive relief and other equitable
 
remedies; and (iii) no other action is required on the part of the undersigned in connection with the execution, delivery or performance of this agreement.
     1.           Lock-Up. In consideration of the foregoing, the undersigned hereby agrees that, without the prior written consent of Buyer, the undersigned will not, and will cause any spouse or family member of the spouse or the undersigned living in the undersigned's household not to, (a) directly or indirectly, sell, offer, contract or grant any option to sell (including without limitation any short sale), pledge, transfer, establish an open "put equivalent position" within the meaning of Rule 16a-1(h) under the Exchange Act or otherwise dispose of any shares of the Buyer Common Stock, received by the undersigned in the Merger (the "Buyer Securities") owned either of record or beneficially (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) by the undersigned (or such spouse or family member), (b) publicly announce an intention to do any of the foregoing, or (c) enter into any swap or other agreement or any transaction that transfers, in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, the economic consequence of ownership of any Buyer Securities owned either of record or beneficially (as defined in Rule 13-d under the Exchange Act) by the undersigned (or such spouse or family member), whether any such swap or transaction is to be settled by delivery of Buyer Common Stock or other securities, in cash or otherwise (each of (a), (b) and (c), individually or collectively, is referred to herein as a "Disposition"), for a period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the second anniversary of the Closing Date. For a period commencing on the second anniversary of the Closing Date and ending on the third anniversary of the Closing Date, the undersigned hereby agrees to make no Disposition of more than 50% of the Buyer Securities owned either of record or beneficially (as defined in Rule 13-d under the Exchange Act) by the undersigned (or such spouse or family member), and will cause any spouse or family member of the spouse or the undersigned living in the undersigned's household not to make any such Disposition.
     2.           Exceptions to Restriction on Disposition. The restrictions on Dispositions set forth in Section 1 shall not apply to Dispositions of Buyer Securities to a family member, trust or other entity made solely for estate or tax planning purposes, provided that any such Disposition shall be conditioned upon each such transferee executing and delivering a lock-up letter agreement with Buyer in form and substance substantially similar to this agreement.
     3.           Stop Transfer. The undersigned also agrees and consents to the entry of stop transfer instructions, substantially in the form attached as Exhibit A hereto, with Buyer's transfer agent and registrar against the transfer of Buyer Securities held by the undersigned, if such transfer would constitute a violation or breach of this agreement.
     4.           Registration Rights. The undersigned waives any registration rights relating to registration under the Exchange Act of any Buyer Securities owned either of record or beneficially by the undersigned, including any rights to
 
receive notice of the Form S-4 Registration Statement, for a period commencing on the Closing Date and continuing through the close of trading on the date that is the second anniversary of the Closing Date, except as otherwise set forth in the Registration Rights Agreement between Buyer and the undersigned, dated as of the date hereof (the "Registration Rights Agreement").
     5.           Termination. If the undersigned's employment with Buyer is terminated (either by Buyer without Cause or by the undersigned for Good Reason (as each is defined in that certain Employment Agreement between the Buyer and undersigned dated as of the date hereof) or as a result of undersigned's death or disability), undersigned (or his estate or guardian, as applicable) shall have the right to terminate this agreement upon the earlier of (a) the two year anniversary of the Closing Date or (b) the six month anniversary of such termination of employment. If the undersigned elects to terminate this agreement pursuant to this Section 5, the undersigned will (x) immediately tender his resignation from the Board of Directors of Buyer and (y) have only those registration rights set forth in the Registration Rights Agreement.
     6.           Condition to Effectiveness. Notwithstanding anything in this agreement to the contrary, this agreement shall not be effective until the Effective Time. In the event the Effective Time does not occur, this agreement shall not be valid, binding and enforceable against any of the parties hereto.
 
     This agreement is irrevocable and will be binding on the undersigned and the respective successors, heirs, personal representatives and assigns of the undersigned.
