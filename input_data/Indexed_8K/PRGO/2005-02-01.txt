Exhibit 99 PERRIGO COMPANY REPORTS SECOND QUARTER FISCAL 2005 EARNINGS ALLEGAN, Mich., Feb. 1 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- The Perrigo Company (Nasdaq: PRGO) today announced results for the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2005 ended Dec. 25, 2004. Perrigo Company (in thousands, except per share amounts) Second Quarter Year-To-Date ----------------------- ----------------------- 2005 2004 2005 2004 ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- Sales $ 251,748 $ 247,377 $ 479,467 $ 459,216 Net Income $ 15,838 $ 38,235 $ 33,416 $ 54,743 Diluted Shares 73,285 71,500 73,166 71,568 Diluted EPS $ 0.22 $ 0.53 $ 0.46 $ 0.76 Second Quarter Results Net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2005 were $251.7 million, an increase of two percent from $247.4 million last year. Reported net income was $15.8 million, or $0.22 per share, compared with $38.2 million, or $0.53 per share, a year ago. Excluding the impact of a previously announced product recall, which reduced sales by $6.3 million and after-tax income by $5.3 million, or $0.07 per share, in the current year and a one-time income tax benefit of $13.1 million, or $0.18 per share last year, net income was $21.1 million, or $0.29 per share, compared with $25.1 million, or $0.35 per share, a year ago. Commenting on the second quarter, David T. Gibbons, Perrigo Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, "Our results reflect the previously announced expense of the November 2004 retail-level recall of loratadine syrup and the lower than anticipated sales of cough and cold and pain reliever products. The weak demand in these key products is not unique to Perrigo and corresponds to tracking service data reporting a cold and flu season that just never kicked in as expected in December. Predictions were that the flu vaccine shortage would result in more sickness, but the number of people reporting cold and flu symptoms through December 2004 was 30 percent below a year ago. It reminds us that while our core business is fundamentally strong, a shift in the flu season can have an impact on us. "We are pleased that our balance sheet remained strong, with $179 million in cash and securities and cash flow from operations of $44 million in the quarter. In October 2004, the Board of Directors approved an increase in the quarterly dividend of 14 percent, from $0.035 to $0.04 per share."
Six Months Results Net sales for the six months ended Dec. 25, 2004 were $479.5 million, an increase of $20 million, or four percent, compared with $459.2 million last year. Net income for the six months was $33.4 million, or $0.46 per share, compared with $54.7 million, or $0.76 per share, a year ago. Excluding the expense of the product recall of $5.3 million after-tax, or $0.07 per share, in the current year and the income tax benefit of $13.1 million, or $0.18 per share last year, net income was $38.7 million, or $0.53 per share, compared with $41.6 million, or $0.58 per share, a year ago. Consumer Healthcare Consumer Healthcare segment sales decreased three percent to $218.8 million, compared with $225.1 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2005. The decline reflected a $6.3 million sales adjustment for the loratadine syrup recall and lower sales in cough/cold and analgesic product categories due to the weak cold and flu season, partially offset by increased sales in the vitamin category. Operating income decreased 39 percent, or $15 million, to $23.2 million, compared with $37.9 million last year, reflecting expenses for the product recall of $8.3 million and lower gross profit contributions from cough/cold and analgesic products. For the first six months of fiscal 2005, Consumer Healthcare sales were $418.4 million compared with $417.8 million in the same period last year. Operating income decreased 19 percent, or $11.8 million, to $51.0 million, compared with $62.8 million last year. Pharmaceuticals In the second quarter, the Pharmaceuticals segment recorded initial shipments of the first generic prescription drug products marketed by the Company, ibuprofen oral suspension and citalopram tablets. The Pharmaceuticals segment recorded operating expenses of $2.3 million, compared with $1.1 million a year ago as the Company continued to invest in its start- up pharmaceutical business. For the first six months of fiscal 2005, operating expenses were $3.6 million, compared with $1.4 million last year. United Kingdom Second quarter net sales for the United Kingdom operations increased $9.5 million to $24.5 million. The December 2003 acquisition of Peter Black Pharmaceuticals accounted for approximately $8 million of the increase and currency fluctuations accounted for approximately $2 million. Operating income for the second quarter was $1.7 million, compared with $0.9 million last year, a result of increased sales and improved gross margins and lower costs driven by the integration initiatives implemented over the past nine months. Sales for the first six months of fiscal 2005 were $47.7 million, compared with $27.6 million in the year ago period, and operating income was $1.9 million, compared with $1.3 million in the year ago period. Mexico Sales for the Mexico operations increased $0.9 million, or 12 percent, to $8.2 million in the second quarter. Operating income for the quarter was $1.7 million, compared with $1.1 million last year. Sales for the first six months of fiscal 2005 were $13.2 million, compared with $13.8 million last year and operating income was $1.6 million, compared with $1.4 million for the comparable six months last year. The Mexico organization continued to make good progress in improving its business model, with retail store brand sales growing 49 percent for the six months year-to-date and now representing 44 percent of total sales.
Outlook Mr. Gibbons noted, "The peak to trough pattern of the cold and flu season from last year to this year has significantly impacted near-term results. The weakness in December demand for cough/cold and analgesic products was unanticipated throughout our industry and has affected the store brand segment of consumer healthcare. In response to this situation, we have taken action to more closely manage production levels and costs for the last half of the year. We are comfortable with our inventory levels and certainly remain strong financially, as evidenced by our balance sheet and cash position, despite the poor cough/cold season. "In a new development, we began shipping nicotine gum in January and, because of production constraints, currently have more demand than we can supply. We are making every effort to increase availability as our nicotine gum product has received good acceptance at the retail level. "Because of the loratadine recall and lost future sales ($0.09 per share), the continued mild cold and flu season, and additional acquisition expenditures (approximately $3.0 million or $0.03 per share), we now anticipate earnings for the full fiscal year 2005 in the range of $0.80 to $0.84 per share and on an operating basis, in the range of $0.92 to $0.96 per share. "Our long-term outlook, for fiscal 2006 and beyond, is as positive as ever as we continue to bring important new products to the store brand consumer healthcare market. The smoking cessation category, in particular, offers significant opportunity for us today, with the potential for sales and profits similar to loratadine, a key product for Perrigo in fiscal 2004."
