[PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LETTERHEAD] EXHIBIT 99.2 AUDITORS' REPORT TO THE SHAREHOLDERS OF AGIS INDUSTRIES (1983) LTD. We have audited the financial statements of Agis Industries (1983) Ltd. (hereafter - the Company) and the consolidated financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries: balance sheets as of December 31, 2004 and 2003 and the related statements of operations, changes in shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's board of directors and management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. The financial statements for 2003 and 2002 were audited jointly with Chaikin, Cohen, Rubin & Gilboa, Certified Public Accountants. We did not audit the financial statements of certain subsidiaries, whose revenues included in consolidation constitute approximately 25.5% of total consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2002. The financial statements of the above subsidiaries were audited by other auditors, whose reports have been furnished to us, and our opinion, insofar as it relates to amounts included for those companies, is based on the reports of the other auditors. We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in Israel, including those prescribed by the Israeli Auditors (Mode of Performance) Regulations, 1973. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by the board of directors and management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits and the reports of the other auditors provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, based on our audits and the reports of the other auditors, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position - of the Company and consolidated - as of December 31, 2004 and 2003 and the results of operations, the changes in shareholders' equity and the cash flows - of the Company and consolidated - for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in Israel. Furthermore, in our opinion, the financial statements referred to above are prepared in accordance with the Israeli Securities (Preparation of Annual Financial Statements) Regulations, 1993. As explained in note 1b, the financial statements as of dates and for reporting periods subsequent to December 31, 2003, are presented in new Israeli shekels, in conformity with accounting standards issued by the Israel Accounting Standards Board. The financial statements as of dates and for reporting periods ended prior to, or on the above date, are presented in values that have been adjusted for the changes in the general purchasing power of the Israeli currency, through that date, in accordance with pronouncements of the Institute of Certified Public Accountants in Israel. ---------------------------- Kesselman & Kesselman Certified Public Accountants Tel-Aviv, Israel March 30, 2005 B-1

(AGIS LOGO) NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NIS IN THOUSANDS NOTE 1 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES The significant accounting policies, which, except for the changes required by the transition to nominal financial reporting in 2004 (see B(1) below), were applied on a consistent basis in the preparation of the financial statements, are as follows: A. GENERAL 1. ACTIVITIES a. Agis Industries (1983) Ltd. (hereafter - "the Company") and its investee companies (together hereafter - "the Group") develop, manufacture, import and market an extremely broad range of products for the enhancement of personal hygiene and health in the areas of pharmaceuticals, cosmetics and toiletries. Segment information for the reporting years is presented, in accordance with the requirements of Accounting Standard No. 11, as part of note 17. b. On November 14, 2004, the Company signed a merger agreement (hereafter - "the Merger Agreement") with Perrigo Company from the U.S.A. (hereafter - "Perrigo"), which is a US company whose shares are traded on the U.S.A. Stock Exchange (Nasdaq). On March 15, 2005, the Merger Agreement was approved by the shareholders of the Company and Perrigo in general meeting. The closing of the transaction took place on March 17, 2005. 1) Following the merger, the Company has become a wholly owned subsidiary of Perrigo and the Company's shareholders have received for the Company's shares that they hold - a consideration of 0.8011 Perrigo shares for each of their shares, and also a cash payment of US$ 14.93 per share. 2) Upon completion of the merger, Perrigo's shares began to be traded both on the Nasdaq and also on the Tel-Aviv Stock Exchange (dual listing). The Company's shares have been delisted from the Tel-Aviv Stock Exchange. 2. USE OF ESTIMATES IN THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 3. DEFINITIONS: Subsidiary - a company controlled to the extent of over 50%, the financial statements of which have been consolidated with the financial statements of the Company. Associated entity - an investee entity (which is not a subsidiary), over whose financial and operational policy the Company exerts material influence, the investment in which is presented by the equity method. Investee company - a subsidiary or associated entity. Interested party - as defined in the Israeli Securities (Preparation of Annual Financial Statements) Regulations, 1993. Goodwill - the difference between the cost of the investment in the investee company or the acquired operations and the Company's share in the fair value of the underlying assets, net of the fair value of the underlying liabilities, at time of acquisition, net of the applicable taxes. B-8
NOTE 1 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) B. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PRESENTATION BASIS The Company draws up and presents its financial statements in Israeli currency (hereafter - "shekels" or "NIS"). The financial statements of companies in the group, whose financial statements are drawn up in foreign currency, are translated into shekels or are remeasured in shekels, for the purpose of inclusion in these financial statements, as explained in 5. below. Commencing 2004, the adjustment of financial statements for the effects of inflation in Israel was discontinued, and transitory provisions for financial reporting on a nominal basis began being applied, as explained below; notwithstanding the above, the comparative figures included in these financial statements are based on the adjusted-for-inflation amounts previously reported: 1. TRANSITION TO NOMINAL FINANCIAL REPORTING IN 2004 With effect from January 1, 2004, the Company has adopted the provisions of Israel Accounting Standard No. 12 -"Discontinuance of Adjusting Financial Statements for Inflation" - of the Israel Accounting Standards Board (hereafter - "the IASB") and, pursuant thereto, the company has discontinued, from the aforesaid date, the adjustment of its financial statements for the effects of inflation in Israel. The amounts adjusted for the effects of inflation in Israel (see 2 below), presented in the financial statements as of December 31, 2003 (hereafter - "the transition date"), were used as the opening balances for the nominal financial reporting in the following periods. Additions made after the transition date have been included in the financial statements at their nominal values. Accordingly, the amounts reported in 2004 are composed as follows: amounts originating from the period that preceded the transition date are composed of their adjusted to December 2003 shekel amount, with the addition of amounts in nominal values that were added after the transition date, and net of amounts that were deducted after the transition date (the retirement of such sums is effected at their adjusted values as of transition date, their nominal values, or a combination of the two, according to the circumstances). All the amounts originating from the period after the transition date are included in the financial statements at their nominal values. 2. COMPARATIVE FIGURES - AMOUNTS ADJUSTED TO END OF 2003 SHEKELS Through December 31, 2003, the Company prepared its financial statements on the basis of historical cost adjusted for the changes in the general purchasing power of Israeli currency ("NIS") (see note 11B), in accordance with pronouncements of the Institute of Certified Public Accountants in Israel (hereafter - "the Israeli Institute"). The comparative figures included in these financial statements are based on the amounts included for the prior reporting periods, as adjusted to the consumer price index ("CPI") for December 2003 (the CPI in effect at the transition date). The components of the income statements were, for the most part, adjusted as follows: the components relating to transactions carried out during the reported period - sales, purchases, labor costs, etc. - were adjusted on the basis of the index for the month in which the transaction was carried out, while those relating to non-monetary balance sheet items (mainly - changes in inventories and depreciation) were adjusted on the same basis as the related balance sheet item. The financing component represents financial income and expenses in real terms and the erosion of balances of monetary items during the year. 3. The amounts of non-monetary assets do not necessarily represent realization value or current economic value, but only the reported amounts of such assets, as described in 1 above. In these financial statements, the term "cost" signifies cost in reported amounts. B-9
NOTE 1 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) B. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PRESENTATION BASIS (continued) 4. Condensed nominal-historical Israeli currency data of the company, for tax purposes, are presented in note 18. 5. As from January 1, 2004, the Company applies the provisions of Israel Accounting Standard No. 13 - "Effect of Changes in Foreign Currency Exchange Rates", which became effective on the date of the transition to nominal financial reporting (see B(1) above). This standard replaces Clarifications Nos. 8 and 9 to Opinion 36 of the Israeli Institute, which dealt with this issue until that date. Pursuant to this standard, the amounts (in terms of foreign currency) that are included in the financial statements of investee companies, drawn up in foreign currency, are dealt with, for the purpose of consolidation, or their inclusion under the equity method, as follows: INVESTEE COMPANIES OPERATING INDEPENDENTLY The operating results and cash flows of such companies are translated into Israeli currency at the exchange rates existing on the dates of the transactions (or at the average exchange rates for the period, where these approximate the actual exchange rates). Balance sheet items, including the balances of fair value adjustments made, and goodwill recognized, on the acquisition of these companies, are translated at the exchange rate at the end of the year. Exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in the investee company are carried as a separate item within shareholders' equity ("differences from translation of foreign currency financial statements of subsidiaries"). Upon disposal of the investment in the investee company, these exchange differences are carried to the income statement, as part of the gain or loss recognized on the disposal. Through December 31, 2003, in accordance with the clarifications to Opinion 36 of the Israeli Institute, the operating results and cash flows of such companies were translated into Israeli currency at the exchange rate at the end of the reported period. The amounts translated into Israeli currency, in respect of balance sheet items at the beginning of the reported year and in respect of changes in shareholders' equity items during the year, were adjusted after being translated, to year-end shekels on the basis of the changes in the CPI through the end of the year. Additionally, as prescribed in the above clarifications, goodwill recognized on the acquisition of an investee company, was previously treated as an asset of the investor company (translated into shekels on acquisition date, and adjusted subsequently for the changes in general purchasing power of the Israeli currency). The transition of the goodwill into an asset of the investee company, as prescribed by Standard No. 13, has been effected by translating the foreign currency amount of its unamortized balance into shekels, at the exchange rate on the transition date; the effect of the difference resulting from this translation is immaterial. INVESTEE COMPANIES THE ACTIVITIES OF WHICH ARE AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE ACTIVITIES OF THE INVESTOR COMPANY The amounts (in terms of foreign currency) included in the financial statements of such companies were remeasured into shekels. The remeasurement was effected by way of translation of the amounts into shekels, on the basis of historical exchange rates in relation to Israeli currency. Differences resulting from the above treatment are included in the statements of operations under financial income or expenses. Through December 31, 2003, the shekel amounts resulting from the aforesaid translation were then adjusted on the basis of the changes in the CPI by the same method used in the financial statements of the Company, with the inflation-adjusted amounts as of December 31, 2003 providing the base for the nominal financial reporting in the following periods. B-10
NOTE 1 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) C. PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION 1. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. The companies included in consolidation are listed in the appendix. 2. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Profits from intercompany sales, not yet realized outside the Group, have also been eliminated. D. CASH EQUIVALENTS The Group considers all highly liquid investments, which include short-term bank deposits (up to three months from date of deposit) that are not restricted as to withdrawal or use, short-term government bonds and other marketable government debentures, the period to maturity of which did not exceed three months at time of investment, to be cash equivalents. E. MARKETABLE SECURITIES These securities are stated at market or - for participation certificates in mutual funds - redemption value. The changes in value of the above securities are carried to financing income or expenses. F. ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS The allowance is determined partly as a fixed percentage of trade receivables, based on past experience, and partly in respect of specific debts doubtful of collection. G. INVENTORIES Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined as follows: Raw materials and supplies - on "first-in, first-out" basis. Work in progress and finished goods - on basis of production costs: Raw material and supplies component - on "first-in first-out" basis. Labor and overheads component - on annual average basis. Purchased products - on "first-in, first-out" basis. H. OTHER INVESTMENT Investment in shares of a company is stated at cost, net of a provision for decrease in value, which is not of a temporary nature (see also note 13.(m)(6)). I. FIXED ASSETS 1. These assets are stated at cost, net of related investment grants. Fixed assets of operations acquired are included at their fair value at date of acquisition of these operations. 2. Cost of improvements - that contribute to the improvement of the quality of products or the increase of production or the estimated useful life of the products - and renovation of fixed assets, are carried to the cost of these assets. 3. With regard to the capitalization of costs incurred to prevent environmental pollution, see 1.(U) below. B-11
NOTE 1 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) I. FIXED ASSETS (continued) 4. The assets are depreciated by the straight-line method, on basis of their estimated useful life. Annual rates of depreciation are as follows: Leasehold improvements are amortized by the straight-line method over the term of the lease, which is shorter than the estimated useful life of the improvements. * On October 1, 2003, the useful life estimate of certain production facilities was altered from 10 years to 15 years. Accordingly, the depreciated balance of said facilities as of that date is depreciated over the period remaining to them, up to 15 years. The alteration was performed in accordance with the opinion of outside engineers. The opinion was based on past experience with respect to said facilities, the physical condition of the facilities and the anticipated technological developments and their effect on the future operation of the facilities. The effect on the income before taxes in 2003 amounted to approximately NIS 1.7 million. J. OTHER ASSETS AND DEFERRED EXPENSES OTHER ASSETS: Other assets are stated at cost and amortized in equal annual installments over a period that does not exceed their economic life. Annual rates of amortization are as follows: * Consists mainly of the goodwill, which arose upon the acquisition of operations by the U.S. subsidiary Clay-Park Labs, Inc. (hereafter - "CP"), which is presented in the consolidated balance sheets under "other assets and deferred expenses" and is amortized in equal annual installments over a period of 20 years, commencing in the year of acquisition. In Company management's opinion, amortizing the goodwill over a period of 20 years fairly reflects the Company's anticipated period of economic benefit, in light of the specific circumstances of the acquired operations, as follows: a. The loyalty that characterizes customers in the pharmaceuticals industry. b. The expensive process that is required to obtain licenses and approval from the supervisory bodies acts as a barrier to potential competitors. B-12
NOTE 1 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) J. OTHER ASSETS AND DEFERRED EXPENSES (continued) DEFERRED EXPENSES Costs of raising loans are amortized over the repayment period of the loans. K. IMPAIRMENT OF ASSETS In February 2003, Accounting Standard No. 15 of the IASB - "Impairment of Assets", became effective. This standard requires a periodic review to evaluate the need for a provision for the impairment of the Company's non-monetary assets - fixed assets and identifiable intangibles, including goodwill, as well as investments in associated entities. Accordingly, commencing with the interim financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2003, the Company assesses - at each balance sheet date - whether any events have occurred or changes in circumstances have taken place, which might indicate that there has been an impairment of one or more of the above assets. When such indicators of impairment are present, the Company evaluates whether the carrying value of the asset in the Company's accounts can be recovered from the cash flows anticipated from that asset, and, if necessary, to record an impairment provision up to the amount needed to adjust the carrying amount to the recoverable amount. The recoverable value of an asset is determined according to the higher of the net selling price of the asset or its value in use to the Company. The value in use is determined according to the present value of anticipated cash flows from the continued use of the asset, including those expected at the time of its future retirement and disposal. When it is not possible to assess whether an impairment provision is required for a particular asset on its own, the need for such a provision is assessed in relation to the recoverable value of the cash-generating unit to which that asset belongs. A cash-generating unit includes goodwill allocated to that unit, and any impairment loss relating to that unit is to be initially allocated to the goodwill and then to the other assets. L. DEBENTURES In the consolidated financial statements, the debentures held by a subsidiary are set-off against the amount of the debentures issued. M. COMPANY SHARES HELD BY THE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES These shares are presented - at their cost to the Company and the subsidiaries - as a deduction from shareholders' equity, under "cost of shares in Company held by the Company and subsidiaries". Gains, net of losses and the related tax, arising from the sale of these shares, are credited directly to "capital reserves". N. REVENUE RECOGNITION 1. Sale of products Revenue from sale of products is recognized upon shipment (when title passes to the customer). Provisions for discounts and other provisions relating to price adjustments (where it has been agreed with customers that the price is conditional) are estimated and deducted from sales. B-13
NOTE 1 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) N. REVENUE RECOGNITION (continued) 2. Production work for others Revenue for performing production work for others is included upon shipment. When the Company is entitled to indemnification in respect of minimum anticipated unclaimed amounts, the resulting revenue is recognized over the related period. 3. Sale of know-how Revenue from sale of know-how and grant of usage rights thereto is recognized with the consideration receivable being earned. O. DISCOUNTS FROM SUPPLIERS Discounts received from suppliers, on a periodic basis, regarding which the Company has not committed to meet specific targets, are included in the financial statements in accordance with, and on the basis of, the purchases actually made. Discounts, receipt of which is conditional/ on the Company reaching a minimum purchase level (quantitative or financial), are included in the financial statements on a pro-rata basis, in accordance with the amount of purchases actually made by the Company from the relevant suppliers during the relevant period, provided that the attainment of the targets appears probable and that the discount amount can be estimated with reasonable certainty. Among the factors used to estimate the discount amount are the Company's past experience and the forecasted amount of purchases from the relevant suppliers during the remainder of the period.. P. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES Research and development expenses are charged to income as incurred. Participations from government departments and from others in joint ventures are recognized as a reduction of expense, as the related costs are incurred (see also note 8A(4)). Q. DERIVATIVES The Company conducts transactions in derivatives in order to reduce its exposures on existing assets and liabilities and certain firm commitments in foreign currency to fluctuations in the exchange rates of those currencies. Gains and losses on these transactions are recognized in income commensurate with the results from the related assets or liabilities, or deferred and recognized in income as part of the measurement of the results of the underlying hedged transactions, as appropriate. Transactions that do not meet the criteria to qualify as hedging transactions, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in Israel, are presented in the balance sheets at their fair values. Changes in the fair values of the derivatives are included in the statements of operations under financing income or expenses. R. DEFERRED TAXES 1. Deferred taxes are computed in respect of differences between the amounts presented in the financial statements and those taken into account for tax purposes. As to the main factors in respect of which deferred taxes have been included - see note 10. B-14
NOTE 1 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) R. DEFERRED TAXES (continued) 1. (continued) Deferred tax assets are computed for carryforward tax deductions and losses, up to the level of the credit balance of deferred taxes, or, if there is likelihood that they will be utilized, they are computed in accordance with management's assessment. Deferred tax balances are computed at the tax rate expected to be in effect at time of release to income from the deferred tax accounts. The amount of deferred taxes presented in the statements of operations reflects changes in the above balances during the year. 2. Taxes, which would apply in the event of disposal of investments in investee companies, have not been taken into account in computing the deferred taxes, as it is the Company's policy to hold these investments, not to realize them. 3. The Group may incur an additional tax liability in the event of a dividend distribution out of certain profits between Group companies or to its shareholders; no account was taken of such additional tax, since it is the Group's policy not to cause distribution of a dividend, which would involve additional tax liability to the Group, in the foreseeable future. S. NET INCOME PER NIS 1 OF PAR VALUE OF SHARES Net income per NIS 1 of par value of shares is computed in accordance with Opinion 55 of the Israeli Institute. As to the data used in determining the aforesaid income - see note 14. T. LINKAGE BASIS Balances, the linkage arrangements in respect of which stipulate linkage to the last index published prior to date of payment, are stated on the basis of the last index published prior to balance sheet date (the index for November). Balances denominated in foreign currency, or linked thereto, are included in the financial statements according to the exchange rates as of the balance sheet date. U. ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS Regular operating and maintenance costs of installations for the prevention of environmental pollution, relating to environmental rehabilitation arising from current or past operations, are charged to the statements of operations. Costs for the prevention of environmental pollution, that increase the life or enhance the efficiency of the installations, or that reduce or prevent environmental pollution, are included in fixed assets and depreciated in accordance with the Group's usual depreciation policy. V. DIVIDEND DECLARED SUBSEQUENT TO BALANCE SHEET DATE Liabilities relating to dividends declared subsequent to balance sheet date are included in the accounts for the period in which the declaration was made. The amount declared is appropriated, however, from retained earnings, and reported as a separate item in the shareholders' equity - "Dividend declared after balance sheet date". B-15
NOTE 1 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) W. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENT In July 2004, the IASB issued Israel Accounting Standard No. 19 - "Taxes on Income", which is based on International Accounting Standard No. 12, that prescribes the accounting treatment (recognition criteria, measurement, presentation and disclosure) required for taxes on income. This accounting standard is to be applied to financial statements covering periods commencing on, or after, January 1, 2005. For the most part, the provisions of this standard are the same as the accounting principles that are customarily applied at present (see R. above). Nevertheless, the following matters will affect the deferred taxes and tax expenses included in the financial statements for reporting periods subsequent to the standard's effective date: The standard requires deferred taxes to also be created in respect of the difference between the amount included in the financial statements for land and the amount thereof taken into account for tax purposes (temporary difference). The standard requires deferred taxes to be created in respect of the land owned by the Company at the time of the standard becoming effective, and will result in a cumulative effect in respect of prior years. The tax saving in respect of the unrealized profits on transactions between Group companies will be recorded at the tax rate applicable to the purchasing company and will result in the inclusion of a cumulative effect in respect of previous years. NOTE 2 - INVESTMENTS IN INVESTEE COMPANIES A. COMPOSITION: * Solely represents investments in subsidiaries. ** Linked to the CPI and bearing interest at the rate of 6% per annum. B-16
NOTE 2 - INVESTMENTS IN INVESTEE COMPANIES (continued) B. THE CHANGES IN THE INVESTMENTS DURING 2004 ARE AS FOLLOWS: C. As to goodwill, see notes 1J and 5. D. DANAGIS LTD. (HEREAFTER - DANAGIS) Danagis is an associated company owned equally by a subsidiary and Denshar Ltd. Danagis distributes the consumer products of the Group and of Denshar Ltd. As to the guarantees securing Danagis' bank indebtedness, see note 8B. E. INFRASERV GMBH & CO. WIESBADEN KG (HEREAFTER - INFRASERV) On October 1, 2002, the Company signed - through a German subsidiary - a series of agreements, whereby it acquired an API manufacturing plant. The amount invested in acquiring the plant totaled NIS 27,839,000 (approximately E 6 million). In addition, in accordance with the aforesaid agreements, the German subsidiary has acquired a 7% share in a limited partnership - InfraServ GmbH & Co. Wiesbaden KG (hereafter - "InfraServ") that owns land and buildings in the industrial zone in which the plant of the German subsidiary is located and also provides industrial services to various companies in this zone. The cost of acquisition of this investment is to be paid out of the dividend distributions made by InfraServ during the years 2002-2006, and any balance will be settled by the end of 2007 at the latest (see note 6). B-17
NOTE 3 - OTHER INVESTMENTS AND LONG-TERM LOANS COMPOSITION: (1) Debt from Nesh Cosmetics (1992) Ltd. (hereafter - "Nesh"), partly linked to the CPI and bearing interest and partly unlinked and bearing variable interest. The debt is to be repaid by the setting-off of some of the annual profits to which Nesh will be entitled under the agreement signed (see note 8A(1)(d)). The Company anticipates that the debt will be repaid within 10 years. The debt is included accordingly in the books. To secure repayment of the debt, the Company registered a first-ranking lien on Nesh's goodwill. (2) A loan that was granted against a promissory note to a senior employee, who was formerly a minority shareholder in CP. Should this employee continue to be employed for a period of three years from 2004, the note will be converted into a grant. B-18
NOTE 4 - FIXED ASSETS - DEPRECIATED BALANCE A. COMPOSITION AND CHANGES DURING THE YEAR: * Includes medical equipment. B-19
NOTE 4 - FIXED ASSETS - DEPRECIATED BALANCE (continued) B. The fixed assets are net of investment grants, as follows: C. LAND RIGHTS: 1. The Group leases most of the land, on which its operations are conducted in southern Israel, from the Israel Lands Administration, under long-term leases (most of the leases terminate in the period between 2016-2049), and, in certain instances, there are options to renew the lease. Some of the real estate property and long-term lease rights have not yet been registered in the names of the Group companies at the Land Registry. 2. A subsidiary's plant in the center of Israel is located on land, the title to which has been registered in the name of the subsidiary. 3. Some of the Company's facilities in Israel and overseas are located on leased premises, see note 8A(3). D. As to pledges on assets - see note 12. E. As to the closing of a subsidiary's plant site, see note 13M(1). NOTE 5 - OTHER ASSETS AND DEFERRED EXPENSES * Consists mainly of the goodwill arising on the acquisition of an activity by CP, and adjusted on the basis of exchange differences, as described in note 1b(5). The changes in the original amount in 2004 are due solely to translation differences. B-20
NOTE 6 - LONG-TERM LOANS AND OTHER LIABILITIES A. COMPOSITION: * The loans bear interest at variable rates. As to an interest swap, whereby the variable interest was fixed at the effective rate of 2.8% (including the margin), see note 15C. As to the requirements of covenants to secure the loans, see note 12. The transaction meets the criteria to qualify as a hedging transaction, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. ** The loan units were received on December 3, 2003 and bear interest at a fixed rate, payable on a semi-annual basis. The principal of the loans is linked to the increase in the CPI and is repayable in three equal installments in December of each of the years 2007-2009. On January 8, 2004, the Company transacted an interest swap in the notional amount of NIS 65.7 million ($ 15 million), under which it swapped the aforementioned terms for linkage to the dollar with the addition of variable interest based on the Libor + 2%. In addition, the Company entered into a hedge transaction, in respect of extreme changes in the rate of the Libor interest rate, in the notional amount of NIS 32.8 million ($ 7.5 million), see note 15C. These transactions do not meet the criteria to qualify as hedging transactions, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. *** Including current maturity in respect of commitments for the acquisition of fixed assets amounting to NIS 1,607,000, which is included in trade payables (December 31, 2003 - NIS 2,137,000). B-21
NOTE 6 - LONG-TERM LOANS AND OTHER LIABILITIES (continued) B. The liabilities (net of current maturities) mature in the following years after the balance sheet dates: NOTE 7 - LIABILITIES FOR EMPLOYEE TERMINATION BENEFITS, NET A. PENSION AND SEVERANCE PAY 1. COMPANIES IN ISRAEL Labor laws and agreements require the Israeli companies in the Group to pay severance pay to employees dismissed or retiring from their employ in certain other circumstances. Severance pay is calculated on the basis of the length of the employees' service, and usually at their latest monthly salary on the basis of one month's salary for every year worked, and based on salary components that, in management's opinion, create entitlement to severance pay. The liabilities in respect of employees' rights to severance pay are covered as follows: a) In accordance with collective labor agreements, the Israeli companies in the Group make regular deposits with external pension funds in respect of a portion of their employees. These plans fully cover 72% of the severance pay liability. b) The Israeli companies in the Group make regular deposits to severance pay funds and to purchase managerial insurance policies in the employees' names, in respect of the employees who have elected this option. These insurance policies cover the severance pay liability in respect of those employees. The amounts deposited in the aforesaid funds and policies are included in the balance sheets, since they are under the control and management of the companies. c) Some of the Group's senior employees have agreements for increased retirement bonuses at rates of 150%-200%. d) The liability included in the balance sheets includes the balance of the abovementioned liabilities, as well as a long-term liability in respect of "advance notice" agreements with respect to employees who are likely to utilize their right, as above, including in respect of a former Chief Executive Officer (see notes 8A(2)(d) and 13M(3)). B-22
NOTE 7 - LIABILITIES FOR EMPLOYEE TERMINATION BENEFITS, NET (continued) A. PENSION AND SEVERANCE PAY (continued) 2. FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES The employees of the U.S. subsidiary have pension plans based on deposits at specified percentages of their salaries. These plans fully cover the subsidiary's liability. The liabilities for pension payments covered by these plans are not reflected in the financial statements, since all the risks relating to the payment of pensions as described above have been passed to the pension funds. The employees of the German subsidiary have an in-house pension plan. The liability is presented on the basis of an actuarial computation. The actuarial computation was based on the following assumptions: capitalization rate of 5.00%, salary increases of 2.50% and increases in the pension rate of 1.75%. The liability presented in the balance sheets includes the balance of the liabilities that are not covered. B. GENERAL FUND The Group deposits funds, at its discretion, in a fund earmarked to cover the liabilities referred to above, which are not covered by the regular deposits. The funds are deposited with general severance pay funds, which are managed by leading Israeli banks. Withdrawals from the fund are subject to compliance with the provisions stipulated in the Severance Pay Law. C. The balance sheet liability for employee termination benefits, and the amounts funded as stated above, are composed as follows: B-23
NOTE 8 - COMMITMENTS, LIENS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES A. COMMITMENTS 1. Operating agreements: a. Subsidiaries have manufacturing and distribution agreements with third parties relating to pharmaceuticals and consumer products. These agreements terminate between 2005-2007. b. The Company has several long-standing relationships and trade agreements with overseas suppliers in connection with the import of pharmaceuticals and raw materials. The Company has been working with one of its principal suppliers, Schering AG, for several decades without a written agreement. In 2001, an agreement was signed with Bayer AG, which expired on December 31, 2004. In 2005, the parties made an interim agreement and are interested in shortly signing an agreement that will be valid until the end of 2006. The Company has an agreement with Bayer Diagnostics Europe Ltd. The agreement is for five years, commencing on November 1, 2003, and is automatically renewed, unless one of the parties gives 12-months' advance notice of his intention to terminate the agreement. The agreements signed mainly reflect the actual relationships existing until and as of their signing. In addition, the Company and its subsidiaries are committed to pay royalties and other commissions of 2%-15% on the sales of some of their products. c. A subsidiary in Germany has a 10-year manufacturing agreement, commencing in October 2002; with regard to the first 5 years, the agreement stipulates minimum annual quantities and predetermines the selling prices. d. On December 31, 2003, the Company signed an agreement with Nesh, pursuant to which Nesh's operations have been merged with the operations of subsidiaries engaged in the field of consumer products. Nesh is entitled to a 25% share of the results from the merged operations, as defined in the agreement (after adding a loading for working capital financing and other expenses, as prescribed in the agreement). Nesh's abovementioned share of the profits is included within the framework of selling expenses. In February 2003, the Company started preparing for this merger. The agreement also stipulates the repayment terms for the loans granted to Nesh (see note 3(2)). e. In April 2003, the Company signed a licensing agreement with Ortho McNeil Pharmaceutical Inc. (hereafter - Ortho), a company wholly owned by the Johnson & Johnson group, whereby Ortho has been granted exclusive usage rights to the drug "Mupirocin Ointment", which was developed by the Company and whose formula is protected by patent. Such usage is in accordance with the approval granted to the Company by the U.S. Food and Drugs Administration (hereafter - "the FDA") in December 2002. In consideration for the grant of the above rights, Ortho paid NIS 58 million ($ 13 million) (NIS 37 million after tax) during May 2003, which the Company credited to income in 2003; through to 2010, Ortho is to also make payments to the Company that are to be based on a percentage of product sales, but which shall not be less than the minimum amounts stipulated under the terms of the agreement. B-24
NOTE 8 - COMMITMENTS, LIENS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES (continued) A. COMMITMENTS (continued) 1. Operating agreements (continued) e. (continued) In parallel with the above agreement, a subsidiary, CP, and Ortho signed an agreement for the supply of the product by CP (hereafter - "the supply agreement"); pursuant to the supply agreement, CP is to manufacture the product for Ortho for a consideration based on CP's forecasted manufacturing costs and, in addition, CP received a one-time payment of NIS 8.8 million ($ 2 million). The payment received under the supply agreement is credited to revenues based on the proportion that the actual manufacturing bears to the overall forecasted manufacturing during the forecast period referred to in the supply agreement. As of December 31, 2004, NIS 7,433,000 ($ 1,721,000) of the above amount had been credited to revenues. f. The Company and CP have signed several agreements with various research institutes (CROs), mainly in the U.S., for the purpose of their performing clinical testing for the research and development programs of the Agis Group. The total value of research work ordered by the Company pursuant to these agreements, but which had still to be carried out as of December 31, 2004, amounts to NIS 19,476,000 ($ 4,521,000). g. In December 2004, the Company and CP have signed a supply agreement with Taro Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd and its subsidiaries (hereafter - "Taro"), pursuant to which Taro is to supply CP with "mometazone cream", which is a generic version of Scherring-Plough's product. In accordance with the terms of the agreement, the cream is to be produced at Taro's plants and is to be marketed in the U.S.A. by CP. h. The Group has a distribution agreement with Danagis for the distribution of the Group's consumer products, in return for a distribution commission. i. A subsidiary has entered into an agreement with a leading European company in the field of marketing and registration of products for the distribution of profits in connection with the development, production and marketing of a number of generic drugs.

Commitments with employees and officers: a. At the same time that the Merger Agreement with Perrigo referred to in note 1A(1)(b) above was signed, Mr. Moshe Arkin, an interested party of the Company, signed a number of related agreements. b. The Company's CEO has signed an employment agreement for a 3-year period that commenced on the date of closing the merger transaction, pursuant to which he will continue in his present position as CEO of the Company and shall also serve as a senior vice president of Perrigo. In the event of the CEO's employment being terminated before the expiration date of the agreement, he shall be paid the balance of all amounts due to him under the agreement. B-25
NOTE 8 - COMMITMENTS, LIENS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES (continued) A. COMMITMENTS (continued) 2. Commitments with employees and officers (continued): c. Past senior officers of the Company (see note 13M(3)) have personal employment contracts, which entitle them, in addition to their regular salary, to a bonus that is dependent upon the financial results of the Company and its subsidiaries (see also note 16). The contract periods end in 2006. d. Certain employees, if certain conditions are fulfilled, entitled to "prior notice" of varying periods, as specified in the contracts signed with them - including in the event of the transfer of control in the Company. No provision has been included in the accounts in respect of employees for whom the Company does not anticipate that the aforementioned conditions will be fulfilled. The Company has included a provision for those employees who will exercise their entitlement, as above, including in respect of the former Chief Executive Officer (see note 13M(3)). e In November 2002, a senior CP employee was granted an option to acquire 50,000 of the Company's shares at the price of $ 7.5 per share. The option for the acquisition of 25,000 shares will vest on December 31, 2005, and the balance has expired due to failing to meet the CP sales targets. All the above options expire on December 31, 2008. f. In November 2004, the CP's CEO was granted an option to acquire 50,000 of the Company's shares at the price of $ 23.02 per share. The option vests in five equal annual installments. Within the framework of the merger agreement with perrigo, these options will be converted into perrigo option. 3. Commitments relating to rental agreements: a. The Israeli companies in the Group have a lease with an interested party in respect of the office buildings that they use. The lease expires in 2006, but may be renewed for a further 5 years. The rental is linked half to the dollar and to the US CPI and half to the Israeli CPI. The projected rental payments for the next three years, at rates in effect at December 31, 2004, amount to NIS 2,408,000 in each of the years between 2005 and 2007. b. Other Israeli subsidiaries have leases in respect of the buildings and laboratories that they use. These leases have an average term of approximately one to two years, with renewal options of two to four years. The rentals are mainly linked to the CPI. The projected annual rental payments for the coming years, at rates in effect at December 31, 2004 amount to NIS 9,002,000. c. A subsidiary in the U.S. has leases in respect of the buildings that it uses. These leases expire through 2014. The rentals are in dollars.

NOTE 8 - COMMITMENTS, LIENS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES (continued) A. COMMITMENTS (continued) 4. Commitments in respect of royalties: a. The Company and a subsidiary are committed to pay royalties to the Government of Israel on proceeds from sales of products in the development of which the Government participates by way of grants. Under the terms of the Company's funding from the Israeli Government, royalties of 2%-3.5% are payable on sales of products developed from projects so funded, up to 100% of the amount received by the Company, in respect of each product separately. The amount to be refunded from the royalties is dollar-linked and, from January 1, 1999, interest is added at an annual rate based on Libor. At December 31, 2004, the maximum royalty amount payable by the Company with regard to future sales is approximately NIS 39,256,000. b. A subsidiary is committed to additional payments in respect of the acquisition of know-how and trademark. These payments are conditioned to the sale of the product manufactured using the acquired know-how and will not exceed NIS 5,170,000 ($ 1.2 million). B. GUARANTEES: The Company has given a guarantee to secure the bank debts of foreign subsidiaries that amounted to NIS 170,378,000 at December 31, 2004 (see also notes 6 and 12C). The Company has unlimitedly guaranteed the liabilities of Agis Group companies in Israel to banks, and, correspondingly, has received unlimited guarantees in respect of its own debts to banks from Agis Group companies in Israel. As of December 31, 2004, group companies do not have liabilities to banks in relation to this guarantee. The Company has given a guarantee to a bank to secure the indebtedness of Danagis Ltd. of up to NIS 2,000,000 million, but not in excess of 50% of Danagis' bank debts. C. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES: 1. In November 1997 and January 1998, claims totaling $ 31 million in aggregate were lodged against CP for damages allegedly caused as a result of the emission of a minimal amount of material from the CP laboratory. In several hearings held to date, in various levels of courts in the U.S., the last of which was held in the New York State Supreme Court in November 1999, most of the claims were dismissed. CP has already filed responses to the remaining claims, which relate to personal injury, and intends to mount a vigorous defense against these claims. CP has also filed claims against several insurance companies in connection with the above claims. Since these are personal injury claims, CP is unable to assess the amount that might be awarded should these claims prevail. However, in management's opinion, based on examinations conducted by CP's doctor, who was unable to identify any permanent injuries to the claimants he examined, and in accordance with the opinion of the Company's legal counsel, the financial damages being claimed are not supported by the facts being put forward to justify them, and the maximum amount that CP is likely to be required to pay, if at all, is not a significant amount for the Company and, accordingly, no provision therefor has been made in the financial statements. B-27
NOTE 8 - COMMITMENTS, LIENS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES (continued) C. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES: (continued) 2. A number of claims and other legal actions, which have arisen in the ordinary course of business, are pending against the Group. Some of these claims are for amounts that are not significant, or company management believes that it has good chances to win these claims. The Group has appropriate insurance cover for a part of the above claims and actions and, accordingly, no provisions therefor have been created in the financial statements. 3. In respect of benefits pursuant to the Law for the Encouragement of Capital Investments, 1959 (hereafter - "the Law") Pursuant to the Law, the Company and certain subsidiaries received grants from the State of Israel in respect of their investments in the construction or expansion of their facilities, as well as tax benefits (see note 10). The grant and tax benefits are contingent upon compliance with certain conditions. If the companies do not comply with the conditions, they will have to repay the amounts of the grant and the tax benefits, plus interest and linkage differentials, from the date received. In the opinion of company management, the companies have fulfilled the essential conditions of the instruments of approval. 4. In May 2004, the Ministry of the Environment imposed additional conditions on the business license of a subsidiary that has a plant at Ramat Hovav. According to Company experts, the new conditions are extremely strict, to the extent that - under present circumstances - it is not possible to assess the full extent of their actual implementation or the costs that this would involve. The subsidiary, together with other companies that received similar demands have lodged an administrative petition for the cancellation of the conditions on the grounds of their being unreasonable. Subsequent to balance sheet date, the parties have agreed to go to take this matter to mediation. 5. As to disputed income tax assessments, see note 10 G. 6. In 2003, the Document Stamp Duty Law, 1961 (hereafter - Stamp Duty Law) was amended, pursuant to which the list included in the Stamp Duty Law was updated. During 2004, the Company - as well as many other Israeli companies - received requests from the tax authorities to furnish documents. In September 2004, a petition was filed with the High Court of Justice to prohibit the process of requesting documents to be furnished and to require the tax authorities to publicly publish their interpretive position regarding the meaning of the Stamp Duty Law, prior to any attempt by them to enforce this law. As of the date of approval of the financial statements, this petition is pending before the High Court of Justice. In the opinion of the Company's management, in light of the uncertainty involved in the implementation of the law, it is not possible at this stage to estimate the potential effect, if any, on the financial statements. B-28

RETAINED EARNINGS Pursuant to the new Companies Law, which took effect in 2000, the acquisition of the Company's shares by the Company or its subsidiaries is treated as a distribution of profits out of the Company's retained earnings. C. CAPITAL RESERVES Capital reserves mainly consist of the premium on shares. NOTE 10 - TAXES ON INCOME A. CORPORATE TAXATION IN ISRAEL 1. Measurements of results for tax purposes under Income Tax (inflationary Adjustments) Law, 1985 (hereafter - the inflationary adjustments law) a) Under the inflationary adjustments law, results for tax purposes are measured in real terms, having regard to the changes in the CPI. The Company and its Israeli subsidiaries are taxed under this law. b) By virtue of the inflationary adjustments law, the Company and subsidiaries, which own industrial enterprises (see C(2) below), are entitled to claim accelerated depreciation on their fixed assets, instead of claiming accelerated depreciation under the law, as described in C(1)(b) below. B-29
NOTE 10 - TAXES ON INCOME (continued) A. CORPORATE TAXATION IN ISRAEL (continued) 2. Tax rates The income of the Company and its Israeli subsidiaries (which are not entitled to benefits for "approved enterprises", as referred to in C below) is taxed at the regular rate. Through to December 31, 2003, the corporate tax was 36%. In July 2004, an amendment to the Income Tax Ordinance was enacted. One of the provisions of this amendment is that the corporate tax rate is to be gradually reduced from 36% to 30%, in the following manner: the rate for 2004 will be 35%, in 2005 - 34%, in 2006 - 32%, and in 2007 and thereafter - 30%. The effect of the change in the tax rates in the coming years, on the deferred tax balances at the date of the amendment to the law, is included under the item "taxes on income" in the statements of operations - see note F(1) below. B. SUBSIDIARIES OUTSIDE ISRAEL Subsidiaries that are incorporated outside of Israel are assessed for tax under the tax laws in their countries of residence. The principal tax rates applicable to subsidiaries outside Israel are as follows: Company incorporated in the USA - tax rate of 42%. Company incorporated in Germany- tax rate of 37%. C. ENCOURAGEMENT LAWS IN ISRAEL 1. TAX BENEFITS UNDER THE LAW FOR THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF CAPITAL INVESTMENTS, 1959 (HEREAFTER - THE LAW) Under the law, by virtue of the "approved enterprise" status granted to certain of their enterprises, the Company and certain Israeli subsidiaries are entitled to various tax benefits. The main tax benefits available to the abovementioned companies are: a. Reduced tax rates During the period of benefits - mainly 10 years, but 7 years in some instances, commencing in the first year in which the companies earn taxable income from the approved enterprises (provided the maximum period to which it is restricted by law has not elapsed) - the following reduced tax rates or tax exemptions apply to the income derived from the companies' approved enterprises: 1) Tax exemption on income from certain approved enterprises in Development Zone "A" in respect of which the companies have elected the "alternative benefits" (involving waiver of investment grants); the length of the exemption period is 10 years. The periods of benefits in respect of the activated enterprises of the Company and the investee companies expire in the years 2008-2012. 2) Tax exemption on income from certain approved enterprises in respect of which the companies have elected the "investment grant"; the length of the exemption period is 2 years, after which the income from these enterprises is taxable at the rate of 25%, rather than at the regular tax, for 5 years, which ended in 2004. The benefits period for enterprises that have not yet been activated has not yet commenced, but is limited to 2016. B-30
NOTE 10 - TAXES ON INCOME (continued) C. ENCOURAGEMENT LAWS IN ISRAEL (continued) 1. TAX BENEFITS UNDER THE LAW FOR THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF CAPITAL INVESTMENTS, 1959 (HEREAFTER - THE LAW) (continued) a. Reduced tax rates (continued) 3) The Company has an "establishment" approval for an "enterprise with alternative benefits" which has not yet been activated, which would entitle the Company to a tax exemption in respect of the income derived therefrom, for a period of 10 years. The benefits period is limited to 2014. In the event of distribution of cash dividends out of income, which was tax exempt as above, the companies would have to pay the 25% tax in respect of the amount distributed. Since it is the Group's policy not to cause distribution of dividend, which would involve additional tax liability to the Group in the foreseeable future, no provision has been made for such tax. From the end of the benefits period referred to above, the income from these enterprises will be liable to tax at the regular tax rate. The proportion of the taxable income entitled to benefits of reduced tax rates, other than as an "establishment" enterprise as referred to above, is calculated on the basis of the ratio between the turnover of the "approved enterprise" and the whole turnover of the Company; the turnover applicable to the "approved enterprise" is calculated, as a general rule, by taking the increase resulting from the comparison of the Company's turnover with its "basic" turnover, which is prescribed as being the turnover during the last year before the activation of the "approved enterprise", or such other basis as is stipulated in the instrument of approval. b. Accelerated depreciation The companies are entitled to claim accelerated depreciation for five tax years commencing in the first year of operation of each asset, in respect of buildings, machinery and equipment used by the approved enterprise (see 10.A(1)(b) above). c. Conditions for entitlement to the benefits The entitlement to the above benefits is conditional upon the companies' fulfilling the conditions stipulated by the law, regulations published thereunder and the instruments of approval for the specific investments in approved enterprises. In the event of failure to comply with these conditions, the benefits may be cancelled, in whole or in part, and the companies may be required to refund the amount of the benefits with the addition of arrears interest. As of the publication date of the financial statements, most of the necessary performance certificates had been received from the Investment Center. B-31
NOTE 10 - TAXES ON INCOME (continued) C. ENCOURAGEMENT LAWS IN ISRAEL (continued) 2. THE LAW FOR THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF INDUSTRY (TAXATION), 1969 a. The Company and certain subsidiaries in Israel are "industrial companies", as defined by this law. As such, these companies are entitled to claim depreciation at increased rates for equipment used in industrial activity as stipulated by regulations published under the inflationary adjustments law, and have done so. b. The Company and a certain subsidiary have a common line of production and are therefore entitled to file consolidated tax returns in accordance with section 23 of the Law for the Encouragement of Industry. Pursuant to the arrangement between the Company and the subsidiary with which the Company files consolidated tax returns as stated above, each of these companies is entitled to set off its tax losses against the taxable income of the other within the framework of the consolidated tax return. The company utilizing the tax losses of the other is to compensate the other company for the tax saving it is entitled to, linked to the CPI. D. LOSSES, THE DEDUCTION FOR INFLATION AND THE "REAL DIFFERENCE" IN RESPECT OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES FOR TAX PURPOSES, CARRIED FORWARD TO FUTURE YEARS As of December 31, 2004, carryforward losses, the balance of the deduction for inflation and other deductions in respect of subsidiaries aggregate approximately NIS 5,631,000 in the United States and approximately NIS 344,000 in Israel and, as of December 31, 2003, approximately NIS 10,097,000 and approximately NIS 8,708,000, respectively. As to a participation receivable from the state of New York, see note 3 and 13.M(2). The "real loss" on realization of marketable securities aggregates approximately NIS 9,113,000 at December 31, 2004. This loss is deductible from future "real income" from marketable securities, if any. No deferred taxes have been included in respect of such loss. Under the inflationary adjustments law, carryforward losses, the deduction for inflation and the "real difference" in respect of marketable securities are linked to the CPI. The losses of overseas subsidiaries are denominated in dollars and euros. The periods during which the losses in the United States may be utilized end between 2010-2021. B-32

In addition, certain employees of the Company are entitled to receive an advance notice under certain circumstances. The expenses include a provision in respect of Mr. Bianco, as well as in respect of employees who are to utilize their right, as above. During 2004, the Company has adjusted the provisions relating to various liabilities to senior officers who are no longer in office. B-44
NOTE 13 - SUPPLEMENTARY FINANCIAL STATEMENT INFORMATION (continued) STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS: (continued) (4) During 2004, the Company entered into agreements with present and former officers in the Company, who had been holding, since 1994, options to purchase 5% of the Company's holdings in CP Pursuant to said agreements, the aforementioned officers waived their right to exercise the options previously granted to them. In return, the Company has undertaken to indemnify them on the basis of the amount of the benefit they would have derived from the exercise of the option. Within the framework of the agreements, the amount of indemnification was determined for the major part of the options, and the remaining balance would be determined on the basis of the price of the Company's shares. In addition, purchase dates have been scheduled, the latest of which will not be before April 2, 2006. In accordance with the agreements and following the merger, all the options were exercised in March 2005. Also, an agreement was signed with a senior employee of CP with respect to the compensation that was paid to him for his waiver of his options. In respect of the aforementioned agreements, the Company has recorded a one-time provision, carried to "other expenses", in respect of the estimated value of the benefit arising from the surrender of said options. (5) During the first half of the year, the Company held negotiations regarding a merger proposal, see also note 1.a(1). The negotiations did not result in a binding agreement. One-time expenses of approximately NIS 7.1 million, incurred in connection with the negotiations, have been carried to "other expenses" in the reported period. During the second half of the year, the Company held negotiations regarding a merger proposal. This time, the negotiations resulted in a binding agreement, and the merger was closed in March 2005. Non-recurring expenses in relation to the negotiations that had been incurred through to the date of the financial statements and that had been charged to the other expenses item in the reporting period amounted to NIS 6,974,000. (6) Investment through subsidiary in the share capital and convertible debentures of Meditor Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (hereafter - "Meditor"). The equity interest in Meditor is approximately 19%, and the Company has the right to increase its holdings in the future to 21% of the share capital of Meditor. In view of Meditor's lack of success in raising additional finance, there are significant doubts as to its ability to continue as a going concern. Therefore, in 2003 the Company decided to fully write-off the investment in Meditor NOTE 14 - NET INCOME PER NIS 1 OF PAR VALUE OF SHARES Par value of shares used in computation of net income per NIS 1 of par value of shares is as follows: * Including options (exercise of which is expected) granted to a senior employee of CP (see note 8.A.(2)(e)-(f)). Options granted to another senior employee of CP, as referred to in note 8A(2)(f) have not been taken into account in computing the net income per share as their exercise is not expected and their effect, on a fully diluted basis, is immaterial. The effect on the income in respect of the imputed income accruing to the Company, assuming the receipt of the exercise price in respect of the options, is immaterial. B-45
NOTE 15 - FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT A. GENERAL The Group operates internationally, which gives rise to exposure to risks from changes in foreign exchange rates. Derivative financial instruments (hereafter - "derivatives") are utilized by the Group to reduce those risks, as explained in this note. As the counter parties to these derivatives are Israeli banks, the Group considers the inherent credit risks remote. The Group does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes. B. FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK MANAGEMENT The Company enters into foreign currency derivatives - forward exchange and option contracts - in order to protect the Company from the risk that the foreign currency fair value of existing assets and liabilities, and the foreign currency cash flows resulting from firm commitments for the future sale or purchase of goods or services or from anticipated transactions will be affected by changes in exchange rates. The term of all those contracts is less than one year. The amounts relating to the aforementioned foreign currency derivatives are as follows: C. MANAGEMENT OF INTEREST RISKS The Group enters into interest derivatives - interest rate swaps and floor and cap options - in order to reduce the potential impact of interest rate fluctuations. As part of an interest swap, on February 12, 2003 the Group reached an agreement with an Israeli bank for the exchange between the two, within a fixed time frame, of a notional amount of $ 15 million, bearing variable interest, for the same notional amount bearing a fixed interest rate. The period of said interest swap ends on June 20, 2005. Over this period, the Company is to receive variable interest based on the Libor (December 31, 2004 - 2.56%) and pay interest at the fixed rate of 2.15%. As part of an interest rates swap, on January 8, 2004, the Company transacted another interest swap, under which it exchanged a notional amount of NIS 64.620 million ($ 15 million), bearing shekel interest at a fixed rate of 4.36% linked to the CPI, for an identical notional amount, bearing dollar interest at a variable rate based on Libor + 0.75%. The interest swap is primarily for periods through December 3, 2007. In addition, the Company transacted a hedge against changes in the Libor, in a notional amount of NIS 32.310 million ($ 7.5 million). Under the transaction, if the Libor exceeds 5%, the Company would be indemnified in respect of the portion in excess of 5%, up to a ceiling of 8%. As part of this transaction, the Company has undertaken to complement the interest rate up to 1.25% should the Libor be less than 1.25%. The above transactions do not meet the criteria to qualify as hedging transactions, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. B-46
NOTE 15 - FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT (continued) D. CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISKS Most of the Group's cash and cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities at December 31, 2004 and 2003 were deposited with Israeli and U.S. banks. The Company's marketable securities are held by a company that manages investment portfolios; such securities represent mainly Israeli Government bonds/ other debentures of highly rated corporations. The Company is of the opinion that the credit risk in respect of these balances is remote. Most of the Company's sales are made in Israel, North America and Europe, to a large number of customers; the sales in Israel are to Health Funds and to the private sector, which consists mainly of retail chains and drugstores. The sales in North America are mainly to a large number of customers, some of which are leaders in their field. Consequently, the exposure to credit risks relating to trade receivables is limited. A subsidiary insures the credit it extends to overseas customers which derives from its export. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers for the purpose of determining the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts and bad debts. E. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The financial instruments of the Group consist mainly of non-derivative assets: cash and cash equivalents, investments and short-term deposits and loans, receivables and debit balances, investments and long-term receivables; non-derivative liabilities: short-term credit, payables and credit balances, loans and other long-term liabilities; as well as derivative financial instruments. In view of their nature, the fair value of the financial instruments included in working capital of the Group is usually identical or close to their carrying value. The fair value of deposits and long-term receivables and long-term loans and other long-term liabilities also approximates the carrying value, since they bear interest at rates close to the prevailing market rates or, in respect of those that do not bear interest, the fair value difference is not material. Derivatives are presented at their market value. NOTE 16 - TRANSACTIONS WITH "INTERESTED PARTIES" B-47

NOTE 17 - BUSINESS AND GEOGRAPHICAL SEGMENTS (continued) B. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION ON GEOGRAPHICAL AND BUSINESS SEGMENTS: 1. Geographical segments The Company operates internationally and its organizational structure matches its two principal segments: Israel and the rest of the world (the international operations). Accordingly, the division of operations in this manner represents the basis according to which the Group reports data on its principal segments. The geographical segments are determined according to the destination countries to which the Company's products are marketed. The Group's manufacturing operations are mainly conducted in Israel, with other manufacturing being carried out in the United States and, since the fourth quarter of 2002, in Germany too. Some 67% of the Group's production is sold to customers outside Israel. More than 75% of the sales of the international operations segment are to the North American market. The balance of this segments sales are sold throughout the world, though the major part goes to Western Europe. 2. Business segments The Group's operations in its two geographical segments consist of the sale of a wide range of products. The Group manufactures and sells products for the following sectors: Chemicals sector - This sector includes Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (API), which are used as ingredients in the pharmaceuticals industry. Pharmaceuticals sector - This sector includes generic drugs, ethical pharmaceuticals imported by the Company, medical diagnostic equipment and ethical pharmaceuticals manufactured under know-how licenses by the Company. Consumer products sector - This sector includes - inter alia - cosmetics, toiletries and detergents. Following are data regarding the distribution of consolidated revenues by business segments: B-49

Assets and additions to fixed and intangible assets by business segment Following are data reflecting the carrying value of segment assets and additions to fixed and intangible assets by the business segment to which the assets belong: 4. Segment assets and liabilities Segment assets include all operating assets used by a segment and consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, receivables and debit balances, inventories, fixed assets and other assets, net of allowances and provisions. While most such assets can be directly attributed to individual segments, the carrying value of certain assets used jointly by two or more segments is allocated to the segments on a reasonable basis. Segment liabilities include all operating liabilities and consist principally of trade payables and salaries currently payable and accrued liabilities (including severance pay). 5. Inter-segment transfers Segment revenue, segment expenses and segment results include transfers between business segments. Such transfers are conducted at arm's length prices. Those transfers are eliminated in consolidation. B-50

. . . (AGIS LOGO) CONTENTS
EXHIBIT 99.3 (AGIS LOGO) REPORT OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS FOR THE QUARTER AND THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004 We are honored to present the Report of the Company's Board of Directors, which describes the main areas of activity of the Company and its subsidiaries (hereinafter - "Agis Group" or "the Company)"and its results for the quarter and the year ended December 31, 2004. MERGER WITH PERRIGO COMPANY ("PERRIGO") On March 17, 2005, the merger between the Company and Perrigo was closed, in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement signed on November 14, 2004, and after its ratification by the shareholders of both companies in general meetings of shareholders held on March 15, 2005. Perrigo is a leading health care products company, and is the world's largest company for the sale of over-the-counter medications and dietary supplements sold by pharmaceutical, food and retail chains under store brand. Perrigo has plants and logistics centers in the U.S., England and Mexico. The shares of Perrigo are sold on the U.S. Nasdaq. Since the closing of the merger, they also trade on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (dual-listing), and are included in the Tel Aviv 25 Index. Upon the closing of the merger, the shares of the Company were no longer traded on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange. ADDITIONAL MAIN POINTS During the reported quarter, the Agis Group's sales turnover totaled NIS 448 million. About 68% of total sales in the period were to the international market. Income from operations before financing, which totaled NIS 51 million in the reported quarter, increased by 22% compared with income from operations before financing in the same period last year. Net income after deducting non-recurring items in the reported quarter totaled NIS 38,588 thousand. Earnings per share in the reported quarter amounted to NIS 1.4 per share. The Company posted expenses of NIS 6,974 thousand in the report quarter, in connection with the merger with Perrigo. During 2004, the Company received approvals from the American Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") for the marketing of 8 new generic drugs having annual sales turnover, in terms of the ethical drug, of $250 million. At the publication date of the financial statements, there are six other applications pending with the FDA for approval of generic drugs, the sales of which, in the last twelve months, in terms of the ethical drugs, totaled $270 million. At the end of December, the Company signed an agreement with Taro Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. ("Taro"), in connection with Mometason Fuorate Cream USP 0.1%. Under the terms of the agreement, the pharmaceutical will be manufactured by Taro and marketed by Clay Park Labs Inc. ("CP"), the Company's subsidiary, in the U.S. As part of its preparations for a possible merger with an international company, or, alternatively, for an offering on foreign exchanges, the Company signed agreements during the first quarter of 2004 with current and former officers, who had held an option to purchase 5% of the Company's holdings in CP since 1994. Under the terms of the agreements, officers waived their right to exercise this option, in consideration for indemnification at an amount reflecting the benefit they were to receive from exercising the option. During the second quarter of the year, the amount of the indemnification to be paid was finalized. Likewise, during the second quarter of the year, the Company reached agreement in principle with a senior employee of CP regarding the indemnification to be paid to him for his waiving the options he had held, which was expressed in the agreement signed with him during the third quarter of 2004. In the wake of these agreements, the Company recorded a non-recurring provision in "other expenses" for the estimated value of the benefit inherent in the redemption of the abovementioned options. Likewise, the Company updated the provisions deriving from various obligations toward senior officers who no longer serve in those capacities. The non-recurring expenses totaled NIS 70 million. Additional non-recurring expenses of NIS 14 million were charged to other expenses, for expenses related to the merger proposal from Ivax Corporation that did not lead to an agreement, and expenses related to the merger with Perrigo, as discussed previously. A-1
DESCRIPTION OF THE COMPANY AND ITS BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT 1. SUMMARY OF THE AGIS GROUP'S BUSINESS ACTIVITIES PRIOR TO THE MERGER WITH PERRIGO The Group's managerial strategy and organizational structure are focused on two main operating segments, based on geographic dispersal - in the international market and in the domestic Israeli market, according to the countries to which the Group's diverse range of products are marketed. The geographic segments are characterized by similar economic and political conditions that have a direct and indirect impact on the Group's economic activity, its turnover and profitability. The Agis Group, which employs more than 2,000 workers (including 450 in the U.S. and 70 in Germany), develops, manufactures, imports and markets pharmaceuticals (primarily generic drugs - mainly those developed independently and ethical drugs imported by the Company or manufactured under know-how license), API and consumer products. The Company's principal growth engine is the development of new products for the international market, deriving from the Group's investments in research and development, chemicals R&D for development of API as well pharmaceutical R&D for the development of generic drugs, namely topical drugs, and finding synergy between the various segments. The American market is presently characterized by a rapid shift to the use of generic drugs, and usually by the end of the first two years of the marketing of generic alternatives, about 80% of the quantitative consumption is in the form of generics. 2. THE INTERNATIONAL MARKET 2.1 PRINCIPAL CHARACTERISTICS AND SECONDARY OPERATING SEGMENTS The Company's main managerial resources, as well as the vast majority of its investments in research and development, are earmarked for identifying new products targeted at the international market, in the Company's major business segments, i.e. pharmaceuticals and API, and maximizing the synergy existing between these segments. The market's size and the dispersal of customers make possible the Company's uninterrupted growth and the achievement of favorable profitability margins, owing to its ability to focus on niche products, specifically in generic topical drugs. This focus reduces the number of the Group's competitors and the prices of its products are influenced mainly by market forces. The products marketed by the Group to the international market are mainly generic drugs whose patents have expired, and they are marketed under a generic name or the private label of a customer. In order to develop these products, substantial investment is needed in research and development, over many years, with the prospects of recouping the investment being uncertain. If the process succeeds, the profitability of the products in the initial period of their introduction is very high, and when competitors enter the market for the product, profitability falls significantly, and stabilizes around the average profit margin for the Company's products. In the U.S. the Company also manufactures older OTC products - a segment characterized by strong competition and low entry barriers. Therefore, the profit margin of these products is lower than for other pharmaceuticals. The European health authorities, and even more so, the FDA, require compliance with stringent manufacturing standards that dictate the high quality of the manufacturing and adherence to procedures. These procedures necessitate large investments in means of production and high-quality laboratory equipment, as well as numerous investments in work procedures, controls and maintaining the level of scientific expertise and knowledge needed by the employees responsible for the quality assurance of the products. These investments significantly increase manufacturing costs, but also enable the Group to set prices that generate high profitability to the Company. A-2
2. THE INTERNATIONAL MARKET (cont.) 2.2 PHARMACEUTICALS 2.2.1 Pharmaceuticals in the U.S. The manufacture of pharmaceuticals and their marketing in the U.S. is carried out through CP at its plant in New York. About 450 workers are employed in the plant, rented by the Company, which spans about 35,000 square meters. The rental agreements are for various periods until December 31, 2014. The manufacturing and packaging are performed in one shift, in a five-day workweek. The Company estimates that its capacity utilization reaches approx. 75% in a single shift, similar to the rate in 2003. CP's 2004 sales (including-consumer products) totaled approx. NIS 778 million ($174 million), compared with NIS 625 million ($143 million) in 2003. In September 2004, the Company received FDA approval to market in the U.S. a generic drug manufactured, for the first time, in the Company's plant in Yeruham, after the plant successfully passed an FDA inspection in September 2003. By the end of the year, the Company received two additional approvals for pharmaceuticals manufactured in this plant. The tax rate on income from sales to the U.S. of pharmaceuticals manufactured in the Yeruham plant, which was recognized as a plant under construction on the tax-exempt track is expected to be low if not zero. 2.2.2 Pharmaceuticals for Europe In the Yeruham plant, the Company develops and manufactures pharmaceuticals for the European market, the API of which is also developed and manufactured by Agis Group. 2.3 ACTIVE PHARMACEUTICAL INGREDIENTS ("API") 2.3.1 General The Agis Group develops, markets and manufactures, through Chemagis Ltd (hereinafter "Chemagis") and Chemagis Germany (see below 2.3.2), API, which are used in the global pharmaceuticals industry, maximizing the synergy with the Group's development and manufacturing activities for generic drugs. In 2004, the API's sales totaled NIS 433 million (including inter-company sales to Group companies of NIS 74 million), of which 37% was to North America, 26% to Germany, 25% to Europe (excluding Germany) and the balance to the rest of the world. In 2003, the API's sales totaled NIS 422 million (including inter-company sales of NIS 106 million). 2.3.2 Manufacturing Most of Chemagis' manufacturing activities are carried out in its Ramat Hovav plant, according to manufacturing processes that were developed in Chemagis' laboratories in Tel-Aviv and Ramat Hovav. A small part of the manufacturing and development, namely of intermediate products and products in development stages, is done for Chemagis by others in Israel and overseas. The plant employs approx. 190 workers and operates in three shifts, 6 days a week. In the Company's opinion, the manufacturing capacity of most of the facilities in the plant was utilized in full in 2004, as in 2003. Annually, the Company invests sizable amounts to expand the plant, investments recognized under the various tracks of the Israel Investment Center. In recent years, these investments are on the ten-year tax exempt track. In 2004, the Company invested NIS 48 million in the Chemagis plant in Ramat Hovav. A-3
2. THE INTERNATIONAL MARKET (cont.) 2.3 ACTIVE PHARMACEUTICAL INGREDIENTS ("API") (cont.) 2.3.2 Manufacturing (cont.) These investments, like the purchase of a manufacturing platform for API products in Germany (see below), will make it possible to increase the manufacturing capacity of API products, and, consequently, improved manufacturing and marketing flexibility. On October 1, 2002, the Company purchased from Aventis a plant for the manufacture of API located in Germany (hereinafter - "Chemagis Germany"). Under the terms of the purchase agreements, Chemagis Germany will supply Aventis with API it manufactures, for a ten-year period. In the first five years, the parties agreed on the minimum annual quantities and on sales prices prescribed in advance. The plant employs 70 workers, and in 2004, 70% of its manufacturing capacity was utilized. 2.4 CONSUMER PRODUCTS Careline exports part of its products overseas, mainly under private labels. The export turnover totals NIS 11.9 million in 2004, compared with NIS 7.4 million in 2003. 2.5 MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION Pharmaceuticals are marketed in the U.S. to large customers, such as retail and pharmacy chains, and to large distributors and other institutional customers, through CP's marketing and sales department, and through independent representatives - REPS. Most of the OTC and consumer products are sold under private labels of CP's large customers. Pharmaceuticals are marketed to Europe through the pharmaceutical and API marketing department in Israel, in partnership with a European representative with which the Company has an agreement prescribing terms including the division of income for certain products. API products are marketed by Chemagis, through a marketing department with 15 employees who market the products worldwide, and in the U.S. through Chemagis U.S.A. Inc., which serves as the marketing arm of Chemagis' products for the American market. 2.6 DEPENDENCY ON CUSTOMERS AND SUPPLIERS More than half of CP's sales are effected to 5 customers, with sales to the major customer totaling $40.8 million, accounting for some 9.6% of the Group's total sales in 2004, compared with $37.6 million and 9.8% of total sales in 2003, respectively. The Company markets the API to some 300 customers throughout the world. 3. THE DOMESTIC MARKET - ISRAEL 3.1 PRINCIPAL CHARACTERISTICS AND SECONDARY OPERATING SEGMENTS For several years, Israel has been experiencing an ongoing recession that is causing persistent price erosion and a decrease in the sales turnover and profitability of all the products sold in Israel. The economic situation has a direct effect on the decrease in the purchasing power of the public and budget cuts, which include cuts in the health budget. As in the rest of the world, the Israeli pharmaceuticals market has also been characterized in recent years by a shift to generic drugs for all ethical drugs whose patents have expired. A-4
3. THE DOMESTIC MARKET - ISRAEL (cont.) 3.1 PRINCIPAL CHARACTERISTICS AND SECONDARY OPERATING SEGMENTS (cont.) The domestic market is characterized by a strong concentration of customers, including the health funds and supermarket and pharmacy chains. In general, the Company products sold in Israel are mainly branded products. They are also characterized by the fact that they do not require massive, long-term investment in research and development or compliance with stringent manufacturing standards. Most of the investment is in marketing and sales, as described in Par. 3.4 below. The operations in Israel can be divided into operating sub-segments: One is pharmaceuticals and the other is cosmetics, toiletries and cleaning products. 3.2 PHARMACEUTICALS INDUSTRY IN ISRAEL 3.2.1 General Most of the Agis Group's activities in the domestic market are based on the ethical pharmaceuticals market or on the domestic manufacture of ethical drugs under know-how agreements. Only a small part of its activities are in the field of generic drugs. The Company's volume of activity and profitability from the sale of pharmaceuticals in Israel have eroded in recent years, as a result of events that occurred in this market, which have had a negative effect on the Company. The negative events were expressed in the competition in the industry and pressure brought by the Company's large customers to reduce prices and the shift by some to cheaper substitutes as well in the intensifying generic competition for the Company's products, as described previously. Agis Group's domestic sales of pharmaceuticals totaled approx. NIS 316 million in 2004, compared with NIS 325 million in 2003. The proportion of pharmaceuticals marketed in Israel by the Agis Group's of total sales fell from 19% in 2003 to 17% in 2004. Since January 1, 2004, the Company has served as distributor for some of the pharmaceuticals manufactured by the international company, Pfizer, which are imported by its Israeli subsidiary, and the sales turnover includes a distribution commission - not the full sales turnover. Until such date, the Company had served as the importer of those products, as the representative of Pharmacia, which merged with Pfizer, and the sales in 2003 were included in the Company's sales turnover. Excluding the effect of the change in the relationship, as described, the sales turnover of pharmaceuticals in the domestic market during the reported period was slightly higher than the reported turnover in the same period last year. 3.2.2 Manufacture of pharmaceuticals in Israel The Company's pharmaceuticals plant, located in Yeruham, employs about 250 workers, and spans an area of approx 8,000 square meters. The plant complies with the standards and requirements of the authorized health authorities in Israel (G.M.P. - Good Manufacturing Practice), of the FDA (see 2.2.1 above) and of the European health authorities. Most of the plant's manufacturing is done in two shifts, in a five-day work week. In 2004, only 65% of the plant's potential manufacturing capacity was utilized, while the Company made infrastructure preparations during the year, in order to meet the plant's work plan, including exports to the U.S. and Europe. A-5
3. THE DOMESTIC MARKET - ISRAEL (cont.) 3.2 PHARMACEUTICALS INDUSTRY IN ISRAEL (cont.) 3.2.2 Manufacture of pharmaceuticals in Israel (cont.) The Company's products are manufactured according to manufacturing processes and know-how that were developed either independently or under the terms of know-how agreements or licenses (including mandatory licenses) that were issued to the Company under the Patents Law. In 2004, sales of pharmaceuticals manufactured by the company in Israel totaled approx. NIS 87 million, similar to 2003. 3.2.3 Pharmaceuticals and medical diagnostic products imported for the domestic market The Agis Group's import activities are conducted on the basis of exclusive agreements and arrangements with some of the world's leading pharmaceutical, diagnostic and other medical products manufacturers that engage in the development of ethical drugs by making sizable investments in R&D. Some of these manufacturers also participate in a portion of the marketing and sales promotion expenses of the pharmaceuticals they manufacture, and even finance manpower to engage in medical promotion of their products. The Company, through its subsidiaries, serves as agent or importer for about 15 international companies. The Company has had commercial ties with one of the major suppliers, Schering AG, for decades, without a written agreement. With another major supplier, Bayer AG, an agreement was signed in 2001, in effect until December 31, 2004. In 2005, an interim agreement was signed, with the parties intending to sign a full agreement, to be in force until the end of 2006. In early 2004, an agreement was signed with Bayer Diagnostics Europe Ltd., reflecting the relationship that had existed before the agreement was signed. The agreement is for a five-year period commencing November 1, 2003, and renews automatically, unless notice of non-renewal is received twelve months before termination of the agreement period. Likewise, the Company serves as the distributor in the domestic market of pharmaceuticals manufactured by international companies with representatives in the domestic market. In 2004, the sales of imported pharmaceuticals and diagnostic products in Israel totaled NIS 230 million, compared with NIS 239 million in 2003. The decrease in sales turnover stems from the shift of part of the sales activities from imported products of international companies to distribution activity by subsidiaries of those companies in Israel. 3.3 CONSUMER PRODUCTS INDUSTRY IN ISRAEL 3.3.1 General The range of products manufactured mainly by subsidiaries encompasses most cosmetics, toiletries, detergents, cleaning products and bar soaps, mainly under the brand names Careline, Neca and Natural Formula. In the consumer products industry, competition for shelf space is fierce, the life cycle of products is short and there is continuous demand for new products. The consumer products industry requires strong advertising support and numerous, diverse sales promotion campaigns. A-6
3. DOMESTIC MARKET - ISRAEL (cont.) 3.3 CONSUMER PRODUCTS INDUSTRY IN ISRAEL (cont.) 3.3.1 General (cont.) Every year, the Company launch several new series of products, such as series of make-up, toiletries, hair grooming and face care products. These product introductions are accompanied by substantial investments in sales promotion and advertising, in addition to the investments needed to support the older products. In this segment, the Company is exposed to competition from products manufactured in Israel and from imports. Most of the large international consumer products companies operate in Israel (Lever, P&G, L'Oreal, and Henkel), as well as a number of local manufacturers (Sano, Dr. Fisher and Intercosma) and importers (Shastovitz, Alfa, Denshar). In recent years, competition has intensified on the part of supermarket chains that market consumer products under their own private labels. The two peak periods for consumer products are around Passover and the Jewish New Year. On December 31, 2003, the Company signed an agreement with NESH Cosmetics (1992) Ltd. (hereinafter - "NESH"), whereby the operations of NESH merged with Agis' consumer products operations. The Company took action to prepare for the merger during 2003. In 2004, approval for the merger was received from the Anti-Trust Commissioner. In addition to the Careline, Neca and NESH products, the Company manufactures cosmetics and toiletries for unrelated local parties and other parties, which sell their products under their own brand names. 3.3.2 Manufacturing At Careline's Yeruham facility, which employs some 200 workers, all manufacturing, filling and packaging activities for the Company's products are carried out according to manufacturing processes and formulas, most of which were developed independently by Careline. Most of the manufacturing and packaging is carried out in a single shift of 5 workdays. The Company assesses that in 2004, about 80% of the Careline's manufacturing capacity was utilized in a single shift, compared with 2003, when an average of 75% was utilized in a single shift. Most of the raw materials for manufacturing and packaging are purchased from different suppliers in Israel and abroad. In most cases, The Company is not dependent on a single supplier, and there are alternative sources of supply for the principal raw materials. Careline has a development department that is engaged in developing new products and improving existing ones. Presently, most of the products currently manufactured by Careline are the results of Careline's own development. Research institutes assist Careline in Israel, as do highly reputed International consultants, in developing and testing the efficiency of some of the products. Careline's quality control and quality assurance departments are responsible for conducting regular and initiated testing to assure the manufacturing quality of the company's products. The Company owns 20,000 square meters of land in the Segula industrial zone in Petach Tikva, on which the Neca plant stands. The company closed down the plant and relocated the production of products to alternative production sites, including the Careline plant in Yeruham. Beginning in 2005, the Company began to use the site for storage and distribution of consumer products, while, at the same time, discontinued usage of warehouses that had been leased by the Company at other sites, that it had used until then. A-7
3. DOMESTIC MARKET - ISRAEL (cont.) 3.4 MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION As stated in Par. 3.3.1, most of the investment in products sold in Israel is in sales promotion, through distribution of medical information, sales representatives and extensive advertising support through the various media. The products manufactured and imported by the Agis Group are marketed by 3 divisions: pharmaceuticals, diagnostics and consumer products. Sales and marketing include departments of medical promotion, telemarketing, sales representatives, stocking personnel and beauty consultants. Through this division, the Group markets its products to all the medical institutions in Israel, such as health funds, hospitals, pharmacies and medical laboratories, as well as to pharmacies, supermarkets and cosmetic chains. There are also several different departments engaged in the development of the strategy and the management of the Company's marketing in the domestic market. The distribution of the products manufactured and/or marketed by the Agis Group in Israel is carried out through a subsidiary, Agis Distribution and Marketing (1989) Ltd. (hereinafter - "Agis Distribution"), and also carried out through an affiliated company, Danagis Ltd., a company owned jointly with Denshar Ltd. The distribution services rendered by Company include storage, shipping, handling of the products in accordance with the directions of the Ministry of Health and the manufacturers, providing for inventory, receiving orders, distributing the products to different customers, and collecting sales proceeds. 3.5 DEPENDENCY ON CUSTOMERS AND SUPPLIERS The Agis Group's largest customer in Israel is Clalit Health Services (hereinafter - "Clalit"). The Agis Group's sales to Clalit in 2004 represented 6.9% of the Group's total sales, similar to 2003. Aside from Clalit, the Company has no single customer in the domestic market which has a share of the Group's sales exceeding 5%. In light of the wide range of products marketed in the domestic market, the Company is not dependent on any single product, and it can regulate the manufacturing and marketing of the various products according to demand. The raw materials used in manufacturing are purchased from different suppliers overseas. In most cases, the Company has an agreement with an exclusive supplier of raw materials, from which the know-how to manufacture the products was acquired in long-term arrangements. The Group acquires different raw materials and pharmaceuticals from two main suppliers. The total purchases from those suppliers in 2004 and 2003 constituted 16.4% and 17.2%, respectively, of the group's total purchases. 4. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT; CLINICAL TESTING; PATENTS 4.1 PHARMACEUTICAL R&D The R&D goals were specified so as to focus most of the efforts on products that are suitable for the American market, and for the Company's area of expertise. Most of the integrated pharmaceutical efforts currently carried out in the Company's laboratories in Israel and the U.S. are in this area. The R&D activities in the pharmaceuticals segment are conducted by a staff of 100 workers, 60 of whom work in Yeruham and the rest in the U.S. During 2004, some of the research that had been conducted by CP in the U.S. was transferred to Israel. In the years 2002-2004, the Company received FDA approvals for the marketing of 18 generic drugs in the American market that were developed by the Company and CP (of which 8 were in 2004), and another approval in 2002 for a pharmaceutical with an ethical formulation that it developed, the usage rights to which were transferred to Ortho McNeil Pharmaceutical Inc. (hereinafter - "Ortho"). A-8
4. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT; CLINICAL TESTING; PATENTS (cont.) 4.1 PHARMACEUTICAL R&D (cont.) As of the publication date of the financial statements, the Company had filed 6 applications with the FDA for approvals of new generic drugs, for which the total of their ethical drugs market is estimated at $270 million. The Company is in various stages of development of about 20 pharmaceuticals, some of which will be submitted for FDA approval in 2005 and some in later years. In 2004, the investments by the Company and CP in pharmaceutical R&D totaled approx. NIS 101 million compared with NIS 94 million in 2003. In 2004, the participation of various bodies in the pharmaceutical research and development expenses totaled approx. NIS 8 million, compared with NIS 5 million in 2003. In December 2004, the Company submitted applications to the Chief Scientist for his participation in pharmaceutical research and development costs for the year 2005. These applications relate to expected investments during 2005, for which the participation of the Chief Scientist can be requested, amounting to NIS 34 million in this segment. Based on the Company's experience in prior years, the Chief Scientist's participation does not cover these expenses in full. Another facet of the development of pharmaceuticals is based on maximizing the synergy between the Group's API and pharmaceutical manufacturing activities, for the purpose of marketing them in the international markets, mainly the U.S. (through CP) and Europe (through the Company and its independent sales representatives). The Company is working to identify pharmaceuticals for which patents were not registered and for which, to the best of the Company's knowledge, there are currently no generic suppliers for their API. The goal is that the collaboration with Chemagis will include Chemagis' developing API for the purpose of developing them further as pharmaceuticals and for the purpose of their export as API to countries in which they are not protected by patent. At a later stage, after the international patent protection for these pharmaceuticals expires, it will be possible to market them internationally, both as a pharmaceutical manufactured by the Company or CP and as API manufactured by Chemagis. In this collaboration between the Company and Chemagis, the Group attempts to maximize the economic benefit from this integrated R&D in two areas - the chemical and the pharmaceutical. This multi-disciplinary activity enables the maximum utilization of all of the scientific know-how generated by the Agis Group. As in any development work based on original R&D, it is possible that the development will not lead to a pharmaceutical product. On the other hand, the success of the R&D program currently being conducted by the Company should bear fruit during five or more years, and increase manufacturing and export activities. 4.2 CLINICAL STUDIES The Company and CP are performing clinical studies of generic prescription drugs intended for marketing in the U.S. The Company and CP have increased the number of clinical studies carried out during recent years, in order to submit the generic drugs for FDA approval. 4.3 PATENTS As of the date of this Report, none of the pharmaceuticals resulting from the Company's independent development are protected by patent, except for the formulation as described below. Over the years, the Company and Chemagis have filed several applications in Israel for patent registration of products they have developed, and, at the same time, filed corresponding applications in different countries overseas. These patent registrations are for protection of new formulations of known pharmaceuticals intended to achieve improved medical action and for new and improved chemical manufacturing processes. In December 2002, the Company received FDA approval to market a pharmaceutical, whose formulation was developed by the Company, and is protected by a patent. A-9
4. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT; CLINICAL TESTING; PATENTS (cont.) 4.3 PATENTS (cont.) Some of the pharmaceuticals imported by the Agis Group and some that are manufactured by the Company under know-how agreements, are protected by patent. All of these patents are registered in the name of the overseas know-how provider or manufacturer. Presently, the Patents Law in Israel enables the development of patent-protected pharmaceuticals before expiration of the patent, in order to market and sell them in Israel and internationally upon expiration of the patent. This opportunity heightens generic competition in Israel, on one hand, but opens many possibilities for increasing the exports of the Company and Chemagis, in the medium term. 4.4 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IN THE CHEMICALS SEGMENT Chemagis' current R&D program includes the development of synthesis processes for several pharmaceuticals that are not protected by patent in Israel, and for which the raw materials for their manufacture are not available in the global market. Chemagis' R&D activities are carried out by a team of 70 researchers in its laboratories in Tel-Aviv and Ramat Hovav, and by a pilot in the Ramat Hovav plant. Chemagis' investments in R&D during 2004 totaled approx. NIS 37 million, of which approx. NIS 5 million was participation by the Chief Scientist, and in 2003, totaled approx. NIS 30 million, of which approx. NIS 7 million was participation by the Chief Scientist. In December 2004, Chemagis submitted applications with the Chief Scientist for his participation in research and development costs of the year 2005. The amount of investments in research and developments in the chemicals field for which Chemagis requested participation, is NIS 25 million. Based on the Company's prior experience, the Chief Scientist's participation does not cover the full amount of the requested investments. 5. FINANCIAL POSITION 5.1 BALANCE SHEET The Group's total assets as of 31.12.2004 amounted to NIS 1,953 million, compared with NIS 1,907 million as of 31.12.2003. Total current assets as of 31.12.2004 amounted to NIS 1,266 million, compared with NIS 1,243 million as of 31.12.2003. Total current assets represent about 65% of the total balance sheet, similar to the percentage of expenses in 2003. The cash balances held by the Company as of 31.12.2003 were used for various investments, in accordance with the Company's policy, and to finance the Company's working capital, due to the expansion of its business activities. Also see 5.3 below. Investments and long-term receivables totaled NIS 78 million on 31.12.2004, compared with NIS 79 million on 31.12.2003. Current liabilities totaled NIS 539 million as of 31.12.2004, compared with NIS 478 million as of 31.12.2003. Among the reasons for the increase in current liabilities is the balance of the liability not yet paid, relating to the obligations toward officers, as discussed in the Main Points of this Report. Likewise, there was an increase in current liabilities related to current maturities of CP's long-term loans, totaling NIS 86 million, due to the expiration of a line of credit from Bank Hapoalim New York on June 20, 2005, and the presentation of this line of credit as a short-term liability. The increase in current liabilities was offset partly by the repayment of a short-term loan in CP, which was replaced by a long-term credit line, as discussed in Par. 5.3 above Long-term liabilities as of 31.12.2004 totaled NIS 272 million, compared with NIS 320 million on 31.12.2003. The decrease in long-term liabilities stems mainly from the reclassification of current maturities of a credit line from Bank Hapoalim New York, as discussed previously, and from the change in the deferred tax balance. A-10
5. FINANCIAL POSITION (cont.) 5.1 BALANCE SHEET (cont.) In contrast, long-term liabilities increased as a result of the loan agreement with Bank Leumi New York signed on March 24, 2004, which replaced a short-term loan from that bank that had matured, as discussed in par. 5.3 above. As of 31.12.2004, shareholders' equity totaled NIS 1,142 million representing about 58% of the total balance sheet, similar to the percentage on 31.12.2003. The equity is after deduction of the cost of shares in the Company held by the Company and subsidiaries totaling NIS 158 million. 5.2 INVESTMENTS IN FIXED ASSETS The Agis Group invested approx. NIS 109 million in fixed assets during 2004. Of this total, NIS 99 million was improving, streamlining and expanding the manufacturing capacity of the Group's manufacturing plants (namely plants manufacturing products that are marketed to the international market). The Company assesses that these substantial investments, focused on the infrastructure that represent its growth engines, will constitute an important stratum in the realization of the business strategy of expanding international operations and improving its profitability through efficient, high-quality production of new products that it develops. Depreciation expenses on fixed assets totaled NIS 69 million in 2004. 5.3 THE GROUP'S FINANCING SOURCES 5.3.1 General As part of the financial strategy of some degree of leverage in financing the Group's operations, part of the Company's operations are financed through loans (for overseas operations), as well as by loan units mobilized from institutional investors in December 2003, all as described below. In 2004, long-term and short-term loans, including current maturities, averaged approx. NIS 356 million compared with NIS 172 million in 2003. Credit from suppliers in 2004 averaged approx. NIS 247 million compared with NIS 236 million in 2003. Customer debt in 2004 averaged approx. NIS 384 million, compared with NIS 317 million in 2003. 5.3.2 Financing from financial institutions in Israel On December 3, 2003, the Company received from financial institutions in Israel a loan totaling NIS 180 million. The loan is linked to the increase in the index and bears annual interest of 5.6%, paid semiannually. The loan principal will be repaid in three equal installments, in the month of December in the years between 2007 and 2009. The loan is unsecured. On January 2004, the Company effected an interest rate swap in the amount of 15 million dollars, whereby it exchanged the terms, as described above, for linkage to the dollar plus variable interest at the rate of Libor + 2%. Likewise, the Company executed on February 2004 a hedging transaction against drastic changes in the Libor interest rate in the amount of 7.5 million Dollars, so that if the Libor interest rises above 5%, the Company will receive compensation on the amount exceeding 5%, up to a ceiling of 8%. As part of this transaction, the Company undertook that if the Libor interest rate would fall below 1.25%, it would pay the difference between the Libor interest and 1.25%. A-11
5. FINANCIAL POSITION (cont.) 5.3 THE GROUP'S FINANCING SOURCES (cont.) 5.3.3 CP financing On June 20, 2001, CP signed a loan agreement with the New York branch of Bank Hapoalim, to renew a $20 million credit line, in effect until June 20, 2005. The interest rate on the credit line is Libor + 0.65%. The Company guaranteed the repayment of CP's obligations under this agreement. As of the Financial Statement date, CP had drawn $20 million of this credit line. In February 2003, the Company executed an interest rate swap, whereby the interest on $15 million of the abovementioned credit line was changed from variable interest based on the Libor rate to fixed interest of 2.15% per annum, and in total, an interest rate of 2.8%. In March 2004, CP signed a loan agreement with Bank Leumi New York, which replaced a short-term loan that had matured. Under the terms of the agreement, CP was given a line of credit, guaranteed by the Company, for a three-year period, at an amount up to 15 million dollars. As of the date of the financial statements, CP had utilized 10 million dollars of this line of credit. The interest rate on this line of credit is Libor + 1.5%. The Company has guaranteed repayment of CP's liabilities pursuant to this agreement. 5.3.4 Chemagis Germany Financing In November 2004, Chemagis Germany signed a loan agreement with Citibank Tel-Aviv, which replaced the short-term loan received one year earlier from Citibank Frankfurt, which had matured. Under the terms of the agreement, Chemagis Germany received a line of credit for a period of one year in the amount of 7 million euro. The line of credit bears interest at the rate of Eurobor + 1.35%. The Company has guaranteed repayment of the liabilities of Chemagis Germany pursuant to this agreement. 5.4 SHARE CAPITAL 5.4.1 Dividend Payment On February 4, 2004, the Company paid a NIS 2 per share dividend that had been declared on January 5, 2004, totaling approx. NIS 55 million. Subsequent to the balance sheet date, the Company declared an additional dividend of NIS 2 per share, for a total of NIS 55 million. The dividend will be paid on March 31, 2005. 5.4.2 Company shares held by the Company and subsidiaries As of the publication date of the financial statements, the Company and subsidiaries hold 12.6% of the Company's share capital. 5.5 CLAIMS AGAINST THE COMPANY 5.5.1 Claim against CP In November 1997 and January 1998 claims totaling 55 million dollars were lodged against CP for damages allegedly caused as a result of the emission of a minimal amount of material from the CP laboratory. In several hearings held to date in various levels of courts in the U.S., the last of which was in New York State Supreme Court in November 1999, most of the claims were dismissed. There are other claims for physical injury, which CP has already answered, and it intends to vigorously defend against them. CP also filed claims against several insurance companies in connection with the above claim. A-12
5. FINANCIAL POSITION (cont.) 5.5 CLAIMS AGAINST THE COMPANY (cont.) 5.5.1 Claim against CP (cont.) The uncertainty as to the legal outcome is characteristic of claims of this type. Therefore, the Company is unable to estimate the ultimate outcome of the litigation. However, legal counsel for CP has opined that the monetary claims asserted in the Complaint are not supported by facts that justify them, and that the maximum amount that CP could be required to pay, if any, is not material to the Company. Therefore, the company did not record any provision in its financial statements in respect of this claim. 5.5.2 Business license in Ramat Hovav In May 2004, the Ministry of the Environment sent to Chemagis additional conditions for the business license for its plant in Ramat Hovav. Professionals in the company are of the opinion that these are stringent conditions, and it is not possible, under the present circumstances, to estimate the extent of the actual fulfillment of the conditions and the costs involved. Chemagis, together with other companies that received similar demands, filed an administrative appeal to revoke the conditions because of their unreasonableness. Subsequent to the balance sheet date, the parties agreed to try to resolve the dispute between them through arbitration. A-13
6. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD YEAR 2004 6.1 CONDENSED ANNUAL STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEARS 2004 AND 2003 * Net of non-recurring events. Within the framework of these events, the following expenses were included: During 2004: a. A total of NIS 70 million in expenses related to agreements with offices who waived their rights to exercise options that they had held, as well as expenses related to various obligations toward senior officers who stopped serving in such capacity. b. A total of NIS 7 million related to negotiation on the merger proposal received from Ivax Corporation, which did not lead to an agreement. c. A total of an additional NIS 7 million, expenses related to the merger with Perrigo. During 2003: a. The one-time of the granting of exclusive rights to Ortho, totaled NIS 44 million. b. Expenses and income that were charged mainly to the item "other" that are not expected to recur in the coming years, such as the payment of severance pay to senior employees and employees of the Neca plant, write-off of unusable assets of the Neca plant, due its being closed, decline in value of the investment in Meditor, as well as revenues, net, originating from the State of New York's participation in the previous years' expenses of CP for salaries, training and various investments. A-14
6. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR 2004 (cont) 6.2 SALES Below is a breakdown of the Agis Group's sales in the years 2004 and 2003, broken down according to the Group's main operating segments and as a percentage of the Agis Group's total sales: SALES TURNOVER in 2004 totaled NIS 1,821,241 thousand, compared with NIS 1,691,554 thousand in the same period last year, and NIS 1,647,144 thousand after neutralizing non-recurring revenues generated by the Company in the same period last year, relating to the granting of a manufacturing license to Ortho, representing an increase of 10.6%. SALES TURNOVER TO THE INTERNATIONAL MARKET in 2004 totaled NIS 1,229,380 thousand, compared with NIS 1,083,293 thousand in the same period last year, and after neutralizing non-recurring events, as aforesaid, compared with NIS 1,038,883 thousand, representing an increase of 18.3%. Sales turnover to the international market grew despite the decrease in sales stemming from the sales agreement with Dermik. The sales growth was posted in all the other elements of the Company's international activities, namely sales to the U.S, of new pharmaceuticals developed by the Company and by CP. Sales of API products posted growth both in the products manufactured in Israel and those manufactured by the Company's plant in Germany. A-15
6. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR 2004 (cont) 6.2 SALES (cont.) SALES TURNOVER TO THE DOMESTIC MARKET in 2004 totaled NIS 591,861 thousand, compared with NIS 608,261 thousand in the same period last year. The decrease in sales turnover in the domestic market stems from the sales of imported pharmaceuticals and of consumer products which, in the first half of 2003, also included the sales of Penina Rosenblum Ltd., and beginning July 1, 2003, include only a distribution commission, because of the change in the undertaking with this customer. Since January 1, 2004, the Company has served as distributor for some of the pharmaceuticals manufactured by the international company, Pfizer, which are imported by its Israeli subsidiary, and the sales turnover includes a distribution commission - not the full sales turnover. Until such date, the Company had served as the importer of those products, as the representative of Pharmacia, which merged with Pfizer, and the sales in 2003 were included in the Company's sales turnover. Excluding the effect of the change in the relationship, as described, the sales turnover of pharmaceuticals and consumer products in the domestic market during the reported period was slightly higher than the reported turnover in the same period last year. 6.3 EARNINGS AND PROFITABILITY GROSS PROFIT in 2004 totaled NIS 713,868 thousand, representing 39.2% of sales, compared with NIS 637,805 thousand, which, after neutralizing non-recurring events, totaled NIS 596,941, representing 36.2% of sales. Gross profit increased in comparison with the same period last year, because of the significant growth in international activity. The increase in gross margin stems from the change in the Company's sales mix, due mainly to the relative increase in the sales of products with higher profit margins. R&D EXPENSES in 2004 totaled NIS 126,144 thousand, compared with NIS 112,558 thousand in 2003 and constituting growth of 12%. The Chief Scientist's and others participation in the Group's research and development expenses in the reported period totaled NIS 12,302 thousand, compared with NIS 11,952 thousand in the same period last year. SELLING EXPENSES in 2004 totaled NIS 281,423 thousand, compared with NIS 245,659 thousand in the same period last year. Selling expenses as a percentage of sales turnover amounted to 15.5%, compared with 14.9% in the same period last year, after neutralizing non-recurring events. The reasons for the increase in selling expenses include marketing efforts for consumer products OTC drugs in Israel and increased distribution and selling expenses of new pharmaceuticals developed by the Company in the U.S. and API products. GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES totaled NIS 103,963 thousand in 2004, accounting for 5.7% of turnover, similar to the rates posted in the same period last year. After neutralizing non-recurring expenses, general and administrative expenses totaled NIS 92,989 thousand, and in total, amounted to NIS 94,617 thousand. INCOME FROM OPERATIONS BEFORE FINANCING in 2004 totaled NIS 202,338 thousand, compared with NIS 184,971 thousand in 2003 and after deducting the effect of non-recurring items NIS 145,735 thousand, and representing an increase of about 39% compared with the same period last year. The increase in operating income stems from the improvement in gross profit, which was attributable to the Company's international activities. NET FINANCING EXPENSES totaled NIS 9,359 thousand in 2004, compared with financing income of NIS 7,514 thousand after deducting the effect of non-recurring items in 2003. OTHER EXPENSES in 2004 totaled NIS 84,612 thousand, most of which is attributable to non-recurring items, as described in Par. 6.1 above. A-16
6. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR 2004 (cont) 6.3 EARNINGS AND PROFITABILITY (cont.) INCOME BEFORE TAXES ON INCOME AFTER NEUTRALIZING NON-RECURRING EVENTS totaled NIS 192,923 in 2004, compared with NIS 153,093 thousand in the same period last year, representing an increase of 26%. After the effect of non-recurring events, the Company posted income before taxes of NIS 108,367 thousand, compared with NIS 167,128 thousand in the same period last year. INCOME TAX EXPENSES AFTER NEUTRALIZING NON-RECURRING EVENTS totaled NIS 34,416 thousand in 2004, representing 17.8% of income before taxes, compared with NIS 28,032, thousand in the same period last year, representing 18.3% of income before taxes. NET INCOME AFTER NEUTRALIZING NON-RECURRING EVENTS amounted to NIS 159,784 thousand in 2004, compared with NIS 126,334 thousand in the same period last year, an increase of 26.5%.

EARNINGS PER SHARE AFTER NEUTRALIZING NON-RECURRING EVENTS amounted to NIS 5.83 per share in 2004, compared with NIS 4.61 per share in 2003, representing an increase of 26.5%. After the effect of non-recurring events, earnings per share amounted to NIS 3.30 compared with NIS 4.99 in 2003. A-17
6. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR 2004 (cont.) 6.4 CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED QUARTERLY STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS * Reclassified Net income on a quarterly basis as described above, were influenced by non-recurring events that occurred during 2004. The substance of the non-recurring events was described previously in this report, at length. In par. 6.5 described the result of operation without the effect of non recurring items. A-18
6. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR 2004 (cont.) 6.5 CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED QUARTERLY STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS AFTER DEDUCTING NON-RECURRING ITEMS * Reclassified BELOW IS A SUMMARY OF THE SIGNIFICANT EVENTS THAT OCCURRED DURING THE QUARTERS, WHICH, IN THE COMPANY'S OPINION, INFLUENCED THEIR RESULTS:- - The results of operations in every quarter were influenced mainly by the sales turnover and gross margin in the period. Sales turnover in each quarter was affected mainly by the Company's international operations during that period, for API products and for pharmaceuticals in the international market. - Gross profit and its margin were influenced between the quarters by the internal mix of sales in the segments with different profitability margins that change over time - namely sales to the international market vs. sales to the domestic market, well as the sales volume of new generic drugs developed by the Company, that were approved for marketing by the FDA. - Among the other elements that influenced profitability during the various quarters are: a. Variation between the quarters in the amount of research and development expenses, which are recorded when incurred. b. Marketing and sales promotion efforts, as well as sales commissions and royalties, deriving from various events that occur during the year, and according to which, the level of expenses varies over the different quarters. c. Distribution and selling expenses in international activities as a variable of the marketing and sales efforts, namely of new generic drugs and API d. Effect of the financing item in the various quarters of the report period, in accordance with the changes in the various parameters that influenced the Company's financial activities, such as interest rates, inter-currency exchange rates, the capital market, consumer price index, etc., alongside theusage of credit, based on various needs.

7. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD OCTOBER-DECEMBER 2004 7.1 BELOW ARE CONDENSED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2004 AND 2003: * After deducting non-recurring events. A-20
7. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD OCTOBER-DECEMBER 2004 (cont.) 7.2 SALES Below are details of the Agis Group's sales in the fourth quarters of 2004 and 2003, broken down according to the Group's main areas of activity, and as a percentage of the Agis Group's total sales: SALES TURNOVER in the fourth quarter of 2004 totaled NIS 447,835 thousand, compared with NIS 444,732 thousand in the corresponding period last year, representing growth of 0.7%. SALES TURNOVER IN THE INTERNATIONAL MARKET in the last quarter of 2004 totaled NIS 302,667 thousand, compared with NIS 295,597 thousand in the same period last year, representing growth of 2.4%. The increase, originating in sales of new pharmaceuticals developed by the Company and API products, was offset in part by the decrease in sales stemming from the sales agreement with Dermik and by the especially strong sales of pharmaceuticals exported to Europe recorded in the same period last year. SALES TURNOVER IN THE DOMESTIC MARKET totaled NIS 145,168 thousand in the fourth quarter of 2004, compared with NIS 149,135 thousand in the corresponding period last year. The decrease in turnover is due mainly to the decrease in sales of imported pharmaceuticals because of the shift of some of its sales from imported products of international pharmaceutical manufacturer to providing distribution services to the Israeli subsidiary of that manufacturer, and a decrease in the turnover of consumer products in Israel. A-21
7. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD OCTOBER-DECEMBER 2004 (cont.) 7.3 EARNINGS AND PROFITABILITY GROSS PROFIT in the fourth quarter of the year amounted to NIS 179,532 thousand, compared with NIS 175,039 thousand in the corresponding period last year representing growth of 2.6%. The gross margin in the fourth quarter of the year was 40% compared with 39.4% in the corresponding period last year. R&D EXPENSES in the fourth quarter totaled NIS 28,183 thousand, compared with NIS 31,152 thousand in the corresponding period last year.

Selling expenses comprised 15.8% of sales turnover in the fourth quarter of the year, compared with 17% in the corresponding period last year. The decrease in selling expenses stems from the decrease in sales commissions for the share in profits of an agent in Europe, in view of the increased exports to Europe during the same period last year and the resultant amount of commissions. This decrease was offset in part by the increase in the distribution and selling expenses of CP, because of the growth in the sales turnover of new pharmaceuticals developed by the Company. GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES in the fourth quarter of the year totaled NIS 29,674 thousand, compared with NIS 26,786 thousand in the same period last year. General and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter of the year accounted for 6.6% of sales turnover, compared with 6% in the same period last year. OPERATING INCOME BEFORE FINANCING in the fourth quarter of the year totaled NIS 50,997 thousand, compared with NIS 41,637 thousand in the same period last year, representing an increase of 22.5%. FINANCING EXPENSES in the fourth quarter of the year totaled NIS 2,128 thousand, compared with financing income of NIS 2,018 thousand in the corresponding period last year. OTHER EXPENSES in the fourth quarter of 2004 totaled NIS 8,534 thousand, comprised mostly of non-recurring expenses incurred by the Company in connection with the merger with Perrigo. Also see 6.1 below.
