ITEM 2.02. DISCLOSURE OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION On May 5, 2005, the Perrigo Company released earnings for the third quarter of fiscal year 2005. The earnings release contains non-GAAP measures which are defined as a financial measure of the Company's performance that excludes or includes amounts thereby differentiating it from the most directly comparable measure presented in the financial statements that are calculated and presented in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the Company has provided a reconciliation for operating income, net income and earnings per share within its earnings release to the most directly comparable GAAP measure for these non-GAAP measures. The Company excludes a write-off of in-process research and development, restructuring costs, acquisition-related expenses, a product recall and a one-time tax benefit when monitoring and evaluating the on-going financial results and trends of its business due to the non-recurring nature of these items.

Exhibit 99 PERRIGO COMPANY REPORTS FISCAL 2005 THIRD QUARTER AND NINE MONTHS LOSSES DUE TO WRITE OFF OF IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ALLEGAN, Mich., May 5 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- The Perrigo Company (Nasdaq: PRGO; TASE) today announced results for the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2005 ended March 26, 2005. Perrigo Company (in thousands, except per share amounts) Third Quarter Year-To-Date ------------------------- ------------------------- 2005 2004 2005 2004 ----------- ----------- ----------- ----------- Sales $ 220,093 $ 232,863 $ 699,560 $ 692,079 (Net Loss)/Income $ (379,436) $ 17,739 $ (346,020) $ 72,482 Diluted Shares 73,660 72,598 71,970 72,035 Diluted EPS $ (5.15) $ 0.24 $ (4.81) $ 1.01 The acquisition of Agis Industries was completed on March 17, 2005. Agis is included in the consolidated balance sheet as of March 26, 2005. Agis operating results are not included in the third quarter, but will be included in the consolidated results beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. Third Quarter Results Net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2005 were $220.1 million, a decrease of five percent from $232.9 million last year due to a sales shortfall in the Consumer Healthcare segment. Perrigo reported a net loss of $379.4 million, or $5.15 per share, which includes charges associated with the acquisition of Agis. The acquisition-related charges include the following: the write-off of in-process research and development of $388.6 million, which is not deductible for tax purposes; a charge for operational improvements and asset impairments in the Consumer Healthcare segment of $6.4 million pre-tax, or $4.1 million after-tax; and, acquisition-related legal, audit and integration expenses of $4.6 million pre-tax, or $3.0 million after-tax. Excluding the charges associated with the acquisition, net income was $16.2 million, or $0.22 per share. This is compared with net income of $17.7 million, or $0.24 per share, a year ago. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures is shown in Table II at the end of this press release. "Our operating results in the third quarter reflect lower sales and profits in the Consumer Healthcare segment where we experienced weak seasonal demand for cough/cold and pain relief products. There was a late pick-up at retail, but, with adequate inventories available following the season's slow start, retailers were able to meet consumer demand in the quarter from on-hand inventory," said David T. Gibbons, Perrigo Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. Agis Acquisition Commenting on the Agis acquisition, Mr. Gibbons stated, "The combination of Perrigo and Agis has created a global company with broader capabilities to grow in the generic pharmaceutical, active pharmaceutical ingredients and consumer healthcare markets. We have brought together talent and technology and we are combining Perrigo's leadership in store brand over-the-counter pharmaceutical and nutritional products with Agis' growing position in topical generics and active pharmaceutical ingredients. Together, we have excellent R&D and an experienced, global management team. The integration of our companies is off to a good start and we are enthusiastic about the opportunities we see to grow and enhance value for our shareholders."
Nine Months Results Net sales for the nine months ended March 26, 2005 were $699.6 million, an increase of $7.5 million, or one percent, compared with $692.1 million last year. Perrigo reported a net loss of $346.0 million, or $4.81 per share, which includes charges associated with the acquisition of Agis and the expense of a product recall. The charges and expenses associated with the acquisition were the same as those recorded in the third quarter. The impact of the loratadine syrup product recall in the second quarter of fiscal 2005 reduced sales by $6.3 million and after-tax income by $5.3 million. In the prior year, the Company reported a one-time tax benefit of $13.1 million after-tax. Excluding the write-off of in-process research and development, acquisition-related expenses and the expense of the product recall, net income was $54.9 million, or $0.76 per share. Excluding the one-time tax benefit of $13.1 million, or $0.18 per share, in the prior year period, comparable net income was $59.4 million, or $0.83 per share. A reconciliation of these non- GAAP measures is shown in Table II at the end of this press release. Consumer Healthcare Consumer Healthcare segment sales decreased six percent to $194.0 million, compared with $206.1 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2004. The decline reflected lower sales of loratadine products compared with strong initial sales a year ago. Sales were also lower in the vitamin category following our strong first half. We received positive benefits from sales of new products for smoking cessation and feminine hygiene. Operating income was $18.7 million, reflecting lower sales and production levels, as well as a $6.4 million charge for asset impairment and acquisition-related restructuring expense. Excluding the $6.4 million charge, operating income was $25.1 million, compared with $28.8 million last year. For nine months of fiscal 2005, Consumer Healthcare sales were $612.4 million, two percent below the $623.9 million in the same period last year. Operating income was $69.7 million, reflecting lower sales and production levels, an asset impairment charge, acquisition-related expenses and the expense of a product recall. Excluding the charge of $6.4 million and the product recall expense of $8.3 million, operating income was $84.4 million, compared with $91.5 million a year ago. Pseudoephedrine Mr. Gibbons also noted, "A number of major retailers have recently announced plans to move certain over-the-counter products that contain the active ingredient pseudoephedrine to a position behind the pharmacy counter. This is in reaction to new legislation in certain states to slow the misuse of pseudoephedrine-based products to create methamphetamine for illegal drug use. We are developing phenylephrine-based alternatives for the most popular solid dose products and expect to phase-in the reformulated products as soon as possible throughout the 2005/2006 season. We anticipate that the recent acceleration of the move behind the counter will have some negative impact on our cough/cold/allergy/sinus category sales in the next year. However, it is too early to accurately measure the effect."
Pharmaceuticals In the third quarter, the Pharmaceutical Segment recorded an operating loss of $1.9 million, compared with a loss of $1.6 million a year ago as the Company continued to invest in its start-up pharmaceutical business. For nine months of fiscal 2005, Pharmaceutical operating loss was $5.5 million, compared with a loss of $3.0 million last year. United Kingdom Third quarter net sales for the United Kingdom operations decreased $2.0 million, or nine percent, to $19.8 million due to declines in contract and nutritional product sales, partially offset by favorable foreign exchange rates. Operating income for the third quarter was $0.4 million compared with $0.2 million last year. Sales for nine months were $67.5 million, compared with $49.4 million in the year ago period, and operating income was $2.3 million, compared with $1.5 million a year ago. Mexico Sales for Perrigo's Mexico Operations increased $0.9 million, or 18 percent, to $5.9 million in the third quarter as a result of increased sales to the store brand and pharmaceutical distribution channels. Operating income for the quarter was $0.2 million, compared with an operating loss of $0.8 million last year. Sales for nine months were $19.1 million, compared with $18.7 million last year and operating income was $1.7 million, compared with $0.6 million for the comparable nine months a year ago. Opening Balance Sheet The attached condensed balance sheet includes the preliminary allocation of the purchase price for Agis into the components of fair value of the assets at acquisition, as well as adjustments related to the transaction financing. At closing, Perrigo also entered into a loan agreement with an Israeli bank for $400 million. Simultaneously, $400 million was deposited by Perrigo with the same Israeli bank. As required, these amounts are reported separately on the consolidated balance sheet as long-term debt and restricted cash. Perrigo will pay interest expense on the loan and receive interest income on the deposit in subsequent periods. The purpose of this transaction is to provide an appropriate and efficient mechanism for inter-company financing. Included in the fair value of the assets of Agis is a step-up in the value of inventory of $27.6 million. This amount will be charged to cost of sales over the next three to six months, but is not expected to have any impact beyond that period. Outlook The year-to-date reported net loss of $346.0 million included the write- off of in-process research and development of $388.6 million, the loratadine recall of $5.3 million and other acquisition-related costs of $7.0 million. Adjusted net income was $54.9 million, or $0.76 per share, through nine months of fiscal 2005. There will be an additional $2 million in integration costs incurred in the fourth quarter. Further, the write-off of the inventory step-up that was recorded as part of the purchase price adjustment will approximate $16 million. Commenting on the outlook for the fourth quarter and full year, Mr. Gibbons stated, "Operating results for Agis will be consolidated for the first time in our fiscal fourth quarter and the shares outstanding will change to reflect the 22 million shares issued as part of the purchase price. Consistent with the historical seasonal pattern, we anticipate lower sequential sales and profits in our Consumer Healthcare business. The continuing ramp-up in sales of new nicotine gum products should help offset difficult comparisons on our loratadine products.
"We anticipate reported per share results for the full year to range from a loss of $4.45 to a loss of $4.55 per share. On an operating basis, we expect income per share in the range of $0.90 to $0.94." Perrigo will host a conference call to discuss third quarter fiscal 2005 results at 11 a.m. (ET) today.
