Exhibit 99.1 PERRIGO COMPANY ANNOUNCES 10B5-1 PLAN ALLEGAN, Mich., June 16 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- The Perrigo Company (Nasdaq: PRGO; TASE) today announced that it has adopted a written trading plan under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to facilitate the repurchase of its common stock in accordance with the share repurchase program authorized by its Board as announced on April 26, 2005. A broker or brokers selected by the Company will have the authority under terms and limitations specified in the plan to repurchase shares on behalf of the Company under the existing repurchase authorization. Under the terms of the plan, there can be no assurance that any shares will in fact be purchased. Purchases may be made under the plan beginning June 21, 2005. A 10b5-1 plan allows the Company to repurchase shares at times when it would ordinarily not be in the market because of the Company's trading policies. The Company would remain authorized to purchase shares after the termination of the 10b5-1 plan without further announcement.
