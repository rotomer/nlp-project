ITEM 2.02. DISCLOSURE OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION On September 7, 2005, the Perrigo Company released earnings for the fourth quarter and full year of fiscal year 2005. The earnings release contains non-GAAP measures which are defined as a financial measure of the Company's performance that excludes or includes amounts thereby differentiating it from the most directly comparable measure presented in the financial statements that are calculated and presented in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the Company has provided a reconciliation for operating income, net income and earnings per share within its earnings release to the most directly comparable GAAP measure for these non-GAAP measures. The Company excludes a write-off of in-process research and development, restructuring costs, acquisition-related expenses, a write-off of the step-up in value of inventory acquired, settlements related to class action lawsuits and the Federal Trade Commission, and a one-time tax benefit when monitoring and evaluating the on-going financial results and trends of its business due to the non-recurring nature of these items. The Company believes this information is also useful for investors since excluding these non-recurring items provides important insight into the Company's on-going operations. The press release related to Perrigo's earnings is attached as Exhibit 99. The information in this Report is being furnished and shall not be deemed "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that Section.

Exhibit 99.1 PERRIGO COMPANY REPORTS FISCAL YEAR 2005 FINANCIAL RESULTS ALLEGAN, Mich., Sept. 7 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- The Perrigo Company (Nasdaq: PRGO; TASE) today announced results for the full year and fourth quarter ended June 25, 2005. The acquisition of Agis Industries was completed on March 17, 2005. Agis was first included in the consolidated balance sheet as of March 26, 2005 and Agis' operating results are included in the consolidated results beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. Perrigo Company (in thousands, except per share amounts) Fourth Quarter Year-To-Date --------------------------- --------------------------- 2005 2004 2005 2004 ------------ ------------ ------------ ------------ Sales $ 324,538 $ 206,125 $ 1,024,098 $ 898,204 Net (Loss)/Income $ (6,963) $ 8,085 $ (352,983) $ 80,567 Diluted Shares 93,480 73,277 77,313 72,289 Diluted EPS $ (0.07) $ 0.11 $ (4.57) $ 1.11 Commenting on the past year, Perrigo Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, David T. Gibbons, said, "Fiscal 2005 was a busy, exciting and challenging period that brought many changes to Perrigo Company. We gained entry into the generic prescription drug and Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient markets with the acquisition of Agis, providing us a platform for future growth and expanded research and development and manufacturing capabilities. The integration is moving forward quickly and the two management teams are working well together. The acquisition also brought the added complexity of new purchase accounting requirements and new segment reporting. With several unusual items this year and last year, financial comparisons are difficult." The reconciliation tables at the end of this release exclude key non-recurring items to provide insight into our on-going operations. Fiscal Year 2005 Sales for the twelve months ended June 25, 2005 were $1,024.1 million, compared with $898.2 million last year, an increase of 14 percent. The Company reported a loss of $353.0 million, or $4.57 per share, which included charges associated with the Agis acquisition and class action lawsuit expenses as follows:
Net income was also impacted by charges for the loratadine and infant drop product recalls of $6.6 million after-tax, or $0.09 per share. Excluding the charges associated with the acquisition and the class action expense, but including the recall charges against operating income, net income was $62.6 million, or $0.81 per share. Reported net income in fiscal 2004 was $80.6 million, or $1.11 per share. Excluding a one-time tax benefit ($13.1 million after-tax, or $0.18 per share) and an FTC settlement cost ($3.4 million after-tax, or $0.05 per share), net income was $70.9 million, or $0.98 per share. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures is shown in Table II at the end of this press release. Fiscal Fourth Quarter For the fourth quarter, sales were $324.5 million, an increase of 57 percent, compared with $206.1 million last year, reflecting the consolidation of Agis' product sales in the current quarter. The Company reported a net loss of $7.0 million, or $0.07 per share, compared with net income of $8.1 million, or $0.11 per share a year ago. Excluding non-recurring charges consisting primarily of the acquisition-related write-off of the step-up in the value of inventory acquired ($18.2 million after-tax, or $0.20 per share) and the estimated class action settlement charge ($2.9 million after-tax, or $0.03 per share) and including a charge for the infant drops product recall ($1.3 million after-tax, or $0.01 per share), net income in the current quarter was $13.0 million, or $0.14 per share. Excluding a charge for an FTC settlement ($3.4 million after-tax, or $0.05 per share), net income in the prior year fourth quarter was $0.16 per share. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures is shown in Table II at the end of this press release. New Segment Reporting The Company realigned segment reporting following the Agis acquisition, primarily by product, as follows: Consumer Healthcare, Rx Pharmaceuticals and API as well as an Other category. The Consumer Healthcare segment now includes the U.S., U.K. and Mexico Operations. The Other category consists of two operating segments with sales of consumer, pharmaceutical and medical diagnostic products, primarily for the Israeli market. Segment information is shown in Table I at the end of this press release. Consumer Healthcare "The Consumer Healthcare business had a particularly challenging year. The cough and cold season started slowly and peaked late with lower severity, which reduced our unit production and pressured margins. We had two retail-level product recalls, loratadine syrup and infant drops, that reduced operating income by $10.3 million. We are reviewing and enhancing our quality processes for new products, which were the focus of the recalls," said Gibbons. Consumer Healthcare segment sales for fiscal 2005 were $933.3 million, an increase of four percent, compared with $898.2 million in fiscal 2004. The sales increase reflects the incremental sales volume from the Agis acquisition, a full year of sales from Perrigo U.K., acquired in fiscal 2004, and new product sales in the smoking cessation, feminine hygiene and foot care product categories. The increase was offset partially by sales returns due to the product recalls and price and volume declines in the cough/cold, analgesic and gastrointestinal product categories. Reported operating income was $86.6 million compared with $107.9 million last year reflecting lower production levels, increased material costs related to oil pricing, and a reduction of $10.3 million due to the product recalls. Excluding one-time costs for operational improvements and asset impairments ($6.4 million) and the estimated settlements of class action lawsuits ($4.5 million), but including the recall charges against operating income, operating income in fiscal 2005 was $98.3 million compared with $112.6 million in fiscal 2004. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures is shown in Table II at the end of this press release.
Rx Pharmaceuticals Results for fiscal 2005 largely reflect the operations of the Agis business, consolidated with Perrigo Pharmaceuticals for the first time in the fiscal fourth quarter. The Rx Pharmaceuticals segment reported sales of $32.6 million and an operating loss of $10.7 million compared with a loss of $5.0 million last year in our "greenfield" generic Rx start-up. Excluding the write-off of the step-up in the value of inventory acquired of $5.5 million, the operating loss in fiscal 2005 was $5.1 million. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures is shown in Table II at the end of this press release. API Results for fiscal 2005 reflect the operations of the Agis business, reported for the first time in the fiscal fourth quarter. The API segment reported sales of $23.4 million and an operating loss of $7.2 million. Excluding the write-off of the step-up in the value of inventory acquired of $12.5 million, the API segment had operating income of $5.4 million. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures is shown in Table II at the end of this press release. Other The Other category consists of Agis' Israel Consumer and Israel Pharmaceutical and Diagnostics Products segments, reported for the first time in the fiscal fourth quarter. The Other category reported sales of $34.8 million and an operating loss of $4.6 million. Excluding the write-off of the step-up in the value of inventory acquired of $4.4 million, the Other category had an operating loss of $0.2 million. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures is shown in Table II at the end of this press release. Fiscal 2006 Outlook Pseudoephedrine Pseudoephedrine, the active ingredient in many of our Consumer Healthcare cough and cold products, has received significant media and legislative attention. Pseudoephedrine, which is a safe and effective active ingredient, can be used for the manufacturing of the illegal drug methamphetamine. State governments are rapidly approving legislation requiring retailers to remove pseudoephedrine-based products from retail shelves and move them behind the pharmacy counter in an effort to reduce the production of methamphetamine. As retailer actions to move pseudoephedrine behind the counter have accelerated in the last two months, the expected demand for pseudoephedrine products has been sharply reduced. Perrigo's pseudoephedrine-containing product sales totaled $182 million in fiscal 2005. Today, the Company estimates fiscal 2006 sales of approximately $110 - $120 million, down $62 - $72 million from fiscal 2005. The Company is working on the reformulation and validation of phenylephrine-based products, which are substitutes for pseudoephedrine. Reformulated products will be introduced throughout the fiscal 2006 cough, cold and flu season. At this time, many of the brands do not currently have phenylephrine-based products available on the shelf, which makes it difficult to create national brand equivalent formulations. Mr. Gibbons stated that, "The decline of pseudoephedrine sales year-over-year will unfortunately offset a very strong new product portfolio that includes Smoking Cessation, Acetaminophen Arthritis Pain Relief and Acetaminophen Extended Release Pain Relief. New products are estimated to contribute sales in excess of $90 million. "Consumer Healthcare sales are expected to be $1.0 billion, up by approximately $70 million in 2006 with the addition of a full year of Agis OTC product sales," said Gibbons, "and operating income should approximate $105 million, or slightly above last year before non-recurring charges. This is not where we wanted to be, but a good result given the uncontrollable outside factors.
"Sales for the Rx Pharmaceuticals, API and Other Israeli business are forecasted to be approximately $390 million in fiscal 2006 versus $91 million in fiscal 2005. Fiscal 2006 operating income is estimated to be $42 million, which excludes $5 million for the write-off of inventory step-up, which will occur in the first quarter. This operating income will include approximately $9.0 million for intangible amortization. "On a consolidated basis, sales will total approximately $1.4 billion, up $370 million, or 36 percent. Net income is estimated at $72 - $76 million and EPS at $0.74 - $0.78 per share, including additional integration costs at approximately $8 million, and before a write-off of the step-up in the value of inventory acquired of $0.04 per share that will be expensed in the first quarter of fiscal 2006." Mr. Gibbons concluded, "Our earnings forecast has been lowered by $0.20 per share in the past month due to the current expectations of a steeper decline in the sale of pseudoephedrine-based products. We cannot control the external factors impacting the cough and cold product segment, but we are doing all we can to adjust to the new legislation and the acceleration of retailer actions. We believe the pseudoephedrine situation is primarily a one season issue. In addition, because this is our first year of integration, we will incur one-time costs of approximately $8 million, which will not recur in future years. "We are disappointed that what had appeared to be coming together as a very good fiscal 2006 has been impacted so severely by the pseudoephedrine issues. We will work through these challenges as we continue to build on our core strengths to create a strong future. Those core strengths continue to exist in our Consumer Healthcare business, and we are very encouraged so far at what we see in our newly acquired Rx Pharmaceuticals and API business, which is off to a very good start."
