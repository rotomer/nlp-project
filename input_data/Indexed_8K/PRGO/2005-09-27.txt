ITEM 8.01. OTHER EVENTS Product Recall The Company has initiated a voluntary retail-level recall of all affected lots of mesalamine rectal suspension, USP 4 g/60 ml., an anti-inflammatory agent used to treat mild to moderate ulcerative colitis, following reports of leakage related to the bottle closure cap. The recall is not safety related and there have been no reports of injury or illness related to the leakage of this product. The cost of this recall, which includes the write-off of the Company's on-hand inventories and the cost of returns and disposal, is approximated at $2.7 million, or $0.02 per share for the fiscal first quarter 2006 ending September 24, 2005. This expense was considered in the financial guidance for fiscal year 2006 which the Company has previously provided. Certain statements in this 8-K are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and are subject to the safe harbor created thereby.
