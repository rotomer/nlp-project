ITEM 2.02. DISCLOSURE OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION On October 27, 2005, the Perrigo Company released earnings for the first quarter of fiscal year 2006. The earnings release contains non-GAAP measures which are defined as a financial measure of the Company's performance that excludes or includes amounts thereby differentiating it from the most directly comparable measure presented in the financial statements that are calculated and presented in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the Company has provided a reconciliation for gross profit, operating income, net income and earnings per share within its earnings release to the most directly comparable GAAP measure for these non-GAAP measures. The Company excludes a write-off of the step-up in value of inventory acquired when monitoring and evaluating the on-going financial results and trends of its business due to the non-recurring nature of this item. The Company believes this information is also useful for investors since excluding this non-recurring item provides important insight into the Company's on-going operations.

Exhibit 99.1 PERRIGO COMPANY REPORTS FIRST QUARTER FISCAL 2006 FINANCIAL RESULTS ALLEGAN, Mich., Oct. 27 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- The Perrigo Company (Nasdaq: PRGO; TASE) today announced results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2006 ended Sept. 24, 2005. The acquisition of Agis Industries was completed on March 17, 2005. Agis was first included in the consolidated balance sheet as of March 26, 2005 and operating results were first included in the consolidated results in the quarter ended June 25, 2005. Perrigo Company (in thousands, except per share amounts) Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 1st Quarter Ended 1st Quarter Ended 9/24/05 9/25/04 ----------------- ----------------- Sales $ 319,734 $ 227,719 Net Income $ 12,911 $ 17,578 Diluted EPS $ 0.14 $ 0.24 Diluted Shares 94,314 73,043 Net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2006 were $319.7 million, an increase of 40 percent from $227.7 million last year, reflecting the addition of Agis' product sales. Net income was $12.9 million, or $0.14 per share, compared with $17.6 million, or $0.24 per share, a year ago. Excluding the acquisition-related write-off of the step-up in the value of inventory acquired ($3.7 million after-tax, or $0.04 per share) and including a charge for product recalls ($3.3 million after-tax, or $0.03 per share), net income in the quarter was $16.6 million, or $0.18 per share. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures is shown in Table II at the end of this press release. David T. Gibbons, Perrigo Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, "As anticipated, we began to realize the impact of the market transition of certain pseudoephedrine-based cough/cold products moving to a merchandising position behind the pharmacy counter. We reacted early in the quarter to pull production volumes down to reduce our inventory exposure. The retailers' shift away from pseudoephedrine products on the shelf resulted in lower cough/cold product sales and put downward pressures on gross margin. As we work through the pseudoephedrine-related challenges this cough/cold and flu season, we remain confident in the basic strength of our Consumer Healthcare business and encouraged by the results in our new Rx Pharmaceuticals and API businesses, which turned in strong results in the quarter. Our balance sheet remains strong, with manageable debt and cash flow from operations of $18 million this quarter versus a use of cash of $23 million in the first quarter last year. We repurchased 496,000 shares for $7.0 million during the first quarter as part of a previously announced stock repurchase plan." Consumer Healthcare Consumer Healthcare segment sales in the quarter were $228.6 million compared with $227.7 million in the first quarter last year. These results included topical OTC product sales of $19 million related to the Agis acquisition and new product sales, primarily in the smoking cessation category, offset by a decline of $23 million of pseudoephedrine-based cough and cold products. Reported operating income was $13.1 million, compared with $27.9 million a year ago, reflecting the incremental sales of lower-margin topical OTC products acquired in the Agis acquisition and the sales decline of higher- margin pseudoephedrine-based products. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures is shown in Table II at the end of this press release. Rx Pharmaceuticals Results for the current quarter largely reflect the operations of the Agis business. The Rx Pharmaceuticals segment reported sales of $29.1 million and operating income of $3.8 million, which included a charge of $2.8 million before-tax for the recall of mesalamine suspension product. Last year Rx Pharmaceuticals reported an operating loss of $1.3 million as the Company invested in the start-up of the generics business.
API The API segment reported sales of $26.8 million and operating income of $6.6 million. Excluding the write-off of the step-up in the value of inventory acquired of $1.7 million, the API segment had operating income of $8.3 million. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures is shown in Table II at the end of this press release. Other The Other category, which consists of Israel Consumer Products and Israel Pharmaceutical and Diagnostic Products segments, reported sales of $35.2 million and an operating loss of $0.7 million. Excluding the write-off of the step-up in the value of inventory acquired of $2.7 million, the Other category had an operating profit of $2.0 million. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measure is shown in Table II at the end of this press release. Unallocated expense was $2.2 million including on-going corporate costs of $1.6 million and one-time integration costs of $0.6 million.
