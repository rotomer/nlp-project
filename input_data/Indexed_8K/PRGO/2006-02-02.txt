ITEM 2.02. DISCLOSURE OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION On February 2, 2006, the Perrigo Company released earnings for the second quarter of fiscal year 2006. The earnings release contains non-GAAP measures which are defined as a financial measure of the Company's performance that excludes or includes amounts thereby differentiating it from the most directly comparable measure presented in the financial statements that are calculated and presented in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the Company has provided a reconciliation for gross profit, operating income, net income and earnings per share within its earnings release to the most directly comparable GAAP measure for these non-GAAP measures. The Company excludes a write-off of the step-up in value of inventory acquired and a gain on the sale of an equity investment when monitoring and evaluating the on-going financial results and trends of its business due to the non-recurring nature of these items. The Company believes this information is also useful for investors since excluding these non-recurring items provides important insight into the Company's on-going operations. The press release related to Perrigo's earnings is attached as Exhibit 99. The information in this Report is being furnished and shall not be deemed "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that Section.

Exhibit 99.1 PERRIGO COMPANY REPORTS SECOND QUARTER FISCAL 2006 FINANCIAL RESULTS ALLEGAN, Mich., Feb. 2 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- The Perrigo Company (Nasdaq: PRGO; TASE) today announced results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2006 ended Dec. 24, 2005. The acquisition of Agis Industries was completed on March 17, 2005. Agis was first included in the consolidated balance sheet as of March 26, 2005 and operating results were first included in the quarter ended June 25, 2005. Perrigo Company (in thousands, except per share amounts) Second Quarter Six Months ----------------------- ----------------------- 2006 2005 2006 2005 ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- Sales $ 359,697 $ 251,748 $ 679,431 $ 479,467 Net Income $ 25,366 $ 15,838 $ 38,277 $ 33,416 Diluted EPS $ 0.27 $ 0.22 $ 0.41 $ 0.46 Diluted Shares 93,963 73,285 94,167 73,166 Second Quarter Results Net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2006 were $359.7 million, an increase of 43 percent from $251.7 million last year, reflecting the addition of Agis' product sales. Net income was $25.4 million, or $0.27 per share, including a gain of $2.9 million after-tax, or $0.03 per share, on the sale of the Company's non-controlling interest in a Canadian distribution company. Last year, net income was $15.8 million, or $0.22 per share, which included a charge for a product recall of $5.3 million after-tax, or $0.07 per share. Commenting on the second quarter, David T. Gibbons, Perrigo Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, "We are pleased with the performance of the Rx Pharmaceutical and API businesses which delivered strong results this quarter. Our results in Consumer Healthcare reflect the transition occurring in pseudoephedrine-based cough/cold products. The elimination of certain pseudoephedrine products and the shift to behind the counter by many retailers has resulted in lower cough/cold product sales, operational complexity and continued pressure on our Consumer Healthcare segment profits as we push to reformulate these products and introduce a record number of new products at the same time. "Perrigo's financial position remains secure, with strong cash flow from operations of $55 million which has allowed us to repurchase approximately 1.2 million shares for $16 million so far this year." Six Months Results Net sales for the six months ended Dec. 24, 2005 were $679.4 million, an increase of $200 million, or 42 percent, compared with $479.5 million last year, reflecting the addition of Agis' product sales. Net income for the six months was $38.3 million, or $0.41 per share, compared with $33.4 million, or $0.46 per share, a year ago, which included a charge for a product recall of $5.3 million, or $0.07 per share. Excluding an acquisition-related write-off of the step-up in the value of inventory acquired in the first quarter ($3.7 million after-tax, or $0.04 per share) and a gain on the sale of the non-controlling interest in a Canadian distribution company ($2.9 million after-tax, or $0.03 per share) in the second quarter, net income for the six months was $39.1 million, or $0.41 per share. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures is shown in Table II at the end of this press release.
Consumer Healthcare Consumer Healthcare segment sales in the quarter were $272.2 million compared with $251.6 million in the second quarter last year. These results included topical OTC product sales of $14 million related to the Agis acquisition and $17 million in new product sales, offset by a decline of $20 million of pseudoephedrine-based cough and cold products. Operating income was $32.1 million, compared with $26.5 million a year-ago. For the first six months of fiscal 2006, Consumer Healthcare sales were $500.9 million compared with $479.3 million in the first six months last year. These results included topical OTC product sales of $32 million related to the Agis acquisition and $26 million in new product sales, offset by a decline of $43 million on pseudoephedrine-based cough and cold products. Operating income was $45.2 million, compared with $54.4 million a year ago, reflecting the incremental sales of lower-margin topical OTC products acquired in the Agis acquisition, the sales decline of higher-margin pseudoephedrine-based products and higher inventory obsolescence expenses. Rx Pharmaceuticals The Rx Pharmaceuticals segment reported sales of $28.6 million and operating income of $5.3 million. In the prior year, the Rx Pharmaceutical segment reported an operating loss of $2.4 million, reflecting the Company's investment in the start-up of the generics business. For the six months, sales were $57.7 million and operating income was $9.1 million, including a pre-tax charge of $2.8 million for a product recall in the first quarter, compared with an operating loss of $3.6 million in the same period last year. API Second quarter sales for the API segment were $26.9 million and operating income was $6.5 million. For the six months, sales were $53.7 million and operating income was $13.1 million. Excluding the first quarter write-off of the step-up in the value of inventory acquired of $1.7 million, the API segment had operating income of $14.9 million for the six months. Other The Other category, consisting of Israel Consumer Products and Israel Pharmaceutical and Diagnostic Products segments, reported sales of $32.0 million and operating income of $0.4 million. Sales for the first six months of fiscal 2006 were $67.2 million with an operating loss of $0.3 million. Excluding the first quarter write-off of the step-up in the value of the inventory acquired of $2.7 million, the Other category had an operating income of $2.4 million. In the second quarter, unallocated expense was $5 million, including corporate costs of $3.6 million and integration costs of $1.4 million. For the first six months, unallocated expense was $7.1 million, consisting of corporate costs of $5.1 million and integration costs of $2.0 million. New Developments The Company announced today that it has received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to market over-the-counter (OTC) nicotine polacrilex lozenges. With the approval, the Company has been granted 180 days of generic market exclusivity, beginning with the first shipments which are expected within 30 days. The FDA determined the product is bioequivalent to GlaxoSmithKline's Commit(R) lozenge, which is indicated as an aid to smoking cessation. Sales for the brand name product at retail were approximately $100 million in calendar 2005. The Company has entered into a five-year supply, purchase and license agreement with another pharmaceutical company pursuant to which the Company will produce API for the other company and sell certain intellectual property assets. The Company has also entered into a collaboration agreement with that company pursuant to which the two companies will collaborate on the development and manufacture of two drug products. Revenues from sales under the supply, purchase and license agreement and fees from the collaboration agreement will contribute to the revenues and operating income of the Company's API and Rx Pharmaceutical businesses, respectively, in the second half of 2006 and beyond.
Outlook Mr. Gibbons stated that, "Despite all of the ups and downs within our business segments, the outlook remains the same and we continue to anticipate full year operating earnings results of $0.74 - $0.78 per share. The prior guidance for reported earnings was $0.70 - $0.74 per share, which included the acquisition-related inventory step-up expense of $0.04 per share. Because of the gain on the Canadian distribution company sale, the reported earnings guidance increases to $0.74 - $0.78 per share. "The Rx Pharmaceutical, API and Other business has exceeded expectations in the first half of the year. This business will also be strong in the second half with the completion of the supply agreement and the collaboration agreement with another pharmaceutical company, which will continue to contribute strongly through next year as well. R&D spending will increase significantly in the second half as we invest in our new product pipeline to ensure our future. The anticipated strong results from the Rx Pharmaceutical and API segments, although not quite as strong as in the first half, including the benefit of the noted agreements, will help offset projected weakness in the Consumer Healthcare segment in the second half. "Our review of Consumer Healthcare operations and projections of current business trends indicate weaker sales and margins than originally planned, primarily related to launch delays and lower sales of new products. In addition, we expect a continuing negative impact from pseudoephedrine as we convert a large number of formulations to non-pseudoephedrine ingredients. This conversion has proven to be more complex and difficult than anticipated. It is clear that we will not overcome the negative impact of the new product and pseudoephedrine issues to the extent anticipated. "While pseudoephedrine continues to be a difficult situation, Perrigo has been confronted with difficult outside influences in the past, and although larger and more complex, this one has some similarity to the PPA product withdrawal of November 2000. We worked our way through that situation and we will work through this one as well, targeting a rebound in our Consumer Healthcare business for next year," concluded Mr. Gibbons.
