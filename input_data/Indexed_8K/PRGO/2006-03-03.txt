"Doug has been with Perrigo for more than six years. He has played a significant role in supporting our tremendous growth and in driving the changes that have diversified our company and enhanced shareholder value," said David T. Gibbons, Perrigo Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "We are grateful for Doug's leadership and we look forward to a seamless transition in the coming months."

Brown earned her MBA degree from the University of Chicago and her Bachelor's degree from the University of Illinois. Brown is fluent in several languages. Beginning March 1, Brown took on the added responsibility for Perrigo's Investor Relations, Treasury and Tax departments. "Judy and I have worked side-by-side for nearly two years," Schrank said.
