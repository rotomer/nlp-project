Exhibit 99.1 PERRIGO COMPANY REPORTS THIRD QUARTER FISCAL 2006 FINANCIAL RESULTS ALLEGAN, Mich., April 27 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- The Perrigo Company (Nasdaq: PRGO; TASE) today announced results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2006 ended March 25, 2006. The acquisition of Agis Industries was completed on March 17, 2005. Agis was first included in the consolidated balance sheet as of March 26, 2005 and operating results were first included in the quarter ended June 25, 2005. Perrigo Company (in thousands, except per share amounts) Third Quarter Nine Months --------------------------- --------------------------- 2006 2005 2006 2005 ------------ ------------ ------------ ------------ Sales $ 332,321 $ 220,093 $ 1,011,752 $ 699,560 Net Income $ 20,861 $ (379,436) $ 59,138 $ (346,020) Diluted EPS $ 0.22 $ (5.15) $ 0.63 $ (4.81) Diluted Shares 94,044 73,660 94,143 71,970 Third Quarter Results Net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2006 were $332.3 million, an increase of $112.2 million, or 51 percent from $220.1 million last year, largely reflecting the addition of Agis' product sales. Net income was $20.9 million this year, or $0.22 per share and includes a $1.3 million reversal of the accrual related to the Loratadine recall. In fiscal 2005, the Company reported a net loss of $379.4 million, or $5.15 per share, which included charges of $395.6 million associated with the acquisition of Agis. Excluding these charges, net income and earnings per share would have been $16.2 million and $0.22 per share, respectively. (A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures is shown in Table II at the end of this press release.) Commenting on third quarter results, David T. Gibbons, Perrigo Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, "The results in our Consumer Healthcare segment continue to reflect the ongoing market impact of pseudoephedrine-based cough and cold products, as retailers respond to the passage of Federal legislation. Despite a decline of $26 million in sales of pseudoephedrine products, our Consumer Healthcare sales increased 10 percent, as the pseudoephedrine sales loss was offset by topical product sales of $16 million related to the Agis acquisition, strong new product revenues in smoking cessation, and increased vitamin sales. In February, we began shipping over-the-counter nicotine lozenges, an aid to smoking cessation, and we expect to expand distribution of this product during the fourth quarter. We continue to see good results from our Rx and API businesses. "Cash flow in our third quarter was strong, allowing for continued share repurchases, dividend payments and debt reduction," concluded Gibbons. On February 21, 2006, the Company announced that the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional $60 million of common stock through February 16, 2007, under its ongoing share repurchase program. 1
The $395.6 million of last year's acquisition-related charges noted above included: * A write-off of in-process research and development of $388.6 million, which was not deductible for tax purposes; * A charge for operational improvements and asset impairments in the Consumer Healthcare segment of $6.4 million pre-tax, or $4.1 million after-tax; * Acquisition-related legal, audit and integration expenses of $4.6 million pre-tax, or $2.9 million after-tax. Nine Months Results Net sales for the nine months ended March 25, 2006 were $1,011.8 million, an increase of $312.2 million, or 45 percent, compared with $699.6 million last year, largely reflecting the addition of Agis' product sales. Net income for the nine months this year was $59.1 million, or $0.63 per share and includes a $1.3 million reversal of the accrual related to the Loratadine recall. In fiscal 2005, the net loss was $346.0 million, or $4.81 per share, which included a charge for the Loratadine recall of $5.3 million, or $0.07 per share. Excluding an acquisition-related write-off of the step-up in the value of inventory acquired ($3.7 million after-tax, or $0.04 per share) and a gain on the sale of the interest in a Canadian distribution company ($2.9 million after-tax, or $0.03 per share), net income for the nine months in the current year would have been $59.9 million, or $0.64 per share. In the prior year nine months, excluding the $395.6 million of acquisition-related charges, net income would have been $49.6 million, or $0.69 per share. (A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures is shown in Table II at the end of this press release.) Outlook Mr. Gibbons stated, "Our full year guidance for reported earnings of $0.74 to $0.78 per share remains unchanged. Our third quarter results were in line with expectations as the Consumer Healthcare business continued to reflect the impact of pseudoephedrine product dynamics, while the Rx and API segments continued to deliver good operating results. Even with increasing investments in research and development and competitive pricing on several key Rx and API products in the fourth quarter, we still anticipate that results from these businesses will help to balance the challenges in Consumer Healthcare. "We expect recently launched new products in Consumer Healthcare to make significant revenue and profit contributions in the fourth quarter. Because of the new products, fourth quarter profitability should be in line with historical levels despite increased costs for the large number of cough/cold product reformulations and for investments to support our high standards of quality assurance. "We are disappointed by the year-over-year decline in Consumer Healthcare margins driven by pseudoephedrine and the resulting operational issues. We continue to invest in quality and new product development, and remain focused on cost reduction and operational changes that are necessary to drive margin improvement," concluded Gibbons. 2
Consumer Healthcare Consumer Healthcare segment sales in the third quarter were $241.2 million compared with $219.7 million last year. A sales decline of $26 million in pseudoephedrine-based cough and cold products was offset by topical over-the-counter (OTC) product sales of $16 million related to the Agis acquisition and $24 million in new product sales. The Company began shipping nicotine polacrilix lozenges and recorded strong sales in the smoking cessation, feminine hygiene, and vitamin product categories. Operating income was $21.5 million and includes a $2.1 million reversal of the accrual related to the Loratadine recall. In fiscal 2005, operating income was $19.3 million. Excluding a $6.4 million charge for asset impairment and acquisition-related restructuring, operating income was $25.7 million. For nine months of fiscal 2006, Consumer Healthcare sales were $742.1 million, compared with $699 million in the nine months last year. A sales decline of $69 million in pseudoephedrine-based cough and cold products was offset by topical OTC product sales of $48 million related to the Agis acquisition and $51 million in new product sales. Operating income was $66.6 million, and includes a $2.1 million reversal of the accrual related to the Loratadine recall. In fiscal 2005, operating income was $73.7 million. Excluding a $6.4 million charge for asset impairment and acquisition-related restructuring, operating income was $80.1 million. Rx Pharmaceuticals The Rx Pharmaceuticals segment reported sales of $30.2 million and operating income of $4.3 million. The Company announced final approvals for desoximetasone gel, ciclopirox olamine cream, terconazole vaginal suppositories and a tentative approval for sertraline hydrochloride tablets during the quarter. In the prior year, the Rx Pharmaceutical segment reported an operating loss of $1.9 million, reflecting the Company's investment in the start-up of its generics business. For the nine months, sales were $88.0 million and operating income was $13.4 million, which included a pre-tax charge of $2.8 million for a product recall in the first quarter, compared with an operating loss of $5.5 million in the same period last year. API Third quarter sales for the API segment were $30.3 million and operating income was $8 million. Sales in the quarter included $4 million for non-product revenues. For the nine months, sales were $83.9 million and operating income was $21.1 million. Excluding a first quarter write-off of the step-up in the value of inventory acquired of $1.7 million, the API segment had operating income of $22.8 million for the nine months. Other The Other category, consisting of Israel Consumer Products and Israel Pharmaceutical and Diagnostic Products segments, reported sales of $30.6 million and an operating loss of $0.3 million. Sales for nine months were $97.8 million, with an operating loss of $0.6 million. Excluding a first quarter write-off of the step-up in the value of inventory acquired of $2.7 million, the Other category had operating income of $2.1 million. In the third quarter, unallocated expenses were $3.1 million, including corporate costs of $2.5 million and integration costs of $0.6 million. For nine months, unallocated expenses were $10.2 million, consisting of corporate costs of $7.6 million and integration costs of $2.6 million. 3
Significant Events On February 2, 2006, the Company announced it received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to market OTC nicotine polacrilix lozenges. With the approval, the Company was granted 180 days of generic market exclusivity. The FDA determined the product was bioequivalent to GlaxoSmithKline's Commit(R) lozenge, which is indicated as an aid to smoking cessation. Initial shipments of the product began in late-February. On February 2, the Company also said that it entered into a supply, purchase and license agreement with another pharmaceutical company pursuant to which the Company will produce API for the other company and sell certain intellectual property assets. The Company also entered into a collaboration agreement with that company pursuant to which the two companies will collaborate on the development and manufacture of two drug products. Revenues from sales under the supply, purchase and license agreement and fees from the collaboration agreement contributed to operating income in the third quarter and will continue to have a positive impact in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 and beyond.
