Exhibit 99.1 PERRIGO COMPANY REPORTS FISCAL YEAR 2006 FINANCIAL RESULTS ALLEGAN, Mich., Aug. 9 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- The Perrigo Company (Nasdaq: PRGO; TASE) today announced results for the full year and fourth quarter ended July 1, 2006. The acquisition of Agis Industries was completed on March 17, 2005. Agis was first included in the consolidated balance sheet as of March 26, 2005 and operating results were first included in the quarter ended June 25, 2005. David T. Gibbons, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Perrigo Company commented on the results. "The fourth quarter was a strong finish to a very challenging year. Our Consumer Healthcare segment has continued to work through the changing market dynamics of the Cough/Cold category brought on by the regulatory changes that now restrict the sale of pseudoephedrine as an active ingredient in OTC products. We are focused on bringing many reformulated Cough/Cold products to our customers' shelves. On a positive note, new product sales of $77 million made fiscal year 2006 Perrigo Consumer Healthcare's best new product year ever." Mr. Gibbons added, "We were very pleased with the stronger than anticipated results from our Rx and API businesses. Our strategy to broaden our business portfolio helped us deliver value in the face of some significant market challenges in fiscal year 2006." Fiscal Year 2006 Sales for the 12 months ended July 1, 2006 were $1,366.8 million, compared with $1,024.1 million last year, an increase of 33 percent, largely reflecting the addition of Agis' product sales. Reported net income for the 12 months was $71.4 million, or $0.76 per share. In fiscal year 2005, the Company reported a net loss of $353.0 million, or $4.57 per share, which included charges primarily associated with the Agis acquisition. The following is a summary of the non-recurring charges included in fiscal years 2006 and 2005: 2006 2005 -------- -------- * Restructuring $ 5.7 $ 4.1 * Inventory step-up 3.7 18.2 * Gain on sale of equity investment (2.9) * Write-off of in-process research & development 386.8 * Acquisition costs 3.6 * Class action lawsuit 2.9 $ 6.5 $ 415.6 Excluding the impact of the charges noted above, adjusted net income for fiscal 2006 was $77.8 million, or $0.83 per share. For fiscal year 2005 adjusted net income was $62.6 million, or $0.81 per share. (Refer to Table II at the end of this press release for additional non-GAAP disclosure information.)
Fiscal Fourth Quarter In the fiscal year 2006 fourth quarter, sales were $355.1 million, an increase of $30.6 million, or nine percent, compared with $324.5 million last year. Reported net income was $12.3 million, or $0.13 per share, compared with a net loss of $7.0 million, or $0.07 per share a year ago. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005, the Company recorded charges primarily associated with the acquisitions. These non-recurring charges, as well as one recorded in the fourth quarter of 2006, are summarized below: 2006 2005 -------- -------- * Restructuring $ 5.7 * Inventory step-up $ 18.2 * Write-off of in-process R&D (1.8) * Acquisition costs 0.6 * Class action lawsuit 2.9 $ 5.7 $ 19.9 Adjusted net income excluding these items above was $17.9 million, or $0.19 per share, compared with net income of $13.0 million, or $0.14 per share a year ago. (Refer to Table II at the end of this press release for additional non-GAAP disclosure information.) Consumer Healthcare Consumer Healthcare segment sales for fiscal year 2006 were $994.2 million, an increase of seven percent, compared with $933.3 million last year. A sales decline of $90 million in pseudoephedrine-based cough and cold products was offset by incremental topical OTC product sales of $42 million related to the Agis acquisition and $77 million in new product sales. Reported operating income was $78.8 million compared with $86.6 million last year. Adjusted operating income was $88.0 million compared with $98.3 million last year. Consumer Healthcare sales in the fourth quarter were $258.3 million, an increase of 10 percent compared with $234.3 million last year. Reported operating income was $13.6 million, compared with $12.9 million a year ago. Adjusted operating income was $22.5 million, compared with $18.3 million a year ago.
Mr. Gibbons stated, "Strong fourth quarter results in the analgesics, smoking cessation and vitamin categories pushed sales higher. A positive response to summer promotional programs along with the sales of some pseudoephedrine replacement products contributed to the gain. Throughout the year, we have continued to concentrate on new product development and our ability to expand our store brand offerings. This year's successful expansion of the smoking cessation category is an example of this focus." Consumer Healthcare Restructuring As part of the on-going evaluation of ways to improve asset performance and continue to build on the opportunities for efficiency created through the acquisition of Agis, the Company announced in the fourth quarter its plans to close manufacturing plants in Montague and Holland, Michigan. Profitable product lines from these plants will be transferred to plants in Allegan, Michigan and The Bronx, New York. The Company recorded an after-tax restructuring charge of $5.7 million, or $0.06 per share in the fourth quarter related primarily to asset impairments of these plants. The Company also anticipates it will incur a one-time cost of approximately $3 million in fiscal year 2007 related to the process of completing these closures. Rx Pharmaceutical The Rx Pharmaceutical segment reported sales of $120.9 million in fiscal year 2006, compared with $32.6 million a year ago. Reported operating income was $16.6 million, which included a pre-tax charge of $2.8 million for a product recall, compared with an operating loss of $10.7 million last year. Excluding inventory step-up charges, the adjusted operating loss last year was $5.1 million. In the fiscal year 2006 fourth quarter, sales were $33.0 million, including $5.2 million in non-product revenue, compared with $32.0 million a year ago. Reported operating income was $3.2 million compared with an operating loss last year of $5.2 million. Excluding the inventory step-up charges, adjusted operating income was $0.4 million last year. API Fiscal year 2006 sales for the API segment were $110.7 million compared with $23.4 million in fiscal year 2005. Sales in the current year included $4.0 million in non-product revenues. Reported operating income was $25.9 million compared with a reported operating loss of $7.2 million last year. Excluding inventory step-up charges, adjusted operating income was $27.7 million in fiscal 2006 and $5.4 million in fiscal 2005. Fourth quarter sales were $26.8 million, an increase of 15 percent compared with $23.4 million in 2005. Reported operating income was $4.8 million compared with an operating loss of $7.2 million last year. Excluding inventory step-up charges, adjusted operating income last year was $5.4 million. Other The Other category, consisting of Israel Consumer Products and Israel Pharmaceutical and Diagnostic Products segments, recorded sales of $140.9 million compared with $34.8 million a year ago. Reported operating income was $3.5 million compared with an operating loss of $4.6 million last year. Excluding inventory step-up charges, the segment had adjusted operating income of $6.2 million in fiscal year 2006 and an adjusted operating loss of $0.2 million in fiscal year 2005. In the fourth quarter, sales were $37.0 million compared with $34.8 million a year ago. Reported operating income was $2.6 million compared with an operating loss of $4.6 million last year. For the prior year, the adjusted operating loss was $0.2 million. For fiscal year 2006, unallocated expenses were $13.5 million, consisting of corporate costs of $10.8 million and integration costs of $2.7 million. In the fourth quarter, unallocated expenses were $3.4 million, primarily corporate costs.
Outlook Mr. Gibbons looks forward to fiscal year 2007. "We believe that the worst of the pseudoephedrine transition is behind us and we are prepared to bring many new replacement products to customers' shelves for this coming season. Fiscal year 2007 should be better than 2006 for Consumer Healthcare although the cough/cold category will not be back to fiscal year 2005 levels. Perrigo Consumer Healthcare will have another solid new product year led by the smoking cessation category. The positive impact on operating margins of our new product launches will be tempered somewhat by higher research and development spending and by our on-going investments in quality systems and infrastructure to continually improve customer service levels. Consumer Healthcare sales are expected to grow 3% to 4%, exceeding $1 billion for the first time. We anticipate that operating income, excluding $3 million of restructuring costs, should be between $98 to $104 million." Mr. Gibbons added, "In our Rx and API businesses, fiscal year 2007 will be a somewhat unusual year in that new products will not contribute significantly to our results. Fiscal year 2007 will also see increased pricing and margin pressure in the marketplace on some of our existing, core products. At the same time, investment for new product research and development will increase next year with a focus on complex, high-barrier niche products that will be key to our future growth in this business. We realize that concentrating more effort on these types of products represents longer time-to-market, but we believe that these products will drive higher earnings growth over the long term. Sales for the Rx Pharmaceuticals, API and Other Israeli businesses are forecasted to increase 6% in fiscal year 2007 to approximately $400 million. We estimate that fiscal year 2007 operating income should be between $45 to $49 million, a year-over-year decline on an operating basis." Mr. Gibbons concluded, "Our fiscal year 2007 earnings guidance on an operating basis is expected to be in the range of $0.86 to $0.91 per share excluding $0.02 per share of restructuring costs."
