ITEM 2.02. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION On October 31, 2006, the Perrigo Company released earnings for the first quarter and fiscal year 2007. The earnings release contains non-GAAP measures which are defined as a financial measure of the Company's performance that excludes or includes amounts thereby differentiating it from the most directly comparable measure presented in the financial statements that are calculated and presented in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the Company has provided a reconciliation for gross profit, operating income, net income and earnings per share within its earnings release to the most directly comparable GAAP measure for these non-GAAP measures. The Company excludes a fiscal 2006 write-off of the step-up in value of inventory acquired when monitoring and evaluating the on-going financial results and trends of its business due to the non-recurring nature of this item. The Company believes this information is also useful for investors since excluding this non-recurring item provides important insight into the Company's on-going operations. The press release related to Perrigo's earnings is attached as Exhibit 99. The information in this Report is being furnished and shall not be deemed "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that Section.

Exhibit 99.1 PERRIGO COMPANY'S FIRST QUARTER REVENUE INCREASES SEVEN PERCENT DRIVEN BY ORGANIC AND NEW PRODUCT GROWTH ALLEGAN, Mich., Oct. 31 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- The Perrigo Company (Nasdaq: PRGO; TASE) today announced results for its fiscal year 2007 first quarter that ended September 30, 2006. Perrigo Company (in thousands, except per share amounts) Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2006 1st Quarter 1st Quarter Ended Ended 9/30/06 9/24/05 ------------ ------------ Sales $ 340,868 $ 319,734 Net Income $ 17,549 $ 12,911 Diluted EPS $ 0.19 $ 0.14 Diluted Shares 93,521 94,314 Sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2007 were $340.9 million, an increase of seven percent. Net income was $17.5 million, or $0.19 per share, compared with $12.9 million, or $0.14 per share, a year ago. The first quarter of fiscal 2006 included an acquisition-related write-off of the step-up in the value of inventory acquired ($3.7 million after-tax, or $0.04 per share). Excluding this adjustment, net income was $16.6 million, or $0.18 per share. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures is shown in Table II at the end of this press release. Joseph Papa, Perrigo's President and CEO, stated, "Fiscal 2007 is off to a good start, with year-over-year sales increases across our business portfolio. New product launches led by the smoking cessation category continue to be a driver for Consumer Healthcare's performance. At the same time, we are in the process of launching over thirty newly reformulated cough/cold products in order to meet the retailers' and consumers' needs for the current season. The Rx Pharmaceutical and API businesses grew sales in a marketplace that continues to be very competitive." Mr. Papa added, "I am very excited about all of our on-going activity related to bringing new products to the marketplace and the significant work being done by our global research and development teams to allow for more such new product launches in the future." Consumer Healthcare Consumer Healthcare segment sales in the quarter were $242.5 million compared with $227.1 million in the first quarter last year, an increase of $15.1 million, or seven percent. These results were driven by new product introductions of $7.3 million, primarily in the smoking cessation and vitamin categories, as well as growth of $5.1 million or 19 percent in the Mexican and U.K. operations. Reported operating income was $18.1 million, compared with $13.3 million a year ago, reflecting higher gross profit from increased sales volume in both the domestic and international operations. On September 25, the Company announced it had received approval from the Food and Drug Administration for over-the-counter Famotidine tablets, 20 mg (Maximum Strength Pepcid(R) AC tablets) indicated for the prevention and treatment of heartburn due to acid indigestion. Shipments began immediately.
Subsequent to the end of the first quarter, the Company began shipping coated mint nicotine polacrilix gum. This is the store brand equivalent to Nicorette(R) Fresh Mint(TM) coated gum which has estimated retail sales of more than $100 million. Rx Pharmaceuticals The Rx Pharmaceuticals segment reported sales of $31.4 million, including $5.4 million in non-product revenues, compared with $29.1 million a year ago. Operating income was $5.8 million up from $3.8 million last year. API The API segment reported sales of $29.8 million compared with sales of $26.8 million a year ago. Operating income was $4.7 million compared with $6.6 million last year, reflecting a combination of lower margins on existing product sales, and higher research and development and selling and administration expenses. Excluding inventory step-up charges, adjusted operating income was $8.3 million a year ago. Other The Other category, which consists of Israel Consumer Products and Israel Pharmaceutical and Diagnostic Products segments, reported sales of $37.2 million compared with $36.7 million last year. Reported operating income was $2.7 million compared with an operating loss of $0.9 million last year. Excluding inventory step-up charges, adjusted operating income was $1.8 million last year. Outlook Looking forward, Mr. Papa noted, "Our portfolio of broad healthcare solutions continues to enable us to deliver value in a challenging marketplace. I am confident in our ability to effectively manage through the operational complexities of the launches of our new and reformulated products this year. We are continuing to invest in strong new product opportunities for future years in all of our businesses. Throughout the organization, we continue our focus on quality, with parallel efforts on continued cost reduction and working capital management."
