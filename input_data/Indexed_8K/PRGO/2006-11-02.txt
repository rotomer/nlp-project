TERMS In consideration of the premises and of the mutual agreements herein contained, the parties agree as follows: ARTICLE 1. AMENDMENTS. The Credit Agreement is amended as follows: 1.1 The definitions of Applicable Rate and Maturity Date in Section 1.01 are restated as follows: "Applicable Rate" means, for any day, with respect to any Eurocurrency Loan or with respect to the facility fees payable hereunder, as the case may be, the applicable rate per annum set forth below under the caption "Applicable Margin" or "Facility Fee Rate", as the case may be, based upon the Leverage Ratio as of the most recent determination date: The Applicable Rate shall be determined in accordance with the foregoing table based on the Leverage Ratio as determined in the then most recent quarterly financial statements for the first three Fiscal
Quarters of each Fiscal Year and the audited year end financial statements for the last Fiscal Quarter (in each case calculated on a trailing four quarter basis) of the U.S. Borrower. Adjustments, if any, to the Applicable Rate shall be effective five business days after the Administrative Agent is scheduled to receive the applicable financials under Section 5.01(a) or (b) and certificate under Section 5.01(c). If the U.S. Borrower fails to deliver the financials to the Administrative Agent at the time required hereunder, then the Applicable Rate shall be set at Level 1 until five days after such financials are so delivered. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Applicable Rate shall be set at Level 4 as of October 30, 2006 and shall be adjusted for the first time based on the financials for the first Fiscal Quarter ending thereafter. "Maturity Date" means October 30, 2011. 1.2 The reference in Section 2.08(d)(iii) and in Exhibit D to "$325,000,000" shall be deleted and "$450,000,000" shall be substituted in place thereof.
