ITEM 2.02. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION - ---------- --------------------------------------------- On February 1, 2007, the Perrigo Company released earnings for the second quarter and fiscal year 2007. The earnings release contains non-GAAP measures which are defined as a financial measure of the Company's performance that excludes or includes amounts thereby differentiating it from the most directly comparable measure presented in the financial statements that are calculated and presented in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the Company has provided a reconciliation for gross profit, operating income, net income and earnings per share within its earnings release to the most directly comparable GAAP measure for these non-GAAP measures. The Company excludes a fiscal 2007 restructuring charge, a fiscal 2006 write-off of the step-up in value of inventory acquired and a fiscal 2006 gain on the sale of an equity investment when monitoring and evaluating the on-going financial results and trends of its business due to the non-recurring nature of this item. The Company believes this information is also useful for investors since excluding this non-recurring item provides important insight into the Company's on-going operations.

Exhibit 99.1 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE PERRIGO COMPANY'S SECOND QUARTER REVENUE GROWTH DRIVEN BY NEW PRODUCTS ALLEGAN, Mich. - Feb. 1, 2007 - The Perrigo Company (Nasdaq: PRGO; TASE) today announced results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2007 ended December 30, 2006. Perrigo Company (in thousands, except per share amounts) Second Quarter Six Months ----------------------- ----------------------- 2007 2006 2007 2006 ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- Sales $ 370,629 $ 359,697 $ 710,844 $ 679,431 Net Income $ 21,088 $ 25,366 $ 37,970 $ 38,277 Diluted EPS $ 0.23 $ 0.27 $ 0.41 $ 0.41 Diluted Shares 93,506 93,963 93,595 94,167 Second Quarter Results - ---------------------- Sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2007 were $370.6 million, an increase of three percent from $359.7 million last year. Net income was $21.1 million, or $0.23 per share, and included costs for a product recall of $3.2 million after-tax, or $0.03 per share. In the second quarter last year, net income was $25.4 million, or $0.27 per share, and included a gain on the sale of the Company's interest in a Canadian distribution company of $2.9 million after-tax, or $0.03 per share. Excluding this transaction, adjusted net income last year was $22.4 million, or $0.24 per share. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures is shown in Table II at the end of this press release. Commenting on the second quarter, Joseph C. Papa, Perrigo's President and Chief Executive Officer said, "I am pleased with the continued success of our new product launches this year, led by those in our Smoking Cessation category. While Perrigo had another strong new product quarter, our results reflect the impact of the November 2006 Acetaminophen recall and the lower than anticipated sales of cough/cold and pain reliever products in the Consumer Healthcare business. The weak demand for our key products corresponds to the mild cold and flu season experienced through December. This is similar to what we've seen the past two cough/cold seasons."
Six Months Results - ------------------ Sales for the first six months ended December 30, 2006 were $710.8 million, an increase of five percent compared with $679.4 million last year. Net income was $38.0 million, or $0.41 per share, which included expenses for a product recall of $3.9 million after-tax, or $0.04 per share. In the first six months last fiscal year, net income was $38.3 million, or $0.41 per share. Excluding an acquisition-related write-off of the step-up in the value of inventory acquired in the first quarter last year ($3.7 million after-tax, or $0.04 per share) and a gain on the sale of the non-controlling interest in a Canadian distribution company ($2.9 million after-tax, or $0.03 per share) in the second quarter last year, net income for the six months was $39.1 million, or $0.41 per share. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures is shown in Table II at the end of this press release. The effective tax rate for the six months year to date was 18.4%, down from 33.9% last year. This lower rate was a result of the higher proportion of income from non-US businesses versus last year, international tax planning and the retroactive renewal of the research and development tax credit that was part of the Tax Relief and Healthcare Act enacted into law this quarter. Consumer Healthcare - ------------------- Consumer Healthcare segment sales in the quarter were $275.9 million, compared with $270.2 million in the second quarter last year. These results included $19.5 million in new product sales, led by the recently launched coated mint nicotine gum and nicotine lozenge products, offset by a decline in cough/cold and pain relief products. Operating income was $17.4 million, compared with $31.4 million a year ago, reflecting lower cough/cold and analgesics category sales and expenses for a product recall. For the first six months of fiscal 2007, Consumer Healthcare sales were $517.8 million, compared with $497.3 million in the first six months last fiscal year. These results included $26.8 million in new product sales, offset by a decline in cough and cold category product sales. Operating income was $34.5 million, compared with $44.8 million a year ago. On November 9, 2006, Perrigo announced that it had initiated a voluntary, nationwide product recall to the retail level of certain lots of its store brand Acetaminophen 500 mg caplets. At that time, the Company estimated the cost to pull back product from the retailers' warehouses and shelves to be $2.9 million pre-tax. The scope of the recall grew subsequent to that announcement as the Company proactively addressed consumers' inquiries. The Company now estimates that the total cost of the recall, including consumer level returns and refunds will be $6.0 million pre-tax, $3.9 million after-tax, or $0.04 per share. Discussions continue with the raw material supplier to determine the extent to which the recall-related materials costs may be recoverable. 2
Rx Pharmaceuticals - ------------------ The Rx Pharmaceuticals segment reported sales of $28.3 million in the quarter, including $6.2 million of service and royalty revenue, compared with $28.6 million a year ago. Operating income was $3.7 million, compared with $5.3 million last year, primarily as a result of increased investment for research and development. For the first six months of fiscal 2007, sales were $59.7 million and operating income was $9.5 million. For the same period last year, sales were $57.7 million and operating income was $9.1 million, including a pre-tax charge of $2.8 million for a product recall in the first quarter. API - --- Second quarter sales in the API segment were $28.6 million, compared with $26.9 million a year ago. Operating income was $5.9 million, compared with $6.5 million last year and reflects a significant increase in research and development investments. For the first six months, sales were $58.4 million, compared with $53.7 million a year ago, and operating income was $10.6 million, compared with $13.1 million last year. Excluding a $1.7 million first quarter write-off of the step-up in the value of inventory acquired, operating income for the first six months last year was $14.9 million. Other - ----- The Other category, consisting of the Israel Consumer Products and Israel Pharmaceutical and Diagnostic Products segments, reported sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2007 of $37.8 million, up 11 percent from $34.0 million a year ago. Operating income was $3.0 million compared with $1.0 million last year. Sales for the first six months were $75.0 million, up six percent from $70.7 million last year, and operating income was $5.6 million, compared with $0.1 million last year. Excluding a $2.7 million first quarter write-off of the step-up in the value of inventory acquired, the Other category recorded operating income of $2.8 million for the first six months last year. Outlook - ------- The Company anticipates earnings for the full fiscal year in the range of $0.86 to $0.91 per share, excluding $0.01 per share of restructuring costs. The Company expects its full-year tax rate to be in the range of 20 to 23 percent, down from the previous estimate of 30 to 32 percent, as a result of a change in the worldwide income mix and tax planning measures. Mr. Papa stated, "We will focus closely on monitoring production levels and costs in the second half of the fiscal year. While some of the issues this quarter are one time events, such as the Acetaminophen recall, our focus on quality investments and the reduction of production costs will lead us in a return to historical gross margin levels." "We will maintain our increased investments in research and development as previously planned. Our long-term outlook continues to be positive as we focus on bringing important new products to market while we deliver value to our customers and their consumers." 3
