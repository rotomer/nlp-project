Perrigo Reports Strong Fiscal 2007 Third Quarter Revenue Growth Third Quarter Sales $362 million, up 9% Third Quarter Cash Provided by Operations of $57 million ALLEGAN, Mich., May 8 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- The Perrigo Company (Nasdaq: PRGO; TASE) today announced results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2007 ended March 31, 2007. Perrigo Company (in thousands, except per share amounts) Third Quarter Nine Months 2007 2006 2007 2006 Sales $362,288 $332,321 $1,073,132 $1,011,752 Net Income $17,056 $ 20,860 $ 55,026 $ 59,138 Diluted EPS $ 0.18 $ 0.22 $ 0.59 $ 0.63 Diluted Shares 93,298 94,044 93,604 94,143 On March 26, 2007, Perrigo completed the acquisition of nine generic prescription products and four pipeline products from Glades Pharmaceuticals, Inc. The reported results above include an acquisition-related write-off of the in-process research and development (IPR&D) of $4.8 million after-tax. Third Quarter Results Net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2007 were $362.3 million, an increase of $30 million, or nine percent, compared with $332.3 million last year. Reported net income was $17.1 million, or $0.18 per share, and included the aforementioned write-off of IPR&D and a restructuring charge of $0.2 million after-tax. Excluding these charges, adjusted net income was $22.1 million, or $0.24 per share. In the third quarter last year, net income was $20.9 million, or $0.22 per share. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures is shown in Table II at the end of this press release. Commenting on the third quarter, Joseph C. Papa, Perrigo's President and Chief Executive Officer said, "Our strong revenue growth this quarter was driven largely by improved volume in several of our core Consumer Healthcare product categories, despite this year's mild cold and flu season. New product sales remained strong, especially in the smoking cessation category, positioning us to exceed our targeted new product sales expectations for 2007. The acquisition of generic prescription products from Glades Pharmaceuticals this quarter and the pending acquisition of Qualis, Inc. provide us additional growth prospects in the coming quarters and enhance our future product pipeline. In addition, I was pleased to note our focus on working capital and inventory in the quarter have helped drive operating cash flow of $57 million in the quarter, bringing us to $74 million year-to-date."
Nine Months Results Net sales for the nine months ended March 31, 2007 were $1,073.1 million, an increase of $61 million, or six percent compared with $1,011.8 million last year. Reported net income was $55.0 million, or $0.59 per share, which included costs for a product recall of $4.1 million after-tax, or $0.04 per share. Excluding the write-off of IPR&D of $4.8 million after-tax and restructuring charges of $0.6 million after-tax, adjusted net income was $60.5 million, or $0.65 per share. In the nine months a year ago, net income was $59.1 million, or $0.63 per share. Excluding an acquisition-related write-off of the step-up in the value of inventory acquired in the first quarter last year ($3.7 million after-tax, or $0.04 per share) and a gain on the sale of an interest in a Canadian distribution company ($2.9 million after-tax, or $0.03 per share) in the second quarter last year, net income for the nine months was $59.9 million, or $0.64 per share. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures for both years is shown in Table II at the end of this press release. The effective tax rate for the nine months year to date was 19.4%, down from 32.9% in the same period a year ago. This lower rate was a result of the higher proportion of income from non-US businesses versus last year, international tax planning and the retroactive renewal of the research and development tax credit that was part of the Tax Relief and Healthcare Act. Consumer Healthcare Perrigo's Consumer Healthcare segment net sales in the quarter were $262.3 million, up $23.7 million, or 9.9%, compared with $238.6 million last year. New products contributed $16.7 million in incremental sales primarily in the smoking cessation and nutrition categories. These results also include strong growth in the analgesics category and strong sales gains from store-brand operations in Mexico and the United Kingdom. Operating income in the quarter was $21.6 million, compared with $20.4 million a year ago. For the nine months, Consumer Healthcare sales were $780.0 million, up $44.1 million, or six percent, compared with $735.9 million last year. The sales gain was driven by new product sales of $44.4 million, and increases in Mexico and the United Kingdom, offset by a decline in cough and cold product sales in the first half of the year. Operating income was $56.1 million and includes a $6.3 million charge for a recall of certain Acetaminophen products in November 2006. In fiscal 2006, operating income was $65.2 million. On March 7, 2007, the Company announced that it will acquire store brand OTC pediculicide products for $12 million in cash. The production of these products, which compare to Rid(R) and Nix(R), will be absorbed into our facilities as of the closing date, expected to be on or around June 30, 2007. Rx Pharmaceuticals Perrigo's Rx Pharmaceuticals segment reported sales of $34.0 million, including $5.8 million of service and royalty revenue, compared with $30.2 million a year ago. Operating income was $7.4 million, compared with $4.3 million last year. For the first nine months of fiscal 2007, net sales were $93.7 million and operating income was $16.9 million with a 26% increase in research and development spending. For the same period last year, sales were $88.0 million and operating income was $13.4 million, including a charge of $2.8 million pre-tax for a product recall. As noted above, the Company completed an acquisition of products from Glades Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at the end of March for $57 million in cash plus other consideration of $2.5 million for future research and development collaborations. Glades is a subsidiary of Stiefel Laboratories, Inc., a privately-owned company specializing in the branded dermatology market. The acquisition is expected to add more than $20 million in net sales annually.
API Fiscal third quarter sales in the API segment were $30.1 million, compared with last year's $30.3 million, which included $4 million of non-product revenue. Operating income was $4.0 million, compared with $8.0 million last year. For the nine months, sales were $88.5 million, compared with $83.9 million, and operating income was $14.6 million, compared with $21.1 million last year. Spending in API research and development has increased 70% from last year. Excluding a $1.7 million write-off of the step-up in the value of inventory acquired, operating income for the nine months last year was $22.8 million. Other Perrigo's Other category, consisting of the Israel Consumer Products and Israel Pharmaceutical and Diagnostic Products segments, reported third quarter sales of $35.9 million, compared with $33.2 million a year ago. Operating income was $1.1 million, compared with $0.7 million last year. Sales for the nine months were $110.9 million, up 6.7%, compared with $104.0 million in the same period a year ago and operating income was $6.7 million, compared with $0.9 million last year. Excluding a $2.7 million write-off of the step-up in the value of inventory acquired, operating income for the nine months last year was $3.6 million. Outlook The Company continues to anticipate earnings for the full fiscal year in the range of $0.86 to $0.91 per share, excluding $0.01 per share of restructuring costs and $0.05 per share for the write-off of IPR&D. The Company also expects full-year operating cash flow between $100 to $120 million. Mr. Papa stated, "Our outlook continues to be positive as we focus on quality, service and cost efficiencies and look forward to assisting our customers in meeting the needs of consumers for more affordable healthcare, especially for over-the-counter store brand products. We remain committed to our investments in quality and continue to invest in R&D to enable our future launches of new products."
