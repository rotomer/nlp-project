Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On
August 23, 2007
, the Perrigo Company released earnings for fiscal year 2007.
The earnings release contains non-GAAP measures which are defined as a financial measure of the Companys performance that excludes or includes amounts thereby differentiating it from the most directly comparable measure presented in the financial statements that are calculated and presented in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the Company has provided a reconciliation of adjusted gross profit, operating income, net income and earnings per share within its earnings release to the most directly comparable GAAP measure for these non-GAAP measures.
The Company excludes the items listed below in the applicable fiscal year when monitoring and evaluating the on-going financial results and trends of its business due to the unusual nature of these items. While the Company believes this information is also useful for investors since excluding these items provides important insight into the Companys on-going operations, investors should not rely on these non-GAAP measures as substitutes for the comparable GAAP measures.
Items excluded from reported results:
Fiscal 2007
Fiscal 2006

ALLEGAN, Mich. - Aug. 23
, 2007
- Perrigo Company (Nasdaq: PRGO; TASE) today announced results for fiscal year 2007 and the fourth quarter ended June 30, 2007.
The reported results above include a write-off of in-process research and development of $4.8 million after-tax and a charge to cost of sales associated with a step-up of inventory of $2.7 million after-tax related to the March 26, 2007, acquisition of nine generic prescription products and four pipeline products from Glades Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
(Refer to Table II at the end of this press release for additional non-GAAP disclosure information.)
 
Perrigo President and CEO Joseph C. Papa stated, In fiscal 2007 we achieved record sales in every segment, had record earnings for our fourth quarter and announced two strategic acquisitions designed to increase our return on invested capital. This performance allowed us to significantly increase our research and development investment by funding an incremental $14 million versus last year. It was another strong new product year with $77 million in new product sales, led by smoking cessation. On top of that, we also introduced $59 million of newly reformulated products to the market, all the while improving our customer service levels and investing in our quality systems. The Rx and API segments outperformed our expectations in highly competitive markets.
