          SECTION 1.04. . Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all terms of an accounting or financial nature shall be construed in accordance with GAAP, as in effect from time to time; that, if the Borrower notifies the Administrative Agent that the Borrower requests an amendment to any provision hereof to eliminate the effect of any change occurring after the date hereof in GAAP or in the application thereof on the operation of such provision (or if the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower that the Required Lenders request an amendment to any provision hereof for such purpose), regardless of whether any such notice is given before or after such change in GAAP or in the application thereof, then such provision shall be interpreted on the basis of GAAP as in effect and applied immediately before such change shall have become effective until such notice shall have been withdrawn or such provision amended in accordance herewith.

          SECTION 2.01. . Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, each Lender agrees to make a Term Loan in Dollars to the Borrower on the Effective Date in an aggregate principal amount equal to such Lender's Term Loan Commitment on the Effective Date. Additionally, in connection with any increase in the Term Loan Commitments under Section 2.06, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, each Lender that has so agreed to increase its Term Loan Commitment or become a Lender hereunder agrees to make a Term Loan in Dollars to the Borrower on the date determined pursuant to Section 2.06 in an aggregate principal amount equal to such Lender's increase in its Term Loan Commitment or its new Term Loan Commitment determined pursuant to Section 2.06. The sum of all Term Loans made by the Lenders is defined as the Aggregate Term Loans.
Term Loan Commitments
 
18
          SECTION 2.02. . (a) The failure of any Lender to make its Term Loans required to be made by it shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligations hereunder; that the Term Loan Commitments of the Lenders are several and no Lender shall be responsible for any other Lender's failure to make Term Loans as required hereunder.
Term Loans and Borrowings
provided
     (b) Subject to Section 2.11, each portion of the Term Loans shall be comprised of ABR Loans or Eurocurrency Loans as the Borrower may request in accordance herewith.
     (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Borrower shall not be entitled to elect, convert or continue any Borrowing if the Interest Period requested with respect thereto would end after the Maturity Date.
     (d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each Lender at its option may make any ABR Loan or Eurocurrency Loan by causing any domestic or foreign office, branch or Affiliate of such Lender (an "Applicable Lending Installation") to make such Term Loan that has been designated by such Lender to the Administrative Agent. All terms of this Agreement shall apply to any such Applicable Lending Installation of such Lender and the Term Loans and any Notes issued hereunder executed in connection herewith shall be deemed held by each Lender for the benefit of any such Applicable Lending Installation. Each Lender may, by written notice to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, designate replacement or additional Applicable Lending Installations through which Term Loans will be made by it and for whose account Term Loan payments are to be made. Each Lender will promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent of any event of which it has actual knowledge occurring after the date hereof which will entitle such Lender to compensation pursuant to Section 2.12 and will designate a different Applicable Lending Installation if such designation will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, such compensation and will not, in the judgment of such Lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender or contrary to its policies.
     SECTION 2.03. . To request the initial Term Loan Borrowing to be made on the Effective Date or any subsequent Term Loan under Section 2.06 in connection with an increase in the Aggregate Term Loan Commitments, the Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of such request by telephone (a) in the case of a Eurocurrency Borrowing, not later than 2:00 p.m., Chicago time, three Business Days before the date of the proposed Borrowing or (b) in the case of an ABR Borrowing, not later than 2:00 p.m., Chicago time, one Business Day before the date of the proposed Borrowing. Each such telephonic Borrowing Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery or telecopy to the Administrative Agent of a written Borrowing Request in a form approved by the Administrative Agent and signed by the Borrower. Each such telephonic and written Borrowing Request shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02:
Requests for Term Loan Borrowings
     (i) the aggregate amount of the requested Borrowing;
     (ii) the date of such Borrowing, which shall be a Business Day; and
     (iii) in the case of a Eurocurrency Borrowing, the initial Interest Period to be applicable thereto, which shall be a period contemplated by clause (a) of the definition of the term "Interest Period"; and
     If no election as to the Type of Term Loan Borrowing is specified, then the requested Term Loan Borrowing shall be an ABR Borrowing. If no Interest Period is specified with respect to any requested Eurocurrency Borrowing, then the Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one
 
19
month's duration. Promptly following receipt of a Borrowing Request in accordance with this Section, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of the amount of such Lender's Term Loan to be made as part of the requested Borrowing.
     SECTION 2.04. . (a) Each Lender shall make each Term Loan to be made by it hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of immediately available funds by 12:00 noon, Chicago time, to the account of the Administrative Agent most recently designated by it for such purpose by notice to the Lenders. The Administrative Agent will make such Term Loans available to the Borrower by promptly crediting the amounts so received, in like funds, to an account of the Borrower maintained with the Administrative Agent in such location determined by the Administrative Agent.
Funding of Borrowings
     (b) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand (without duplication) such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation (in the case of a Borrowing denominated in Dollars) or (ii) in the case of the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to ABR Loans. If such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lender's Term Loan included in such Borrowing.
     SECTION 2.05. . (a) Each Borrowing initially shall be of the Type specified in the applicable Borrowing Request and, in the case of a Eurocurrency Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period as specified in such Borrowing Request. Thereafter, the Borrower may elect to convert such Borrowing to a different Type or to continue such Borrowing and, in the case of a Eurocurrency Borrowing, may elect Interest Periods therefor, all as provided in this Section. The Borrower may elect different options with respect to different portions of the affected Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the Term Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the Term Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing. Each portion of the Term Loan elected at any time to be of the same Type shall be in an aggregate amount that is an integral multiple of the applicable $1,000,000 and not less than $3,000,000. Borrowings of more than one Type may be outstanding at the same time; provided that there shall not at any time be more than a total of ten Eurocurrency Borrowings outstanding.
Interest Elections
     (b) To make an election pursuant to this Section, the Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of such election by telephone by the time that a Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 if the Borrower were requesting a Borrowing of the Type resulting from such election to be made on the effective date of such election. Each such telephonic Interest Election Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery or telecopy to the Administrative Agent of a written Interest Election Request in a form approved by the Administrative Agent and signed by the Borrower.
     (c) Each telephonic and written Interest Election Request shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02:
 
20
(i) the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request applies and, if different options are being elected with respect to different portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting Borrowing (in which case the information to be specified pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) below shall be specified for each resulting Borrowing);
(ii) the effective date of the election made pursuant to such Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;
(iii) whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a Eurocurrency Borrowing; and
(iv) if the resulting Borrowing is a Eurocurrency Borrowing, the Interest Period to be applicable thereto after giving effect to such election, which shall be a period contemplated by clause (a) of the definition of the term "Interest Period".
If any such Interest Election Request requests a Eurocurrency Borrowing but does not specify an Interest Period, then the Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month's duration.
     (d) Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender to which such Interest Election Request relates of the details thereof and of such Lender's portion of each resulting Borrowing.
     (e) If the Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest Election Request with respect to a Eurocurrency Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period such Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing. Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the written request (including a request through electronic means) of the Required Lenders, so notifies the Borrower, then, so long as an Event of Default is continuing (i) no outstanding Borrowing may be converted to or continued as a Eurocurrency Borrowing, and (ii) unless repaid, each Eurocurrency Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto.
          SECTION 2.06. (a) Unless previously terminated, the Term Loan Commitments in effect on the Effective Date shall terminate at 5:00 p.m., Chicago time, on the Effective Date.
Termination and Increases of Term Loan Commitments.
          (b) Subject to the conditions set forth below, the Borrower may, upon at least ten (10) days (or such other period of time agreed to between the Administrative Agent and the Borrower) prior written notice to the Administrative Agent, increase the Aggregate Term Loan Commitments from time to time, either by designating a lender not theretofore a Lender to become a Lender (such designation to be effective only with the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent which shall not be unreasonably withheld) or by agreeing with an existing Lender that such Lender's Term Loan Commitment shall be increased (thus increasing the Aggregate Term Loan Commitments); that:
provided
     (i) no Default shall have occurred and be continuing hereunder as of the effective date of such increase;
     (ii) the representations and warranties made by the Borrower and contained in Article III shall be true and correct on and as of the effective date with the same effect as if made on and as of such date (other than those representations and warranties that by their terms speak as of a particular date, which representations and warranties shall be true and correct as of such particular date);
 
21
     (iii) the amount of such increase in the Aggregate Term Loan Commitments shall not be less than $10,000,000, and shall not cause the Aggregate Term Loan Commitments to exceed $200,000,000;
     (iv) The Borrower and the Lender or lender not theretofore a Lender, shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent, a Lender Addition and Acknowledgement Agreement, in form and substance satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and acknowledged by the Administrative Agent and the Borrower;
     (v) no existing Lender shall be obligated in any way to increase its Term Loan Commitment; and
     (vi) the Administrative Agent shall consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) to such increase and the Borrower shall have complied with such other conditions in connection with such increase as may be required by the Administrative Agent.
     (c) Upon the execution, delivery, acceptance and recording of the Lender Addition and Acknowledgement Agreement, from and after the effective date specified in a Lender Addition and Acknowledgement Agreement, such existing Lender shall have a Term Loan Commitment as therein set forth or such other Lender shall become a Lender with a Term Loan Commitment as therein set forth and all the rights and obligations of a Lender with such a Term Loan Commitment hereunder. Any such new Term Loan Commitments shall terminate at 5:00 p.m., Chicago time, on the date any such additional Term Loan is designated to be made thereunder.
     (d) Upon its receipt of a Lender Addition and Acknowledgement Agreement together with any note or notes, if requested, subject to such addition and assumption and the written consent to such addition and assumption, the Administrative Agent shall, if such Lender Addition and Acknowledgement Agreement has been completed and the other conditions described in this Section 2.06 have been satisfied:
     (i) accept such Lender Addition and Acknowledgement Agreement;
     (ii) record the information contained therein in the Register; and
     (iii) give prompt notice thereof to the Lenders and the Borrower and deliver to the Lenders a schedule reflecting the new Term Loan Commitments.
          SECTION 2.07. (a) The Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Term Loan on the Maturity Date.
Repayment of Term Loans; Evidence of Debt.
     (b) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Term Loan made by such Lender, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder.
     (c) The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it shall record (i) the amount of each Term Loan made hereunder, the Type thereof and the Interest Period (if any) applicable thereto, (ii)
 
22
the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to each Lender hereunder and (iii) any amount received by the Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of the Lenders and each Lender's share thereof.
     (d) The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of this Section shall be prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein; provided that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay the Term Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
     (e) Any Lender may request that Term Loans made by it be evidenced by a promissory note. In such event, the Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note payable to the order of such Lender (or, if requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its registered assigns) and in the form of Exhibit C hereto or such other form approved by the Administrative Agent. Thereafter, the Term Loans evidenced by such promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after assignment pursuant to Section 9.04) be represented by one or more promissory notes in such form payable to the order of the payee named therein (or, if such promissory note is a registered note, to such payee and its registered assigns).
          SECTION 2.08. (a) The Borrower shall have the right at any time and from time to time to prepay any Borrowing in whole or in part, subject to prior notice in accordance with paragraph (b) of this Section.
Prepayment of Term Loans.
     (b) The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent by telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of any prepayment hereunder (i) in the case of prepayment of a Eurocurrency Borrowing, not later than 2:00 p.m., Chicago time, three Business Days before the date of prepayment, and (ii) in the case of prepayment of an ABR Borrowing, not later than 2:00 p.m., Chicago time, one Business Day before the date of prepayment. Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the prepayment date and the principal amount of each Borrowing or portion thereof to be prepaid. Promptly following receipt of any such notice relating to a Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each partial prepayment of any Borrowing shall be in an amount that would be permitted in the case of an advance of a Borrowing of the same Type as provided in Section 2.05. Each prepayment of a Borrowing shall be applied ratably to the Term Loans included in the prepaid Borrowing. Prepayments shall be accompanied by accrued interest to the extent required by Section 2.10.
          SECTION 2.09. . The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for its own account fees payable in the amounts and at the times separately agreed upon between the Borrower and the Administrative Agent. Fees paid shall not be refundable under any circumstances.

          SECTION 2.10. (a) The portion of the Term Loans comprising each ABR Borrowing shall bear interest at the Alternate Base Rate.
Interest.
          (b) The portion of the Term Loans comprising each Eurocurrency Borrowing shall bear interest at the Adjusted LIBO Rate for the Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing plus the Applicable Rate.
          (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any principal of or interest on any Term Loan or any fee or other amount payable by the Borrower hereunder is not paid when due (after the expiration of any applicable grace or cure period), whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise, such overdue amount shall bear interest, after as well as before judgment, at a rate per annum equal to (i) in the case of overdue principal of any Term Loan, 2% plus the rate otherwise applicable to such Term Loan as provided in the preceding paragraphs of this Section or (ii) in the case of any other amount, 2% plus the rate applicable to ABR Loans as provided in paragraph (a) of this Section.
 
23
          (d) Accrued interest on each Term Loan shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date for such Term Loan; that (i) interest accrued pursuant to paragraph (c) of this Section shall be payable on demand, (ii) in the event of any repayment or prepayment of any Term Loan, accrued interest on the principal amount repaid or prepaid shall be payable on the date of such repayment or prepayment and (iii) in the event of any conversion of any Eurocurrency Loan prior to the end of the current Interest Period therefor, accrued interest on such Term Loan shall be payable on the effective date of such conversion.
provided
          (e) All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days, except that interest computed by reference to the Alternate Base Rate at times when the Alternate Base Rate is based on the Prime Rate shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year), and in each case shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). The applicable Alternate Base Rate, Adjusted LIBO Rate or LIBO Rate shall be determined by the Administrative Agent, and such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
          SECTION 2.11. . If prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a Eurocurrency Borrowing:
Alternate Rate of Interest
     (a) the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the LIBO Rate, as applicable, for such Interest Period; or
     (b) the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders that the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the LIBO Rate, as applicable, for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining their Term Loans included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period;
then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Borrower and the Lenders by telephone or telecopy as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of any Borrowing to, or continuation of any Borrowing as, a Eurocurrency Borrowing shall be ineffective and such Borrowing shall be converted to or continued as on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto an ABR Borrowing, and (ii) if any Borrowing Request or Interest Election Request requests a Eurocurrency Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be made as an ABR Borrowing.
          SECTION 2.12. (a) If any Change in Law shall:
Increased Costs.
     (i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender (except any such reserve requirement reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate); or
     (ii) impose on any Lender or the London interbank market any other condition affecting this Agreement or any Term Loan made by such Lender;
and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining any Eurocurrency Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Term Loan) or to
 
24
reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then the Borrower will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.
          (b) If any Lender determines that any Change in Law regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's capital or on the capital of such Lender's holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Term Loans made by such Lender to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender's holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's policies and the policies of such Lender's holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lender's holding company for any such reduction suffered.
          (c) A certificate of a Lender setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.
          (d) Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's right to demand such compensation; that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than 270 days prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender's intention to claim compensation therefor; that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 270-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.

          SECTION 2.13. In the event of (a) the payment of any principal of any Eurocurrency Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of Default), (b) the conversion of any Eurocurrency Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (c) the failure to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any Eurocurrency Loan on the date specified in any notice delivered pursuant hereto (regardless of whether such notice may be revoked under Section 2.08(b) and is revoked in accordance therewith), or (d) the assignment of any Eurocurrency Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.16, then, in any such event, the Borrower shall compensate each Lender for the loss, cost and expense attributable to such event. In the case of a Eurocurrency Loan, such loss, cost or expense to any Lender shall be deemed to include an amount determined by such Lender to be the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest which would have accrued on the principal amount of such Eurocurrency Loan had such event not occurred, at the Adjusted LIBO Rate that would have been applicable to such Eurocurrency Loan, for the period from the date of such event to the last day of the then current Interest Period therefor (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, for the period that would have been the Interest Period for such Eurocurrency Loan), over (ii) the amount of interest which would accrue on such principal amount for such period at the interest rate which such Lender would bid were it to bid, at the commencement of such period, for Dollar deposits of a comparable amount and period from other banks in the eurodollar market. A certificate of any Lender setting forth any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.
Break Funding Payments.
 
25
          SECTION 2.14. (a) Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower hereunder shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes; that if the Borrower shall be required to deduct any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes from such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the Administrative Agent or Lender receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Borrower shall make such deductions and (iii) the Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
Taxes.
provided
          (b) In addition, the Borrower shall pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
          (c) The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Lender, within 10 days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes paid by the Administrative Agent or such Lender on or with respect to any payment by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower hereunder (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender, or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
          (d) As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by the Borrower to a Governmental Authority, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
          (e) Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which the Borrower is located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments under this Agreement shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate.
          (f) If the Administrative Agent or a Lender determines, in its sole discretion, that it has received a refund of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrower or with respect to which the Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.14, it shall pay over such refund to the Borrower (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Borrower under this Section 2.14 with respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent or such Lender and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund); provided, that the Borrower, upon the request of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent or such Lender in the event the Administrative Agent or such Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. This Section shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes which it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person.
 
26
          SECTION 2.15. . (a) Unless otherwise specified, the Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder (whether of principal, interest, fees or of amounts payable under Section 2.12, 2.13 or 2.14, or otherwise) prior to 1:00 p.m., Chicago time, on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without set-off or counterclaim. Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent to the applicable account designated to the Borrower by the Agent, except that payments pursuant to Sections 2.12, 2.13, 2.14 and 9.05 shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto. The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. All payments hereunder shall be made in Dollars. Any payment required to be made by the Administrative Agent hereunder shall be deemed to have been made by the time required if the Administrative Agent shall, at or before such time, have taken the necessary steps to make such payment in accordance with the regulations or operating procedures of the clearing or settlement system used by the Administrative Agent to make such payment.
Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Set-offs
     (b) If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent from the Borrower to pay fully all amounts of principal, interest and fees then due from the Borrower hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, towards payment of interest and fees then due from the Borrower hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, towards payment of principal then due from the Borrower hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal then due to such parties.
     (c) If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on its Term Loans resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Term Loans and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Term Loans of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on its Term Loans; provided that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph (c) shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Term Loans to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph (c) shall apply). The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.
     (d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such
 
27
payment, then each of the Lenders severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation (in the case of an amount denominated in Dollars).
     (e) If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.04(b), 2.15(d) or 9.03(c), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender's obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.
          SECTION 2.16. (a) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.12, or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.14, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Term Loan hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.12 or 2.14, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.
Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.
          (b) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.12, or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.14, or if any Lender defaults in its obligation to fund its Term Loan hereunder, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 9.04), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); that (i) the Borrower shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Term Loan, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts) and (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.12 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.14, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments. A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.
provided
          SECTION 2.17. . (a) To guarantee or secure, as the case may be, the payment when due of the Secured Obligations, the Borrower shall cause each of the following to execute and deliver Guaranties to the Administrative Agent: (i) all Domestic Subsidiaries of the Borrower will Guarantee all Secured Obligations; and (ii) if it will not result in a material tax consequence (as reasonably agreed upon by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent), all Foreign Subsidiaries will Guarantee all Secured Obligations to the extent they are legally permitted to do so. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Securitization Entities shall not be required to be Guarantors.
Guaranties; Collateral
 
28
     (b) If any Foreign Subsidiaries could not execute a Guaranty for all Secured Obligations because that Guaranty would result in a material adverse tax consequence (as reasonably agreed upon by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent), then the Administrative Agent reserves the right (i) to require that 65% (or such greater amount that may be pledged without a material adverse tax consequence) of the Equity Interests of such Foreign Subsidiaries that are owned directly by the Borrower or a Domestic Subsidiary be pledged pursuant to Collateral Documents satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and (ii) to require that 65% (or such greater amount that may be pledged without a material adverse tax consequence, as reasonably agreed upon by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent) of the Equity Interests of any other such Foreign Subsidiary be pledged pursuant to Collateral Documents satisfactory to the Administrative Agent to the extent such pledge is legally permitted and such pledge will not result in a material tax consequence (as reasonably agreed upon by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent).
     (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Borrower shall not be obligated to cause certain Subsidiaries to deliver the Guaranties required under Section 2.17(a) above or cause the pledge of the Equity Interests of certain Foreign Subsidiaries required under Section 2.17(b) to the extent that all such Subsidiaries that have not delivered the Guaranties required under Section 2.17(a) above and all such Foreign Subsidiaries that are required to have their Equity Interests pledged under Section 2.17(b) have not had 65% or more of their Equity Interests pledged under Section 2.17(b) would not constitute a Significant Subsidiary if considered as one Subsidiary. In making such determination under this Section 2.17(c), the assets or income of any Subsidiary shall be determined using the consolidated assets and income of such Subsidiary and its subsidiaries.
     (d) The Borrower agrees that it will promptly notify the Administrative Agent if any additional Guaranties or pledges of the Equity Interests of Foreign Subsidiaries are required at any time by the terms of Sections 2.17(a), (b) and (c) above (whether due to the formation or acquisition of any Subsidiary, any increase in the assets or income of any Subsidiary or due to any other reason that would require additional Guaranties or pledges of the Equity Interests of Foreign Subsidiaries under the terms of Sections 2.17(a), (b) and (c) above). The Borrower agrees that it will and will promptly cause each such Subsidiary to execute and deliver, promptly following the date that such Subsidiary becomes subject to the requirements of this clause (d), such additional Guaranties or Collateral Documents and other agreements, documents and instruments, each in form and substance satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, sufficient to grant to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent, the Guaranties and Liens required by this Agreement and the Collateral Documents. The Borrower shall deliver, and cause each such Subsidiary to deliver, to the Administrative Agent all such certificates, legal opinions, share certificates and stock powers, lien searches, organizational and other charter documents, resolutions and other documents and agreements as the Administrative Agent may request in connection therewith.
          In order to induce the Lenders and the Administrative Agent to enter into this Agreement, the Borrower represents and warrants to each Lender and the Administrative Agent, that the following statements are true, correct and complete:
          SECTION 3.01.

          SECTION 3.06. (a) There are no actions, suits or proceedings by or before any arbitrator or Governmental Authority pending against or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened against or affecting the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries (i) as to which

The excess of the present value of all benefit liabilities under each Plan of the Borrower, the Subsidiaries and the ERISA Affiliates (based on those assumptions used to fund such Plan), as of the last annual valuation date applicable thereto for which a valuation is available, over the value of the assets of such Plan could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, and the excess of the present value of all benefit liabilities of all underfunded Plans (based on those assumptions used to fund each such Plan) as of the last annual valuation dates applicable thereto for which valuations are available, over the value of the assets of all such underfunded Plans could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

          SECTION 3.11. The Borrower has disclosed to the Lenders all agreements, instruments and corporate or other restrictions known to the Borrower to which it or any of its Subsidiaries is subject, and all other matters known to it, that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Information Memorandum nor any of the other reports, financial statements, certificates or other information furnished by or on behalf of the Borrower to the Administrative Agent or any Lender in connection with the negotiation of this Agreement or delivered hereunder (as modified or supplemented by other information so furnished) contains any material misstatement of fact or omits to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading in any material respect; that, with respect to projected financial information, the Borrower represents only that such information was prepared in good faith based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable at the time.

After applying the proceeds of each Term Loan, Margin Stock will not constitute more than 25% of the value of the assets (either of the Borrower alone or of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis) that are subject to any provisions of this Agreement that may cause the Term Loans to be deemed secured, directly or indirectly, by Margin Stock.

32
     (b) The Administrative Agent shall have received the favorable written opinion (addressed to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders and dated the Effective Date) of counsel for the Borrower and the Guarantors substantially in the form of Exhibit D and covering such other matters relating to the Borrower and the Guarantors, this Agreement or the Transactions as the Required Lenders shall reasonably request and the favorable written opinion (addressed to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders and dated the Effective Date) of such foreign counsel or counsels for the Borrower and the Guarantors with respect to such matters relating to the Collateral Documents as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request, provided that such opinions of foreign counsel may be delivered within such reasonable time after the Effective Date as agreed to by the Administrative Agent. The Borrower hereby requests such counsels to deliver such opinions.
     (c) The Administrative Agent shall have received such documents and certificates as the Administrative Agent or its counsel may reasonably request relating to the organization, existence and good standing of the Loan Parties, the authorization of the Transactions and any other legal matters relating to the Loan Parties, the Loan Documents or the Transactions, all in form and substance satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and its counsel.

     (h) The Loan Parties shall have delivered such other documents as the Administrative Agent, any Lender or their respective counsel may have reasonably requested.
The Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders of the Effective Date, and such notice shall be conclusive and binding. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the obligations of the Lenders to make Term Loans hereunder shall not become effective unless each of the foregoing conditions is satisfied (or waived pursuant to Section 9.02) at or prior to 3:00 p.m., Chicago time, on April 22, 2008 (and, in the event such conditions are not so satisfied or waived, the Term Loan Commitments shall terminate at such time).
 
33
          Until the Term Loan Commitments have expired or been terminated and the principal of and interest on each Term Loan and all fees payable hereunder shall have been paid in full, the Borrower covenants and agrees with the Lenders that:

     (d) any other development that results in, or could reasonably be expected to result in, a Material Adverse Effect.
Each notice delivered under this Section shall be accompanied by a statement of a Financial Officer or other executive officer of the Borrower setting forth the details of the event or development requiring such notice and any action taken or proposed to be taken with respect thereto.

If at any time the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries shall enter into or be a party to any instrument or agreement, including all such instruments or agreements in existence as of the date hereof and all such instruments or agreements entered into after the date hereof, relating to or amending any provisions applicable to any of its Indebtedness which in the aggregate, together with any related Indebtedness, exceeds $20,000,000, which includes covenants or defaults not substantially provided for in this Agreement or more favorable to the lender or lenders thereunder than those provided for in this Agreement, then the Borrower shall promptly so advise the Administrative Agent and the Lenders.

Exhibit D
[Effective Date]                     
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent, and the Lenders party to the Term Loan Agreement referred to below
Ladies and Gentlemen:
     We have acted as counsel for Perrigo Company, a Michigan corporation (the "Borrower") and the Domestic Subsidiaries that are Guarantors in connection with the Term Loan Agreement dated as of the date hereof (the "Term Loan Agreement") among the Borrower, the Lenders party thereto, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent. This opinion is being rendered to you at the request of the Borrower pursuant to Section 4.01(b) of the Term Loan Agreement.
     For purposes of this opinion, we have examined an executed copy of the Term Loan Agreement and the Guaranty dated as of the date hereof executed by the Guarantors (together with the Term Loan Agreement, the "Credit Documents"). We have also examined such other documents and instruments concerning the Borrower and the Domestic Subsidiaries that are Guarantors (collectively, the "Obligors") and have made such further investigation as we have deemed necessary or appropriate in connection with this opinion. The law covered by the opinions expressed herein is limited to the federal law of the United States and the law of the state of Michigan.
     In forming the basis for our opinion as follows, we have assumed the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals and the conformity to originals of all documents submitted to us as copies. In rendering the opinions expressed in paragraph 2 below, we have further assumed that the Credit Documents constitute the respective legal, valid and binding obligations of all parties thereto other than the Obligors. We have relied, to the extent that we have deemed such reliance proper, upon factual representations made by the Obligors in the Credit Documents with respect to the accuracy of factual matters contained therein with respect to it and its Subsidiaries, which we have not independently established. Except as otherwise indicated in this opinion, capitalized terms are defined or used as set forth in the Term Loan Agreement. As used herein, the phrase "to the best of our knowledge" means inquiry of an executive officer of the Obligors and the actual knowledge of attorneys in our firm primarily responsible for the provision of legal services to the Obligors.
     Based upon and subject to the foregoing, we are of the opinion, as of the date hereof, that:
     1. Each Obligor (a) is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the state of Michigan, (b) has all requisite power and authority to carry on its business as now conducted, and (c) except where the failure to do so, individually or in the aggregate, could not
 
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, is qualified to do business in, and is in good standing in, every jurisdiction where such qualification is required.
     2. The Credit Documents (a) have been duly authorized by proper corporate action on the part of each Obligor, (b) have been duly executed and delivered by each Obligor, and (c) constitute the valid and binding obligations of each Obligor, enforceable against each Obligor in accordance with their respective terms, except as the enforceability thereof may be limited by (i) applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws relating to or affecting the rights of creditors generally, (ii) general principles of equity, and (iii) limitations imposed by applicable law on the enforceability of purported waivers of rights and defenses.
     3. The execution, delivery, and performance by each Obligor of the Credit Documents to which it is a party and compliance with the terms and provisions thereof do not and will not (a) violate any provision of the articles of incorporation or bylaws of each Obligor, (b) violate any applicable law, rule, or regulation, (c) to the best of our knowledge, violate any order, writ, injunction, or decree of any Michigan or federal Governmental Authority or arbitral award applicable to each Obligor, or (d) to the best of our knowledge, result in a breach of, constitute a default under, require any consent under, or result in the acceleration or require prepayment of any indebtedness pursuant to the terms of any agreement or instrument to which each Obligor is a party or by which it is bound, or result in the creation or imposition of any Lien or other encumbrance upon any property of each Obligor pursuant to the terms of any such agreement or instrument.
     4. To the best of our knowledge and except for the Disclosed Matters, there is no action, suit, or proceeding pending against or overtly threatened against or affecting, the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries before any arbitrator or Governmental Authority in which an adverse decision could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect or which in any manner draws into question the validity or enforceability of the Credit Documents.
     5. No authorization, consent, or approval of, or filing or registration with, any Michigan or federal Governmental Authority is required for the execution, delivery, or performance by each Obligor of the Credit Documents or for the validity or enforceability thereof against each Obligor.
     6. Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is (a) an "investment company" as defined in, or subject to regulation under, the Investment Company Act of 1940 or (b) a "holding" company" as defined in, or subject to regulation under, the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935.
     7. Assuming that the Borrower will comply with the provisions of the Term Loan Agreement relating to the use of proceeds, the making of Term Loans under the Term Loan Agreement will not violate the Regulations of the Board, including Regulations U and X.
     8. The provisions of the Collateral Documents are sufficient to create in favor of the Administrative Agent a valid security interest in all right, title and interest of Perrigo International, Inc. in the collateral described in the Collateral Documents to the extent a security interest may be created in such items and types of collateral under Article 9 of the UCC as in effect on the date hereof. Upon the due filing of the Uniform Commercial Code financing statements attached hereto as with the Secretary of State of the State of Michigan, the Administrative Agent will have a perfected security interest in all right, title and interest of Perrigo International, Inc. in those items and types of collateral described in the Collateral Documents in which a security interest may be perfected by the due filing of a financing statement in the State of Michigan under the UCC. Based on the assumption that the Administrative Agent has taken delivery and is retaining possession in Michigan of the stock certificates evidencing the Equity Interests described on (the "Pledged Stock"), together with the properly
Exhibit A
Exhibit B
 
executed stock powers described on , and that the Administrative Agent has taken delivery of such Pledged Stock and stock powers and its security interest in good faith without notice of any adverse claim within the meaning of the UCC, there has been created under the Security Agreement, and there has been granted to the Administrative Agent, a valid and perfected security interest in the Pledged Stock, free of any adverse claims as defined in the UCC.
Exhibit C
     Any permitted assignee of any Lender may also rely on this opinion; provided, however, that nothing herein shall be construed as requiring us to update or supplement this opinion.
