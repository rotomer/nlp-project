Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On
May 6, 2008
, the Perrigo Company released earnings for the third quarter and fiscal year 2008.
The earnings release contains non-GAAP measures which are defined as a financial measure of the Companys performance that excludes or includes amounts thereby differentiating it from the most directly comparable measure presented in the financial statements that are calculated and presented in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the Company has provided a reconciliation for gross profit, operating income, net income and earnings per share within its earnings release to the most directly comparable GAAP measure for these non-GAAP measures.
The Company excludes the items listed below in the applicable fiscal year when monitoring and evaluating the on-going financial results and trends of its business due to the unusual nature of these items. The Company believes that presenting operating results excluding these items is also useful for investors since it provides important insight into the Company's on-going core business operations on a normalized basis.
Items excluded from reported results:
Fiscal 2008
- A charge to cost of sales associated with the step-up in value of inventory acquired
- A restructuring charge for organizational improvements
- A write-off of in-process research and development
Fiscal 2007
- A restructuring charge for organizational improvements
- A write-off of in-process research and development
The press release related to Perrigos earnings is attached as Exhibit 99.1.
