ITEM 4.01.
Changes in Registrant's Certifying Accountant
On May 20, 2008, the Audit Committee (the "Audit Committee") of the Board of Directors of Perrigo Company (the "Company"), as part of its annual review process, selected Ernst & Young ("Ernst & Young"), to serve as its independent registered public accounting firm for the 2009 fiscal year ending June 27, 2009.
The Audit Committee has determined that BDO Seidman, LLP ("BDO") will not be reappointed as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. Accordingly, effective upon the completion of its engagement for the Company's current fiscal year ending June 28, 2008, BDO will cease to be the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. With respect to BDO and its service as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2007 and July 1, 2006, as well as the subsequent period preceding the Audit Committee's decision not to reappoint BDO:
The Company provided BDO with a copy of these disclosures and asked BDO to provide it with a letter addressed to the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") stating whether BDO agrees with the Company's statements and, if not, stating the respects in which it does not agree. A copy of BDO's letter to the Commission is attached as Exhibit 16.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2007 and July 1, 2006 and the subsequent period prior to engaging Ernst & Young, the Company did not consult with Ernst & Young regarding the application of accounting principals to a specified transaction,
 
either completed or proposed, or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the Company's consolidated financial statements, or any other matters or reportable events described in Items 304(a)(2)(i) and (ii) of Regulation S-K.
