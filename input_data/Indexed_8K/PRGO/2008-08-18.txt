Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On
August 18, 2008
, the Perrigo Company released earnings for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2008.
The earnings release contains non-GAAP measures which are defined as a financial measure of the Companys performance that excludes or includes amounts thereby differentiating it from the most directly comparable measure presented in the financial statements that are calculated and presented in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).
