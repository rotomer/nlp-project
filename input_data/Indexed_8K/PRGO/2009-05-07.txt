Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On May 7, 2009, Perrigo Company (Company) released earnings for the third quarter and fiscal year 2009.
The earnings release contains non-GAAP measures which are defined as a financial measure of the Companys performance that excludes or includes amounts thereby differentiating it from the most directly comparable measure presented in the financial statements that are calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).  Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the Company has provided a reconciliation for gross profit, operating expenses, operating income, income from continuing operations and earnings per share from continuing operations within its earnings release to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure for these non-GAAP measures.
The Company excludes the items listed below in the applicable period when monitoring and evaluating the on-going financial results and trends of its business due to the unusual nature of these items.  The Company believes that presenting operating results and guidance excluding these items is also useful for investors since it provides important insight into the Company's on-going core business operations on a normalized basis.

(Refer to Table II at the end of this press release for additional adjustments in the current year period and additional non-GAAP disclosure information.)
As part of managements strategic review of its portfolio of businesses, in March 2009, the Company committed to a plan to sell its Israel Consumer Products business. The results of this business are reflected in the condensed consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations for all periods presented. The Company has engaged the investment banking firms of William Blair and Poalim Capital Markets to assist in this sale process, which is expected to be completed within one year.
Perrigos Chairman and CEO Joseph C. Papa stated, I am very pleased with our record third quarter sales and earnings. In this quarter, the over-the-counter category fell 3% versus third quarter last year and the national brand category fell more than 7%, while Perrigo Consumer Healthcare grew 12%. We were able to achieve this growth rate despite the fact that we are comparing the results to the launches of Omeprazole and Cetirizine at this time last year. More consumers than ever are realizing the value that store brands have to offer.
Nine Months Results
Net sales from continuing operations for the first nine months of fiscal 2009 were $1,498.7 million, an increase of 19% over fiscal 2008. The increase was driven by the Consumer Healthcare segment and included $203.7 million of consolidated new product sales.  Reported gross profit of $432.1 million was an increase of 13% over fiscal 2008, driven by the Consumer Healthcare segment. The year-to-date reported gross profit percentage in fiscal 2009 was 28.8%, down from 30.5% last year. Reported operating expenses were $240.4 million, an increase of 5% over fiscal 2008. However, as a percentage of net sales, operating expenses were 16.0%, down from 18.2% in fiscal 2008. Reported income from continuing operations was $108.8 million, relatively flat over fiscal 2008.
Consumer Healthcare
           Consumer Healthcare segment net sales in the third quarter were $419.1 million compared with $373.0 million in the third quarter last year, an increase of $46.1 million or 12%. The increase resulted from approximately $39.2 million of sales from the acquisitions of JB Labs, Unico, Diba and Brunel, and $31.4 million from sales of new and existing products in the gastrointestinal, cough/cold, smoking cessation and nutrition categories. These increases were partially offset by the impact of unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $12.4 million and the absence of the U.K.s Vitamins, Minerals, and Supplements (VMS) businesss sales of $9.8 million.
Reported operating income was $62.3 million, compared with $51.7 million a year ago, largely driven by a favorable mix of products sold both domestically and internationally, gross margins from sales by Unico and the absence of a $2.9 million charge to cost of sales related to the step-up in value of inventory acquired in the Galpharm acquisition that was recognized in fiscal 2008. Adjusted operating income was $63.0 million, an increase of 15% compared to a year ago.

For the first nine months of fiscal year 2009, Consumer Healthcare net sales increased 28% or $270.3 million compared to fiscal 2008.  The increase resulted primarily from sales of new and existing products of approximately $212.7 million, primarily in the gastrointestinal, cough/cold, nutrition, smoking cessation and analgesic categories. The increase was also driven by $109.8 million of sales from JB Labs, Unico, Galpharm, Brunel and Diba. These combined increases were partially offset by the absence of the U.K.s VMS businesss sales of $25.7 million and the impact of unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $22.4 million.
On February 20, 2009, the Company announced that it began shipping over-the-counter (OTC) Ibuprofen and Diphenhydramine Citrate Tablets, 200/38 mg (Ibuprofen PM). The product is being marketed under store brand labels and is comparable to Wyeth Consumer Healthcares Advil PM tablets, 200/38 mg, indicated as a pain reliever (NSAID)/nighttime sleep-aid. Estimated brand sales for the product for the 12 months ended December 21, 2008 were $71 million.
Rx Pharmaceutical
s
The Rx Pharmaceutical segment third quarter net sales were $41.7 million compared with $49.2 million a year ago. The decrease was due primarily to the absence of the fiscal 2008 receipt of a one-time cash payment of $8.5 million from a customer in lieu of expected future minimum royalty payments, as agreed upon in a license termination agreement. Net sales were also negatively impacted by a $2.2 million reduction in non-product revenue, as well as continued pricing pressures on certain existing products in the portfolio. These decreases were partially offset by $5.1 million of increased sales volumes on other products in the portfolio.
For the first nine months of fiscal year 2009, net sales for the Rx Pharmaceutical segment decreased 6% compared to fiscal 2008. The decrease was due primarily to the aforementioned one-time cash payment of $8.5 million. The decrease in net sales was also due to an $8.2 million reduction in non-product revenue, as well as pricing pressures due to continued competition in the marketplace for generic drugs. These decreases were partially offset by new product sales of approximately $11.0 million, along with an increase in sales volumes on the Companys existing portfolio of products of approximately $7.0 million.
On March 17, 2009, the Company announced that its partner Cobrek Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Cobrek) had filed an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) for Clindamycin Phosphate Foam 1%, a generic version of Evoclin Foam 1%. The Company believes that Cobrek is the first to file an ANDA with a Paragraph IV certification against Evoclin. 
Evoclin (clindamycin phosphate) Foam 1% is a topical antibiotic indicated for topical application in the treatment of acne vulgaris, and had sales of approximately $44 million for the 12 months ended January 2009, as measured by Wolters Kluwer Health.

API
 
The API segment reported third quarter net sales of $31.0 million compared with $37.8 million a year ago. The decrease was due primarily to the absence of a one-time $4.9 million accrual reversal related to a long standing customer contract negotiation recognized in fiscal 2008, along with approximately $2.0 million resulting from unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Operating income was $4.3 million, compared with $6.0 million last year, reflecting the aforementioned accrual reversal, as well as unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate changes, partially offset by favorable contributions from new products, pricing improvements and lower operating expenses.
For the first nine months of fiscal year 2009, net sales decreased 13% compared to fiscal 2008. This decrease was due primarily to a decline of approximately $16.7 million in sales of three key products, the absence of the one-time $4.9 million accrual reversal mentioned above and approximately $1.0 million resulting from unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These decreases were partially offset by a $5.3 million increase in the sales mix of existing products, along with new product sales of approximately $3.2 million.
Other
Continuing operations for the Other category, consisting of the Israel Pharmaceutical and Diagnostic Products operating segment, reported third quarter net sales of $14.1 million, compared with $20.6 million a year ago. Operating income was $2.7 million, up from $1.4 million last year. The increase in operating income was due primarily to operating expenses for fiscal 2009 decreasing by 30% compared to fiscal 2008. The decrease was due primarily to lower employee-related expenses and slightly favorable changes in the foreign exchange rate.
For the first nine months of fiscal 2009, net sales decreased $5.6 million or 9%, compared to fiscal 2008.  The decrease was driven primarily by a $7.6 million impact related to a change in a customer contract. In addition, sales in the diagnostic product line decreased by approximately $2.4 million. These decreases were partially offset by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, along with increased sales due to changes in the sales mix of existing products in the remaining portfolio.
Guidance
Chairman and CEO Joseph C. Papa concluded, We are now expecting adjusted fiscal 2009 earnings from continuing operations to be between $1.80 and $1.90 per share, which implies a year over year growth rate of adjusted earnings from continuing operations of 15% to 22% over fiscal 2008. This is revised from our previous guidance of $1.75 to $1.90 per share, excluding charges outlined in Table III at the end of this release. Looking ahead, we believe Perrigo is well positioned to continue to add value to its customers and shareholders.
