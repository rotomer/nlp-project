Merger Agreement
On March 22, 2010, Perrigo Company (the "Company"), PBM Holdings, Inc. ("Holdings"), PBM Nutritionals, LLC ("Nutritionals" and together with Holdings, "PBM"), Pine Holdings Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company ("Holdings Merger Sub"), Pine Nutritionals Merger Sub, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company ("Nutritionals Merger Sub" and together with Holdings Merger Sub, the "Merger Subs"), and PBM Stakeholders, LLC, as the representative of the Stakeholders (as defined below), entered into a Merger Agreement whereby (i) Holdings Merger Sub will merge with and into Holdings with Holdings surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and (ii) Nutritionals Merger Sub will merge with and into Nutritionals with Nutritionals surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (collectively, the "Mergers"). The Company will pay PBM's stockholders, option holders, stock appreciation rights holders, unitholders and unit appreciation rights holders (collectively, the "Stakeholders") an aggregate purchase price of $808 million, less proceeds used to retire certain PBM indebtedness, and subject to certain working capital and other adjustments as provided in the Merger Agreement (the "Merger Consideration"). The Company will pay the full amount of the Merger Consideration in cash, which is intended to be funded through a combination of (a) cash on hand, (b) borrowing under the Company's existing senior financing facilities, and (c) additional senior debt. In addition, in the event the Company is unable to pay the entire Merger Consideration using these three sources, the Company has obtained a commitment from JPMorgan Chase Bank ("JPMCB") to provide a bridge loan of up to $350 million, which the Company may draw upon in order to pay a portion of the Merger Consideration.
The completion of the Mergers is subject to certain conditions, including, among others, that (i) the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, has expired or been terminated, (ii) subject to certain materiality exceptions, the representations and warranties made by the Company and PBM, respectively, are true and correct and (iii) the Company and PBM are in compliance in all material respects with their respective Merger Agreement obligations.
The Merger Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants by the parties. At the closing of the Mergers (the "Effective Time"), the Company will pay $86.8 million of the Merger Consideration into two escrow accounts. The first escrow account, in the amount of $6 million, will be used to satisfy any obligation of the Stakeholders to pay post-closing adjustments to the purchase price and, if any portion of the escrow remains after satisfaction of the Stakeholder's obligations, to reimburse the Stakeholders' representative's fees and expenses. Any amounts remaining in the post-closing adjustments escrow account after reimbursing the Stakeholders' representative will be released to the Stakeholders. The second escrow account, in the amount of $80.8 million, will be the sole and exclusive remedy available to the Company if PBM's representations and warranties fail to be true and correct (subject to certain materiality exceptions) at the signing or the Effective Time, or if PBM breaches any of their covenants or agreements pursuant to the Merger Agreement (subject to certain specified exceptions). Any amounts remaining in the indemnity escrow account 18 months after the Effective Time, other than amounts set aside for claims pending at such time, will be used to reimburse the Stakeholders' representative's fees and expenses, if necessary, and then released to the Stakeholders. The Company's indemnification claims are subject to an $8.08 million deductible. Additionally, the Company will pay $10 million of the Merger Consideration into an account specified by the Stakeholders' representative to cover expenses incurred by the Stakeholders' representative in connection with its duties under the Merger Agreement.
If all of the conditions to the obligations of the Company and PBM (subject to certain specified exceptions) have been satisfied or waived, and the Company has not consummated the Mergers by May 17, 2010, or if PBM is entitled to terminate the Merger Agreement due to a breach by the Company of its representations, warranties or covenants that results in a condition to the obligation of PBM to consummate the Mergers not being satisfied, then the Merger Agreement may be terminated by PBM. If PBM terminates the Merger Agreement as described in the preceding sentence, the Company would be required to pay PBM a termination fee of $32 million, plus the reasonable expenses of PBM not to exceed $3 million.
 
Employment Offer Letter
On March 22, 2010, concurrent with the execution of the Merger Agreement, Paul B. Manning, the President and CEO of Holdings and Nutritionals, accepted an employment offer letter by the Company (the "Employment Offer Letter"), the effectiveness of which is contingent upon the consummation of the Mergers.

If the applicable Indemnifying Parties notify the Indemnified Party in writing that they do not dispute the claim described in such Claim Notice or fail to notify the Indemnified Party in writing within thirty (30) days following receipt of the Claim Notice that they dispute the Claim described in such Claim Notice, the Losses identified in the Claim Notice will be conclusively deemed a liability of the Indemnifying Party under Sections 8.1(a) or (b), as applicable, and, in the case of a Claim Notice delivered by the Parent Indemnified Parties, the Parent shall be entitled to instruct the Escrow Agent to release to the Parent Indemnified Parties the amount of such Losses pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

4.
Remedies.
(a) The parties to this Agreement recognize that irreparable harm would result from any breach by Employee of any restrictive covenant contained in this Agreement and that monetary damages alone would not provide adequate relief for any such breach. Accordingly, in addition to any other remedy that may be available to Perrigo, if Employee breaches a restrictive covenant contained in this Agreement, the parties acknowledge that injunctive relief in favor of Perrigo is proper (without the requirement of posting a bond or other security).
(b) The parties acknowledge that the agreements herein are reasonable in all respects and necessary for the protection of Perrigo, and Employee acknowledges that Perrigo's willingness to enter into the Merger Agreement is expressly conditioned on Employee's undertaking and complying with the agreements in this Agreement. Accordingly, Employee shall be bound by the restrictive covenants in this Agreement to the maximum extent permitted by Law, it being the intent and spirit of the parties that the foregoing shall be fully enforceable. The parties further agree, however, that if a court of competent jurisdiction determines that any of the provisions hereof are excessively broad as to duration, scope, or geographic area, such provision shall be deemed modified to permit enforcement to the maximum extent allowed by Law.

Perrigo shall (i) on or prior to the Closing Date, deliver to Employee a true and correct list of the products that (together with the categories set forth on Schedule II, which shall not be subject to updating) comprise the Perrigo Business and, in each case, which include the products that are in the market in commercial distribution on the Closing Date, (ii) promptly on or following (but, in any event, no later than fourteen (14) Business Days following) the Employment End Date, deliver to

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Schedule I (and, accordingly, the Perrigo Business) shall in no event include, and Employee shall not, following the Employment End Date, be restricted from competing with, any product or products added following the date of this Agreement, to Perrigo's portfolio of products pursuant to, or in connection with, a transaction or series of related transactions (in each case, whether alone or as part of a merger, acquisition, consolidation or otherwise) involving aggregate consideration equal to, or in excess of, $200 million.

Section 4.
Remedies and Further Acknowledgments
(f) The parties to this Agreement recognize that irreparable harm would result from any breach by Perrigo or any of its Affiliates of any restrictive covenant contained in this Agreement and that monetary damages alone would not provide adequate relief for any such breach. Accordingly, in addition to any other remedy that may be available to PBM, if Perrigo or any of its Affiliates breaches or threatens to breach a restrictive covenant contained in this Agreement, PBM shall have the right, in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other rights and remedies that may be available to it, under law or in equity to apply to and obtain in any court of competent jurisdiction injunctive relief or other equitable relief to enjoin or restrain any failure to perform, violation or threatened violation by Perrigo or its Affiliates of any provision or obligation of this Agreement or to compel specific performance by Perrigo or its Affiliates of one or more of the provisions or its obligations under this Agreement. Perrigo and PBM furthermore agree that each party shall waive any requirement that any other party post any bond, guaranty or other surety in order to obtain any such injunction or specific performance.
(g) The parties acknowledge that the agreements herein are reasonable in all respects and necessary for the protection of PBM, and Perrigo acknowledges that PBM's willingness to enter into the Merger Agreement is expressly conditioned on Perrigo's undertaking and complying with the agreements in this Agreement. Perrigo acknowledges and agrees that the restrictions imposed by this Agreement as to time, geographical area, and scope (temporal or otherwise) of activity being restricted are reasonable and do not impose a greater restraint than is necessary to protect the goodwill or other business interests of PBM. Accordingly, Perrigo shall be bound by the restrictive covenants in this Agreement to the maximum extent permitted by Law, it being the intent and spirit of the parties that the foregoing shall be fully enforceable. The parties further agree, however, that if a court of competent jurisdiction determines that any of the provisions hereof are excessively broad as to duration, scope, or geographic area, such provision shall be deemed modified to permit enforcement to the maximum extent allowed by Law.
