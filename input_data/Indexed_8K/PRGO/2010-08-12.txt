ITEM 2.02.
Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On August 12, 2010, Perrigo Company (Company) released earnings for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2010.  The press release related to the Companys earnings is attached as Exhibit 99.1.
The earnings release contains certain non-GAAP measures.  A non-GAAP financial measure is defined as a numerical measure of a companys financial performance that excludes or includes amounts different than the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) in the statements of income, balance sheets or statements of cash flows of the company.  Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the Company has provided a reconciliation for gross profit, operating expenses, operating income, net interest and other, income from continuing operations and earnings per share from continuing operations within its earnings release to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure for these non-GAAP measures.
The Company excludes the items listed below in the applicable period when monitoring and evaluating the on-going financial results and trends of its business due to the unusual nature of these items.  The Company believes that presenting operating results excluding these items is also useful for investors since it provides important insight into the Company's on-going core business operations on a normalized basis. Adjusted earnings is one of the primary indicators management uses for planning and forecasting in future periods, including trending and analyzing the core operating performance of the Companys business from period to period without the effect of the non-core business items indicated.  Management uses adjusted earnings to prepare operating budgets and forecasts and to measure the Companys performance against those budgets and forecasts on a corporate and segment level.
Beginning with its Fiscal 2011 guidance, the Company will also be excluding amortization on acquired intangible assets related to business combinations and asset acquisitions. Over the past five years, the Company has regularly made acquisitions, and as a result, the Companys amortization expense has quickly increased.  Management believes that these large non-cash charges distort the underlying operational performance of the Companys business and reduce the transparency for management and investors in analyzing quarterly activity.
Items excluded from reported results and guidance:
Fiscal 2009 Results
 
 
 
 
 
Fiscal 2010 Results
 
Fiscal 2011 Guidance
In addition, for purposes of comparison to Fiscal 2011 guidance, the Company has provided in the earnings release Fiscal 2010 adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding deal-related amortization.
The information in this Report is being furnished and shall not be deemed filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that Section.  The information in this Report shall not be deemed incorporated by reference into any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.

Perrigo Company (Nasdaq: PRGO; TASE) today announced results for its fourth quarter and full year ended June 26, 2010.
Perrigo's Chairman and CEO Joseph C. Papa commented, "For the fourth straight year, we delivered year-over-year record sales, earnings and cash flow from operations. Despite significant challenges, from competition in our largest product to stronger regulatory oversight, we remained focused on execution and delivered results ahead of our own expectations. During the year, we made two business acquisitions that expanded our portfolio into adjacent categories and new geographical areas. We extended our product pipeline into ophthalmics. We also entered strategic partnerships for new products leveraging Perrigo's powerful sales, marketing and distribution capabilities. We are continuing along our strategic path in these challenging times to make quality healthcare more affordable to consumers around the globe."
The Company's reported results are summariz ed in the attached Consolidated Statements of Income, Balance Sheets and Cash Flows. As part of management's continued strategic review of the Company's portfolio of businesses, management committed to a plan to sell, and subsequently sold on February 26, 2010, the Company's Israel Consumer Products business. The results of this business are reflected in the consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations for all periods presented.

Reported operating income included approximately $10 million in inventory step-up charges related to the acquisitions of PBM Holdings, Inc. (PBM) and Orion Laboratories (Orion).    
Fiscal Year Results
Net sales for fiscal 2010 were $2.27 billion, an increase of 13% over fiscal 2009. The increase was driven largely by strong performance in the Consumer Healthcare and Rx segments. The growth included consolidated new product sales of approximately $125 million. Reported gr oss profit was $746 million, up 25%, and the reported gross margin was 32.9%, up from 29.7% last year. The gross margin improvement was driven primarily by new products. Reported operating margin increased 250 basis points to 14.8% and adjusted operating margin increased 360 basis points to 16.9%. Reported income from continuing operations was $224 million, an increase of 59%. Adjusted income from continuing operations was $263 million, or an increase of 50% from fiscal 2009.
Consumer Healthcare
Consumer Healthcare segment net sales in the fourth quarter were $481 million, compared with $407 million in the fourth quarter last year, an increase of $74 million or 18%. The increase resulted from $46 million of sales attributable to the acquisitions of PBM and Orion, $19 million of new product sales and $17 million from higher sales volumes of existing products, primarily in the analgesic category, as well as from favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which increased sales by $ 2 million. These increases were partially offset by a decline of approximately $10 million in sales from existing products, primarily in gastrointestinal, nutrition and oral electrolytes categories. Reported gross profit was $144 million, compared to $120 million a year ago. Adjusted gross profit was $154 million compared to $120 million a year ago. Adjusted gross margin increased 270 basis points to 32.1%, largely driven by acquisitions, increased sales in analgesics and favorable product mix. Reported operating income was $67 million, compared with $56 million a year ago, and adjusted operating income was $77 million compared to $56 million a year ago. Adjusted operating margin increased 210 basis points to 15.9% due to the strong gross margin improvement.      
For fiscal year 2010, Consumer Healthcare net sales increased $194 million or 12%, compared to fiscal 2009.  The increase resulted from approximately $89 million in incremental sales from the Company's acquisitions of PBM, Orion, J.B. Laboratories, Unico Holdings and Laboratorios Diba, new product sales of $70 million and an increase in sales of existing products of $61 million, primarily in the gastrointestinal, cough/cold and analgesics categories. This growth was partially offset by $19 million in decreased sales from existing products, primarily in the nutrition, feminine hygiene and smoking cessation categories. Net sales were also reduced by approximately $7 million as a result of foreign currency exchange rates. Reported gross profit was $561 million, compared to $460 million a year ago. Adjusted gross profit was $571 million, compared to $465 million a year ago. Adjusted gross margin increased 280 basis points to 31.2%, largely driven by acquisitions, new product sales and lower inventory costs. Reported operating income was $305 million, compared with $234 million a year ago, and adjusted operating income was $315 million, compared to $239 million a year ago. Adjusted operating margin increased 260 basis points t o 17.2%.

Rx Pharmaceuticals
The Rx Pharmaceuticals segment fourth quarter net sales were $84 million, compared with approximately $49 million a year ago, an increase of 72%. This increase was due primarily to an increase in new product sales and increased sales in over-the-counter Rx (ORx). Reported gross profit was $33 million, compared to $21 million a year ago. The increase was due primarily to new product sales, increased sales in ORx and less downward pricing pressure. Gross margin decreased 360 basis points to 39.4%. The decrease was due primarily to the successful new product launch of imiquimod cream, of which the Company is the authorized generic distributor and recognizes a lower gross margin in line with such contracts. Reported operating income was approximately $17 million, an increase of $5 mil lion from last year, and adjusted operating income was $22 million, compared to $12 million a year ago. Adjusted operating margin increased 90 basis points from last year to 25.7% due to increased operating expense leverage.  
For fiscal year 2010, net sales for the Rx Pharmaceuticals segment increased 45% over fiscal 2009. Net sales increased due to higher sales of existing products, new product sales, less downward pricing pressure and an increase in service and royalty revenue.

API
The API segment reported fourth quarter net sales of $38 million, compared with $39 million a year ago. The decrease was due primarily to lower sales of existing products, which was partially offset by new product sales and dossier sales. Reported operating income increased approximately $12 million due primarily to charges related to the restructuring in Germany that were included in fiscal 2009. Adjusted operating income decreased $1 million. Adjusted operating margin decreased 170 b asis points to 22%.  
For fiscal year 2010, net sales increased 2% or $3 million, compared to fiscal 2009. Reported operating income increased $14 million over last year, and adjusted operating income increased $8 million over last year to $23 million. Adjusted operating margin increased 570 basis points to 16.8%.  
Other

The operating segment reported operating income of approximately $1 million, compared to operating income of $2 million for fiscal 2009. Net sales for fiscal 2010 decreased 13% compared to fiscal 2009. The decrease was due primarily to approximately $22 million related to the loss of a customer contract.  
Guidance
Chairman and CEO Joseph C. Papa concluded, "We had strong performance and execution across our busines ses during fiscal 2010, and in fiscal 2011, we look to build on that success. We expect fiscal 2011 reported diluted earnings from continuing operations to be between $3.08 and $3.28 per share as compared to $2.41 in fiscal 2010. Excluding the charges outlined in Table III at the end of this release, we expect fiscal 2011 adjusted diluted earnings from continuing operations to be between $3.40 and $3.60 per share as compared to $3.04 in fiscal 2010. This new range implies a year-over-year growth rate of adjusted earnings from continuing operations of 12% to 18% over fiscal 2010 adjusted diluted EPS."
