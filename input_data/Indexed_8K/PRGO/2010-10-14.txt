2010 Credit Agreement
See description in Item 2.03 below.
Amendment to 2008 Credit Agreement
On October 8, 2010, in connection with the execution of the 2010 Credit Agreement (defined below), Perrigo Company and certain of its subsidiaries (collectively, "Perrigo") entered into a First Amendment (the "First Amendment") to the Term Loan Agreement, dated as of April 22, 2008, with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent; RBS Citizens, N.A., as Syndication Agent; and the lenders party thereto (the "Term Loan Agreement"). The First Amendment conforms certain covenants in the Term Loan Agreement to the covenants contained in the 2010 Credit Agreement and makes certain other conforming changes. The First Amendment is filed as Exhibit 10.1 hereto, and the foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by reference thereto.
 
On October 8, 2010, in connection with the execution of the 2010 Credit Agreement (defined below), Perrigo, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the lender parties to the Credit Agreement, dated as of March 16, 2005, among Perrigo, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent, Syndication Agent and Documentation Agent and the lender parties listed therein (the "2005 Credit Agreement"), terminated the 2005 Credit Agreement.
 
Perrigo entered into a Credit Agreement, dated as of October 8, 2010, with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent; Bank of America, N.A. and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Syndication Agents; HSBC Bank USA, National Association, Fifth Third Bank and Bank Leumi USA, as Documentation Agents; and seven other participant banks (the "2010 Credit Agreement"). Under the terms of the 2010 Credit Agreement, the initial revolving loan commitment is $350,000,000 and the initial term loan commitment is $150,000,000, each subject to increase or decrease as specified in the 2010 Credit Agreement. Revolving loans may be made in U.S. dollars or equivalent amounts denominated in foreign currencies, and the term loan is in U.S. dollars. The loans bear interest, at the election of Perrigo, at either the Annual Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin or the Adjusted LIBO Rate plus the Applicable Margin, as specified and defined in the 2010 Credit Agreement. The Applicable Margin is based on Perrigo's Leverage Ratio from time to time, as defined in the 2010 Credit Agreement. The obligations under the 2010 Credit Agreement are guaranteed by certain subsidiaries of Perrigo and, in some instances, the obligation may be secured by a pledge of 65% of the equity interests of certain foreign subsidiaries. The maturity date of the term loan and the final maturity date of any revolving loan is October 8, 2015. Upon the occurrence of certain specified events of default, the principal amount of the term loan and any revolving loans then outstanding may be declared due and payable, together with accrued interest. The 2010 Credit Agreement contains affirmative and negative covenants that Perrigo believes are normal and customary for transactions of this type.
Perrigo intends to use the proceeds from the term loan and any revolving loans for general corporate purposes, including repayment of certain other debts outstanding at the time such loans are made, such as the $100,000,000 term loan made pursuant to the 2005 Credit Agreement. The 2010 Credit Agreement is filed as Exhibit 10.2 hereto, and the foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by reference thereto.
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

The Applicable Agent will make such Swingline Loan available to the applicable Borrower by promptly crediting the amounts so received, in like funds, to the account of the applicable Borrower with the Applicable Agent (or, in the case of a Swingline Borrowing made to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as provided in Section 2.05(e), by remittance to the applicable Issuing Bank); provided that, in the case of a Swingline Shekel Loan, the Swingline Shekel Lender will make such Swingline Loan available to the applicable Israeli Borrower by promptly crediting the amounts so received, in like funds, to the account of the applicable Israeli Borrower with the Swingline Shekel Lender. The Administrative Agent shall determine the procedures to be followed by the Swingline Lenders to ensure that the Dollar Equivalent of the aggregate
 
principal amount of the Swingline Loans does not exceed the amount permitted by Section 2.04(a) at the time any Swingline Loan is made and to ensure that the amount of Advances made does not exceed the amounts permitted by Section 2.01(a), and each Swingline Lender and the other parties hereto agrees to abide by such procedures. Without limiting such procedures, for purposes of determining the amount of any Borrowing that is permitted to be made under Section 2.01(a) or 2.04(a), the Administrative Agent may at any time assume that the Dollar Equivalent of the aggregate amount of Swingline Shekel Loans is equal to $15,000,000 unless the request for such Borrowing delivered to the Administrative Agent specifies the Dollar Equivalent of the aggregate amount of Swingline Shekel Loans on the day of such request and on the day such Borrowing is to be made, and the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely thereon in determining the permissible amount of such Borrowing. If the Swingline Loans at any time exceed any of the amounts permitted by Section 2.01(a) or 2.04(a), the relevant Borrower or Borrowers shall promptly prepay the relevant Swingline Loans by the amount of such excess.
(c) Each Swingline Lender may by written notice given to the Applicable Agent not later than 1:00 p.m., Chicago time (or 11:00 a.m. London time in the case of any Swingline Loan denominated in any Foreign Currency or made to any Foreign Subsidiary Borrower), on any Business Day require the Lenders to acquire participations on such Business Day in all or a portion of the outstanding Swingline Loans, provided that the Swingline Shekel Lender may do so only upon and during the continuance of an Event of Default. Such notice shall specify the aggregate amount of such Swingline Loans in which the Lenders will participate, and such Swingline Loans, if denominated in Foreign Currency, shall be converted to Dollars and shall bear interest at the Alternate Base Rate. Promptly upon receipt of such notice, the Applicable Agent will give notice thereof to each Lender, specifying in such notice such Lender's Applicable Adjusted Percentage of such Swingline Loan or Loans. Each Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees, upon receipt of notice as provided above, to pay to the Applicable Agent, for the account of the applicable Swingline Lender, such Lender's Applicable Adjusted Percentage of such Swingline Loan or Loans. Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that its respective obligation to acquire participations in Swingline Loans pursuant to this paragraph is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. Each Lender shall comply with its obligation under this paragraph by wire transfer of immediately available funds, in the same manner as provided in Section 2.06 with respect to Loans made by such Lender (and Section 2.06 shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the payment obligations of the Lenders), and the Applicable Agent shall promptly pay to the applicable Swingline Lender the amounts so received by it from the Lenders. The Applicable Agent shall notify the applicable Borrower of any participations in any Swingline Loan acquired pursuant to this paragraph (c), and thereafter payments in respect of such Swingline Loan shall be made to the Applicable Agent and not to the applicable Swingline Lender. Any amounts received by a Swingline Lender from the applicable Borrower (or other party on behalf of such Borrower) in respect of a Swingline Loan after receipt by such Swingline Lender of the proceeds of a sale of participations therein shall be promptly remitted to the Applicable Agent; any such amounts received by the Applicable Agent shall be promptly remitted by the Applicable Agent to the Lenders that shall have made their payments pursuant to this paragraph and to such Swingline Lender, as their interests may appear; provided that any such payment so remitted shall be repaid to such Swingline Lender or to the Applicable Agent, as applicable, if and to the extent such payment is required to be refunded to the applicable Borrower for any reason. The purchase of participations in a Swingline Loan pursuant to this paragraph shall not relieve the applicable Borrower of any default in the payment thereof and the applicable Borrower shall reimburse each Lender for any amounts that may be due under Section 2.14, 2.16. 2.20 or any other term of this Agreement.
 
SECTION 2.05. (a)  Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the U.S. Borrower may request the issuance of Letters of Credit denominated in Dollars for its own account or the account of a Subsidiary acceptable to the Issuing Bank, in a form reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Bank, at any time and from time to time during the Availability Period. In the event of any inconsistency between the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the terms and conditions of any form of letter of credit application or other agreement submitted by the U.S. Borrower to, or entered into by the U.S. Borrower and a Subsidiary with, the Issuing Bank relating to any Letter of Credit, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall control. On the Effective Date, each Existing Letter of Credit shall, without any further action by any party, be deemed to have been issued as a Letter of Credit hereunder on the Effective Date and shall for all purposes hereof be treated as a Letter of Credit under this Agreement.
Letters of Credit.
General.
(b) To request the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or the amendment, renewal or extension of an outstanding Letter of Credit), the U.S. Borrower shall hand deliver or telecopy (or transmit by electronic communication, if arrangements for doing so have been approved by the Issuing Bank) to the Issuing Bank and the Administrative Agent (reasonably in advance of the requested date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension) a notice requesting the issuance of a Letter of Credit, or identifying the Letter of Credit to be amended, renewed or extended, and specifying the date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension (which shall be a Business Day), the date on which such Letter of Credit is to expire (which shall comply with paragraph (c) of this Section), the amount of such Letter of Credit, the name and address of the account party thereof (which shall be the U.S. Borrower or a Subsidiary, and if a Subsidiary then the U.S. Borrower and such Subsidiary shall be jointly and severally liable with respect to all Obligations relating to such Letter of Credit), the name and address of the beneficiary thereof and such other information as shall be necessary to prepare, amend, renew or extend such Letter of Credit. If requested by the Issuing Bank, the U.S. Borrower (and the applicable Subsidiary if such Letter of Credit is to be issued for the account of a Subsidiary) also shall submit a letter of credit application on the Issuing Bank's standard form in connection with any request for a Letter of Credit. A Letter of Credit shall be issued, amended, renewed or extended only if (and upon issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of each Letter of Credit the U.S. Borrower shall be deemed to represent and warrant that), after giving effect to such issuance, amendment, renewal or extension (i) the LC Exposure shall not exceed $50,000,000, (ii) the (A) Aggregate Revolving Credit Exposure shall not exceed (B) the Aggregate Revolving Commitments minus the Aggregate Ancillary Commitments and (iii) the sum of the Aggregate Total Revolving Exposure shall not exceed the Aggregate Revolving Commitments.
Notice of Issuance, Amendment, Renewal, Extension; Certain Conditions.
(c) Each Letter of Credit shall expire at or prior to the close of business on the earlier of (i) the date one year after the date of the issuance of such Letter of Credit (provided that any Letter of Credit may provide for additional one year renewals thereof subject to the approval of the Administrative Agent prior to the time of such renewal) and (ii) the date that is five Business Days prior to the Maturity Date.
Expiration Date.
(d) By the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or an amendment to a Letter of Credit increasing the amount thereof) and without any further action on the part of the Issuing Bank or the Lenders, the Issuing Bank hereby grants to each Lender, and each Lender hereby acquires from the Issuing Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit equal to such Lender's Applicable Adjusted Percentage of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit. In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Issuing Bank, such Lender's Applicable Adjusted Percentage of each LC Disbursement made by the Issuing Bank and not reimbursed by the U.S. Borrower on the date due as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section, or of any reimbursement payment required to be refunded to the U.S. Borrower for any reason. Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations pursuant to this paragraph in respect of Letters of Credit is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever.
Participations.
 
(e) If the Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit, the U.S. Borrower and any applicable Subsidiary (if such Letter of Credit was issued for the account of a Subsidiary) shall jointly and severally reimburse such LC Disbursement by paying to the Administrative Agent an amount equal to such LC Disbursement not later than 12:00 noon, Local Time, on the date that such LC Disbursement is made, if the U.S. Borrower shall have received notice of such LC Disbursement prior to Local Time, on such date, or, if such notice has not been received by the U.S. Borrower prior to such time on such date, then not later than 12:00 noon, Local Time, on (i) the Business Day that the U.S. Borrower receives such notice, if such notice is received prior to 10:00 a.m., Local Time, on the day of receipt, or (ii) the Business Day immediately following the day that the U.S. Borrower receives such notice, if such notice is not received prior to such time on the day of receipt; that the U.S. Borrower may, subject to the conditions to borrowing set forth herein, request in accordance with Section 2.03 or 2.04 that such payment be financed with an ABR Revolving Borrowing or Swingline Loan in an equivalent amount and, to the extent so financed, the U.S. Borrower's and any applicable Subsidiary's obligation to make such payment shall be discharged and replaced by the resulting ABR Revolving Borrowing or Swingline Loan. If the U.S. Borrower and any applicable Subsidiary fail to make such payment when due, such amount, if denominated in Foreign Currency shall be converted to Dollars and shall bear interest at the Alternate Base Rate and the Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender of the applicable LC Disbursement, the payment then due from the U.S. Borrower and any applicable Subsidiary in respect thereof and such Lender's Applicable Adjusted Percentage thereof. Promptly following receipt of such notice, each Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent its Applicable Adjusted Percentage of the payment then due from the U.S. Borrower and any applicable Subsidiary, in the same manner as provided in Section 2.06 with respect to Loans made by such Lender (and Section 2.06 shall apply, , to the payment obligations of the Lenders), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the Issuing Bank the amounts so received by it from the Lenders. Promptly following receipt by the Administrative Agent of any payment from the U.S. Borrower or any applicable Subsidiary pursuant to this paragraph, the Administrative Agent shall distribute such payment to the Issuing Bank or, to the extent that Lenders have made payments pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse the Issuing Bank, then to such Lenders and the Issuing Bank as their interests may appear. Any payment made by a Lender pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse the Issuing Bank for any LC Disbursement (other than the funding of ABR Revolving Loans or a Swingline Loan as contemplated above) shall not constitute a Loan and shall not relieve the U.S. Borrower and any applicable Subsidiary of their obligation to reimburse such LC Disbursement.
Reimbursement.
provided
mutatis
mutandis
(f) . The U.S. Borrower's and any applicable Subsidiary's obligation to reimburse LC Disbursements as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit or this Agreement, or any term or provision therein, (ii) any draft or other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment by the Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit, or (iv) any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or provide a right of setoff against, the U.S. Borrower's or any applicable Subsidiary's obligations hereunder. Neither the Administrative Agent, the Lenders nor the Issuing Bank, nor any of their Related Parties, shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment or failure to make any payment
Obligations Absolute
 
thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the Issuing Bank; that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse the Issuing Bank from liability to the U.S. Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the U.S. Borrower and any applicable Subsidiary to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by the U.S. Borrower and any applicable Subsidiary that are caused by the Issuing Bank's failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof. The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of gross negligence or wilful misconduct on the part of the Issuing Bank (as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), the Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such determination. In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree that, with respect to documents presented which appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, the Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit.
provided
(g) The Issuing Bank shall, promptly following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit. The Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the U.S. Borrower by telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of such demand for payment and whether the Issuing Bank has made or will make an LC Disbursement thereunder; that any failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the U.S. Borrower and any applicable Subsidiary of their obligation to reimburse the Issuing Bank and the Lenders with respect to any such LC Disbursement.
Disbursement Procedures.
provided
(h)  If the Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement, then, unless the U.S. Borrower or the applicable Subsidiary shall reimburse such LC Disbursement in full on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and including the date such LC Disbursement is made to but excluding the date that the U.S. Borrower and or the applicable Subsidiary reimburses such LC Disbursement, at the rate per annum then applicable to ABR Revolving Loans; that, if the U.S. Borrower or any applicable Subsidiary fails to reimburse such LC Disbursement when due pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section, then Section 2.12(e) shall apply. Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for the account of the Issuing Bank, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any Lender pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section to reimburse the Issuing Bank shall be for the account of such Lender to the extent of such payment.
Interim Interest.
provided
(i) The Issuing Bank may be replaced at any time by written agreement among the U.S. Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the replaced Issuing Bank and the successor Issuing Bank. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders of any such replacement of the Issuing Bank. At the time any such replacement shall become effective, the U.S. Borrower shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for the account of the replaced Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.11(b). From and after the effective date of any such replacement, (i) the successor Issuing Bank shall have all the rights and obligations of the Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued thereafter and (ii) references herein to the term "Issuing Bank" shall be deemed to refer to such successor or to any previous Issuing Bank, or to such successor and all previous Issuing Banks, as the context shall require. After the replacement of an Issuing Bank hereunder, the replaced Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such replacement, but shall not be required to issue additional Letters of Credit.
Replacement of the Issuing Bank.
 
(j) If any Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, on the Business Day that the U.S. Borrower receives notice from the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders (or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated, Lenders with LC Exposure representing greater than 50% of the total LC Exposure) demanding the deposit of cash collateral pursuant to this paragraph, the U.S. Borrower and any applicable Subsidiary (with respect to any Letters of Credit issued for its account only, jointly and severally with the Borrower) shall deposit in an account with the Administrative Agent, in the name of the Administrative Agent and for the benefit of the Lenders, an amount in cash equal to the LC Exposure as of such date plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon; that the obligation to deposit such cash collateral shall become effective immediately, and such deposit shall become immediately due and payable, without demand or other notice of any kind, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default with respect to the U.S. Borrower or any applicable Subsidiary with respect to any Letters of Credit issued for its account described in clause (h) or (i) of Article VII. Such deposit shall be held by the Administrative Agent as collateral for the payment and performance of the obligations of the U.S. Borrower and any applicable Subsidiary under this Agreement. The Administrative Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over such account. Other than any interest earned on the investment of such deposits, which investments shall be made at the option and sole discretion of the Administrative Agent and at the U.S. Borrower's and any applicable Subsidiary's risk and expense, such deposits shall not bear interest. Interest or profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in such account. Moneys in such account shall be applied by the Administrative Agent to reimburse the Issuing Bank for LC Disbursements for which it has not been reimbursed and, to the extent not so applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of the U.S. Borrower and any applicable Subsidiary for the LC Exposure at such time or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated (but subject to the consent of Lenders with LC Exposure representing greater than 50% of the total LC Exposure), be applied to satisfy other obligations of the U.S. Borrower under this Agreement. If the U.S. Borrower and any applicable Subsidiary is required to provide an amount of cash collateral hereunder as a result of the occurrence of an Event of Default, such amount (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to the U.S. Borrower or applicable Subsidiary within three Business Days after all Events of Default have been cured or waived.
Cash Collateralization.
provided
(k) . From time to time, the Administrative Agent may designate other Lenders (in addition to JPMorgan) that agree (in their sole discretion) to act in such capacity and are satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and the U.S. Borrower as Issuing Banks. Each such additional Issuing Bank shall execute such agreements requested by the Administrative Agent and shall thereafter be an Issuing Bank hereunder for all purposes, provided that any such additional Issuing Bank shall only issue such Letters of Credit as approved by the Administrative Agent.
Additional Issuing Banks
(l) . Unless otherwise requested by the Administrative Agent, each Issuing Bank shall report in writing to the Administrative Agent (i) on the first Business Day of each week and the first Business Day of each Fiscal Quarter, the aggregate face amount of Letters of Credit issued by it and outstanding as of the last Business Day of the preceding week or the preceding Fiscal Quarter, as applicable, (ii) on or prior to each Business Day on which such Issuing Bank expects to issue, amend, renew or extend any Letter of Credit, the date of such issuance, amendment, renewal or extension, and the aggregate face amount of the Letters of Credit to be issued, amended, renewed or extended by it and outstanding after giving effect to such issuance, amendment, renewal or extension occurred (and whether the amount thereof changed), (iii) on each Business Day on which such Issuing Bank makes any LC Disbursement, the date of such LC Disbursement and the amount of such LC Disbursement and (iv) on any other Business Day, such other information as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably request.
Reporting
 
SECTION 2.06. . (a) Each Lender shall make each Loan to be made by it hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of immediately available funds by 12:00 noon, Local Time, to the account of the Applicable Agent most recently designated by it for such purpose by notice to the Lenders; provided that Swingline Loans shall be made as provided in Section 2.04. The Applicable Agent will make such Loans available to the applicable Borrower by promptly crediting the amounts so received, in like funds, to an account of the applicable Borrower maintained with the Applicable Agent (i) in such location determined by the Administrative Agent, in the case of Loans denominated in Dollars, or (ii) in London, in the case of Loans denominated in a Foreign Currency and designated by the applicable Borrower in the applicable Borrowing Request; provided that ABR Revolving Loans and Swingline Dollar Borrowings made to finance the reimbursement of a LC Disbursement and reimbursements as provided in Section 2.05(e) shall be remitted by the Administrative Agent to the applicable Issuing Bank.
Funding of Borrowings
(b) Unless the Applicable Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Applicable Agent such Lender's share of such Borrowing, the Applicable Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the applicable Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Applicable Agent, then the applicable Lender and the applicable Borrower severally agree to pay to the Applicable Agent forthwith on demand (without duplication) such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the applicable Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Applicable Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender, (x) the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation (in the case of a Borrowing denominated in Dollars) or (y) the rate reasonably determined by the Applicable Agent to be the cost to it of funding such amount (in the case of a Borrowing denominated in a Foreign Currency) or (ii) in the case of the applicable Borrower, the interest rate applicable to ABR Loans (in the case of a Borrowing denominated in Dollars) or the rate reasonably determined by the Applicable Agent to be the cost to it of funding such amount (in the case of a Borrowing denominated in a Foreign Currency). If such Lender pays such amount to the Applicable Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lender's Loan included in such Borrowing.
SECTION 2.07. . (a) Each Borrowing initially shall be of the Type specified in the applicable Borrowing Request and, in the case of a Eurocurrency Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period as specified in such Borrowing Request. Thereafter, the applicable Borrower may elect to convert such Borrowing to a different Type, in the case of Borrowings denominated in Dollars, or to continue such Borrowing and, in the case of a Eurocurrency Borrowing, may elect Interest Periods therefor, all as provided in this Section. The applicable Borrower may elect different options with respect to different portions of the affected Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing. This Section shall not apply to Swingline Foreign Currency Borrowings or Swingline Dollar Borrowings, which may not be converted or continued.
Interest Elections
(b) To make an election pursuant to this Section, the applicable Borrower shall notify the Applicable Agent of such election by telephone (other than any election with respect to Loans denominated in any Foreign Currency, which election shall be in writing unless otherwise agreed to by the Applicable Agent) by the time that a Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 if such Borrower were requesting a Borrowing of the Type and denominated in the Foreign Currency resulting from such election to be made on the effective date of such election. Each such Interest Election Request shall be irrevocable and if given by telephone shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery or telecopy to the Applicable Agent of a written Interest Election Request in a form approved by the Applicable Agent and signed by the applicable Borrower.
 
(c) Each telephonic and written Interest Election Request shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02:
(i) the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request applies and, if different options are being elected with respect to different portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting Borrowing (in which case the information to be specified pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) below shall be specified for each resulting Borrowing);
(ii) the effective date of the election made pursuant to such Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;
(iii) whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a Eurocurrency Borrowing; provided that the resulting Borrowing is required to be a Eurocurrency Borrowing in the case of a Borrowing denominated in a Foreign Currency; and
(iv) if the resulting Borrowing is a Eurocurrency Borrowing, the Interest Period to be applicable thereto after giving effect to such election, which shall be a period contemplated by clause (a) of the definition of the term "Interest Period".
If any such Interest Election Request requests a Eurocurrency Borrowing but does not specify an Interest Period, then the applicable Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month's duration.
(d) Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the Applicable Agent shall advise each Lender to which such Interest Election Request relates of the details thereof and of such Lender's portion of each resulting Borrowing.
(e) If the applicable Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest Election Request with respect to a Eurocurrency Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period such Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing (unless such Borrowing is denominated in a Foreign Currency, in which case such Borrowing shall be continued as a Eurocurrency Borrowing with an Interest Period of one month's duration commencing on the last day of such Interest Period). Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the written request (including a request through electronic means) of the Required Lenders, so notifies the applicable Borrower, then, so long as an Event of Default is continuing (i) no outstanding Borrowing may be converted to or continued as a Eurocurrency Borrowing, (ii) unless repaid, each Eurocurrency Borrowing denominated in Dollars shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto and (iii) unless repaid, each Eurocurrency Borrowing denominated in a Foreign Currency shall be continued as a Eurocurrency Borrowing with an Interest Period of one month's duration.
SECTION 2.08. (a) Unless previously terminated, the Revolving Commitments shall terminate on the Maturity Date and the Term Loan Commitments shall terminate at 5:00 p.m., Chicago time, on the Effective Date.
Termination and Reduction/Increases of Commitments.
 
(b) The U.S. Borrower may at any time terminate, or from time to time reduce, the Revolving Commitments; that (i) each reduction of the Revolving Commitments shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of $10,000,000 and not less than $10,000,000 and (ii) the U.S. Borrower shall not terminate or reduce the Revolving Commitments if, after giving effect to any concurrent prepayment of the Revolving Loans in accordance with Section 2.10, the Aggregate Total Revolving Exposure would exceed the Aggregate Revolving Commitments.
provided
(c) The U.S. Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of any election to terminate or reduce the Revolving Commitments under paragraph (b) of this Section at least three Business Days prior to the effective date of such termination or reduction, specifying such election and the effective date thereof. Promptly following receipt of any notice, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each notice delivered by the U.S. Borrower pursuant to this Section shall be irrevocable; that a notice of termination of the Revolving Commitments delivered by the U.S. Borrower may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities, in which case such notice may be revoked by the U.S. Borrower (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied. Any termination or reduction of the Commitments shall be permanent. Each reduction of the Revolving Commitments shall be made ratably among the Lenders in accordance with their respective Revolving Commitments.
provided
(e) Subject to the conditions set forth below, the U.S. Borrower may, upon at least ten (10) days (or such other period of time agreed to between the Administrative Agent and the U.S. Borrower) prior written notice to the Administrative Agent, increase the Aggregate Revolving Commitments from time to time, either by designating a lender not theretofore a Lender to become a Lender (such designation to be effective only with the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent which shall not be unreasonably withheld) or by agreeing with an existing Lender that such Lender's Revolving Commitment shall be increased (thus increasing the Aggregate Revolving Commitments); that:
provided
(i) no Default shall have occurred and be continuing hereunder as of the effective date of such increase;
(ii) the representations and warranties of the Loan Parties set forth in the Loan Documents shall be true and correct in all material respects (except that any representation or warranty which is already qualified as to materiality or by reference to Material Adverse Effect shall be true and correct in all respects) on and as of such date, except to the extent such representations and warranties expressly relate to an earlier date, in which case such representations and warranties shall have been true and correct in all material respects as of such earlier date;
(iii) the amount of each such increase in the Aggregate Revolving Commitments shall not be less than $10,000,000 (or such other minimum amount agreed to between the Administrative Agent and the U.S. Borrower), and shall not cause the sum of (x) the aggregate increases in the Revolving Commitments under this Section 2.08(e) plus (y) the outstanding amount of all New Term Loans made under Section 2.08(f) to exceed $200,000,000;
(iv) the Borrowers and any applicable Lender or lender not theretofore a Lender, shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent, a Lender Addition and Acknowledgement Agreement, in form and substance satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and acknowledged by the Administrative Agent and each Borrower;
(v) no existing Lender shall be obligated in any way to increase any of its Commitments unless it has executed and delivered a Lender Addition and Acknowledgement Agreement;
 
(vi) the Administrative Agent shall consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) to such increase and the U.S. Borrower shall have complied with such other conditions in connection with such increase as may be required by the Administrative Agent;
(vii) the interest rates paid with respect to the increased Revolving Loan Commitment shall be identical to those payable with respect to the existing Revolving Loan Commitment;
(viii) the Administrative Agent shall have received such supplemental opinions, resolutions, certificates and other documents as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request; and
(ix) a new Lender may not be the Borrower or any Affiliate or Subsidiary of the Borrower.

(e) Any Lender may request that Loans made by it be evidenced by a promissory note. In such event, the applicable Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note payable to the order of such Lender (or, if requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its registered assigns) and in the form of Exhibit E hereto or such other form approved by the Applicable Agent.

Alternate Rate of Interest
(a) the Applicable Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the LIBO Rate, as applicable, for such Interest Period; or
 
(b) the Applicable Agent is advised by the Required Lenders that the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the LIBO Rate, as applicable, for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining their Loans included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period;
then the Applicable Agent shall give notice thereof to the Borrowers and the Lenders by telephone or telecopy as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until the Applicable Agent notifies the Borrowers and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of any Borrowing to, or continuation of any Borrowing as, a Eurocurrency Borrowing denominated in such currency shall be ineffective and such Borrowing shall be converted to or continued as on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto (A) if such Borrowing is denominated in Dollars, an ABR Borrowing or (B) if such Borrowing is denominated in a Foreign Currency, as a Borrowing bearing interest at such rate as the Administrative Agent determines adequately reflects the costs to the Lenders of making or maintaining such Borrowing, and (ii) if any Borrowing Request requests a Eurocurrency Borrowing in such currency, such Borrowing shall be made as an ABR Borrowing (if such Borrowing is requested to be made in Dollars) or shall be made as a Borrowing bearing interest at such rate as the Administrative Agent determines adequately reflects the costs to the Lenders of making or maintaining such Borrowing.
SECTION 2.14. (a) If any Change in Law shall:
Increased Costs.
(i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender (except any such reserve requirement reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate) or the Issuing Bank; or
(ii) impose on any Lender or the Issuing Bank or the London interbank market any other condition affecting this Agreement or any Advance made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein;
and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining any Eurocurrency Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan) or to increase the cost to such Lender or the Issuing Bank of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or the Issuing Bank hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then the applicable Borrower will pay to such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.
(b) If any Lender or the Issuing Bank determines that any Change in Law regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's capital or on the capital of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by the Issuing Bank, to a level below that which such Lender or the Issuing Bank or such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's policies and the policies of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the applicable Borrower will pay to such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank or such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company for any such reduction suffered.
 
(c) A certificate of a Lender or the Issuing Bank setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section shall be delivered to the U.S. Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The applicable Borrower shall pay such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.
(d) Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or the Issuing Bank to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's right to demand such compensation; that the U.S. Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender or the Issuing Bank pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than 270 days prior to the date that such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, notifies the U.S. Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's intention to claim compensation therefor; that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 270-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.

SECTION 2.15. In the event of (a) the payment of any principal of any Eurocurrency Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of Default), (b) the conversion of any Eurocurrency Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (c) the failure to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any Eurocurrency Loan on the date specified in any notice delivered pursuant hereto (regardless of whether such notice may be revoked under Section 2.10(b) and is revoked in accordance therewith), or (d) the assignment of any Eurocurrency Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto as a result of a request by the U.S. Borrower pursuant to Section 2.18, then, in any such event, the applicable Borrower shall compensate each Lender for the loss, cost and expense attributable to such event. In the case of a Eurocurrency Loan, such loss, cost or expense to any Lender shall be deemed to include an amount determined by such Lender to be the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest which would have accrued on the principal amount of such Loan had such event not occurred, at the Adjusted LIBO Rate that would have been applicable to such Loan, for the period from the date of such event to the last day of the then current Interest Period therefor (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, for the period that would have been the Interest Period for such Loan), over (ii) the amount of interest which would accrue on such principal amount for such period at the interest rate which such Lender would bid were it to bid, at the commencement of such period, for Dollar deposits of a comparable amount and period from other banks in the eurodollar market. A certificate of any Lender setting forth any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section shall be delivered to the applicable Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The applicable Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.
Break Funding Payments.
SECTION 2.16. (a) Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any Borrower hereunder shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes; that if any Borrower shall be required to deduct any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes from such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the Administrative Agent, Lender or Issuing Bank (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) such Borrower shall make such deductions and (iii) such Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
Taxes.
provided
 
(b) In addition, each Borrower shall pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
(c) Each Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, each Lender and the Issuing Bank, within 10 days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes paid by the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, on or with respect to any payment by or on account of any obligation of such Borrower hereunder (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the U.S. Borrower by a Lender or the Issuing Bank, or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender or the Issuing Bank, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
(d) As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by any Borrower to a Governmental Authority, such Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
(e) Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which a Borrower is located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments under this Agreement shall deliver to the U.S. Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the U.S. Borrower as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate.
(f) If the Administrative Agent or a Lender determines, in its sole discretion, that it has received a refund of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by a Borrower or with respect to which a Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.16, it shall pay over such refund to such Borrower (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by such Borrower under this Section 2.16 with respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent or such Lender and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund); provided, that such Borrower, upon the request of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over to such Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent or such Lender in the event the Administrative Agent or such Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. This Section shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes which it deems confidential) to any Borrower or any other Person.
SECTION 2.17. . (a) Unless otherwise specified, each Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder (whether of principal, interest, fees or reimbursement of LC Disbursements, or of amounts payable under Section 2.14, 2.15, 2.16 or 2.20, or otherwise) prior to 1:00 p.m., Local Time, on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without set-off or counterclaim. Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Applicable Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall be made to the Applicable Agent to the applicable account designated to the U.S. Borrower by each Applicable Agent, except payments to be made directly to the applicable Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender as
Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Set-offs
 
expressly provided herein and except that payments pursuant to Sections 2.14, 2.15, 2.16, 2.20 and 9.05 shall be made directly to the persons entitled thereto. The Applicable Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. All payments hereunder of (i) principal or interest in respect of any Loan shall be made in the currency in which such Loan is denominated, (ii) reimbursement obligations shall be made in the currency in which the Letter of Credit in respect of which such reimbursement obligation exists is denominated or (iii) any other amount due hereunder or under another Loan Document (other than an Ancillary Facility Document) shall be made in Dollars. Any payment required to be made by an Applicable Agent hereunder shall be deemed to have been made by the time required if such Applicable Agent shall, at or before such time, have taken the necessary steps to make such payment in accordance with the regulations or operating procedures of the clearing or settlement system used by such Applicable Agent to make such payment.
(b) If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Applicable Agent from any Borrower to pay fully all amounts of principal, unreimbursed LC Disbursements, interest and fees then due from such Borrower hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, towards payment of interest and fees then due from such Borrower hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, towards payment of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due from such Borrower hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due to such parties.
(c) If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Ancillary Loans, Revolving Loans, Term Loans or participations in LC Disbursements or Swingline Loans resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Ancillary Loans, Revolving Loans, Term Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Ancillary Loans, Revolving Loans, Term Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Ancillary Loans, Revolving Loans, Term Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans; provided that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph (c) shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by a Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements to any assignee or participant, other than to such Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph (c) shall apply). Each Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against such Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such Borrower in the amount of such participation.
(d) Unless the Applicable Agent shall have received notice from a Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Applicable Agent for the account of the Lenders or the applicable Issuing Bank hereunder that such Borrower will not make such payment, the Applicable Agent may assume that such Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in
 
reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the applicable Issuing Bank, as applicable, the amount due. In such event, if such Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the applicable Issuing Bank, as applicable, severally agrees to repay to the Applicable Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation (in the case of an amount denominated in Dollars) and (ii) the rate reasonably determined by the Applicable Agent to be the cost to it of funding such amount (in the case of an amount denominated in a Foreign Currency).
(e) If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.04(c), 2.05(d) or (e), 2.06(b), 2.17(d) or 9.03(c), then the Applicable Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the Applicable Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender's obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.
SECTION 2.18. (a) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.14, or if any Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.16, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.14 or 2.16, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. Each Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.
Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.
(b) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.14, or if a Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.16, or if any Lender defaults in its obligation to fund Loans hereunder, then such Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 9.04), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); that (i) such Borrower shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent (and if a Commitment is being assigned, the Issuing Bank), which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or such Borrower (in the case of all other amounts) and (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.14 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.16, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments. A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling such Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.
provided
SECTION 2.19. . On or after the Effective Date, the U.S. Borrower may designate any Foreign Subsidiary that is a Wholly-Owned Subsidiary as a Foreign Subsidiary Borrower by delivery to the Administrative Agent of a Foreign Subsidiary Borrower Agreement executed by such Foreign Subsidiary and the U.S. Borrower. Each such designation shall specify whether such Foreign Subsidiary shall be entitled (i) to obtain Revolving Loans and/or (ii) to
Foreign Subsidiary Borrowers
 
request the creation of Ancillary Facilities under Section 2.21, and each such designation shall be subject to the consent of the Administrative Agent (which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld), provided that no Foreign Subsidiary Borrower Agreement shall become effective as to any Foreign Subsidiary if it shall be unlawful for such Foreign Subsidiary to become a Borrower hereunder or for any Lender participating in Advances to such Foreign Subsidiary to make Advances to such Foreign Subsidiary as provided herein. Upon the execution by the U.S. Borrower and delivery to the Administrative Agent of a Foreign Subsidiary Borrower Termination with respect to any Foreign Subsidiary Borrower, such Foreign Subsidiary shall cease to be a Foreign Subsidiary Borrower and a party to this Agreement; provided that no Foreign Subsidiary Borrower Termination will become effective as to any Foreign Subsidiary Borrower (other than to terminate such Foreign Subsidiary Borrower's right to make further Borrowings under this Agreement) at a time when any principal of or interest on any Loan to, or any Letter of Credit issued for the account of, such Foreign Subsidiary Borrower shall be outstanding hereunder or any Ancillary Facility under which Ancillary Loans may be made available to such Foreign Subsidiary Borrower has not been previously terminated. Promptly following receipt of any Foreign Subsidiary Borrower Agreement or Foreign Subsidiary Borrower Termination, the Administrative Agent shall send a copy thereof to each Lender.
SECTION 2.20. . (a) For so long as any Lender is required to make special deposits with the Bank of England or comply with reserve assets, liquidity, cash margin or other requirements of the Bank of England, to maintain reserve asset ratios or to pay fees, in each case in respect of such Lender's Eurocurrency Loans or Swingline Foreign Currency Loans, such Lender shall be entitled to require the applicable Borrower to pay, contemporaneously with each payment of interest on each of such Loans, additional interest on such Loan at a rate per annum equal to the Mandatory Cost Rate calculated in accordance with the formula and in the manner set forth in Exhibit F hereto.
Additional Reserve Costs
(b) For so long as any Lender is required to comply with reserve assets, liquidity, cash margin or other requirements of any monetary or other authority (including any such requirement imposed by the European Central Bank or the European System of Central Banks, but excluding requirements reflected in the Statutory Reserves or the Mandatory Cost Rate) in respect of any of such Lender's Eurocurrency Loans and Swingline Foreign Currency Loans, such Lender shall be entitled to require the applicable Borrower to pay, contemporaneously with each payment of interest on each of such Lender's Loans subject to such requirements, additional interest on such Loan at a rate per annum specified by such Lender to be the cost to such Lender of complying with such requirements in relation to such Loan.
(c) Any additional interest owed pursuant to paragraph (a) or (b) above shall be determined by the applicable Lender, which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and notified to the applicable Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) at least five Business Days before each date on which interest is payable for the applicable Loan, and such additional interest so notified to the applicable Borrower by such Lender shall be payable to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender on each date on which interest is payable for such Loan.
SECTION 2.21. . (a) . If a Foreign Subsidiary Borrower and a Lender or Lenders agree, subject to (i) compliance with the requirements set forth in this Section 2.21 and (ii) such Foreign Subsidiary Borrower having complied with Sections 2.19 and 4.03, such Lenders shall be permitted to provide an Ancillary Facility to such Foreign Subsidiary Borrower. The Aggregate Ancillary Commitments shall not at any time exceed $55,000,000.

Such notice shall be delivered not less than five Business Days prior to the proposed cancellation date. Such cancellation shall be effective as of the proposed cancellation date unless the Ancillary Facility Exposure under such Ancillary Facility has not been reduced to zero as of such date.
Cancellation by Foreign Subsidiary Borrower
(g) . Each Ancillary Lender shall report in writing to the Administrative Agent (i) on the last Business Day of each month and of each Fiscal Quarter of the U.S. Borrower the Ancillary Facility Exposure for the last day of the month or Fiscal Quarter then ending, as the case may be for each Ancillary Facility under which it is an Ancillary Lender and (ii) on any other Business Day requested by the Administrative Agent, the Ancillary Facility Exposure for such day for each Ancillary Facility under which it is an Ancillary Lender. In addition, each Foreign Subsidiary Borrower to which an Ancillary Facility has been made available and each Ancillary Lender shall, upon request by the Administrative Agent, promptly supply the Administrative Agent with any information relating to the operation of such Ancillary Facility (including the Ancillary Facility Exposure) as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request.

Termination and Expiration of Ancillary Commitments
SECTION 2.22. . (a) To guarantee or secure, as the case may be, the payment when due of the Secured Obligations, the U.S. Borrower shall cause each of the following to execute and deliver Guaranties to the Administrative Agent: (i) All Domestic Subsidiaries of the Company will Guarantee all Secured Obligations; (ii) if it will not result in a material tax consequence (as reasonably agreed upon by the U.S. Borrower and the Administrative Agent), all Foreign Subsidiaries will Guarantee all Secured Obligations to the extent they are legally permitted to do so; (iii) the U.S. Borrower will Guarantee all Secured Obligations of the Foreign Subsidiary Borrowers; and (iv) if requested by the Administrative Agent, all subsidiary and parent companies of any Foreign Subsidiary Borrower organized in the jurisdiction of such Foreign Subsidiary Borrower will Guarantee all Secured Obligations of such Foreign Subsidiary Borrower to the extent they are legally permitted to do so and such guarantee will not result in a material adverse tax consequence (as reasonably agreed upon by the U.S. Borrower and the Administrative Agent). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Securitization Entities shall not be required to be Guarantors.
Guaranties; Collateral
(b) If any Foreign Subsidiaries could not execute a Guaranty for all Secured Obligations because that Guaranty would result in a material adverse tax consequence (as reasonably agreed upon by the U.S. Borrower and the Administrative Agent), then the Administrative Agent reserves the right (i) to require that 65% (or such greater amount that may be pledged without a material adverse tax consequence) of the Equity Interests of such Foreign Subsidiaries that are owned directly by the U.S Borrower or a Domestic Subsidiary be pledged pursuant to Collateral Documents satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and (ii) to require that 65% (or such greater amount that may be pledged without a material adverse tax consequence, as reasonably agreed upon by the U.S. Borrower and the Administrative Agent) of the Equity Interests of any other such Foreign Subsidiary be pledged pursuant to Collateral Documents satisfactory to the Administrative Agent to the extent such pledge is legally permitted and such pledge will not result in a material tax consequence (as reasonably agreed upon by the U.S. Borrower and the Administrative Agent).
(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the U.S. Borrower shall not be obligated to cause certain Subsidiaries to deliver the Guaranties required under Section 2.22(a) above or cause the pledge of the Equity Interests of certain Foreign Subsidiaries required under Section 2.22(b) to the extent that all such Subsidiaries that have not delivered the Guaranties required under Section 2.22(a) above and all such Foreign Subsidiaries that are required to have their Equity Interests pledged under Section 2.22(b) have not had 65% or more of their Equity Interests pledged under Section 2.22(b) would not constitute a Significant Subsidiary if considered as one Subsidiary. In making such determination under this Section 2.22(c), the assets or income of any Subsidiary shall be determined using the consolidated assets and income of such Subsidiary and its subsidiaries.
(d) Each of the Borrowers agrees that it will promptly notify the Administrative Agent if any additional Guaranties or pledges of the Equity Interests of Foreign Subsidiaries are required at any time by the terms of Sections 2.22(a), (b) and (c) above (whether due to the formation or acquisition of any Subsidiary, any increase in the assets or income of any Subsidiary or due to any other reason that would require additional Guaranties or pledges of the Equity Interests of Foreign Subsidiaries under the terms of Sections 2.22(a), (b) and (c) above). Each of the Borrowers agrees that it will and will promptly cause each such Subsidiary to execute and deliver, promptly upon the request of the Administrative Agent, such additional Guaranties or Collateral Documents and other agreements, documents and instruments, each in
 
form and substance satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, sufficient to grant to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent, the Guaranties and Liens required by this Agreement and the Collateral Documents. Each Borrower shall deliver, and cause each such Subsidiary to deliver, to the Administrative Agent all such certificates, legal opinions, share certificates and stock powers, lien searches, organizational and other charter documents, resolutions and other documents and agreements as the Administrative Agent may request in connection with any Guaranties or pledges of the Equity Interests of any Foreign Subsidiaries or otherwise in connection with any Foreign Subsidiary Borrowers.
SECTION 2.23 . Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the following provisions shall apply for so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender:
Defaulting Lenders
(a) fees shall cease to accrue on the unfunded portion of the Revolving Commitment of such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.11(a);
(b) the Commitments and Credit Exposure of such Defaulting Lender shall not be included in determining whether all Lenders or the Required Lenders have taken or may take any action hereunder (including any consent to any amendment, waiver or other modification pursuant to Section 9.02); provided, that this clause (b) shall not apply to the vote of a Defaulting Lender in the case of an amendment, waiver or other modification requiring the consent of such Lender or each Lender affected thereby;
(c) if any Swingline Exposure or LC Exposure exists at the time such Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender then:
(i) all or any part of the Swingline Exposure and LC Exposure of such Defaulting Lender shall be reallocated among the non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Applicable Percentages but only to the extent (x) the sum of all non-Defaulting Lenders' Revolving Credit Exposures plus such Defaulting Lender's Swingline Exposure and LC Exposure does not exceed the total of all non-Defaulting Lenders' Revolving Commitments and (y) no non-Defaulting Lender's Revolving Credit Exposures plus such non-Defaulting Lender's Applicable Adjusted Percentage of such Defaulting Lender's Swingline Exposure and LC Exposure exceeds such non-Defaulting Lender's Revolving Commitment;
(ii) if the reallocation described in clause (i) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Borrowers shall within two Business Days following notice by the Administrative Agent (x) first, prepay such Swingline Exposure and (y) second, cash collateralize for the benefit of the Issuing Bank only the Borrowers' obligations corresponding to such Defaulting Lender's LC Exposure (after giving effect to any partial reallocation pursuant to clause (i) above) in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.05(j) for so long as such LC Exposure is outstanding;
(iii) if any Borrower cash collateralizes any portion of such Defaulting Lender's LC Exposure pursuant to clause (ii) above, such Borrower shall not be required to pay any fees to such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.11(b) with respect to such Defaulting Lender's LC Exposure during the period such Defaulting Lender's LC Exposure is cash collateralized;
(iv) if the LC Exposure of the non-Defaulting Lenders is reallocated pursuant to clause (i) above, then the fees payable to the Lenders pursuant to Section 2.11(a) and Section 2.11(b) shall be adjusted in accordance with such non-Defaulting Lenders' Applicable Percentages; and
 
(v) if all or any portion of such Defaulting Lender's LC Exposure is neither reallocated nor cash collateralized pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) above, then, without prejudice to any rights or remedies of the Issuing Bank or any other Lender hereunder, all letter of credit fees payable under Section 2.11(b) with respect to such Defaulting Lender's LC Exposure shall be payable to the Issuing Bank until and to the extent that such LC Exposure is reallocated and/or cash collateralized; and
(d) so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender, the Swingline Lender shall not be required to fund any Swingline Loan and the Issuing Bank shall not be required to issue, amend or increase any Letter of Credit, unless it is satisfied that the related exposure and the Defaulting Lender's then outstanding LC Exposure will be 100% covered by the Commitments of the non-Defaulting Lenders and/or cash collateral will be provided by the Borrowers in accordance with Section 2.23(c), and participating interests in any newly made Swingline Loan or any newly issued or increased Letter of Credit shall be allocated among non-Defaulting Lenders in a manner consistent with Section 2.23(c)(i) (and such Defaulting Lender shall not participate therein).
If (i) a Bankruptcy Event with respect to a Parent of any Lender shall occur following the date hereof and for so long as such event shall continue or (ii) the Swingline Lender or the Issuing Bank has a good faith belief that any Lender has defaulted in fulfilling its obligations under one or more other agreements in which such Lender commits to extend credit, the Swingline Lender shall not be required to fund any Swingline Loan and the Issuing Bank shall not be required to issue, amend or increase any Letter of Credit, unless the Swingline Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, shall have entered into arrangements with the Borrowers or such Lender, satisfactory to the Swingline Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, to defease any risk to it in respect of such Lender hereunder.
In the event that the Administrative Agent, the U.S. Borrower, the Swingline Lender and the Issuing Bank each agrees that a Defaulting Lender has adequately remedied all matters that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, then the Swingline Exposure and LC Exposure of the Lenders shall be readjusted to reflect the inclusion of such Lender's Commitment and on such date such Lender shall purchase at par such of the Loans of the other Lenders (other than Swingline Loans) as the Administrative Agent shall determine may be necessary in order for such Lender to hold such Loans in accordance with its Applicable Percentage.
In order to induce the Lenders and the Administrative Agent to enter into this Agreement, each Borrower represents and warrants to each Lender and the Administrative Agent, that the following statements are true, correct and complete:

(a) Each of the U.S. Borrower and its Subsidiaries has good title to, or valid leasehold interests in, all its real and personal property material to its business, except where such failure to have good title or valid leasehold interests could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. None of the assets of the U.S. Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any Lien other than Liens permitted under Section 6.02.
Properties.
(b) Each of the U.S. Borrower and its Subsidiaries owns, or is licensed to use, all trademarks, tradenames, copyrights, patents and other intellectual property material to its business, and the use thereof by the U.S. Borrower and its Subsidiaries does not infringe upon the rights of any other Person, except for any such infringements that, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.
SECTION 3.06. (a) There are no actions, suits or proceedings by or before any arbitrator or Governmental Authority pending against or, to the knowledge of the U.S. Borrower, threatened against or affecting the U.S. Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries (i) as to which there is a reasonable possibility of an adverse determination and that, if adversely determined, could reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to result in a Material Adverse Effect (other than the Disclosed Matters and as set forth in the SEC Documents) or (ii) that involve this Agreement or the Transactions.
Litigation and Environmental Matters.
 
(b) Except as set forth in the SEC Documents and the Disclosed Matters and except with respect to any other matters that, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, neither the U.S. Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries (i) has failed to comply with any Environmental Law or to obtain, maintain or comply with any permit, license or other approval required under any Environmental Law, (ii) has become subject to any Environmental Liability, (iii) has received notice of any claim with respect to any Environmental Liability or (iv) knows of any basis for any Environmental Liability.

The excess of the present value of all benefit liabilities under each Plan of the U.S. Borrower, the Subsidiaries and the ERISA Affiliates (based on those assumptions used to fund such Plan), as of the last annual valuation date applicable thereto for which a valuation is available, over the value of the assets of such Plan could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, and the excess of the present value of all benefit liabilities of all underfunded Plans (based on those assumptions used to fund each such Plan) as of the last annual valuation dates applicable thereto for which valuations are available, over the value of the assets of all such underfunded Plans could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

After applying the proceeds of each Advance, Margin Stock will not constitute more than 25% of the value of the assets (either of any Borrower alone or of the U.S. Borrower and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis) that are subject to any provisions of this Agreement that may cause the Advances to be deemed secured, directly or indirectly, by Margin Stock.
Use of Advances

Conversion of Currencies
(b) The obligations of each Borrower in respect of any sum due to any party hereto or any holder of the obligations owing hereunder (the "Applicable Creditor") shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency (the "Judgment Currency") other than the currency in which such sum is stated to be due hereunder (the "Agreement Currency"), be discharged only to the extent that, on the Business Day following receipt by the Applicable Creditor of any sum adjudged to be so due in the Judgment Currency, the Applicable Creditor may in accordance with normal banking procedures in the relevant jurisdiction purchase the Agreement Currency with the Judgment Currency; if the amount of the Agreement Currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to the Applicable Creditor in the Agreement Currency, such Borrower agrees, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify the Applicable Creditor against such loss.

SECTION 10.01. . (a) On the CAM Exchange Date, (i) the Commitments and the Ancillary Commitments shall automatically and without further act be terminated as provided in Article VII, (ii) the principal amount of each Loan and LC Disbursement denominated in a Foreign Currency shall, automatically and with no further action required, be converted into the Dollar Equivalent, determined using the Exchange Rates calculated as of the CAM Exchange Date, of such amount and on and after such date all amounts accruing and owed to any Lender in respect of such Obligations shall accrue and be payable in Dollars at the rates otherwise applicable hereunder and (iii) each Lender shall automatically and without further act (and without regard to the provisions of Section 9.04) immediately be deemed to have acquired participations in the Swingline Loans, Revolving Loans, Ancillary Loans and Letters of Credit (including each Reserve Account established pursuant to Section 10.02 below) in an amount equal to such Lender's CAM Percentage. Each Lender shall make payments to the Applicable Agent for such participations, and the Applicable Agent shall distribute such payments to the appropriate Lender, in such manner and pursuant to such procedures determined by the Administrative Agent. Each Lender and each Borrower hereby consents and agrees to the CAM Exchange, and each Lender agrees that the CAM Exchange shall be binding upon its successors and assigns and any person that acquires a participation in its interests in any Advance. Each Borrower agrees from time to time to execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent all such promissory notes and other instruments and documents as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably request to evidence and confirm
Implementation of CAM
 
the respective interests of the Lenders after giving effect to the CAM Exchange, and each Lender agrees to surrender any promissory notes originally received by it in connection with its Loans hereunder to the Administrative Agent against delivery of any promissory notes evidencing its interests in the Loans and Ancillary Loans so executed and delivered; provided, however, that the failure of any Borrower to execute or deliver or of any Lender to accept any such promissory note, instrument or document shall not affect the validity or effectiveness of the CAM Exchange.
(b) As a result of the CAM Exchange, upon and after the CAM Exchange Date, each payment received by the Applicable Agent pursuant to any Loan Document in respect of the Revolving Credit Exposures and the Ancillary Facility Exposures shall be distributed to the Lenders pro rata in accordance with their respective CAM Percentages.

SECTION 10.02. . (a) In the event that on the CAM Exchange Date any Letter of Credit shall be outstanding and undrawn in whole or in part, or any LC Disbursement shall not have been reimbursed either by the U.S. Borrower or with the proceeds of a Borrowing, each Lender shall promptly pay over to the Administrative Agent, in immediately available funds, an amount equal to such Lender's CAM Percentage of such undrawn face amount or (to the extent it has not already done so) such unreimbursed drawing, as applicable, together with interest thereon from the CAM Exchange Date to the date on which such amount shall be paid to the Administrative Agent at the rate that would be applicable at the time to an ABR Revolving Loan in a principal amount equal to such undrawn face amount or unreimbursed drawing, as applicable. The Administrative Agent shall establish a separate account (each, a "Reserve Account") or accounts for each Lender for the amounts received with respect to each such Letter of Credit pursuant to the preceding sentence. The Administrative Agent shall deposit in each Lender's Reserve Account such Lender's CAM Percentage of the amounts received from the Lenders as provided above. The Administrative Agent shall have sole dominion and control over each Reserve Account, and the amounts deposited in each Reserve Account shall be held in such Reserve Account until withdrawn as provided in paragraph (b), (c), (d) or (e) below. The Administrative Agent shall maintain records enabling it to determine the amounts paid over to it and deposited in the Reserve Accounts in respect of each Letter of Credit and the amounts on deposit in respect of each Letter of Credit attributable to each Lender's CAM Percentage. The amounts held in each Lender's Reserve Account shall be held as a reserve against the LC Exposures, shall be the property of such Lender, shall not constitute Loans to or give rise to any claim of or against any Borrower and shall not give rise to any obligation on the part of the U.S. Borrower to pay interest to such Lender, it being agreed that the reimbursement obligations in respect of Letters of Credit shall arise only at such times as drawings are made thereunder, as provided in Section 2.05.
Letters of Credit
(b) In the event that after the CAM Exchange Date any drawing shall be made in respect of a Letter of Credit, the Administrative Agent shall, at the request of the applicable Issuing Bank withdraw from the Reserve Account of each Lender any amounts, up to the amount of such Lender's CAM Percentage of such drawing deposited in respect of such Letter of Credit and remaining on deposit and deliver such amounts to such Issuing Bank in satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of the Lenders under Section 2.05(d) (but not of the U.S. Borrower under Section 2.05(e)). In the event that any Lender shall default on its obligation to pay over any amount to the Administrative Agent as provided in this Section 10.02, the applicable Issuing Bank shall have a claim against such Lender to the same extent as if such Lender had defaulted on its obligations under Section 2.05(d), but shall have no claim against any other Lender in respect of such defaulted amount, notwithstanding the exchange of interests in the applicable Borrower's reimbursement obligations pursuant to Section 10.01. Each other Lender shall have a claim against such defaulting Lender for any damages sustained by it as a result of such default, including, in the event that such Letter of Credit shall expire undrawn, its CAM Percentage of the defaulted amount.
 
(c) In the event that after the CAM Exchange Date any Letter of Credit shall expire undrawn, the Administrative Agent shall withdraw from the Reserve Account of each Lender the amount remaining on deposit therein in respect of such Letter of Credit and distribute such amount to such Lender.
(d) With the prior written approval of the Administrative Agent (not to be unreasonably withheld), any Lender may withdraw the amount held in its Reserve Account in respect of the undrawn amount of any Letter of Credit. Any Lender making such a withdrawal shall be unconditionally obligated, in the event there shall subsequently be a drawing under such Letter of Credit, to pay over to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Issuing Bank, on demand, its CAM Percentage of such drawing.
(e) Pending the withdrawal by any Lender of any amounts from its Reserve Account as contemplated by the above paragraphs, the Administrative Agent will, at the direction of such Lender and subject to such rules as the Administrative Agent may prescribe for the avoidance of inconvenience, invest such amounts in Permitted Investments. Each Lender that has not withdrawn its amounts in its Reserve Account as provided in paragraph (d) above shall have the right, at intervals reasonably specified by the Administrative Agent, to withdraw the earnings on investments so made by the Administrative Agent with amounts in its Reserve Account and to retain such earnings for its own account.
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be duly executed by their respective authorized officers as of the day and year first above written.

Exhibit F  Mandatory Cost Rate
1. The Mandatory Cost Rate (to the extent applicable) is an addition to the interest rate to compensate Lenders for the cost of compliance with (a) the requirements of the Bank of England and/or the Financial Services Authority (or, in either case, any other authority which replaces all or any of its functions) or (b) the requirements of the European Central Bank.
2. On the first day of each Interest Period (or as soon as possible thereafter) the Administrative Agent shall calculate, as a percentage rate, a rate (the "Associated Costs Rate") for each Lender, in accordance with the paragraphs set out below. The Mandatory Cost Rate will be calculated by the Administrative Agent as a weighted average of the Lenders' Associated Costs Rates (weighted in proportion to the percentage participation of each Lender in the relevant Loan) and will be expressed as a percentage rate per annum. The Administrative Agent will, at the request of the applicable Borrower, deliver to such Borrower a statement setting forth the calculation of Mandatory Cost Rate.
3. The Associated Costs Rate for any Lender lending from a Facility Office in a Participating Member State will be the percentage notified by that Lender to the Administrative Agent. This percentage will be certified by that Lender in its notice to the Administrative Agent to be its reasonable determination of the cost (expressed as a percentage of that Lender's participation in all Loans made from that Facility Office) of complying with the minimum reserve requirements of the European Central Bank in respect of loans made from that Facility Office.
4. The Associated Costs Rate for any Lender lending from a Facility Office in the United Kingdom will be calculated by the Administrative Agent as follows:
 
+ E  0.01 percent per annum
AB + C(B  D) 
100  (A + C)
 
E x 0.01
per cent. per annum.
300
Where:
A is the percentage of Eligible Liabilities (assuming these to be in excess of any stated minimum) which that Lender is from time to time required to maintain as an interest free cash ratio deposit with the Bank of England to comply with cash ratio requirements.
B is the percentage rate of interest (excluding the Applicable Margin and the Mandatory Cost Rate and, if the Loan is an Unpaid Sum, the additional rate of interest specified in Section 2.12(d)) payable for the relevant Interest Period on the Loan.
C is the percentage (if any) of Eligible Liabilities which that Lender is required from time to time to maintain as interest bearing Special Deposits with the Bank of England.
D is the percentage rate per annum payable by the Bank of England to the Administrative Agent on interest bearing Special Deposits.
E is designed to compensate Lenders for amounts payable under the Fees Rules and is calculated by the Administrative Agent as being the average of the most recent rates of charge supplied by the Reference Banks to the Administrative Agent pursuant to paragraph 7 below and expressed in pounds per 1,000,000.
5. For the purposes of this Exhibit:
(a) "Eligible Liabilities" and "Special Deposits" have the meanings given to them from time to time under or pursuant to the Bank of England Act 1998 or (as may be appropriate) by the Bank of England;
(b) "Facility Office" means the office or offices notified by a Lender to the Administrative Agent in writing on or before the date it becomes a Lender (or, following that date, by not less than five Business Days' written notice) as the office or offices through which it will perform its obligations under this Agreement.
(c) "Fees Rules" means the rules on periodic fees contained in the FSA Supervision Manual or such other law or regulation as may be in force from time to time in respect of the payment of fees for the acceptance of deposits;
(d) "Fee Tariffs" means the fee tariffs specified in the Fees Rules under the activity group A.1 Deposit acceptors (ignoring any minimum fee or zero rated fee required pursuant to the Fees Rules but taking into account any applicable discount rate);
(e) "Participating Member State" means any member state of the European Union that adopts or has adopted the euro as its lawful currency in accordance with legislation of the European Union relating to economic and monetary union.
(f) "Reference Banks" means, in relation to Mandatory Cost Rate, the principal London offices of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.
(g) "Tariff Base" has the meaning given to it in, and will be calculated in accordance with, the Fees Rules.
(h) "Unpaid Sum" means any sum due and payable but unpaid by the applicable Borrower under the Loan Documents.
6. In application of the above formulae, A, B, C and D will be included in the formulae as percentages (i.e. 5 per cent. will be included in the formula as 5 and not as 0.05). A negative result obtained by subtracting D from B shall be taken as zero. The resulting figures shall be rounded to four decimal places.
7. If requested by the Administrative Agent, each Reference Bank shall, as soon as practicable after publication by the Financial Services Authority, supply to the Administrative Agent, the rate of charge payable by that Reference Bank to the Financial Services Authority pursuant to the Fees Rules in respect
 
of the relevant financial year of the Financial Services Authority (calculated for this purpose by that Reference Bank as being the average of the Fee Tariffs applicable to that Reference Bank for that financial year) and expressed in pounds per 1,000,000 of the Tariff Base of that Reference Bank.
8. Each Lender shall supply any information required by the Administrative Agent for the purpose of calculating its Associated Costs Rate. In particular, but without limitation, each Lender shall supply the following information on or prior to the date on which it becomes a Lender:
(a) the jurisdiction of its Facility Office; and
(b) any other information that the Administrative Agent may reasonably require for such purpose.
Each Lender shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent of any change to the information provided by it pursuant to this paragraph.
9. The percentages of each Lender for the purpose of A and C above and the rates of charge of each Reference Bank for the purpose of E above shall be determined by the Administrative Agent based upon the information supplied to it pursuant to paragraphs 7 and 8 above and on the assumption that, unless a Lender notifies the Administrative Agent to the contrary, each Lender's obligations in relation to cash ratio deposits and Special Deposits are the same as those of a typical bank from its jurisdiction of incorporation with a Facility Office in the same jurisdiction as its Facility Office.
10. The Administrative Agent shall have no liability to any person if such determination results in an Associated Costs Rate which over or under compensates any Lender and shall be entitled to assume that the information provided by any Lender or Reference Bank pursuant to paragraphs 3, 7 and 8 above is true and correct in all respects.
11. The Administrative Agent shall distribute the additional amounts received as a result of the Mandatory Cost Rate to the Lenders on the basis of the Associated Costs Rate for each Lender based on the information provided by each Lender and each Reference Bank, as applicable, pursuant to paragraphs 3, 7 and 8 above.
12. Any determination by the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Exhibit in relation to a formula, the Mandatory Cost Rate, an Associated Costs Rate or any amount payable to a Lender shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive and binding on all parties hereto.
13. The Administrative Agent may from time to time, after consultation with the U.S. Borrower and the relevant Lenders, determine and notify to all parties hereto any amendments which are required to be made to this Exhibit F in order to comply with any change in law, regulation or any requirements from time to time imposed by the Bank of England, the Financial Services Authority or the European Central Bank (or, in any case, any other authority which replaces all or any of its functions) and any such determination shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive and binding on all parties hereto.
 
Exhibit G-1
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative
Agent, and the Lenders party to the
Credit Agreement referred to below
Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have acted as counsel for Perrigo Company, a Michigan corporation (the "") and the Domestic Subsidiaries that are Guarantors (collectively, with the U.S. Borrower, the "") in connection with the Credit Agreement dated as of the date hereof (the "") among the U.S. Borrower, the Foreign Subsidiary Borrowers who are from time to time parties to the Credit Agreement, the Lenders who are parties to the Credit Agreement, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent, Bank of America, N.A., and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Syndication Agents, and HSBC Bank USA, National Association, Fifth Third Bank and Bank Leumi USA, as Documentation Agents. This opinion is being rendered to you at the request of the U.S. Borrower pursuant to Section 4.01(b) of the Credit Agreement.
U.S. Borrower
Obligors
Credit Agreement
Each capitalized term that is used but not defined in this opinion has the meaning that the Credit Agreement gives it.
We have examined the following documents, each of which is dated the same date as this opinion unless otherwise indicated:
 
 
 
This letter refers to the documents listed above as the "."
Credit Documents
We have also examined the following:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
We have assumed (1) the genuineness of all signatures and of all Credit Documents that have been submitted to us as originals, (2) that each copy that has been submitted to us conforms to the original, (3) the legal capacity of each natural Person and (4) as to each Credit Document to be entered into by a Person or Persons other than an Obligor, that each such Person that has executed the document had the power to enter into and perform its obligations under it and that the document has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by, and is binding on and enforceable against, that Person.
Any reference in this opinion to our knowledge means the actual knowledge of the attorney who has signed this opinion and each attorney in this firm who has been actively involved in reviewing the Credit Documents or in preparing this opinion, and those attorneys have not made any investigation of or inquiry as to those factual matters with respect to which this opinion states that we do or do not have knowledge, except as set forth in this letter.
 
Subject to the assumptions, qualifications and limitations in this letter, we express the following opinions:
1. Each Obligor, other than PBM Nutritionals, LLC (a) is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its state of incorporation, and (b) has all requisite power and authority to conduct business and own properties. PBM Nutritionals, LLC (a) is a limited liability company validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its state of organization, and (b) has all requisite company power and authority to conduct business and own properties.
2. The Credit Documents (a) have been duly authorized by proper corporate or limited liability company action, as appropriate, on the part of each Obligor and (b) when executed and delivered by each Obligor, will constitute the valid and binding obligations of each Obligor, enforceable against each of them in accordance with their respective terms.
3. The execution, delivery, and performance by each Obligor of the Credit Documents to which it is a party and compliance with their terms and provisions do not and will not (a) violate any provision of the certificate of incorporation, articles of incorporation, certification of formation, bylaws or limited liability company agreement of such Obligor, (b) violate any applicable law, rule, or regulation, (c) violate any order, writ, injunction, or decree of any Michigan or federal Governmental Authority or arbitral award that applies to such Obligor and of which we have knowledge, or (d) except as could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, result in a breach of, constitute a default under, require any consent under, or result in the acceleration or require prepayment of any indebtedness pursuant to the terms of any agreement or instrument to which such Obligor is a party or by which it is bound and of which we have knowledge, or result in the creation or imposition of any Lien or other encumbrance upon any property of such Obligor pursuant to the terms of any such agreement or instrument.
4. Except as set forth in the SEC Documents and except for the Disclosed Matters, we do not know of any action, suit, or proceeding pending against or overtly threatened against or affecting, any Obligor before any arbitrator or Governmental Authority as to which we believe that an adverse decision would have a Material Adverse Effect or that in any manner draws into question the validity or enforceability of the Credit Documents.
5. No authorization, consent, or approval of, or filing or registration with, any Michigan or federal Governmental Authority is required, under Michigan or federal law, for the execution, delivery, or performance by each Obligor of the Credit Documents or for the validity or enforceability of the Credit Documents against each Obligor.
6. None of the Obligors is (a) an "investment company" as defined in, or subject to regulation under, the Investment Company Act of 1940 or (b) a "holding company" as defined in, or subject to regulation under, the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935.
7. Assuming that the Borrowers will comply with the provisions of the Credit Agreement relating to the use of proceeds, the making of Advances under the Credit Agreement will not violate Regulations U and X of the Board.
8. To the extent, if any, that Michigan law applies, the Pledge Agreement is sufficient to create in favor of the Administrative Agent a valid security interest in the partnership interests of Perrigo UK Finco Limited Partnership, a limited partnership organized in the United Kingdom that are described in the Pledge Agreement ("").
Pledged Interests
9. To the extent that the collateral described in the attached form of UCC financing statement consists of personal property in which a security interest may be perfected by filing a financing statement under the Michigan Uniform Commercial Code (""), that security interest will be perfected by filing the attached financing statement in the office of the Delaware Secretary of State.
Article 9 Filing Collateral
 
Our opinions are subject to the following assumptions, limitations and qualifications:
A. Our opinions are subject to (1) the effect of generally applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer or conveyance, reorganization, arrangement, moratorium and other similar laws and (2) limitations that are imposed by the effect of general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is considered in proceedings at law or in equity).
B. Certain provisions in the Credit Documents are not or may not be enforceable under Michigan law. In our opinion, however, this does not render any Credit Document invalid as a whole, and the Administrative Agent may exercise remedies under them that would normally be available to creditors and secured parties under Michigan law.
C. We do not express any opinion as to (including, without limitation, as to the effect or applicability of) any laws, statutes, rules or regulations other than the laws, statutes, rules and regulations of the state of Michigan (excluding municipal and other local ordinances, codes and regulations), the federal laws of the United States, the Delaware General Corporation Law, the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act, and the Florida Business Corporation Act (as limited by the last sentence of this Paragraph). We note that each Credit Document provides that it is to be governed by Michigan law. We do not express any opinion as to the validity or enforceability of these choice-of-law provisions. Our opinions with respect to matters governed by the Florida Business Corporation Act are limited to our reading of the text of such statute and the corporate documents and certificates relating to Perrigo Florida, Inc. identified in this letter, without regard to any applicable case law or regulations interpreting the Florida Business Corporation Act.
D. Our opinions are based entirely upon, and are limited to, our knowledge of Michigan law as it applies generally to transactions of the types contemplated by the Credit Documents when entered into by ordinary business corporations, without regard to the activities in which they are engaged. For example, we do not express any opinion as to laws or regulations that require a business entity to obtain a license or approval because of the specific nature of its business or activities in which it is engaged, such as insurance, banking, construction, oil and gas, or other regulated activities or industries.
E. We assume that the proceeds of the Loans will be used by the Borrowers only for business purposes.
F. It is unclear under Michigan law whether the Administrative Agent, as agent under the Collateral Documents, has the power in its own name, as agent, without naming all the Lenders, in any applicable legal proceeding to exercise remedies under the Collateral Documents for the realization upon the Collateral, other than enforcement of the Pledge Agreement under Article 9 of the Michigan Uniform Commercial Code.
G. We have assumed that no Lender is a broker or a dealer as those terms are defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. We have also assumed that no Agent or Lender is a "creditor" within the meaning of Regulation T of the Board.
H. We have assumed that the factual statements (and not the legal conclusions) contained in the Officer's Certificate and the Secretary's Certificates are true and correct. We have assumed that the statements contained in the certificates issued by the Michigan Department, Delaware Secretary of State and Florida Secretary of State that are referred to above (collectively, the "") are true and correct as of the date of this opinion letter.
State Certificates
 
I. Our opinions in (a) are based exclusively upon the State Certificates.
Paragraph 1
J. We assume that either (1) no Lender is a savings and loan association, a savings association or a savings bank chartered under federal law or under the law of a jurisdiction other than Michigan ("") or (2) any Lender that is a Foreign Savings Institution is not required to obtain a certificate of authority to transact business in Michigan under the Michigan Savings and Loan Act of 1980.
Foreign Savings Institution
K. Except as expressly stated in , we do not express any opinion as to the status of title to any personal property or as to the priority of any security interest that any Credit Document grants.
Paragraph 8
L. We have assumed that Holdings II owns the Pledged Interests.
M. We are informed that Perrigo UK Finco Limited Partnership ("") is a limited partnership organized in the United Kingdom. Our opinion in assumes that United Kingdom law is identical to the laws of the State of Michigan. We do not express any opinion as to whether Michigan law, United Kingdom law or other law governs the perfection, effect of perfection or non-perfection or priority of the security interest in the Pledged Interests that the Pledge Agreement grants (""). We do not give any opinion as to any impact that United Kingdom law or any applicable treaty may have upon the perfection, the effect of perfection or non-perfection or the priority of the Pledge.
UK Finco
Paragraph 8
Pledge
N. We do not express any opinion on the extent to which any personal property consists of Article 9 Collateral. We do not express any opinion on continuation of perfection of any security interest that any Credit Document grants.
Our opinions are matters of professional judgment and are not a guaranty of results. This opinion is furnished solely and exclusively for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and their participants, assignees and other transferees in connection with the Credit Documents and may not be relied upon by any other Person or for any other purpose without our prior written consent. The opinions that we express above are as of the date of this opinion only, and we do not assume any obligation to update or supplement those opinions to reflect any fact or circumstance that in the future comes to our attention or any change in law that in the future occurs or becomes effective. This opinion letter is limited to the matters that are set forth in it, and no opinions are intended to be implied or may be inferred beyond those that are expressly stated above.

Jurisdiction
2. The Foreign Subsidiary Borrower has the power and authority, and the legal right, to make, deliver and perform its obligations under the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which it is a party and to borrow under the Credit Agreement. The Foreign Subsidiary Borrower has taken all necessary corporate action to authorize the performance of its obligations under the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which it is a party and to authorize the execution, delivery and performance of the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which it is a party.
3. Except for consents, authorizations, approvals, notices and filings described on an attached schedule, all of which have been obtained, made or waived and are in full force and effect, no consent or authorization of, approval by, notice to, filing with or other act by or in respect of, any governmental authority is required in connection with the borrowings by the Foreign Subsidiary Borrower under the Credit Agreement or with the execution, delivery, performance, validity or enforceability of the Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document.

The performance by the Agents and the Lenders or any of them of any action required or permitted under the Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document to which it is a party will not violate any law or regulation, or be contrary to the public policy, of the Jurisdiction.
12. If any judgment of a competent court outside the Jurisdiction were rendered against any Obligor in connection with any action arising out of or relating to the Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document to which it is a party, such judgment would be recognized and could be sued upon in the courts of the Jurisdiction, and such courts could grant a judgment which would be enforceable against the Foreign Subsidiary Borrower in the Jurisdiction without any retrial unless it is shown that (a) the foreign court did not have jurisdiction in accordance with its jurisdictional rules, (b) the party against whom the
 
judgment of such foreign court was obtained had no notice of the proceedings or (c) the judgment of such foreign court was obtained through collusion or fraud or was based upon clear mistake of fact or law.
