Item 5. Other Events. A jury in an action in Ohio State Court has awarded $11.7 million in compensatory damages and $250 million in punitive damages against Prudential Securities Incorporated, a wholly owned subsidiary of Prudential Financial, Inc. The awards were made in connection with the class action case of Dale Burns et al. vs. Prudential Securities Inc. and Jeffrey Pickett, in which a former Prudential Securities financial advisor was alleged to have transferred, without authorization, his clients' equity mutual funds into fixed income funds in October 1998. Prudential believes the damages were not legally justified, and it plans to ask the court to set them aside. If that is unsuccessful, Prudential intends to appeal the award. -2-
