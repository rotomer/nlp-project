Item 5.    Other Events.
 
The following events with respect to the case were inadvertently omitted from page 61 of the Registrant's recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K:
Azar, et al. v. Prudential Insurance
 
The New Mexico Court of Appeals issued a decision on January 17, 2003 reversing the finding of summary judgment in favor of plaintiffs and affirming the denial of the Prudential Insurance's motion to dismiss all claims on federal pre-emption grounds. It remanded the case to the trial court to determine if the alleged nondisclosures were material to the plaintiffs.
 
As noted in the Form 10-K both Prudential Insurance and plaintiffs filed petitions for writ of certiorari to the New Mexico Supreme Court in connection with these decisions, both of which have been denied.
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
