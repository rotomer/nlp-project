Item 9. Regulation FD Disclosure.
 
On November 14, 2003, the Company completed and filed its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2003, including its financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2003 and 2002 (the "financial statements"). Net income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2003, reported in those financial statements was $297 million (44 cents per Common Share) and $689 million ($1.07 per Common Share), respectively. The Company previously reported net income of $307 million (46 cents per Common Share) and $699 million ($1.09 per Common Share), for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2003, respectively, in its report on Form 8-K dated November 4, 2003. The adjustment reflects a subsequent addition of $14 million to policyholders' benefits, pertaining to a single claim from September, associated with the Company's individual life and annuities segment that was identified during the October closing process but prior to filing the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2003.
