Other Events and Regulation FD Disclosure.
 
On November 17, 2003, Prudential Financial, Inc. (the "Company") announced that it had entered into a definitive Stock Purchase and Asset Transfer Agreement, dated as of November 17, 2003 (the "Stock Purchase Agreement"), with CIGNA Corporation ("CIGNA") and certain of its affiliates, pursuant to which the Company will acquire CIGNA's retirement business. Pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, the transaction is structured as an acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of CIGNA Life Insurance Company, a life insurance company domiciled in the State of Connecticut ("CIGNA Life"), Global Portfolio Strategies, Inc., a registered investment adviser, and CIGNA Financial Services, Inc., a registered broker dealer. In addition, CIGNA's thrift subsidiary, CIGNA Bank & Trust Company, FSB, will merge into the Company's thrift subsidiary, The Prudential Savings Bank, FSB. The total consideration payable in the transaction is a cash purchase price of $2.1 billion, subject to certain adjustments.
 
Prior to the acquisition by the Company of CIGNA Life, CIGNA and its affiliates will undertake a reorganization of its retirement business, which will include transferring to CIGNA Life certain assets and liabilities related to the business and approximately $840 million of surplus related to the business.
 
In connection with the Stock Purchase Agreement, CIGNA Life and Connecticut General Life Insurance Company, a life insurance company domiciled in the State of Connecticut and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of CIGNA ("CGLIC"), will enter into certain coinsurance and modified coinsurance arrangements in respect of the insurance liabilities related to the business. The assets underlying the general account insurance liabilities will be deposited into trust accounts to secure each party's obligations under these arrangements. Following the closing of the transaction, the parties will ask CGLIC's customers to agree to enter into similar arrangements with CIGNA Life so that CIGNA Life can assume direct responsibility for the contracts from CGLIC.
 
The transaction is subject to various closing conditions, including, among others, state insurance regulatory approvals, expiration of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act and other regulatory approvals.

 Prudential Financial, Inc. (NYSE: PRU) announced today that the company has signed a definitive agreement to acquire the retirement business of CIGNA Corp. (NYSE: CI) for $2.1 billion in cash.

It will also double Prudential's defined contribution recordkeeping assets to $56 billion, based on account values, and its participant base to two million participants. CIGNA will bring additional defined benefit and defined contribution products and services to Prudential's total retirement capabilities.
"A strong presence in the retirement market is essential for success in asset gathering and asset management. This transaction with CIGNA builds on our presence in the retirement market by adding significant scale and capabilities, while offering attractive returns to shareholders. This is an excellent fit that will strengthen a business we want to grow," said Arthur Ryan, chairman and CEO of Prudential Financial, Inc.
The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2004 and be accretive to the earnings per share of Prudential in that year. Both firms will continue operating under their current names until the closing, at which time CIGNA's retirement business will become a part of Prudential's Investment Division.

"We will combine the best from both companies to become a premier retirement services provider in the markets we choose to serve," said John Strangfeld, vice chairman of Prudential Financial, Inc.
Strangfeld said John Y. Kim, who has served as president of CIGNA Retirement & Investment Services since February 2002, will serve as president of the combined retirement business. Scott Sleyster, who currently heads Prudential Retirement, will lead the combined full-service defined contribution business, defined benefit administration, and total retirement outsourcing (combined defined contribution and defined benefit administration), and report to John Kim.
"CIGNA clearly shares our client-focused approach and complements our retirement business extremely well, particularly with its strong middle-market focus, its direct distribution capabilities, and its total retirement outsourcing and defined benefit administration capabilities. Together, we can offer a broader range of services to all our customers," Strangfeld added.
The transaction does not include CIGNA Investment Management, its third-party asset management unit, Times Square Capital Management Inc., or its corporate life insurance operations.
CIGNA's retirement business is headquartered in Hartford, CT. As of September 30, 2003, it had $50 billion in retirement account value, approximately 1.1 million defined contribution plan participants, and about 700,000 defined benefit annuitants and participants. CIGNA's retirement strategy is to provide a total retirement outsourcing solution, offering integrated defined contribution, defined benefit, and non-qualified plan administration for plan providers. The business primarily focuses on the corporate and Taft-Hartley markets, targeting plan sponsors that have 1,000 to 10,000 participants and assets of $20 million to $200 million.
Prudential Retirement, a business of Prudential Financial, delivers retirement plan solutions for public, private, and non-profit organizations.

Non  GAAP Measure
In managing our businesses, we use a non-GAAP measure we call "adjusted operating income" to measure the performance of our Financial Services Businesses.  Our goals for return on equity (ROE), after-tax earnings and earnings per share (EPS) contributions are based on after-tax adjusted operating income and attributed equity of our Financial Services Businesses.  Adjusted operating income, which is not measured in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), excludes net realized investment gains (losses).  A significant element of realized losses is impairments and losses from sales of credit-impaired securities, the timing of which depends largely on market credit cycles and can vary considerably across periods.  The timing of other sales that would result in gains or losses is largely subject to our discretion and influenced by market opportunities.  The fluctuating effects of these transactions could distort trends in the underlying profitability of our businesses.  Adjusted operating income also excludes the results of divested businesses, which are not relevant to our ongoing operations, and certain other items, described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Because we do not predict future realized investment gains (losses), we cannot provide measures of our goals based on income from continuing operations of the Financial Services Businesses, which is the GAAP measure most comparable to adjusted operating income.
For additional information about adjusted operating income, the comparable GAAP measure and a reconciliation between the two, please refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2003 on the Investor Relations Web site at http://www.investor.prudential.com.
