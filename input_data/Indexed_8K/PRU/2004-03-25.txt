The terms of the Notes are described in the Prospectus referred to below.
 
Subject to the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement, the Company hereby (1) appoints each of you as agent of the Company (each, an "Agent" and together, the "Agents") for the purpose of soliciting offers to purchase Notes and each of you hereby agrees to use your reasonable best efforts to solicit offers to purchase Notes upon terms acceptable to the Company at such times and in such amounts as the Company shall from time to time specify and in accordance with the terms hereof, and after consultation with Incapital LLC (the "Purchasing Agent") and (2) agrees that whenever the Company determines to sell Notes pursuant to this Agreement, such Notes shall be sold pursuant to a Terms Agreement (as defined herein) relating to such sale in accordance with the provisions of Section IV hereof between the Company and the Purchasing Agent, with the Purchasing Agent purchasing such Notes as principal for resale to other Agents or dealers (the "Selected Dealers"), each of whom will purchase as principal. The Company reserves the right to enter into agreements substantially similar hereto with other agents.
 
 
The Company has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") a registration statement (File Nos. 333-104444, 333-104444-01 and 333-104444-02) (including the exhibits thereto and as amended at the time such registration statement became effective, the "Registration Statement") that included a base prospectus which sets forth the general terms of the Notes (in the form in which it appears in the Registration Statement and including any documents incorporated therein by reference, the "Basic Prospectus"). Under the Registration Statement, the Notes may be offered from time to time in accordance with Rule 415 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"). The Registration Statement has been declared effective by the Commission, and the Indenture has been qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the "Trust Indenture Act"). The Basic Prospectus and prospectus supplement, dated as of the date hereof, relating to the Notes, filed pursuant to Rule 424 under the Securities Act, including all documents incorporated therein by reference, as from time to time amended or supplemented, including any Pricing Supplement (as defined herein), are referred to herein as the "Prospectus."

(7) No authorization, decree, approval, consent, order, registration or qualification of or with any court or governmental authority, agency or official is required to be obtained by the Company in connection with the execution, delivery or performance by the Company of this Agreement, the Indenture, any applicable Terms Agreement or the Notes, or in connection with the offering, issuance or sale of the Notes or the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated therein, except such as have been obtained and made under the Securities Act and the Trust Indenture Act and such as may be required under state securities or "Blue Sky" laws (as to which such counsel need express no opinion).
 
(8) The execution and delivery of this Agreement, any applicable Terms Agreement, the Indenture and the Notes, and the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated herein and therein, and the compliance by the Company with its obligations hereunder and thereunder, will not result in a breach of, or default under, any material contract, indenture, mortgage, loan agreement, note, lease or other material agreement or instrument known to such counsel (after due inquiry and investigation) to which the Company is a party or by which it may be bound or to which any of the property or assets of the Company is subject, nor will such action result in any violation of the provisions of the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws of the Company or any New York, New Jersey or United States federal statute or law or any order, rule or regulation of any court or insurance regulatory agency or other governmental agency or body having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its properties, except to the extent that such breach, default or violation would not have individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the business, management, financial position, shareholders' equity or results of operations (in each case considered on a U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") basis) of the Company and its subsidiaries, considered as a whole (a "Material Adverse Effect"); for purposes of this opinion (8), such counsel need not express any opinion with respect to federal and state securities laws, other antifraud laws and fraudulent transfer laws.
provided, however, that,
 
(9) (i) To such counsel's knowledge, each of the Company, and, to the extent that each of the following entities is a "subsidiary" of the Company within the meaning of Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X under the Securities Act, each of Prudential Holdings, LLC, Pruco Life Insurance Company and Prudential Asset Management Holding Company, is registered in all capacities with each federal, state, local or other governmental authority and is registered with, a member of, or a participant in, each self-regulatory organization, in each case, as is necessary to conduct its business as described in or contemplated by the Prospectus, except as set forth in the Prospectus and except where failure to be so registered would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect; (ii) to such counsel's knowledge, all such registrations and memberships are in full force and effect and neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has received any notice of any event, inquiry, investigation or proceeding that would reasonably be expected to result in the suspension, revocation or limitation of any such registrations or memberships, except as set forth in the Prospectus and except as would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect; and (iii) to such counsel's knowledge, each of the Company and its subsidiaries is in compliance with all applicable laws, rules, regulations, orders, By-laws and similar requirements in connection with such registrations or memberships, as the case may be, except as set forth in the Prospectus and except as would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.
 
(10) The statements set forth under the heading "Description of the Notes" in the Prospectus, insofar as such statements purport to summarize certain provisions of the Notes and the Indenture, provide a fair summary of such provisions.
 
In rendering such opinion, such counsel may state that such counsel expresses no opinion as to the laws of any jurisdiction other than the federal laws of the United States and the laws of the States of New Jersey and New York; that, insofar as such opinion involves factual matters, such counsel has relied upon certificates of officers of the Company and its subsidiaries and certificates of public officials and other sources believed by such counsel to be responsible; and that such counsel has assumed that the Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Trustee, that the Notes conform to the form thereof examined by such counsel (or members of the Company's legal department acting under such counsel's supervision), that the Trustee's certificates of authentication of the Notes have been manually signed by one of the Trustee's authorized signatories and that the signatures on all documents examined by such counsel (or members of the Company's legal department acting under such counsel's supervision) are genuine (assumptions that such counsel has not independently verified). In addition, such counsel may state that such counsel has examined, or has caused members of the Company's legal department to examine, such corporate and partnership records, certificates and other documents, and such questions of law as such counsel has considered necessary or appropriate for the purposes of such opinion.
 
Such counsel shall also state: (i) that the Registration Statement, as of its effective date, and the Prospectus, as amended or supplemented as of the date thereof (or, if such opinion is being delivered in connection with the purchase of Notes by any Agent as principal pursuant to Section VII(c) hereof, at the date of the applicable Terms Agreement and the date of delivery of such Notes (the "Settlement Date") with respect thereto, appeared on their face to be appropriately responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the Securities Act and the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder and (ii) that nothing that came to such counsel's attention in the course of the Company's review has caused such counsel to believe that the Registration Statement, as of its effective date, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or that the Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, as of the date thereof or as of the date of the applicable Terms Agreement and as of the Settlement Date with respect thereto, includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Such counsel may also state that to the extent any of the opinions of this Section II(a) involve New Jersey law, such counsel has relied with the Agents' permission on the opinion of a vice president and counsel (however denominated) to the Company, who is admitted to practice law in the State of New Jersey, addressed to the Agents. Such counsel may also state that to the extent any of the opinions of this Section II(a) involve New York law, such counsel has relied with the Agents' permission on the opinion of a vice president and counsel (however denominated) to the Company, who is admitted to practice law in the State of New York, addressed to the Agents. Such counsel may also state that such counsel does not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, as amended or supplemented (except to the extent expressly set forth in paragraph (10) above). Such counsel may state that he does not express any opinion or belief as to the financial statements or other financial data contained in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, as amended or supplemented.
 
(b) On the date hereof, the Agents shall have received the favorable opinion, dated the date hereof, of Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen & Hamilton, counsel to the Agents, in form and scope reasonably satisfactory to the Agents, with respect to the validity of the Indenture, the Notes, the Registration Statement and the Prospectus and other related matters as such Agent or Agents may reasonably request.
 
(c) On the date hereof, the Agents shall have received a certificate of the President or any Vice President and the Treasurer or any Assistant Treasurer of the Company, dated as of the date hereof, to the effect that (i) since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Prospectus, there has not been any material change in the stockholders' equity or long-term debt of the Company (other than as a result of the sale of (A) Notes, (B) notes issued pursuant to the Company's Medium-Term Note Program or Euro Medium-Term Note Programme or (C) notes
 
issued pursuant to the Medium-Term Note Program or Euro-Medium-Term Note Programme of Prudential Funding LLC) or any material adverse change, or any development which will involve a prospective material adverse change, in or affecting the business, management, financial position, shareholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries considered as a whole; (ii) the representations and warranties of the Company contained in Section VI hereof are true and correct with the same force and effect as though expressly made at and as of the date of such certificate; (iii) the Company has performed or complied with all agreements and satisfied all conditions on its part to be performed or satisfied in connection with the performance of its obligations hereunder at or prior to the date of such certificate; and (iv) no Event of Default (as defined in the Indenture), or event which, with the giving of notice or the lapse of time or both, would constitute an Event of Default, shall have occurred and be continuing.
 
(d) On the date hereof, each Agent shall have received from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLC a letter in form and substance satisfactory to the Agents, dated as of the date hereof, containing statements and information of the type ordinarily included in accountants' "comfort letters" to underwriters with respect to the financial statements and certain financial information contained in or incorporated by reference into the Prospectus, as then amended or supplemented.
 
(e) On or prior to the time any Agent purchases Notes pursuant to a Terms Agreement: (i) there shall not have been any litigation or proceeding threatened or pending to restrain or enjoin the issuance or delivery of the Notes, or which in any way questions or affects the validity of the Notes; (ii) there shall not have occurred, since the date of the Terms Agreement, any downgrading nor shall any notice have been given of (A) any downgrading, (B) any intended or potential downgrading or (C) any review or possible change with possible negative implications in the rating accorded any debt security or preferred stock of the Company by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization", as such term is defined by the Commission for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Securities Act; (iii) there shall not have been since the respective dates as to which information is given in the Prospectus, any material decrease in the stockholders' equity of the Company or any material increase in the consolidated long-term debt of the Company (other than as a result of the sale of (i) Notes, (ii) notes issued pursuant to the Company's Medium-Term Note Program or Euro Medium-Term Note Programme or (iii) notes issued pursuant to the Medium-Term Note Program or Euro-Medium-Term Note Programme of Prudential Funding LLC) or any material adverse change, or any development involving a prospective material adverse change, in or affecting the business, management, financial position, shareholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, considered as a whole, in each case other than as set forth in the Prospectus, the effect of which in the judgment of the Purchasing Agent makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the purchase by any Agent of Notes from the Company on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus; and neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has sustained since the date of the latest audited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus, any loss or interference with its business from fire, explosion, flood or other calamity, whether or not covered by insurance (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any insurance underwriting losses of the Company or its subsidiaries), or
 
from any labor dispute or court or governmental action, order or decree, in each case other than as set forth or contemplated in the Prospectus; (iv) (A) trading generally shall not have been suspended or materially limited on the New York Stock Exchange, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. or in the over-the-counter market in debt securities, (B) trading of any securities of or guaranteed by the Company shall not have been suspended or materially limited on the New York Stock Exchange, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. or in any over-the-counter market in debt securities, (C) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities in New York shall not have been declared by either Federal, New York State or New Jersey authorities nor shall a material disruption in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States or other relevant jurisdiction have occurred, or (D) there shall not have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities or the declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war or any other calamity or crisis involving the United States or any change in national or international financial, political or economic conditions or currency exchange rates or controls that, in the judgment of the Purchasing Agent makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the purchase by any Agent of Notes from the Company on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus at the time an offer to purchase was solicited or at the time such offer to purchase was made; and (v) no Event of Default, or event which, with the giving of notice or the lapse of time or both, would constitute an Event of Default, shall have occurred and be continuing.
 
 
The Company covenants and agrees with each Agent as follows:
 
(a) Prior to the termination of the offering of the Notes pursuant to this Agreement or any Terms Agreement, the Company will not file any prospectus supplement or, except as provided below, any pricing supplement relating to the Notes or any amendment to the Registration Statement unless the Company has previously furnished to the Agents copies thereof for their review and will not file any such proposed supplement or amendment to which the Agents reasonably object; , that (i) the foregoing requirement shall not apply to any of the Company's periodic filings with the Commission filed pursuant to Section 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the "Exchange Act"), copies of which filings, in the case of quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and annual reports on Form 10-K, the Company will cause to be delivered to the Agents promptly after being transmitted for filing with the Commission and (ii) any pricing supplement that merely sets forth the terms or a description of particular Notes (each a "Pricing Supplement") shall only be reviewed and approved by the Agent or Agents offering such Notes. Subject to the foregoing sentence, the Company will promptly cause each prospectus supplement and Pricing Supplement to be filed with or transmitted for filing to the Commission in accordance with Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act. The Company will promptly advise the Agents (i) of the filing of any amendment or supplement to the Basic Prospectus (except that notice of the filing of an amendment or supplement to the Basic Prospectus that merely sets forth the terms or a description of particular Notes shall only be given to the Agent or Agents offering such Notes),
provided, however
 
(ii) of the filing and effectiveness of any amendment to the Registration Statement, (iii) of any request by the Commission for any amendment to the Registration Statement or any amendment or supplement to the Basic Prospectus or for any additional information, (iv) of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or the institution or threatening of any proceeding for that purpose and (v) of the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of the Notes for sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose. Prior to the termination of the offering of the Notes pursuant to this Agreement or any Terms Agreement, the Company will use its reasonable efforts to prevent the issuance of any such stop order or notice of suspension of qualification and, if issued, to obtain as soon as possible the withdrawal thereof. If the Basic Prospectus is amended or supplemented as a result of the filing under the Exchange Act of any document incorporated by reference in the Prospectus, no Agent shall be obligated to solicit offers to purchase Notes so long as it is not reasonably satisfied with such document.
 
If any event shall occur or condition shall exist as a result of which the Prospectus, in the opinion of counsel for the Agents or counsel for the Company, includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or if in the opinion of any such counsel it is necessary at any time to amend or supplement the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, as then amended or supplemented, to comply with applicable law, the Company shall prior to the acceptance of any offer to purchase Notes prepare and, subject to this Section III(a), cause to be filed with the Commission an amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, as then amended or supplemented, in form and substance satisfactory to counsel for the Agents, that corrects such untrue statement or omission or effects such compliance and shall furnish such amended or supplemented Prospectus to the Agents in such numbers as they may require.
 
(b) Reasonably in advance of each time any annual report of the Company filed under the Exchange Act is incorporated by reference into the Prospectus, and each time the Company sells Notes to such Agent as principal pursuant to a written Terms Agreement and such Terms Agreement specifies the delivery of an opinion or opinions by Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen & Hamilton, counsel to the Agents, as a condition to the purchase of Notes pursuant to such Terms Agreement, the Company shall furnish to such counsel such papers and information as they may reasonably request to enable them to furnish to such Agent the opinion or opinions referred to in Section II(b) hereof.
 
(c) The Company will endeavor, in cooperation with the Agents, to qualify the Notes for offering and sale under the applicable securities laws of such states and other jurisdictions of the United States as the Agents may reasonably designate, and will maintain such qualifications in effect for as long as may be required for the distribution of the Notes; , , that the Company shall not be obligated to file any general consent to service of process or to qualify as a foreign corporation in any jurisdiction in which it is not so qualified. The Company will file such statements and reports as may be required by the laws of each jurisdiction in which the
provided
however
 
Notes have been qualified as above provided. The Company will promptly advise the Agents of the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of the Notes for sale in any such state or jurisdiction or the initiating or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose.
 
(d) Between the date of any Terms Agreement and the Settlement Date with respect thereto, and if agreed to by the applicable Agent or Agents and the Company, the Company will not, without the prior written consent of each such Agent, directly or indirectly, sell, offer to sell, or enter into any agreement to sell, any debt securities of the Company which are substantially similar to the Notes that are to be sold pursuant to such Terms Agreement. Any notes sold under the Company's Medium-Term Note Program or Euro-Medium-Term Note Programme shall not be considered to be "substantially similar" to the Notes for purposes of the immediately preceding sentence.
 
(e) The Company shall make generally available to its security holders as soon as practicable, but in any event not later than 90 days after the effective date of the Registration Statement (as defined in Rule 158(c) under the Securities Act), an earnings statement of the Company and its subsidiaries (which need not be audited) complying with Section 11(a) of the Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder.
 
(f) The Company shall not be required to comply with the provisions of subsections (a) or (b) of this Section or the provisions of Section VII hereof during any period from the time that the Agents (i) shall have been notified (such notice to be confirmed in writing) by the Company to suspend solicitation of offers to purchase the Notes and (ii) shall not then hold any Notes purchased as principal pursuant hereto, until the time the Company shall have notified the Agents (such notice to be confirmed in writing) of the Company's determination that solicitation of purchases of the Notes should be resumed or any Agent shall subsequently purchase Notes from the Company as principal and the Company has subsequently delivered such documents required by Section VII.
 
(g) The Company will use the net proceeds received by it from the sale from time to time of Notes in the manner specified in the Prospectus under "Use of Proceeds".
 
 
(a) Notes shall be purchased by each Agent as principal. The Agents shall offer the Notes upon the terms and conditions set forth herein and in the Prospectus and upon the terms communicated to the Agents from time to time by the Company or the Purchasing Agent, as the case may be (which terms, unless otherwise agreed, may be agreed upon orally, with written confirmation prepared by such Agent or Agents and sent by telecopier to the Company). For the purpose of such sales the Agents will use the Prospectus, as then amended or supplemented, which has been most recently distributed to the Agents by the Company, and the Agents will offer and sell the Notes only as permitted or contemplated thereby and herein and will offer and
 
sell the Notes only as permitted by the Securities Act and the applicable securities laws or regulations of any jurisdiction. An Agent's commitment to purchase Notes as principal shall be deemed to have been made on the basis of the representations and warranties of the Company herein contained and shall be subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth. Unless the context otherwise requires, references herein to "this Agreement" shall include the agreement of one or more Agents to purchase Notes from the Company as principal.
 
The Company agrees to sell the Notes to the Purchasing Agent at a discount from the principal amount of each such Note equivalent to the applicable commission set forth in Exhibit A hereto; provided, however, that the Company and the Purchasing Agent may agree instead to a discount greater than or less than the percentages set forth on Exhibit A hereto. The actual aggregate discount with respect to each sale of Notes will be set forth in the related Pricing Supplement. The Purchasing Agent and the other Agents or selected broker-dealers (the "Selected Dealers") will share the above-mentioned discount in such proportions as they may agree.
 
(b) Procedural details relating to the issue and delivery of, and the solicitation of purchases and payment for, the Notes are set forth in the Administrative Procedures attached hereto as Exhibit B (the "Procedures"), as amended from time to time. Unless otherwise provided in a Terms Agreement, the provisions of the Procedures shall apply to all transactions contemplated hereunder. The Agents and the Company each agree to perform the respective duties and obligations specifically provided to be performed by each in the Procedures as amended from time to time. The Procedures may only be amended by written agreement of the Company and the Agents.
 
 
Each sale of Notes shall be made in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the Procedures and a separate agreement in substantially the form attached as Exhibit C (a "Terms Agreement") to be entered into which will provide for the sale of such Notes to, and the purchase and reoffering thereof, by the Purchasing Agent as principal. A Terms Agreement may also specify certain provisions relating to the reoffering of such Notes by the Purchasing Agent. The offering of Notes by the Company hereunder and the Purchasing Agent's agreement to purchase Notes pursuant to any Terms Agreement shall be deemed to have been made on the basis of the representations, warranties and agreements of the Company herein contained and shall be subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth. Each Terms Agreement shall describe the Notes to be purchased pursuant thereto by the Purchasing Agent as principal, and may specify, among other things, the principal amount of Notes to be purchased, the interest rate or interest rate basis (and whether such interest rate shall be fixed or floating) and maturity date or dates of such Notes, the interest payment dates, if any, the net proceeds to the Company, the initial public offering price at which the Notes are proposed to be reoffered, and the time, Settlement Date and place of delivery of and payment for such Notes, whether the Notes provide for a Survivor's Option (as such term is defined in the Prospectus), whether the Notes are redeemable or repayable and on what terms and conditions, and any other relevant terms. In connection with
 
the resale of the Notes purchased, without the consent of the Company or the Purchasing Agent, the Agents are not authorized to appoint subagents or to engage the service of any other broker or dealer, other than the Selected Dealers, nor may any Agent reallow any portion of the discount paid to it.
 
 
The Company represents and warrants to each Agent as of the date hereof, as of the date of each acceptance by the Company of an offer for the purchase of Notes (including any purchase by the Purchasing Agent as principal, pursuant to a Terms Agreement or otherwise), as of each Settlement Date, and as of any time that the Registration Statement or the Prospectus shall be amended or supplemented or there is filed with the Commission any document incorporated by reference into the Prospectus (other than any Current Report on Form 8-K relating exclusively to the issuance of debt securities under the Registration Statement) (each of the times referenced above being referred to herein as a "Representation Date") as follows:

(c) The Company has been duly incorporated and is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of New Jersey, with power and authority (corporate and other) to own its properties and to conduct its business as described in the Prospectus, and has been duly qualified as a foreign corporation for the transaction of business and is in good standing under the laws of each other jurisdiction in which it owns or leases properties or conducts any business so as to require such qualification, except to the extent that the failure to be so qualified or in good standing would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.
 
(d) Each of this Agreement and any other applicable Terms Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company; the Indenture has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act and has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and is a valid and binding agreement of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except as enforcement thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws relating to or affecting enforcement of creditors' rights generally or by general equitable principles; the Notes have been duly authorized by the Company and, when executed, authenticated and delivered in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, any applicable Terms Agreement and the Indenture against payment therefor, will have been duly executed and delivered by, and will constitute valid and binding obligations of, the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms, except as enforcement thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws relating to or affecting enforcement of creditors' rights generally or by general equitable principles; and the terms of the Indenture and the Notes in respect of which an offer to purchase has been accepted by the Company are in all material respects accurately described in the Prospectus.
 
(e) None of the Company or any of its subsidiaries has sustained since the date of the latest audited financial statements included in the Prospectus any loss or interference with its business that is, individually or in the aggregate, material to the Company and its subsidiaries, considered as a whole, from fire, explosion, flood or other calamity, whether or not covered by insurance (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any insurance underwriting losses of the Company or its subsidiaries), or from any labor dispute or court or governmental action, order or decree, in each case other than as set forth or contemplated in the Prospectus; and, since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Prospectus, except as may otherwise be stated therein or contemplated thereby, (1) there has been no material decrease in the capital or surplus of the Company, (2) there has been no decrease in the capital stock of the Company or any material increase in the consolidated long-term debt of the Company (other than, in each case, as a result of the sale of (i) Notes, (ii) notes issued pursuant to the Company's Medium-Term Note Program or Euro Medium-Term Note Programme or (iii) notes issued pursuant to the Medium-Term Note Program or Euro-Medium-Term Note Programme of Prudential Funding LLC) and (3) there has been no material adverse change, or any development which will involve a prospective material adverse change, in or affecting the business, management, financial position, shareholders' equity (in each case considered on a GAAP basis) or the financial strength ratings of the Company and its subsidiaries considered as a whole.
 
(f) The execution and delivery of this Agreement, any applicable Terms Agreement, the Indenture and the Notes, the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein and therein and compliance by the Company with its obligations hereunder and thereunder, as the case may be, will not conflict with, or result in a breach or violation of, any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under, any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan
 
agreement or other agreement or instrument to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company, or any of its subsidiaries is bound or to which any of the property or assets of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is subject, nor will such actions result in any violation of the provisions of the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws of the Company or the organizational documents of any of its subsidiaries or any statute or any order, rule or regulation of any court or insurance regulatory agency or other governmental agency or body having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any of their properties, except to the extent that such a conflict, breach, default or violation would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.
 
(g) Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries is, or at any time of delivery of the Notes will be, in violation of its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws or other organizational documents or instruments or in default in the performance or observance of any obligation, agreement, covenant or condition contained in any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement, lease or other agreement or instrument to which it is a party or by which it or any of its properties may be bound, which violation or default would have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.
 
(h) There are no legal or governmental proceedings pending to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or of which any property of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is the subject which, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, other than as set forth in the Prospectus; and, to the best of the Company's knowledge, no such proceedings are threatened or contemplated by governmental authorities or threatened by others, other than as set forth in the Prospectus.
 
(i) No consent or action of, or filing or registration with, any governmental or public regulatory body or authority, is required to be obtained by the Company in connection with the execution, delivery or performance by the Company of this Agreement, any applicable Terms Agreement, the Indenture or the Notes, except such as have been obtained and made under the Securities Act and the Trust Indenture Act and such as may be required under the securities or Blue Sky laws of the various states in connection with the offer and sale of the Notes.
 
(j) The Company is not, nor after giving effect to the transactions contemplated herein will be, an "investment company" as such term is defined in the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act").
 
(k) The obligations of the Company to pay the principal of and premium, if any, and interest on the Notes and any and all amounts that become due and payable under this Agreement constitute direct, unconditional and general obligations of the Company and rank and will rank in priority of payment with respect to all unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of the Company.
pari passu
 
(l) PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, who have certified certain financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries, are independent public accountants as required by the Securities Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder.
 
(m) The consolidated financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries, together with the related schedules, notes and supplemental information, set forth in the Prospectus, comply in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act and interpretations thereof and present fairly in all material respects the financial position, the results of operations and the changes in cash flows of such entities in conformity with GAAP at the respective dates or for the respective periods to which they apply; such statements and related schedules, notes and supplemental information have been prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied throughout the periods involved except for any normal year-end adjustments and except as described therein.
 
 
The Company covenants and agrees with each Agent that:
 
(a) Each acceptance by the Company of an offer for the purchase of Notes and each delivery of Notes, shall be deemed to be an affirmation that the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement are true and correct at the time of such acceptance or sale, as the case may be, and an undertaking that such representations and warranties will be true and correct at the time of delivery to the purchaser or its agent, or to the applicable Agent, of the Note or Notes relating to such acceptance or sale, as the case may be, as though made at and as of each such time (and it is understood that such representations and warranties shall relate to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus as amended and supplemented at each such time).
 
(b) Each time that there is filed with the Commission any Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or Annual Report on Form 10-K incorporated by reference into the Prospectus, and otherwise only (i) as may be required in connection with a sale pursuant to Section IV(a) or (ii) at such times as may be reasonably requested by the Agents in the event of a material change in circumstances in respect of the Company, the Company shall furnish or cause to be furnished to the Agent(s) forthwith a certificate dated the date of filing with the Commission of such document, the date requested by the Agents or the date of such sale, as the case may be, in form reasonably satisfactory to the Agent(s) to the effect that the statements contained in the certificate referred to in Section II(c) hereof which were last furnished to the Agents are true and correct at the time of such filing, as though made at and as of such time (except that such statements shall be deemed to relate to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus as amended and supplemented to such time) or, in lieu of such certificate, a certificate substantially similar to the certificate referred to in Section II(c) hereof, modified as necessary to relate to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus as amended and supplemented to the time of delivery of such certificate.
 
(c) Each time that there is filed with the Commission any Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or Annual Report on Form 10-K incorporated by reference into the Prospectus, and otherwise only as may be required in connection with a sale pursuant to Section IV(a), the Company shall furnish or cause to be furnished forthwith, and in any case promptly upon request, to the Agent(s) and to counsel to the Agents the written opinion of counsel to the Company referred to in Section II(a), or other counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Agent(s), dated the date of filing with the Commission of such document, the date requested by the Agent(s) or the date of such sale, as the case may be, in form and scope reasonably satisfactory to the Agent(s), of the same tenor as the opinions referred to in Section II(a) (except that, in the case of any interim report filed on Form 10-Q or other document or annual report on Form 10-K filed under the Exchange Act, such opinions need not be rendered as to the good standing of the entities referred to in Sections II(a)(2) and (3) hereof or as to the matters referred to in Section II(a)(9) hereof), but modified, as necessary, to relate to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus as amended and supplemented to the time of delivery of such opinion or, in lieu of such opinion, counsel last furnishing such opinion to the Agents shall furnish the Agent(s) with a letter substantially to the effect that the Agent(s) may rely on such last opinion to the same extent as though it were dated the date of such letter authorizing reliance (except that statements in such last opinion shall be deemed to relate to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus as amended and supplemented to the time of delivery of such letter authorizing reliance).
 
(d) Each time that there is filed with the Commission any Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or Annual Report on Form 10-K incorporated by reference into the Prospectus, and otherwise only as may be requested by the Agents in connection with a sale pursuant to Section IV(a), the Company shall furnish or cause their independent public accountants to furnish such Agents (i) in the case of a sale, a letter dated the date of such sale, in form reasonably satisfactory to the Agent(s), substantially in the form of the letter referred to in Section II(d) hereof, (ii) in the case of a filing of an Annual Report on Form 10-K, a letter in form reasonably satisfactory to the Agent(s), substantially in the form of the letter referred to in Section II(d) hereof, and (iii) in the case of a Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, a review letter from such accountants in conformity with the requirements of Statement of Accounting Standards No. 100, but modified as necessary to relate to the Registration Statement and Prospectus as amended and supplemented to the date of such letter, with such changes as may be necessary to reflect changes in the financial statements and other information derived from the accounting records of the Company.
 
 
(a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Agent against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Agent may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or any amendment thereof or the Prospectus, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a
 
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse each Agent for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by it in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim as to which it is entitled to indemnification hereunder as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus as so amended or supplemented in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Agent expressly for use therein.
 
(b) Each Agent, severally and not jointly, will indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or any amendment thereof or the Prospectus, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in any Registration Statement or Prospectus as so amended or supplemented in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Agent expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred.
 
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party) and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such
 
action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party (or such other release of the indemnified party as shall be satisfactory to the indemnified party) from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
 
(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section VIII is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Agents on the other from the offering of the Notes to which such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Agents on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Agents on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering of such Notes purchased under this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total discounts and commissions received by the Agents with respect to such Notes purchased under this Agreement, in each case as set forth in Schedule A hereto. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or the Agents on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Agents agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by allocation (even if the Agents were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Agent shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Notes purchased by it and distributed to or placed by it with investors were offered to investors exceeds the amount of any damages which such Agent has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Agents' obligations in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective purchase obligations and not joint.
pro rata
 
(e) The obligations of the Company under this Section VIII shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Agent within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act; and the obligations of the Agents under this Section VIII shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Agents may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company (including any person who, with his or her consent, is named in the Prospectus as about to become a director of the Company) and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act.
 
 
The Company may elect to suspend or terminate the offering of Notes under this Agreement at any time; the Company also (as to any one or more of the Agents) or any Agent (as to itself) may terminate the appointment and arrangements described in this Agreement. Upon receipt of instructions from the Company, the Purchasing Agent shall suspend or terminate the participation of any Selected Dealer under the Master Selected Dealer Agreement. Such actions may be taken, in the case of the Company, by giving prompt written notice of suspension to all of the Agents and by giving not less than five days' written notice of termination to the affected party and the other parties to this Agreement, or in the case of an Agent, by giving not less than five days' written notice of termination to the Company and except that, if at the time of termination an offer for the purchase of Notes shall have been accepted by the Company but the time of delivery to the purchaser or his agent of the Note or Notes relating thereto shall not yet have occurred, the Company shall have the obligations provided herein with respect to such Note or Notes. The Company shall promptly notify the other parties in writing of any such termination.
 
The Purchasing Agent may, and, upon the request of an Agent with respect to any Notes being purchased by such Agent shall, terminate any agreement hereunder by the Purchasing Agent to purchase such Notes, immediately upon notice to the Company at any time at or prior to the Settlement Date relating thereto, if there shall have come to the attention of the Purchasing Agent or such Agent or Agents any facts that would cause them to believe that the Prospectus, at the time it was required to be delivered to a purchaser of Notes, included an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances existing at the time of such delivery, not misleading. As used in this Section IX, the term "Prospectus" means the Prospectus in the form first provided to the applicable Agent or Agents for use in confirming sales of the related Notes.
 
Any Terms Agreement shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Agents on the terms set forth or incorporated by reference therein. The termination of this
 
Agreement shall not require termination of any agreement by the Purchasing Agent to purchase Notes as principal, and the termination of any such agreement shall not require termination of this Agreement.
 
If this Agreement is terminated, Sections VIII, XII and XIII hereof shall survive and shall remain in effect; provided that if at the time of termination of this Agreement an offer to purchase Notes has been accepted by the Company but the time of delivery to the Purchasing Agent of such Notes has not occurred, the provisions of all of Section III, Section IV and Section V shall also survive until the time of delivery.
 
In the event a proposed offering is not completed according to the terms of this Agreement, an Agent will be reimbursed by the Company only for out-of-pocket accountable expenses actually incurred.
 
 
Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, all statements, requests, notices and advices hereunder shall be in writing, or by telephone if promptly confirmed in writing, and if to an Agent shall be sufficient in all respects if delivered in person or sent by telex, facsimile, e-mail transmission (confirmed in writing), or registered mail to such Agent at its address, telex or facsimile number set forth on Annex A hereto and if to the Company shall be sufficient in all respects if delivered or sent by telex, facsimile, e-mail transmission (confirmed in writing) or registered mail to the Company at the address specified below. All such notices shall be effective on receipt.

InterNotes, due one year or more from date of issue (the "Notes") may be offered on a continuing basis by Prudential Financial, Inc. (the "Company"). The Notes will be offered by Incapital LLC (the "Purchasing Agent"), Banc of America Securities LLC, A.G. Edward & Sons, Inc, Bear, Stearns & Co. Inc., Charles Schwab & Company, Incorporated, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Edward D. Jones & Co., L.P., Fidelity Capital Markets, a division of National Financial Services, LLC, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, Muriel Siebert & Co., Samuel A. Ramirez & Co., Inc, Raymond James & Associates, Inc., RBS Dain Rauscher Inc., UBS Financial Services, Inc., and Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC (collectively, the "Agents") pursuant to a Selling Agent Agreement among the Company and the Agents dated as of the date hereof (the "Selling Agent Agreement") and one or more terms agreements substantially in the form attached to the Selling Agent Agreement as Exhibit C (each a "Terms Agreement"). The Notes are being resold by the Purchasing Agent (and by any Agent that purchases them from the Purchasing Agent) (i) directly to customers of the Agents or (ii) to selected broker-dealers (the "Selected Dealers") for distribution to their customers pursuant to a Master Selected Dealer Agreement (a "Dealers Agreement") attached to the Selling Agent Agreement as Exhibit E. The Notes have been registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission"). Citibank, N.A. is the trustee (the "Trustee") under the indenture, dated as of April 25, 2003, between the Company and JPMorgan Chase Bank as amended to designate the Trustee for the Notes by a supplemental indenture, dated as of March 25, 2004 (as amended or supplemented from time to time, the "Indenture"), between the Company and the Trustee, covering, among other debt securities, the Notes. Pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, Citibank, N.A. also will serve as authenticating agent, issuing agent and paying agent.

Dear Selected Dealer:
 
In connection with public offerings of securities after the date hereof for which we are acting as manager of an underwriting syndicate or are otherwise responsible for the distribution of securities to the public by means of an offering of securities for sale to selected dealers, you may be offered the right as such a selected dealer to purchase as principal a portion of such securities. This will confirm our mutual agreement as to the general terms and conditions applicable to your participation in any such selected dealer group organized by us as follows.
 
1. . The terms and conditions of this Agreement shall be applicable to any public offering of securities ("Securities"), pursuant to a registration statement filed under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act"), or exempt from registration thereunder (other than a public offering of Securities effected wholly outside the United States of America), wherein Incapital LLC clearing through BNY Clearing Services, LLC (the "Account") (acting for its own Account or for the account of any underwriting or similar group or syndicate) is responsible for managing or otherwise implementing the sale of the Securities to selected dealers ("Selected Dealers") and has expressly informed you that such terms and conditions shall be applicable. Any such offering of Securities to you as a Selected Dealer is hereinafter called an "Offering". In the case of any Offering where we are acting for the account of any underwriting or similar group or syndicate ("Underwriters"), the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall be for the benefit of, and binding upon, such Underwriters, including, in the case of any Offering where we are acting with others as representatives of Underwriters, such other representatives.
Applicability of this Agreement
 
2. . Any Offering: (i) will be subject to delivery of the Securities and their acceptance by us and any other Underwriters; (ii) may be subject to the approval of all legal matters by counsel and the satisfaction of other conditions, and (iii) may be made on the basis of reservation of Securities or an allotment against subscription. We will advise you by electronic mail, facsimile or other form of written communication ("Written Communication", which term, in the case of any Offering described in Section 3(a) or 3(b) hereof, may include a prospectus or offering circular) of the particular method and supplementary terms and conditions (including, without limitation, the information as to prices and offering date referred to in Section 3(c) hereof) of any Offering in which you are invited to participate. To the extent such supplementary terms and conditions are inconsistent with any provision herein, such terms and conditions shall supersede any such provision. Unless otherwise indicated in any
Conditions of Offering; Acceptance and Purchases
 
such Written Communication, acceptances and other communications by you with respect to an Offering should be sent to Incapital LLC, One North LaSalle Street, Suite 3500, Chicago, IL 60602, (Fax: (312) 379-3701). We reserve the right to reject any acceptance in whole or in part. Unless notified otherwise by us, Securities purchased by you shall be paid for on such date as we shall determine, on one day's prior notice to you, by certified or official bank check, in an amount equal to the Public Offering Prices (as hereinafter defined) or, if we shall so advise you, at such Public Offering Price less the Concession (as hereinafter defined), payable in New York Clearing House funds to the order of BNY Clearing Services, LLC clearing for the account of Incapital LLC, against delivery of the Securities. If Securities are purchased and paid for at such Public Offering Price, such Concession will be paid after the termination of the provisions of Section 3(c) hereof with respect to such Securities. Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless notified otherwise by us, payment for and delivery of Securities purchased by you shall be made through the facilities of The Depository Trust Company, if you are a member, unless you have otherwise notified us prior to the date specified in a Written Communication to you from us or, if you are not a member, settlement may be made through a correspondent who is a member pursuant to instructions which you will send to us prior to such specified date.
 
3. .
Representations, Warranties and Agreements
 
(a) . In the case of any Offering of Securities that are registered under the Securities Act ("Registered Offering"), we shall provide you with such number of copies of each preliminary prospectus and of the final prospectus relating thereto as you may reasonably request for the purposes contemplated by the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission thereunder. You represent and warrant that you are familiar with Rule 15c2-8 under the Exchange Act relating to the distribution of preliminary and final prospectuses and agree that you will comply therewith. You agree to make a record of your distribution of each preliminary prospectus and, when furnished with copies of any revised preliminary prospectus, you will, upon our request, promptly forward copies thereof to each person to whom you have theretofore distributed a preliminary prospectus. You agree that in purchasing Securities in a Registered Offering you will rely upon no statement whatsoever, written or oral, other than the statements in the final prospectus delivered to you by us. You will not be authorized by the issuer or other seller of Securities offered pursuant to a prospectus or by any Underwriter to give any information or to make any representation not contained in the prospectus in connection with the sale of such Securities.
Registered Offerings
 
(b) . In the case of any Offering of Securities, other than a Registered Offering, which is made pursuant to an offering circular or other document comparable to a prospectus in a Registered Offering, we shall provide you with such number of copies of each preliminary offering circular and of the final offering circular relating thereto as you may reasonably request. You agree that you will comply with the applicable Federal and state laws, and the applicable rules and regulations of any regulatory body promulgated thereunder, governing the use and distribution of offering circulars by brokers or dealers. You agree that in purchasing Securities pursuant to an offering circular you will rely
Offerings Pursuant to Offering Circular
 
upon no statements whatsoever, written or oral, other than the statements in the final offering circular delivered to you by us. You will not be authorized by the issuer or other seller of Securities offered pursuant to an offering circular or by any Underwriter to give any information or to make any representation not contained in the offering circular in connection with the sale of such Securities.
 
(c) . With respect to any Offering of Securities, we will inform you by a Written Communication of the public offering price, the selling concession, the reallowance (if any) to dealers and the time when you may commence selling Securities to the public. After such public offering has commenced, we may change the public offering price, the selling concession and the reallowance to dealers. The offering price, selling concession and reallowance (if any) to dealers at any time in effect with respect to an Offering are hereinafter referred to, respectively, as the "Public Offering Price", the "Concession" and the "Reallowance". With respect to each Offering of Securities, until the provisions of this Section 3(c) shall be terminated pursuant to Section 4 hereof, you agree to offer Securities to the public at no more than the Public Offering Price. If so notified by us, you may sell Securities to the public at a lesser negotiated price than the Public Offering Price, but in an amount not to exceed the "Concession". If a Reallowance is in effect, a reallowance from the Public Offering Price not in excess of such Reallowance may be allowed as consideration for services rendered in distribution to dealers who are actually engaged in the investment banking or securities business, who execute the written agreement prescribed by Rule 2740 of the Conduct Rules of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (the "NASD") and who are either members in good standing of the NASD or foreign banks, dealers or institutions not eligible for membership in the NASD who represent to you that they will promptly reoffer such Securities at the Public Offering Price and will abide by the conditions with respect to foreign banks, dealers and institutions set forth in Section 3(e) hereof.
Offer and Sale to the Public
 
(d) . We may, with respect to any Offering, be authorized to over-allot in arranging sales to Selected Dealers, to purchase and sell Securities for long or short account and to stabilize or maintain the market price of the Securities. You agree that, upon our request at any time and from time to time prior to the termination of the provisions of Section 3(c) hereof with respect to any Offering, you will report to us the amount of Securities purchased by you pursuant to such Offering which then remain unsold by you and will, upon our request at any such time, sell to us for our account or the account of one or more Underwriters such amount of such unsold Securities as we may designate at the Public Offering Price less an amount to be determined by us not in excess of the Concession. If, prior to the later of (i) the termination of the provisions of Section 3(c) hereof with respect to any Offering or (ii) the covering by us of any short position created by us in connection with such Offering for our account or the account of one or more Underwriters, we purchase or contract to purchase for our account or the account of one or more Underwriters in the open market or otherwise any Securities purchased by you under this Agreement as part of such Offering, you agree to pay us on demand an amount equal to the Concession with respect to such Securities (unless you shall have purchased such Securities pursuant to Section 2 hereof at the Public Offering Price in which case we shall not be obligated to pay such Concession to you pursuant to Section 2) plus transfer taxes and broker's commissions or dealer's mark-up, if any, paid in connection with such purchase or contract to purchase.
Over-allotment; Stabilization; Unsold Allotments
 
(e) . You represent and warrant that you are actually engaged in the investment banking or securities business and either a member in good standing of the NASD or, if you are not such a member, you are a foreign bank, dealer or institution not eligible for membership in the NASD which agrees to make no sales within the United States, its territories or its possessions or to persons who are citizens thereof or residents therein, and in making other sales to comply with the NASD's interpretation with respect to free riding and withholding. You further represent, by your participation in an Offering, that you have provided to us all documents and other information required to be filed with respect to you, any related person or any person associated with you or any such related person pursuant to the supplementary requirements of the NASD's interpretation with respect to review of corporate financing as such requirements relate to such Offering.
NASD
 
You agree that, in connection with any purchase or sale of the Securities wherein a Concession, discount or other allowance is received or granted, (1) you will comply with the provisions of Rule 2740 of the NASD's Conduct Rules and (2) if you are a non-NASD member broker or dealer in a foreign country, you will also comply (a), as though you were an NASD member, with the provisions of IM-2110-1 and Rules 2730, 2740 and 2750 of the NASD's Conduct Rules and (b) with Rule 2420 thereof as that Rule applies to a non-NASD member broker or dealer in a foreign country.
 
You further agree that, in connection with any purchase of securities from us that is not otherwise covered by the terms of this Agreement (whether we are acting as manager, as a member of an underwriting syndicate or a selling group or otherwise), if a Concession or other allowance is granted to you, clauses (1) and (2) of the preceding paragraph will be applicable.
 
(f) . We may buy Securities from or sell Securities to any Underwriter or Selected Dealer and, without consent, the Underwriters (if any) and the Selected Dealers may purchase Securities from and sell Securities to each other at the Public Offering Price less all or any part of the Concession. Unless otherwise specified in a separate agreement between you and us, this agreement does not authorize you to act as agent for: (i) us; (ii) any Underwriter; (iii) the issuer; or (iv) other seller of any Securities in offering Securities to the public or otherwise. Neither we nor any Underwriter shall be under any obligation to you except for obligations assumed hereby or in any Written Communication from us in connection with any Offering. Nothing contained herein or in any Written Communication from us shall constitute the Selected Dealers an association or partners with us or any Underwriter or with one another. If the Selected Dealers, among themselves or with the Underwriters, should be deemed to constitute a partnership for Federal income tax purposes, then you elect to be excluded from the application of Subchapter K, Chapter 1, Subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and agree not to take any position inconsistent with that election. You authorize us, in our discretion, to execute and file on your behalf such evidence of that election as may be required by the Internal Revenue Service. In connection with any Offering, you shall be liable for your proportionate amount of any tax, claim, demand or liability that may be asserted against you alone or against one or more Selected
Relationship among Underwriters and Selected Dealers
 
Dealers participating in such Offering, or against us or the Underwriters, based upon the claim that the Selected Dealers, or any of them, constitute an association, an unincorporated business or other entity, including, in each case, your proportionate amount of any expense incurred in defending against any such tax, claim, demand or liability.
 
(g) . Upon application to us, we shall inform you as to any advice we have received from counsel concerning the jurisdictions in which Securities have been qualified for sale or are exempt under the securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions, but we do not assume any obligation or responsibility as to your right to sell Securities in any such jurisdiction.
Blue Sky Laws
 
(h) . You agree that in selling Securities pursuant to any Offering (which agreement shall also be for the benefit of the issuer or other seller of such Securities) you will comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations, including the applicable provisions of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission thereunder, the applicable rules and regulations of the NASD, the applicable rules and regulations of any securities exchange having jurisdiction over the Offering and the applicable laws, rules and regulations specified in Section 3(b) hereof.

Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Note and of any Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note.
 
As provided in and subject to the provisions of the Indenture, the Holder of this Note shall not have the right to institute any proceeding with respect to the Indenture or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee or for any other remedy thereunder, unless such Holder shall have previously given the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Securities of this series, the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Securities of this series at the time Outstanding shall have made written request to the Trustee to

The foregoing shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Holder of this Note for the enforcement of any payment of principal hereof or any premium or interest hereon on or after the respective due dates expressed herein.

If the Survivor's Option is applicable to this Note, the Representative (defined below) of a deceased beneficial owner of the Note shall have the option to elect repayment or repurchase of such Note following the death of the beneficial owner (a "Survivor's Option"). Unless specifically provided on the face of this Note, the Survivor's Option may not be exercised unless the Note was acquired by the beneficial owner at least six months prior to such election.
 
If the Survivor's Option is applicable to this Note, upon the valid exercise of the Survivor's Option, the Company shall repay or repurchase, at its option, the Note (or portion thereof), properly tendered for repayment or repurchase by or on behalf of the person (the "Representative") that has authority to act on behalf of the deceased beneficial owner of a Note under the laws of the appropriate jurisdiction (including, without limitation, the personal representative or executor of the deceased beneficial owner or the surviving joint owner of the deceased beneficial owner) at a price equal to 100% of the amortized principal amount of the deceased beneficial owner's beneficial interest in such Note plus accrued interest to the date of such repayment or repurchase, subject to the following limitations:
 
(a) The Company may, in its sole discretion, limit the aggregate principal amount of Notes as to which exercises of the Survivor's Option shall be accepted from all deceased beneficial owners in any calendar year (the "Annual Put Limitation") to an amount equal to the greater of $2,000,000 or 2% of the principal amount of all Notes as of the end of the most recent calendar year, or such greater amount as the Company in its sole discretion may determine for any calendar year, and may limit to $250,000, or such greater amount as the Company in its sole discretion may determine for any calendar year, the aggregate principal amount of acceptances of exercise of the Survivor's Option in such calendar year for any individual deceased beneficial owner (the "Individual Put Limitation").
 
(b) The Company shall not make principal repayments pursuant to exercise of the Survivor's Option in amounts that are less than $1,000, and, in the event that the limitations described in the preceding sentence would result in the partial repayment of any Note, the principal amount of such Note remaining Outstanding after repayment must be at least $1,000 (the minimum authorized denomination of the Notes).
 
(c) Any Note (or portion thereof) tendered pursuant to a valid exercise of the Survivor's Option may not be withdrawn.
 
Each Note (or portion thereof) that is tendered pursuant to valid exercise of the Survivor's Option shall be accepted in the order of all such Notes are received by the Trustee, except for any Note (or portion thereof) the acceptance of which would contravene (i) the Annual Put Limitation, if applied, or (ii) the Individual Put Limitation, if applied, with respect to the relevant individual deceased beneficial owner. If, as of the end of any calendar year, the aggregate principal amount of Notes (or portions thereof) that have been tendered pursuant to the valid exercise of the Survivor's Option during such year has exceeded either the Annual Put Limitation, if applied, or the Individual Put Limitation, if applied, for such year, any exercise(s) of the Survivor's Option with respect to Notes (or portions thereof) not accepted during such calendar year because such acceptance would have contravened either such limitation, if applied,
 
shall be deemed to be tendered in the following calendar year in the order all such Notes (or portions thereof) were originally tendered. Any Note (or portion thereof) accepted for repayment or repurchase pursuant to exercise of the Survivor's Option shall be repaid or repurchased on the first Interest Payment Date that occurs 20 or more calendar days after the date of such acceptance. In the event that a Note (or any portion thereof) tendered for repayment or repurchase pursuant to valid exercise of the Survivor's Option is not accepted, the Trustee shall deliver a notice by first-class mail to the registered holder thereof, at its last known address as indicated in the Note Register, that states the reason such Note (or portion thereof) has not been accepted for payment.
 
In order for a Survivor's Option to be validly exercised with respect to any Note (or portion thereof), the Trustee must receive from the Representative (i) a written request for repayment or repurchase signed by the Representative, and such signature must be guaranteed by a member firm of a registered national securities exchange or of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (the "NASD") or a commercial bank or trust company having an office or correspondent in the United States, (ii) tender of a Note (or portion thereof) to be repaid or repurchased, (iii) appropriate evidence satisfactory to the Company and the Trustee that (A) the deceased was the beneficial owner of such Note at the time of death and the interest in such note was acquired by the deceased beneficial owner at least six months prior to the request for repayment or repurchase, (B) the death of such beneficial owner has occurred, and the date of such death, and (C) the Representative has authority to act on behalf of the deceased beneficial owner, (iv) if applicable, a properly executed assignment or endorsement, (v) if the interest in such Note is held by a nominee of the deceased beneficial owner, a certificate satisfactory to the Company and the Trustee from such nominee attesting to the deceased's beneficial ownership in such Note, (vi) tax waivers and such other instruments or documents that the Company or the Trustee reasonably requires in order to establish the validity of the beneficial ownership of the Notes and the claimant's entitlement to payment, and (vii) any additional information the Company or the Trustee requires to evidence satisfaction of any conditions to the exercise of such Survivor's Option or to document beneficial ownership or authority to make the election and to cause the repayment or repurchase of such Note. All questions as to the eligibility or validity of any exercise of the Survivor's Option will be determined by the Company, in its sole discretion, which determination shall be final and binding on all parties.
 
The death of a person holding a beneficial interest in a Note as a joint tenant or tenant by the entirety with another person, or as a tenant in common with the deceased holder's spouse, will be deemed the death of the beneficial owner of the Note, and the entire principal amount of the Note so held shall be subject to repayment or repurchase. However, the death of a person holding a beneficial interest in a note as tenant in common with a person other than such deceased holder's spouse will be deemed the death of a beneficial owner only with respect to the deceased person's interest in the Note. The death of a person who, during his or her lifetime, was entitled to substantially all of the beneficial interests of ownership of a Note will be deemed the death of the beneficial owner of such note for purposes of this provision, regardless of the registered holder of the Note, if such beneficial interest can be established to the satisfaction of the Company and the Trustee. Such beneficial interest will be deemed to exist in typical cases of nominee ownership, ownership under the Uniform Transfers to Minors Act or Uniform Gifts to Minors Act, community property or other joint ownership arrangements between a husband and wife. In addition, the beneficial interest will be deemed to exist in custodial and trust arrangements where one person has all of the beneficial ownership interest in the Note during his or her lifetime.
 
Because the Notes are represented by a Global Note, the Depository or its nominee shall be the holder of such Note and therefore shall be the only entity that can exercise the Survivor's Option for such Note. To obtain repayment or repurchase pursuant to exercise of the Survivor's Option with respect to such Note, the Representative must provide to the broker or other entity through which the beneficial interest in such Note is held by the deceased beneficial owner (i) the documents described in the second preceding paragraph and (ii) instructions to such broker or other entity to notify the Depository of such Representative's desire to obtain repayment or repurchase pursuant to exercise of the Survivor's Option. Such broker or other entity shall provide to the Trustee (i) the documents received from the Representative referred to in clause (i) of the preceding sentence and (ii) a certificate satisfactory to the Company and the Trustee from such broker or other entity stating that it represents the deceased beneficial owner. Such broker or other entity shall be responsible for disbursing any payments it receives pursuant to exercise of the Survivor's Option to the appropriate Representative.

If fewer than all of the Notes subject to redemption are to be redeemed, the Notes to be redeemed shall be selected by the Trustee by such method as the Trustee shall deem fair and reasonable.
 
If one or more Repayment Dates (or range of Repayment Dates) is specified on the face hereof, this Note will be subject to repayment, in whole or in part, on any such Repayment Date (or during any such range of Repayment Dates) at the option of the Holder hereof upon not less than 30 days' nor more than 60 days' prior written notice, at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount to be repaid, together with interest accrued to the date fixed for repayment. Unless otherwise specified on the face hereof, notice of the Holder's option to elect repayment hereof shall consist of the delivery to the Trustee of either (i) this Note with the form on the reverse hereof entitled "Option to Elect Repayment" duly completed (with signature guaranteed), or (ii) a telegram, facsimile transmission or a letter from a member of a national securities exchange, or of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., or a commercial bank or trust company in the United States, setting forth the name of the Holder hereof, the principal amount hereof, the principal amount to be repaid, the certificate number or a description of the tenor and terms hereof and a statement that the option to elect repayment is being exercised thereby and a guarantee that this Note to be repaid, together with the duly completed form (with signature guaranteed) entitled "Option to Elect Repayment" on the reverse of this Note will be received by the Trustee, in each case, not later than the fifth Business Day after the date of such telegram, facsimile transmission or letter; provided, however, that such telegram, facsimile transmission or letter shall only be effective if this Note and such form, duly completed, are received by the Trustee by such fifth Business Day. Such option may be exercised with respect to less than the entire principal amount of this Note, provided that the portion remaining Outstanding after such repayment shall be in an authorized denomination. Exercise of a repayment option by the Holder of this Note will be irrevocable unless otherwise specified on the face hereof.
 
In the event of redemption or repayment of this Note in part only, a new Note or Notes of this series and of a like tenor for the unredeemed portion hereof will be issued in the name of the Holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof.
 
If so specified on the face of this Note, the Maturity Date will be automatically extended for such periods and at such times as are set forth herein unless the Holder of the Note elects to terminate the automatic extension of the Note. The periods and times for which the maturity of the Note is to be automatically renewed, the date beyond which the maturity may not be so renewed, the procedures for the Holder of the Note to elect repayment of the Note in the event of such renewal and other details must be set forth on the face hereof.
 
If this Note is an Amortizing Note as shown on the face hereof or in the pricing supplement attached hereto or delivered herewith, a portion or all the principal amount of this Note is payable prior to the Stated Maturity Date in accordance with a schedule or by application of a formula.
 
Except as otherwise specified herein, this Note shall bear interest at the rate determined by reference to the applicable Base Rate or Rates specified on the face hereof (i) plus or minus the applicable Spread, if any, and/or (ii) multiplied by the applicable Spread Multiplier, if any, specified on the face hereof and applied in the manner described below. Commencing on the Initial Interest Reset Date, the rate at which interest on this Note is payable shall reset as of each Interest Reset Date specified on the face hereof; provided, however, that the interest rate in effect for the period from the Original Issue Date to the Initial Interest Reset Date will be the Initial Interest Rate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if this Note is designated above as having an Addendum hereto or if the "Other Provisions" specified on the face hereof apply, this Note shall bear interest in accordance with the terms specified in such Addendum or "Other Provisions".
 
The interest rate applicable to each Interest Reset Period specified on the face hereof commencing on the Interest Reset Date with respect to such Interest Reset Period will be the rate determined as of the applicable Interest Determination Date (as defined below) on or prior to the Calculation Date (as defined below, if any). Unless otherwise specified on the face hereof, the "Interest Determination Date" with respect to an Interest Reset Date will be (a) the second Business Day immediately preceding such Interest Reset Date if the CD Rate, the Commercial Paper Rate, the CMT Rate, the Prime Rate and the Federal Funds Rate (each as defined below) is an applicable Base Rate, (b) the last working day of the month immediately preceding each Interest Reset Date on which the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco (the "FHLB of San Francisco") publishes the Index (as defined below) if the Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate (as defined below) is an applicable Base Rate, (c) the second London Business Day (as defined below) immediately preceding such Interest Reset Date if LIBOR (as defined below) is an applicable Base Rate, and (d) the day of the week in which the Interest Reset Date falls on which Treasury Bills (as defined below) are normally auctioned (Treasury Bills are normally sold at auction on Monday of each week, unless that day is a legal holiday, in which case the auction is normally held on the following Tuesday, except that such auction may be held on the preceding Friday), if the Treasury Rate (as defined below) is an applicable Base Rate; provided, however, that if as a result of a legal holiday an auction is held on the Friday of the week preceding an Interest Reset Date, the related Interest Determination Date shall be such preceding Friday; and provided, further, that if an auction shall fall on any Interest Reset Date, then the Interest Reset Date shall instead be the first Business Day following such auction. If the interest rate pertaining to this Note is determined with reference to two or more Base Rates, the "Interest Determination Date" will be the first Business Day which is at least two Business Days prior to such Interest Reset Date on which each Base Rate shall be determinable. Each Base Rate will be determined on such date, and the applicable interest rate will take effect on the related Interest Reset Date.
 
If any Interest Payment Date other than the Maturity Date for this Note falls on a day that is not a Business Day, such Interest Payment Date will be postponed to the next succeeding day that is a Business Day, except that, in case LIBOR is an applicable Base Rate, if such Business Day falls in the next succeeding calendar month, such Interest Payment Date will be the immediately preceding Business Day. If the Maturity Date of this Note falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the related payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest will be made on the next succeeding Business Day as if it were made on the date such payment was due, and no interest will accrue on the amount so payable for the period from and after the Maturity Date to the date of payment on such next succeeding Business Day. The term "Business Day" means any day that is (i) neither a Saturday or Sunday, nor a legal holiday nor a day on which banking
 
institutions in The City of New York are authorized or obligated by law, regulation or executive order to close and, (ii) with respect to any floating rate Note, for which LIBOR is an applicable Base Rate, a London Business Day. A London Business Day means a day on which commercial banks are open for business (including dealings in U.S. dollars) in London.
 
Unless otherwise specified herein, interest payable on this Note on any Interest Payment Date or the Maturity Date shall be the amount of interest accrued from and including the immediately preceding Interest Payment Date in respect of which interest has been paid or duly provided for (or from and including the Original Issue Date specified on the face hereof, if no interest has been paid or duly provided for) to but excluding the applicable Interest Payment Date or the Maturity Date, as the case may be (each, an "Interest Period").
 
With respect to this Note, accrued interest for any Interest Period will be calculated by multiplying the principal amount of this Note by an accrued interest factor. Such accrued interest factor is computed by adding the interest factor calculated for each day in such Interest Period. The interest factor for each such day is computed by dividing the interest rate applicable to such day by 360 (or, in the case of CMT Rate Notes, Treasury Rate Notes or a Note for which the CMT Rate or the Treasury Rate is an applicable Base Rate, by the actual number of days in the year).
 
All percentages resulting from any calculation on this Note will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one-hundred-thousandth of a percentage point, with five one-millionths of a percentage point rounded upward (e.g., 9.876545% (or 0.09876545) will be rounded upward to 9.87655% (or 0.0987655)), and all dollar amounts used in or resulting from such calculation on this Note will be rounded to the nearest cent (with one-half cent being rounded upward).
 
Unless otherwise specified on the face hereof, the Company shall be the Calculation Agent (the "Calculation Agent") with respect to Notes (including this Note) bearing interest at floating rates. The Calculation Agent will calculate the interest rate applicable to this Note on or before the Calculation Date, if any. Upon the request of the Holder hereof, the Calculation Agent will provide the interest rate then in effect and, if determined, the interest rate which will become effective on the next Interest Reset Date with respect to this Note.
 
The "Calculation Date", where applicable, pertaining to any Interest Determination Date will be the earlier of (i) the tenth calendar day after such Interest Determination Date or, if such day is not a Business Day, the next succeeding Business Day or (ii) the Business Day immediately preceding the applicable Interest Payment Date or the Maturity Date, as the case maybe.
 
Determination of CD Rate.
 
If the Base Rate for this Note is the CD Rate, as specified on the face hereof, the CD Rate shall be determined as of the applicable Interest Determination Date (a "CD Rate Interest Determination Date") as the rate on such day for negotiable United States dollar certificates of deposit having the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof as published in H.15(519) (as defined below) under the heading "CDs (secondary market)" or, if not so published by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the relevant Calculation Date, then the CD Rate will be the rate on such
 
CD Rate Interest Determination Date for negotiable United States dollar certificates of deposit of the specified Index Maturity as published in H.15 Daily Update (as defined below), or such other recognized electronic source used for the purpose of displaying such rate, under the caption "CDs (secondary market)." If such rate is not published in either H.15(519), H.15 Daily Update or another recognized electronic source by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on such Calculation Date, then the CD Rate on such CD Rate Interest Determination Date will be calculated by the Calculation Agent and will be the arithmetic mean of the secondary market offered rates as of 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on such CD Rate Interest Determination Date, of three leading nonbank dealers in negotiable United States dollar certificates of deposit in The City of New York selected by the Calculation Agent (after consultation with the Company) for negotiable United States dollar certificates of deposit of major United States money market banks for negotiable certificates of deposit with a remaining maturity closest to the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof in an amount that is representative for a single transaction in that market at that time; provided, however, that if the dealers selected as aforesaid by the Calculation Agent are not quoting as set forth above, the CD Rate with respect to such CD Interest Rate Determination Date will remain the CD Rate for the immediately preceding Interest Reset Period or if there was no Interest Reset Period, the rate of interest payable will be the Initial Interest Rate.
 
"H.15(519)" means the weekly statistical release designated as such, or any successor publication, published by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.
 
"H.15 Daily Update" means the daily update of H.15(519), available through the worldwide-web site of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System at http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h15/update, or any successor site or publication.
 
Determination of Commercial Paper Rate.
 
If the Base Rate for this Note is the Commercial Paper Rate, as specified on the face hereof, the Commercial Paper Rate shall be determined as of the applicable Interest Determination Date (a "Commercial Paper Rate Interest Determination Date") as the Money Market Yield (as defined below) on such date of the rate for commercial paper having the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof as published in H.15 (519) under the heading "Commercial PaperNonfinancial" or, if not so published by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the related Calculation Date, then the Commercial Paper Rate shall be the Money Market Yield of the rate on such Commercial Paper Rate Interest Determination Date for commercial paper of the specified Index Maturity as published in H.15 Daily Update, or such other recognized electronic source used for the purpose of displaying such rate, under the caption "Commercial PaperNonfinancial". If such rate is not yet published in H.15(519), H.15 Daily Update or another electronic source by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on such Calculation Date, then the Commercial Paper Rate for such Commercial Paper Rate Interest Determination Date shall be calculated by the Calculation Agent and shall be the Money Market Yield of the arithmetic mean of the offered rates, as of 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on such Commercial Paper Rate Interest Determination Date of three leading dealers of United States dollar commercial paper in The City of New York selected by the Calculation Agent (after consultation with the Company) for commercial paper having the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof placed for industrial issuers whose bond rating is "Aa", or the equivalent, from a nationally recognized statistical
 
rating organization; provided, however, that if the dealers selected as aforesaid by the Calculation Agent are not quoting as set forth above, the Commercial Paper Rate with respect to such Commercial Paper Rate Interest Determination Date will remain the Commercial Paper Rate for the immediately preceding Interest Reset Period, or if there was no Interest Reset Period, the rate of interest payable will be the Initial Interest Rate.
 
"Money Market Yield" shall be the yield (expressed as a percentage) calculated in accordance with the following formula:
 
 
where "D" refers to the per annum rate for commercial paper quoted on a bank discount basis and expressed as a decimal, and where "M" refers to the actual number of days in the applicable Interest Reset Period.
 
Determination of CMT Rate.
 
If the Base Rate for this Note is the CMT Rate, as specified on the face hereof, the CMT Rate shall be determined as of the applicable Interest Determination Date (a "CMT Rate Interest Determination Date") as the rate displayed on the Designated CMT Telerate Page (as defined below) under the caption "...Treasury Constant Maturities...Federal Reserve Board Release H.15...Mondays Approximately 3:45 P.M.", under the column for the Designated CMT Maturity Index (as defined below) for (i) if the Designated CMT Telerate Page is 7051, the rate on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date and (ii) if the Designated CMT Telerate Page is 7052, the weekly or monthly average, as specified on the face hereof, for the week, or the month, as applicable, ended immediately preceding the week or month, as applicable, in which the related CMT Rate Interest Determination Date falls. If such rate is no longer displayed on the relevant page, or if not displayed by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the related Calculation Date, then the CMT Rate for such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date will be such treasury constant maturity rate for the Designated CMT Maturity Index as published in H.15(519). If such rate is no longer displayed on the relevant page, or if not published by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the related Calculation Date, then the CMT Rate for such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date will be such treasury constant maturity rate for the Designated CMT Maturity Index (or other United States Treasury rate for the Designated CMT Maturity Index) for the CMT Rate Interest Determination Date with respect to such Interest Reset Date as may then be published by either the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or the United States Department of the Treasury that the Calculation Agent determines to be comparable to the rate formerly displayed on the Designated CMT Telerate Page and published in H.15(519). If such information is not provided by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the related Calculation Date, then the CMT Rate for the CMT Rate Interest Determination Date will be calculated by the Calculation Agent and will be a yield to maturity, based on the arithmetic mean of the secondary market offered rates as of approximately 3:30 p.m., New York City time, on the CMT Rate Interest Determination Date reported, according to their written records, by three leading primary United States government securities dealers in The City of New York (each, a "Reference Dealer") selected by the Calculation Agent (from five such Reference Dealers selected by the Calculation Agent and eliminating the highest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the highest) and
 
the lowest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the lowest)), for the most recently issued direct noncallable fixed rate obligations of the United States ("Treasury Notes") with an original maturity of approximately the Designated CMT Maturity Index and a remaining term to maturity of not less than such Designated CMT Maturity Index minus one year. If the Calculation Agent is unable to obtain three such Treasury Note quotations, the CMT Rate for such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date will be calculated by the Calculation Agent and will be a yield to maturity based on the arithmetic mean of the secondary market offered rates as of approximately 3:30 p.m., New York City time, on the CMT Rate Interest Determination Date of three Reference Dealers in The City of New York (from five such Reference Dealers selected by the Calculation Agent and eliminating the highest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the highest) and the lowest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the lowest)), for Treasury Notes with an original maturity of the number of years that is the next highest to the Designated CMT Maturity Index and a remaining term to maturity closest to the Designated CMT Maturity Index and in an amount of at least U.S.$100 million. If three or four (and not five) of such Reference Dealers are quoting as set forth above, then the CMT Rate will be based on the arithmetic mean of the offered rates obtained and neither the highest nor lowest of such quotes will be eliminated; provided, however, that if fewer than three Reference Dealers selected by the Calculation Agent are quoting as set forth above, the CMT Rate with respect to such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date will remain the CMT Rate for the immediately preceding Interest Reset Period, or if there was no Interest Reset Period, the rate of interest payable will be the Initial Interest Rate. If two Treasury Notes with an original maturity as described in the second preceding sentence have remaining terms to maturity equally close to the Designated CMT Maturity Index, then the quotes for the Treasury Note with the shorter remaining term to maturity will be used.
 
"Designated CMT Maturity Index" means the original period to maturity of the U.S. Treasury securities (either 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 20 or 30 years) specified on the face hereof with respect to which the CMT Rate will be calculated. If no such maturity is specified herein, the Designated CMT Maturity Index shall be 2 years.
 
"Designated CMT Telerate Page" means the display on MoneyLine Telerate (or any successor service) on the page specified on the face hereof (or any other page as may replace such page on that service) for the purpose of displaying Treasury Constant Maturities as reported in H.15(519). If no such page is specified herein, the Designated CMT Telerate Page shall be page 7052.
 
Determination of LIBOR.
 
"LIBOR" means the rate determined by the Calculation Agent in accordance with the following provisions:
 
(i) If the Base Rate for this Note is LIBOR, as specified on the face hereof, LIBOR shall be determined as of the applicable Interest Determination Date (a "LIBOR Interest Determination Date"), as either: (a) if "LIBOR Reuters" is specified on the face hereof, the arithmetic mean of the offered rates (unless the Designated LIBOR Page (as defined below) by its terms provides only for a single rate, in which case such single rate shall be used) for deposits in U.S. dollars, commencing on the applicable Interest Reset Date, that appear (or, if only a
 
single rate is required as aforesaid, appears) on the Designated LIBOR Page as of 11:00 a.m., London time, on such LIBOR Interest Determination Date, or (b) if "LIBOR Telerate" is specified on the face hereof or if neither "LIBOR Reuters" nor "LIBOR Telerate" is specified on the face hereof, the rate for deposits in U.S. dollars having the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof, commencing on such Interest Reset Date, that appears on the Designated LIBOR Page as of 11:00 a.m., London time, on such LIBOR Interest Determination Date. If fewer than two offered rates appear, or no rate appears, as applicable, LIBOR in respect of such LIBOR Interest Determination Date will be determined as if the parties had specified the rate described in clause (ii) below.
 
(ii) With respect to a LIBOR Interest Determination Date on which fewer than two offered rates appear, or no rate appears, as the case may be, on the Designated LIBOR Page as specified in clause (i) above, the Calculation Agent will request the principal London offices of each of four major reference banks in the London interbank market, as selected by the Calculation Agent, to provide the Calculation Agent with its offered quotation for deposits in U.S. dollars for the period of the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof, commencing on the applicable Interest Reset Date, to prime banks in the London interbank market at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on such LIBOR Interest Determination Date and in a principal amount that is representative for a single transaction in U.S. dollars. If at least two such quotations are provided, then LIBOR on such LIBOR Interest Determination Date will be the arithmetic mean of such quotations. If fewer than two quotations are provided, then LIBOR on such LIBOR Interest Determination Date will be the arithmetic mean of the rates quoted at approximately 11:00 a.m. in The City of New York, on such LIBOR Interest Determination Date by three major banks in The City of New York, for loans in U.S. dollars to leading European banks having the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof and in a principal amount that is representative for a single transaction in U.S. dollars in The City of New York; provided, however, that if the banks selected by the Calculation Agent are not quoting as set forth above, LIBOR with respect to such LIBOR Interest Determination Date will remain LIBOR for the immediately preceding Interest Reset Period, or if there was no Interest Reset Period, the rate of interest payable will be the Initial Interest Rate.
 
"Designated LIBOR Page" means (a) if "LIBOR Reuters" is specified on the face hereof, the display on the Reuter Monitor Money Rates Service (or any successor service) on the page specified on the face hereof (or such other page as may replace such page on that service) for the purpose of displaying the London interbank rates of major banks for U.S. dollars, or (b) if "LIBOR Telerate" is specified on the face hereof or if neither "LIBOR Reuters" nor "LIBOR Telerate" is specified on the face hereof, the display on the MoneyLine Telerate (or any successor service) for the purpose of displaying the London interbank rates of major banks for U.S. dollars.
 
Determination of Prime Rate.
 
If the Base Rate for this Note is the Prime Rate, as specified on the face hereof, the Prime Rate shall be determined as of the applicable Interest Determination Date (a "Prime Rate Interest Determination Date") as the rate set forth on such date in H.15(519) under the caption "Bank Prime Loan" or, if not published by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the related Calculation Date, the rate on such Prime Rate Interest Determination Date as published in H.15 Daily
 
Update, or such other recognized electronic source used for the purpose of displaying such rate, under the caption "Bank Prime Loan." In the event that such rate is not yet published in H.15(519), H.15 Daily Update or another recognized electronic source by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the related Calculation Date, then the Prime Rate will be determined by the Calculation Agent and will be the arithmetic mean of the rates of interest publicly announced by each bank that appears on the Reuters Screen US PRIME 1 Page (as defined below) as such bank's prime rate or base lending rate as of 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on such Prime Rate Interest Determination Date. If fewer than four such rates appear on the Reuters Screen US PRIME 1 Page for such Prime Rate Interest Determination Date, then the Prime Rate will be determined by the Calculation Agent and will be the arithmetic mean of the prime rates or base lending rates quoted on the basis of the actual number of days in the year divided by a 360-day year as of the close of business on such Prime Rate Interest Determination Date by three major banks in New York City selected by the Calculation Agent (after consultation with the Company); provided, however, that if the banks selected are not quoting as set forth above, the Prime Rate with respect to such Prime Rate Interest Determination Date will remain the Prime Rate for the immediately preceding Interest Reset Period, or if there was no Interest Reset Period, the rate of interest payable will be the Initial Interest Rate.
 
"Reuters Screen US PRIME 1 Page" means the display on the Reuter Monitor Money Rates Service (or any successor service) on the "US PRIME 1" page (or such other page as may replace the US PRIME 1 page on that service) for the purpose of displaying prime rates or base lending rates of major United States banks.
 
Determination of Treasury Rate.
 
If the Base Rate for this Note is the Treasury Rate, as specified on the face hereof, the Treasury Rate shall be determined as of the applicable Interest Determination Date (a "Treasury Rate Interest Determination Date") as the rate from the auction held on such Treasury Rate Interest Determination Date (the "Auction") of direct obligations of the United States ("Treasury Bills") having the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof under the caption "INVESTMENT RATE" on the display on MoneyLine Telerate (or any successor service) on page 56 (or any other page as may replace such page on such service) ("Telerate Page 56") or page 57 (or any other page as may replace such page on such service) ("Telerate Page 57") or, if not so published by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the related Calculation Date, the Bond Equivalent Yield (as defined below) of the rate for such Treasury Bills as published in H.15 Daily Update, or such other recognized electronic source used for the purpose of displaying such rate, under the caption "U.S. Government Securities/Treasury Bills/Auction High" or, if not so published by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the related Calculation Date, the Bond Equivalent Yield of the auction rate of such Treasury Bills as announced by the United States Department of the Treasury. In the event that the auction rate of Treasury Bills having the Index Maturity specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement is not so announced by the United States Department of the Treasury, or if no such Auction is held, then the Treasury Rate will be the Bond Equivalent Yield of the rate on such Treasury Rate Interest Determination Date of Treasury Bills having the Index Maturity specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement as published in H.15(519) under the caption "U.S. Government Securities/Treasury Bills/Secondary Market" or, if not yet published by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the related Calculation Date, the rate on such Treasury Rate Interest Determination Date of such Treasury Bills as published in H.15 Daily Update, or such other
 
recognized electronic source used for the purpose of displaying such rate, under the caption "U.S. Government Securities/Treasury Bills/Secondary Market." If such rate is not yet published in H.15(519), H.15 Daily Update or another recognized electronic source, then the Treasury Rate will be calculated by the Calculation Agent and will be the Bond Equivalent Yield of the arithmetic mean of the secondary market bid rates, as of approximately 3:30 p.m., New York City time, on such Treasury Rate Interest Determination Date, of three leading primary United States government securities dealers selected by the Calculation Agent (after consultation with the Company), for the issue of Treasury Bills with a remaining maturity closest to the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof; provided, however, that if the dealers selected as aforesaid by the Calculation Agent are not quoting as set forth above, the Treasury Rate with respect to such Treasury Rate Interest Determination Date will remain the Treasury Rate for the immediately preceding Interest Reset Period, or if there was no Interest Reset Period, the rate of interest payable will be the Initial Interest Rate.
 
"Bond Equivalent Yield" means a yield (expressed as a percentage) calculated in accordance with the following formula:
 
 
where "D" refers to the applicable per annum rate for Treasury Bills quoted on a bank discount basis, "N" refers to 365 or 366, as the case may be, and "M" refers to the actual number of days in the applicable Interest Reset Period.
 
Determination of Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate.
 
If the Base Rate for this Note is the Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate, as specified on the face hereof, the Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate shall be determined as of the applicable Interest Determination Date (an "Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate Interest Determination Date") as the rate equal to the monthly weighted average cost of funds for the calendar month immediately preceding the month in which such Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate Interest Determination Date falls as set forth under the caption "11th District" on the display on MoneyLine Telerate (or any successor service) on page 7058 (or any other page as may replace such page on such service) ("Telerate Page 7058") as of 11:00 a.m., San Francisco time, on such Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate Interest Determination Date. If such rate does not appear on Telerate Page 7058 on such Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate Interest Determination Date, then the Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate for such Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate Interest Determination Date shall be the monthly weighted average cost of funds paid by member institutions of the Eleventh Federal Home Loan Bank District that was most recently announced (the "Index") by the FHLB of San Francisco as such cost of funds for the calendar month immediately preceding such Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate Interest Determination Date. If the FHLB of San Francisco fails to announce the Index on or prior to such Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate Interest Determination Date for the calendar month immediately preceding such Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate Interest Determination Date, the Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate with respect to such Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate Interest Determination
 
Date will remain the Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate for the immediately preceding Interest Reset Period, or if there was no Interest Reset Period, the rate of interest payable will be the Initial Interest Rate.
 
Determination of Federal Funds Rate.
 
If the Base Rate for this Note is the Federal Funds Rate, as specified on the face hereof, the Federal Funds Rate shall be determined as of the applicable Interest Determination Date (a "Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date") as the rate on that date for United States dollar federal funds as published in H.15(519) under the heading "Federal Funds (Effective)" as such rate is displayed on MoneyLine Telerate (or any successor service) on page 120 (or any other page as may replace such page on such service) ("Telerate Page 120"), or, if such rate does not appear on Telerate Page 120 or, if not so published by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the related Calculation Date, then the Federal Funds Rate will be the rate on such Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date for United States dollar federal funds as published in H.15 Daily Update, or such other recognized electronic source used for the purpose of displaying such rate, under the caption "Federal Funds (Effective)." If such rate does not appear on Telerate Page 120 or is not yet published in H.15(519), H.15 Daily Update or another electronic source by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the related Calculation Date, then the Federal Funds Rate for such Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date will be calculated by the Calculation Agent and will be the arithmetic mean of the rates for the last transaction in overnight United States dollar federal funds arranged by three leading brokers of United States dollar federal funds transactions in The City of New York selected by the Calculation Agent (after consultation with the Company) prior to 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on such Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date; provided, however, that if the brokers selected as aforesaid by the Calculation Agent are not quoting as set forth above, the Federal Funds Rate with respect to such Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date will remain the Federal Funds Rate for the immediately preceding Interest Reset Period, or if there was no Interest Reset Period, the rate of interest payable will be the Initial Interest Rate.
 
Any provision contained herein, including the determination of a Base Rate, the specification of a Base Rate, calculation of the interest rate applicable to this Note, the Interest Payment Dates or any other matter relating hereto, may be modified as specified in an Addendum hereto if so specified on the face hereof.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the interest rate hereon shall not be greater than the Maximum Interest Rate, if any, or less than the Minimum Interest Rate, if any, specified on the face hereof. In addition to any Maximum Interest Rate applicable hereto pursuant to the above provisions, the interest rate on this Note will in no event be higher than the maximum rate permitted by New York law, as the same may be modified by United States law of general application.

If the Survivor's Option is applicable to this Note, the Representative (defined below) of a deceased beneficial owner of the Note shall have the option to elect repayment or repurchase of such Note following the death of the beneficial owner (a "Survivor's Option"). Unless specifically provided on the face of this Note, the Survivor's Option may not be exercised unless the Note was acquired by the beneficial owner at least six months prior to such election.
 
If the Survivor's Option is applicable to this Note, upon the valid exercise of the Survivor's Option, the Company shall repay or repurchase, at its option, the Note (or portion thereof), properly tendered for repayment or repurchase by or on behalf of the person (the "Representative") that has authority to act on behalf of the deceased beneficial owner of a Note under the laws of the appropriate jurisdiction (including, without limitation, the personal representative or executor of the deceased beneficial owner or the surviving joint owner of the deceased beneficial owner) at a price equal to 100% of the amortized principal amount of the deceased beneficial owner's beneficial interest in such Note plus accrued interest to the date of such repayment or repurchase, subject to the following limitations:
 
(a) The Company may, in its sole discretion, limit the aggregate principal amount of Notes as to which exercises of the Survivor's Option shall be accepted from all deceased beneficial owners in any calendar year (the "Annual Put Limitation") to an amount equal to the greater of $2,000,000 or 2% of the principal amount of all Notes as of the end of the most recent calendar year, or such greater amount as the Company in its sole discretion may determine for any calendar year, and may limit to $250,000, or such greater amount as the Company in its sole discretion may determine for any calendar year, the aggregate principal amount of acceptances of exercise of the Survivor's Option in such calendar year for any individual deceased beneficial owner (the "Individual Put Limitation").
 
(b) The Company shall not make principal repayments pursuant to exercise of the Survivor's Option in amounts that are less than $1,000, and, in the event that the limitations described in the preceding sentence would result in the partial repayment of any Note, the principal amount of such Note remaining Outstanding after repayment must be at least $1,000 (the minimum authorized denomination of the Notes).
 
(c) Any Note (or portion thereof) tendered pursuant to a valid exercise of the Survivor's Option may not be withdrawn.
 
Each Note (or portion thereof) that is tendered pursuant to valid exercise of the Survivor's Option shall be accepted in the order of all such Notes are received by the Trustee, except for any Note (or portion thereof) the acceptance of which would contravene (i) the Annual Put Limitation, if applied, or (ii) the Individual Put Limitation, if applied, with respect to the relevant individual deceased beneficial owner. If, as of the end of any calendar year, the aggregate principal amount of Notes (or portions thereof) that have been tendered pursuant to the valid exercise of the Survivor's Option during such year has exceeded either the Annual Put Limitation, if applied, or the Individual Put Limitation, if applied, for such year, any exercise(s) of the Survivor's Option with respect to Notes (or portions thereof) not accepted during such
 
calendar year because such acceptance would have contravened either such limitation, if applied, shall be deemed to be tendered in the following calendar year in the order all such Notes (or portions thereof) were originally tendered. Any Note (or portion thereof) accepted for repayment or repurchase pursuant to exercise of the Survivor's Option shall be repaid or repurchased on the first Interest Payment Date that occurs 20 or more calendar days after the date of such acceptance. In the event that a Note (or any portion thereof) tendered for repayment or repurchase pursuant to valid exercise of the Survivor's Option is not accepted, the Trustee shall deliver a notice by first-class mail to the registered holder thereof, at its last known address as indicated in the Note Register, that states the reason such Note (or portion thereof) has not been accepted for payment.
 
In order for a Survivor's Option to be validly exercised with respect to any Note (or portion thereof), the Trustee must receive from the Representative (i) a written request for repayment or repurchase signed by the Representative, and such signature must be guaranteed by a member firm of a registered national securities exchange or of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (the "NASD") or a commercial bank or trust company having an office or correspondent in the United States, (ii) tender of a Note (or portion thereof) to be repaid or repurchased, (iii) appropriate evidence satisfactory to the Company and the Trustee that (A) the deceased was the beneficial owner of such Note at the time of death and the interest in such note was acquired by the deceased beneficial owner at least six months prior to the request for repayment or repurchase, (B) the death of such beneficial owner has occurred, and the date of such death, and (C) the Representative has authority to act on behalf of the deceased beneficial owner, (iv) if applicable, a properly executed assignment or endorsement, (v) if the interest in such Note is held by a nominee of the deceased beneficial owner, a certificate satisfactory to the Company and the Trustee from such nominee attesting to the deceased's beneficial ownership in such Note, (vi) tax waivers and such other instruments or documents that the Company or the Trustee reasonably requires in order to establish the validity of the beneficial ownership of the Notes and the claimant's entitlement to payment, and (vii) any additional information the Company or the Trustee requires to evidence satisfaction of any conditions to the exercise of such Survivor's Option or to document beneficial ownership or authority to make the election and to cause the repayment or repurchase of such Note. All questions as to the eligibility or validity of any exercise of the Survivor's Option will be determined by the Company, in its sole discretion, which determination shall be final and binding on all parties.
 
The death of a person holding a beneficial interest in a Note as a joint tenant or tenant by the entirety with another person, or as a tenant in common with the deceased holder's spouse, will be deemed the death of the beneficial owner of the Note, and the entire principal amount of the Note so held shall be subject to repayment or repurchase. However, the death of a person holding a beneficial interest in a note as tenant in common with a person other than such deceased holder's spouse will be deemed the death of a beneficial owner only with respect to the deceased person's interest in the Note. The death of a person who, during his or her lifetime, was entitled to substantially all of the beneficial interests of ownership of a Note will be deemed the death of the beneficial owner of such note for purposes of this provision, regardless of the registered holder of the Note, if such beneficial interest can be established to the satisfaction of the Company and the Trustee. Such beneficial interest will be deemed to exist in typical cases of nominee ownership, ownership under the Uniform Transfers to Minors Act or Uniform Gifts to Minors Act, community property or other joint ownership arrangements between a husband and
 
wife. In addition, the beneficial interest will be deemed to exist in custodial and trust arrangements where one person has all of the beneficial ownership interest in the Note during his or her lifetime.
 
Because the Notes are represented by a Global Note, the Depository or its nominee shall be the holder of such Note and therefore shall be the only entity that can exercise the Survivor's Option for such Note. To obtain repayment or repurchase pursuant to exercise of the Survivor's Option with respect to such Note, the Representative must provide to the broker or other entity through which the beneficial interest in such Note is held by the deceased beneficial owner (i) the documents described in the second preceding paragraph and (ii) instructions to such broker or other entity to notify the Depository of such Representative's desire to obtain repayment or repurchase pursuant to exercise of the Survivor's Option. Such broker or other entity shall provide to the Trustee (i) the documents received from the Representative referred to in clause (i) of the preceding sentence and (ii) a certificate satisfactory to the Company and the Trustee from such broker or other entity stating that it represents the deceased beneficial owner. Such broker or other entity shall be responsible for disbursing any payments it receives pursuant to exercise of the Survivor's Option to the appropriate Representative.
