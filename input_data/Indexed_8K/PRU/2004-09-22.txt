Forward Looking Statements and
Non-GAAP Measure
We will make some forward-looking statements in the following presentations. It is possible that actual results may differ materially from the predictions we make today. Additional information regarding factors that could cause such a difference appears in the section titled "Forward-Looking Statements" of our earnings press release for the second quarter of 2004, which can be found on our Web site at www.investor.prudential.com.
In managing our businesses, we use a non-GAAP measure we call "adjusted operating income" to measure the performance of our Financial Services Businesses (FSB). Return on equity for the businesses of the International Insurance and Investments Division is based on equity (excluding unrealized gains/losses on investments) and after-tax adjusted operating income (based on the effective tax rate applicable to adjusted operating income of the FSB as a whole for the period or periods indicated). Adjusted operating income excludes net realized investment gains/losses and related charges and adjustments, and results from divested businesses. Adjusted operating income also excludes discontinued operations, an extraordinary gain in the second quarter of 2004 on an acquisition, and a charge in the first quarter of 2004 for the cumulative effect of an accounting change, which are presented as separate components of net income under GAAP. In the second quarter of 2004, as a result of the acquisition of the retirement business of CIGNA Corporation, the definition of adjusted operating income was modified to exclude recorded changes in asset values that will ultimately inure to contractholders and recorded changes in contractholder liabilities resulting from changes in related asset values. For additional information about adjusted operating income and the comparable GAAP measure please refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for 2003 and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2004, on the Investor Relations Web site at http://www.investor.prudential.com.
Additional historical information relating to the Company's financial performance, including its second quarter 2004 Quarterly Financial Supplement, is also located on the Investor Relations Web site.

Business model  Needs Based Selling
What do we mean by needs based selling of life insurance?
We are in the life insurance business.
 However 
We are not in business to sell life insurance as a product. We are in the business to sell life insurance as a solution.
 That means 
We are in the business to help our clients understand their insurance needs, and then to help them meet those needs.
