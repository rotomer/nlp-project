Exhibit 99.0
 
 
 
 
 
 
Prudential Financial, Inc. (NYSE:PRU) announced today 2005 earnings per share guidance at its Investor Day conference in New York City. Management stated its expectation that Prudential Financial would achieve Common Stock earnings per share in the range of $4.20 to $4.40 for 2005, based on after-tax adjusted operating income of the Financial Services Businesses. The 2005 expectation assumes appreciation in the S&P 500 Index of 8 percent for the year and a number of additional factors that are in the company's Current Report on Form 8-K dated December 2, 2004 filed earlier today with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Management also reaffirmed its previous guidance that Prudential Financial expects that it will achieve Common Stock earnings per share in the range of $3.30 to $3.40 for the year 2004, based on after-tax adjusted operating income of the Financial Services Businesses.
NEWARK, N.J. 
 
Adjusted operating income, which is not measured in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), should not be viewed as a substitute for net income determined in accordance with GAAP, and our definition of adjusted operating income, which can be found below under "Non-GAAP Financial Measure," may differ from that used by other companies.
 
Prudential Financial companies, with approximately $470 billion in total assets under management as of September 30, 2004, serve individual and institutional customers worldwide and include The Prudential Insurance Company of America, one of the largest life insurance companies in the United States. These companies offer a variety of products and services, including life insurance, mutual funds, annuities, pension and retirement related services and administration, asset management, securities brokerage, banking and trust services, real estate brokerage franchises and relocation services.

Non-GAAP Financial Measure
 
 
 
Adjusted operating income excludes net realized investment gains and losses. A significant element of realized losses is impairments and losses from sales of credit-impaired securities, the timing of which depends largely on market credit cycles and can vary considerably across periods. The timing of other sales that would result in gains or losses is largely subject to our discretion and influenced by market opportunities. Similarly, adjusted operating income excludes investment gains and losses on trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities and changes in experience-rated contractholder liabilities due to asset value changes, because these recorded changes in asset and liability values will ultimately inure to contractholders. Trends in the underlying profitability of our businesses can be more clearly identified without the fluctuating effects of these transactions. Adjusted operating income also excludes the results of divested businesses, which are not relevant to our ongoing operations. Because we do not predict future realized investment gains/losses or recorded changes in asset and liability values that will ultimately inure to contractholders, we cannot provide a measure of our Common Stock earnings per share expectation based on income from continuing operations of the Financial Services Businesses, which is the GAAP measure most comparable to adjusted operating income. We believe that the presentation of adjusted operating income as we measure it for management purposes enhances the understanding of our results of operations by highlighting the results from ongoing operations and the underlying profitability factors of our businesses.
