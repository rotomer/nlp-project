Inc., Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., Goldman, Sachs & Co., Lehman Brothers Inc., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, Morgan Stanley & Co.

Series C, Due One Year or More from Date of Issue (the "Notes"), as described herein (the "Agreement").
 
As of the date hereof, the Company has authorized the issuance and sale of the Notes in an aggregate principal amount, including in the case of Original Issue Discount Notes (as defined below), the aggregate initial offering price thereof, which will not exceed $2,500,000,000 at any one time outstanding, pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. It is understood, however, that the Company will have the option, at any time, to increase the amount of Notes that may be issued and that such additional Notes may be sold pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, all as though the issuance of such Notes were authorized as of the date hereof. The Notes are to be offered under the senior debt securities indenture dated as of April 25, 2003 (as amended and supplemented from time to time, the "Indenture"), between the Company and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (formerly known as JPMorgan Chase Bank), as Trustee (the "Trustee"), and will have the maturities, interest rates, redemption provisions, if any, and other terms as set forth in supplements to the Prospectus referred to below.
 
This Agreement provides both for the sale of Notes by the Company to one or more of the Agents as principal for resale to investors and other purchasers and for the sale of Notes by the Company directly to investors (as may from time to time be agreed to by the Company and the related Agent or Agents), in which case the Agents will act as agents of the Company in soliciting purchases of the Notes. All such sales and resales will be made pursuant to the restrictions set forth herein.
 
The Company has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") a registration statement (File Nos. 333-123240, 333-123240-01 and 333-123240-02), including a prospectus, relating to the Notes. Such registration statement, including the exhibits thereto, as amended as of the date hereof, is hereinafter referred to as the "Registration Statement". The Company proposes to file with the Commission from time to time, pursuant to Rule 424 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), supplements to the prospectus included in the Registration Statement that will describe certain terms of the Notes. The prospectus in the form in which it appears in the Registration Statement is hereinafter referred to as the "Basic Prospectus". The term "Prospectus" means the Basic Prospectus together with the prospectus supplement or supplements (each a "Prospectus Supplement") specifically relating to Notes, as filed with, or transmitted for filing to, the Commission pursuant to Rule 424 under the Securities Act. As used herein, the terms "Basic Prospectus" and "Prospectus" shall include in each case the documents, if any, incorporated by reference therein. The terms "supplement" and "amendment" as used herein shall include all documents deemed to be incorporated by reference in the Prospectus that are filed subsequent to the date of the Basic Prospectus by the Company with the Commission pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and "amend" and "supplement" shall include the filing of such documents with the Commission.

agents for the Notes and acknowledges that the Agents shall have the exclusive right to assist the Company in the placement of the Notes during the term of this Agreement, subject to the appointment of additional agents from time to time. The Company agrees that, unless otherwise agreed, during the period the Agents are acting as the Company's placement agents hereunder, the Company will not engage any other person or party to assist in the placement of the Notes; , , that the Company may accept offers to purchase Notes through an agent other than an Agent if (i) the Company shall have executed a confirmation letter and such agent shall have executed an accession letter substantially in the form of Exhibits A and B, respectively, attached hereto and (ii) the Company shall have provided the Agents with copies of such letters promptly following the execution thereof.

(b) . The Agents will solicit offers to purchase the Notes upon the terms and conditions contained herein, and in connection therewith will use only the Prospectus (as defined in Section 2) which has been distributed most recently to the Agents by the Company as contemplated hereby (provided that such distribution occurs a reasonable amount of time in advance of such use).
Method of Solicitation
 
(c) . The Company shall not sell or approve the solicitation by any Agent or any other agent appointed pursuant to Section 1(a) hereof of purchases of Notes in excess of the amount which shall be authorized for issuance by the Company from time to time. The Agents will have no responsibility for maintaining records with respect to the aggregate principal amount of Notes issued or outstanding.
Issued and Outstanding Notes

No Agent shall have any liability to the Company in the event any such purchase is not consummated for any reason other than such Agent's failure to comply with the terms and conditions of this Agreement relating to such purchase. If the Company shall default on its obligation to deliver Notes to a purchaser whose offer it has accepted, the Company shall (i) hold the Agent which solicited such offer harmless against any loss, claim, damage or liability arising from or as a result of such default by the Company and (ii) notwithstanding such default, pay to such Agent any commission to which it would be entitled in connection with such sale, unless (x) such Agent shall have failed to comply with the terms and
Solicitations as Agents
 
conditions of this Agreement relating to such sale or (y) the Company has a reasonable basis to believe that, due to the nature of such purchaser, such sale would have violated any statute or law or any order, rule or regulation of any court or governmental agency or body having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its properties.
 
(f) . The Company and each Agent agree that any Notes purchased by an Agent shall be purchased, and any Notes the placement of which an Agent arranges shall be placed by such Agent, in reliance on the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the Company and on the terms and conditions contained herein and in the manner provided herein.

Upon receipt of instructions from the Company, the Agents will forthwith suspend solicitation of purchases from the Company until such time as the Company has advised the Agents that such solicitation may be resumed.
 
The Company agrees to pay each Agent a commission, which may be in the form of a discount or otherwise, equal to a percentage of the principal amount of each Note sold by the Company as a result of a solicitation made by such Agent and as specified in the applicable Terms Agreement and Pricing Supplement.
 
(d) . The purchase price, interest rate or formula, stated maturity date and other terms of the Notes (as applicable) specified in Annex 1 to Exhibit D hereto shall be agreed upon by the Company and the Agents and set forth in the Prospectus (or an amendment or supplement thereto). Administrative procedures with respect to the sale of Notes shall be agreed upon from time to time by the Agents and the Company (the "Procedures").

SECTION 4. Covenants of the Company.
 
The Company covenants and agrees with each Agent as follows:
 
(a) . Prior to the termination of the offering of the Notes pursuant to this Agreement or any Terms Agreement, the Company will not file any Prospectus Supplement relating to the Notes or any amendment to the Registration Statement unless the Company has previously furnished to the Agents copies thereof for their review and will not file any such proposed supplement or amendment to which the Agents reasonably object; , that (i) the foregoing requirement shall not apply to any of the Company's periodic filings with the Commission filed pursuant to Section 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, copies of which filings, in the case of quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and annual reports on Form 10-K, the Company will cause to be delivered to the Agents promptly after being transmitted for filing with the Commission and (ii) any Prospectus Supplement that merely sets forth the terms or a description of particular Notes (each a "Pricing Supplement") shall only be reviewed and approved by the Agent or Agents offering such Notes. Subject to the foregoing sentence, the Company will promptly cause each Prospectus Supplement to be filed with or transmitted for filing to the Commission in accordance with Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act. The Company will promptly advise the Agents (i) of the filing of any amendment or supplement to the Basic Prospectus (except that notice of the filing of an amendment or supplement to the Basic Prospectus that merely sets forth the terms or
Filing of Documents Incorporated by Reference; Material Changes
provided, however
 
a description of particular Notes shall only be given to the Agent or Agents offering such Notes), (ii) of the filing and effectiveness of any amendment to the Registration Statement, (iii) of any request by the Commission for any amendment to the Registration Statement or any amendment or supplement to the Basic Prospectus or for any additional information, (iv) of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or the institution or threatening of any proceeding for that purpose and (v) of the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of the Notes for sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose.

If the Basic Prospectus is amended or supplemented as a result of the filing under the Exchange Act of any document incorporated by reference in the Prospectus, no Agent shall be obligated to solicit offers to purchase Notes so long as it is not reasonably satisfied with such document.
 
Subject to Section 3(a)(iii) hereof, if any event shall occur or condition shall exist as a result of which the Prospectus, in the opinion of counsel for the Agents or counsel for the Company, includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or if in the opinion of any such counsel it is necessary at any time to amend or supplement the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, as then amended or supplemented, to comply with applicable law, the Company shall prior to the acceptance of any offer to purchase Notes or prior to the time an Agent solicits offers to purchase the Notes as agent to the Company prepare and, subject to this Section 4(a), cause to be filed with the Commission an amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, as then amended or supplemented, in form and substance satisfactory to counsel for the Agents, that corrects such untrue statement or omission or effects such compliance and shall furnish such amended or supplemented Prospectus to the Agents in such numbers as they may require.
 
(b) Reasonably in advance of each time any annual report of the Company filed under the Exchange Act is incorporated by reference into the Prospectus, and each time the Company sells Notes to such Agent as principal pursuant to a written Terms Agreement and such Terms Agreement specifies the delivery of an opinion or opinions by Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP, counsel to the Agents, as a condition to the purchase of Notes pursuant to such Terms Agreement, the Company shall furnish to such counsel such papers and information as they may reasonably request to enable them to furnish to such Agent the opinion or opinions referred to in Section 5(b) hereof.
Due Diligence.
 
(c) . The Company will endeavor, in cooperation with the Agents, to qualify the Notes for offering and sale under the applicable securities laws of such states and other jurisdictions of the United States as the Agents may reasonably designate, and will maintain such qualifications in effect for as long as may be required for the distribution of the Notes; , , that the Company shall not be obligated to file any general consent to service of process or to qualify as a foreign corporation in any jurisdiction in which it is not so qualified. The Company will file such statements and reports as may be required by the laws of each jurisdiction in which the Notes have been qualified as above provided. The
Blue Sky Qualifications
provided
however
 
Company will promptly advise the Agents of the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of the Notes for sale in any such state or jurisdiction or the initiating or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose.

Any notes sold under the Company's Euro-Medium-Term Note Programme or InterNotes program shall not be considered to be "substantially similar" to the Notes for purposes of the immediately preceding sentence.
Stand-Off Agreement

Earnings Statements.
 
(f) . The Company shall not be required to comply with the provisions of subsections (a) or (b) of this Section or the provisions of Section 7 hereof during any period from the time that the Agents (i) shall have been notified (such notice to be confirmed in writing) by the Company to suspend solicitation of offers to purchase the Notes in their capacity as agents and (ii) shall not then hold any Notes purchased as principal pursuant hereto, until the time the Company shall have notified the Agents (such notice to be confirmed in writing) of the Company's determination that solicitation of purchases of the Notes should be resumed or any Agent shall subsequently purchase Notes from the Company as principal and the Company has subsequently delivered such documents required by Section 7.

fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or that the Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, as of the date thereof (or, if such opinion is being delivered in connection with the purchase of Notes by any Agent as principal pursuant to Section 7(c) hereof, at the date of the applicable Terms Agreement and at the Settlement Date with respect thereto), includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Such counsel may also state that to the extent any of the opinions of this Section 5(a) involve (i) New Jersey law, such counsel has relied with the Agents' permission on the opinion of Susan L.

(e) . On or prior to (x) the time an Agent solicits offers to purchase the Notes as agents to the Company or (y) the time an Agent purchases Notes as principal pursuant to a Terms Agreement, as the case may be: (i) there shall not have occurred, since the date of the Terms Agreement in the case of a purchase by an Agent as principal, any downgrading nor shall any notice have been given of (A) downgrading, (B) any intended or potential downgrading or (C) any review or possible change with possible negative implications in the rating accorded any debt security or preferred stock of the Company by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization", as such term is defined by the Commission for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Securities Act; (ii) there shall not have been since the respective dates as to which information is given in the Prospectus, as then amended or supplemented, any material decrease in the stockholders' equity of the Company or any material increase in the consolidated long-term debt of the Company (other than as a result of the sale of (i) Notes, (ii) notes issued pursuant to the Company's Euro Medium-Term Note Programme InterNotes program or (iii) notes issued pursuant to the Commercial Paper Program of Prudential Funding, LLC) or any material adverse change, or any development involving a prospective material adverse change, in or affecting the business, management, financial position, shareholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, considered as a whole, in each case other than as set forth in the Prospectus, as then amended or supplemented, the effect of which in the judgment of the applicable Agent (which in the case of a syndicated issue, shall be the lead manager(s)) makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the solicitation by such Agent of offers to purchase Notes from the Company or the purchase by such Agent of Notes from the Company as principal, as the case may be, on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus, as then amended or supplemented; and neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has sustained since the date of the latest audited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus, as then amended or supplemented, any loss or interference with its business from fire, explosion, flood or other calamity, whether or not covered by insurance (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any insurance underwriting losses of the Company or its subsidiaries), or from any labor dispute or court or governmental action, order or decree, in each case other than as set forth or contemplated in the Prospectus, as then amended or supplemented; (iii) (A) trading generally shall not have been suspended or materially limited on the New York Stock Exchange, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. or in the over-the-counter market in debt securities, (B) trading of any securities of or guaranteed by the Company shall not have been suspended or materially limited on the New York Stock Exchange, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. or in any over-the-counter market in debt securities, (C) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities in New York shall not have been declared by either Federal, New York State or New Jersey authorities nor shall a material disruption in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States or other relevant jurisdiction have occurred, or (D) there shall not have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities or the declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war or any other calamity or crisis involving the United States or any change in national or international financial, political or economic conditions or currency exchange rates or controls that, in the judgment of such Agent or Agents (which in the case of a syndicated issue, shall be the lead manager(s)), is material and adverse and which in the judgment of such Agent or Agents (which
Further Conditions
 
in the case of a syndicated issue, shall be the lead manager(s)) makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the solicitation by such Agent of offers to purchase Notes from the Company or the purchase by such Agent of Notes from the Company as principal, as the case may be, on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented at the time an offer to purchase was solicited or at the time such offer to purchase was made; and (iv) no Event of Default, or event which, with the giving of notice or the lapse of time or both, would constitute an Event of Default, shall have occurred and be continuing.
 
SECTION 6. Delivery of and Payment for Notes Sold Through the Agents.
 
Delivery of Notes sold through an Agent as agent shall be made by the Company to such Agent for the account of any purchaser only against payment therefor in immediately available funds. In the event that a purchaser shall fail either to accept delivery of or to make payment for a Note on the date fixed for settlement, the relevant Agent shall promptly notify the Company and deliver the Note to the Trustee, and, if such Agent has theretofore paid the Company for such Note, the Company will promptly return the amount of such payment to such Agent in immediately available funds. If such failure occurred for any reason other than default by such Agent in the performance of its obligations hereunder, the Company will reimburse such Agent on an equitable basis for its loss of the use of the funds for the period such funds were credited to the Company's account.

Each time that (i) the Registration Statement or the Prospectus is amended or supplemented (excluding a Pricing Supplement), including through the filing of an annual report on Form 10-K or interim report on Form 10-Q or, if such delivery is requested by an Agent, any other document under the Exchange Act, (ii) the Company sells Notes to an Agent as principal and in connection therewith such delivery has been agreed to by the Company and such Agent, or (iii) the Company issues and sells Notes in a form not previously certified to the Agents by the Company, the Company shall furnish or cause to be furnished promptly to the Agents or the applicable Agent, as the case may be, certificates dated the date of such amendment or supplement or the date of such sale, as the case may be, in form reasonably satisfactory to the Agents or the applicable Agent, as the case may be, to the effect that the statements contained in the certificates referred to in Section 5(d) hereof which

Indemnification of the Agents
provided
however
 
(b) . Each Agent, severally and not jointly, will indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or any amendment thereof or the Prospectus (as amended or supplemented), or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in any Registration Statement or Prospectus as so amended or supplemented in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Agent expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred.
Indemnification of the Company
 
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party) and, after notice from the indemnifying
 
party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party (or such other release of the indemnified party as shall be satisfactory to the indemnified party) from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
 
(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Agents on the other from the offering of the Notes to which such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Agents on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Agents on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering of such Notes purchased under this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total discounts and commissions received by the Agents with respect to such Notes purchased under this Agreement, in each case as set forth in the applicable Terms Agreement and Pricing Supplement. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or the Agents on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Agents agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by allocation (even if the Agents were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Agent shall be required to contribute
pro rata
 
any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Notes purchased by it and distributed to or placed by it with investors were offered to investors exceeds the amount of any damages which such Agent has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Agents' obligations in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective purchase obligations and not joint.
 
(e) The obligations of the Company under this Section 8 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Agent within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act; and the obligations of the Agents under this Section 8 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Agents may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company (including any person who, with his or her consent, is named in the Prospectus as about to become a director of the Company) and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act.
 
SECTION 9. Payment of Expenses.
 
The Company agrees to pay all expenses incident to the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, including:
 
(i) The preparation, printing, reproduction, filing and delivery to the Agents of the Registration Statement and the Prospectus and all supplements and amendments thereto;
 
(ii) The preparation, reproduction, filing and delivery to the Agents of this Agreement, the Indenture, any Terms Agreement the calculation agency agreement, if any, and all amendments or supplements, if any, to the foregoing;
 
(iii) The preparation, printing, issuance and delivery of the Notes, including any fees and expenses relating to the use of book-entry Notes;
 
(iv) The fees and disbursements of the Company's counsel, of the Trustee and its counsel, and of any calculation agent and its counsel;
 
(v) The reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel to the Agents incurred in connection with the establishment of the program relating to the Notes, and any amendment or supplement to this Agreement, the Indenture, any Terms Agreement, the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or the Notes, and, if agreed to by the Company and the applicable Agent, any purchase of Notes by such Agent as principal;
 
(vi) The qualification of the Notes under state securities laws in accordance with the provisions of Section 4(c) hereof, including filing fees and the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel for the Agents in connection therewith and in connection with the preparation of any Blue Sky Survey and any Legal Investment Survey; and
 
(vii) Any fees charged by rating agencies for the rating of the Notes.
 
SECTION 10. Representations, Warranties and Agreements to Survive Delivery.
 
All representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Agent or any controlling person of any Agent, or by or on behalf of the Company, and shall survive each delivery of and payment for any of the Notes.
 
SECTION 11. Termination.
 
(a) . This Agreement (excluding any agreement hereunder then in effect by any Agent to purchase Notes as principal) may be terminated for any reason, at any time by the Company (with respect to one or all of Agents) or by an Agent (with respect to itself) upon the giving of written notice of such termination to the other parties hereto.

General
 
SECTION 12. Default by an Agent Purchasing Notes as Principal.
 
With respect to a syndicated issue, if one or more of the Agents purchasing Notes as principal hereunder shall fail to purchase the Notes which it or they agreed to purchase (the "Defaulted Notes"), then the lead nondefaulting Agent shall have the right, within 24 hours thereafter, to make arrangements for one or more of the nondefaulting Agents, or any other agent, to purchase all, but not less than all, of the Defaulted Notes in such amounts as may be agreed upon and upon the terms herein set forth; , , that if such arrangements are not completed within such 24hour period, then:
provided
however
 
(i) if the aggregate principal amount of Defaulted Notes does not exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes agreed to be purchased in such transaction by all Agents, then the nondefaulting Agent or Agents shall be obligated to purchase the entire aggregate principal amount of the Defaulted Notes in the proportion(s) that it or their respective underwriting obligations under the applicable agreement to purchase such Notes as principal bear to the underwriting obligations of all nondefaulting Agents.
 
(ii) if the aggregate principal amount of Defaulted Notes exceeds 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes agreed to be purchased in such transaction by all Agents, then the nondefaulting Agent or Agents shall not be under any obligation to purchase any of the Notes agreed by the Agents to be purchased as principal in such
 
transaction and the applicable agreement to purchase such Notes as principal shall terminate without liability on the part of any nondefaulting Agent or Agents.
 
Nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Agent of its liability, if any, to the Company and any nondefaulting Agent for its default hereunder.
 
In the event of a default by any Agent as set forth in this Section 12 which does not result in the termination of the applicable agreement to purchase Notes as principal, the Settlement Date with respect to such purchase of Notes as principal shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding seven days, as the lead nondefaulting Agent shall determine in order that the required changes in the Prospectus or arrangements may be effected.

EXHIBIT C
 
 
 
Medium-Term Notes, Series C, Due One Year or More from Date of Issue (the "Notes"), are to be offered on a continuing basis by Prudential Financial, Inc., a New Jersey corporation (the "Company"), to or through J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., Banc of America Securities LLC, Bear, Stearns & Co. Inc., Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., Goldman, Sachs & Co., Lehman Brothers Inc., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, UBS Securities LLC and Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC (each an "Agent" and, collectively, the "Agents"), pursuant to a Distribution Agreement, dated March 30, 2005 (the "Distribution Agreement"), between the Company and the Agents. The Distribution Agreement provides both for the sale of Notes by the Company to one or more of the Agents as principal for resale to investors and other purchasers and for the sale of Notes by the Company directly to investors (as may from time to time be agreed to by the Company and the related Agent or Agents), in which case the Agents will act as agents of the Company in soliciting Note purchases.
 
The Company reserves the right to sell Notes directly on its own behalf pursuant to the Distribution Agreement. The Agent or Agents, acting solely as agent or agents for the Company and not as principal, will use reasonable efforts to solicit offers to purchase the Notes. No Agent shall have an obligation to purchase Notes from the Company as principal, but an Agent may agree from time to time to purchase Notes as principal. Any such purchase of Notes by an Agent as principal shall be made in accordance with the Distribution Agreement. Only those provisions in these Administrative Procedures that are applicable to the particular role that the Agents will perform shall apply.
 
The Notes will be issued as a series of debt securities pursuant to a Senior Debt Securities Indenture dated as of April 25, 2003 (as amended or supplemented from time to time, the "Indenture"), between the Company and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (formerly known as JPMorgan Chase Bank), as Trustee (together with any successor in such capacity, the "Trustee"). All references herein to the Trustee in any context shall be deemed to be references to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. acting in one of the following capacities as is appropriate in the context: Trustee, Security Registrar, DTC custodian, DTC participant, transfer agent or paying agent with respect to the Notes.
 
The Notes will be issued in book-entry form and represented by one or more fully registered Notes (each, a "Global Note") delivered to the Trustee, as agent for The Depository Trust Company ("DTC"), and recorded in the book-entry system maintained by DTC. Owners of beneficial interests in Notes issued in book-entry form will be entitled to physical delivery of Certificated Notes equal in principal amount to their respective beneficial interests only upon certain limited circumstances described in the Prospectus (as defined in the Distribution Agreement).
 
General procedures relating to the issuance of all Notes are set forth in Part I hereof. Additionally, Notes issued in book-entry form will be issued in accordance with the procedures set forth in Part II hereof and Certificated Notes will be issued in accordance with the procedures set forth in Part III hereof. Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Indenture or the Notes, as the case may be.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In connection with the qualification of Notes issued in book-entry form for eligibility in the book-entry system maintained by DTC, the Trustee will perform the custodial, document control and administrative functions described below, in accordance with its respective obligations under a Letter of Representations from the Company and the Trustee to DTC, dated April 25, 2003, as made applicable to the Notes by a Bring-Down Letter of Representations from the Company and the Trustee to DTC, dated March 18, 2005, and a Certificate Agreement, dated November 13, 2001, between the Trustee and DTC, as amended (the "Certificate Agreement"), and its obligations as a participant in DTC, including DTC's Same-Day Funds Settlement System ("SDFS").
