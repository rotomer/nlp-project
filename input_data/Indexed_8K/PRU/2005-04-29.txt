It is understood that the Company may from time to time authorize the issuance and sale of additional amounts of the Notes and that such Notes may be issued and sold pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, all as though the issuance and sale of such Notes were authorized by the Company as of the date hereof. The Notes are to be issued pursuant to a senior debt securities indenture, dated as of April 25, 2003, between the Company and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (formerly known as JPMorgan Chase Bank), as amended to designate the Trustee for the Notes by a supplemental indenture, dated as of March 25, 2004 (as amended or supplemented from time to time, the "Indenture"), between the Company and Citibank, N.A. as Trustee (the "Trustee"). The Company's InterNotes and its Retail Medium-Term Notes constitute a single series of debt securities under the Indenture. The terms of the Notes are described in the Prospectus referred to below.
 
Subject to the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement, the Company hereby (1) appoints each of you as agent of the Company (each, an "Agent" and together, the "Agents") for the purpose of soliciting offers to purchase Notes and each of you hereby agrees to use your reasonable best efforts to solicit offers to purchase Notes upon terms acceptable to the Company at such times and in such amounts as the Company shall from time to time specify and in accordance with the terms hereof, and after consultation with Incapital LLC (the "Purchasing Agent") and (2) agrees that whenever the Company determines to sell Notes pursuant to this Agreement, such Notes shall be sold pursuant to a Terms Agreement (as defined herein) relating to such sale in accordance with the provisions of Section IV hereof between the Company and the Purchasing Agent, with the Purchasing Agent purchasing such Notes as principal for resale to other Agents or dealers (the "Selected Dealers"), each of whom will purchase as principal. The Company reserves the right to enter into agreements substantially similar hereto with other agents and in particular, it is understood that the Company has entered into a similar agreement dated as of April 29, 2005 with respect to its Retail Medium-Term Notes.
 
 
The Company has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") a registration statement (File Nos. 333-104444, 333-104444-01, 333-104444-02, 333-123240, 333-123240-01 and 333-123240-02) (including the exhibits thereto and as amended from time to time, the "Registration Statement") that included a base prospectus which sets forth the general terms of the Notes (in the form in which it appears in the Registration Statement and

Malamud, Corporate Vice President and Chief Legal Officer of each of The Gibraltar Life Insurance Company, Ltd. and The Prudential Life Insurance Company, Ltd., addressed to the Agents.

Morris, Vice President and Corporate Counsel of the Company, or Stephen W. Gauster, Vice President and Corporate Counsel of the Company, each of whom is admitted to practice law in the State of New York, addressed to the Agents. Such counsel may also state that such counsel does not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, as amended or supplemented (except to the extent expressly set forth in paragraph (10) above).

Commercial Paper Program of Prudential Funding, LLC) or any material adverse change, or any development involving a prospective material adverse change, in or affecting the business, management, financial position, shareholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, considered as a whole, in each case other than as set forth in the Prospectus, the effect of which in the judgment of the Purchasing Agent makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the purchase by any Agent of Notes from the Company on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus; and neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has sustained since the date of the latest audited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus, any loss or interference with its business from fire, explosion, flood or other calamity, whether or not covered by insurance (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any insurance underwriting losses of the Company or its subsidiaries), or from any labor dispute or court or governmental action, order or decree, in each case other than as set forth or contemplated in the Prospectus; (iv) (A) trading generally shall not have been suspended or materially limited on the New York Stock Exchange, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. or in the over-the-counter market in debt securities, (B) trading of any securities of or guaranteed by the Company shall not have been suspended or materially limited on the New York Stock Exchange, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. or in any over-the-counter market in debt securities, (C) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities in New York shall not have been declared by either Federal, New York State or New Jersey authorities nor shall a material disruption in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States or other relevant jurisdiction have occurred, or (D) there shall not have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities or the declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war or any other calamity or crisis involving the United States or any change in national or international financial, political or economic conditions or currency exchange rates or controls that, in the judgment of the Purchasing Agent makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the purchase by any Agent of Notes from the Company on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus at the time an offer to purchase was solicited or at the time such offer to purchase was made; and (v) no Event of Default, or event which, with the giving of notice or the lapse of time or both, would constitute an Event of Default, shall have occurred and be continuing.
 
 
The Company covenants and agrees with each Agent as follows:
 
(a) Prior to the termination of the offering of the Notes pursuant to this Agreement or any Terms Agreement, the Company will not file any prospectus supplement or, except as provided below, any pricing supplement relating to the Notes or any amendment to the Registration Statement unless the Company has previously furnished to the Agents copies thereof for their review and will not file any such proposed supplement or amendment to which the Agents reasonably object; , that (i) the foregoing requirement shall not apply to any of the Company's periodic filings with the Commission filed pursuant to Section 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the "Exchange Act"), copies of which filings, in the case of quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and annual reports on Form 10-K, the Company will cause to be delivered to the Agents promptly after being transmitted for filing with the Commission and (ii) any pricing supplement that merely sets forth
provided, however
 
the terms or a description of particular Notes (each a "Pricing Supplement") shall only be reviewed and approved by the Agent or Agents offering such Notes. Subject to the foregoing sentence, the Company will promptly cause each prospectus supplement and Pricing Supplement to be filed with or transmitted for filing to the Commission in accordance with Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act. The Company will promptly advise the Agents (i) of the filing of any amendment or supplement to the Basic Prospectus (except that notice of the filing of an amendment or supplement to the Basic Prospectus that merely sets forth the terms or a description of particular Notes shall only be given to the Agent or Agents offering such Notes), (ii) of the filing and effectiveness of any amendment to the Registration Statement, (iii) of any request by the Commission for any amendment to the Registration Statement or any amendment or supplement to the Basic Prospectus or for any additional information, (iv) of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or the institution or threatening of any proceeding for that purpose and (v) of the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of the Notes for sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose. Prior to the termination of the offering of the Notes pursuant to this Agreement or any Terms Agreement, the Company will use its reasonable efforts to prevent the issuance of any such stop order or notice of suspension of qualification and, if issued, to obtain as soon as possible the withdrawal thereof. If the Basic Prospectus is amended or supplemented as a result of the filing under the Exchange Act of any document incorporated by reference in the Prospectus, no Agent shall be obligated to solicit offers to purchase Notes so long as it is not reasonably satisfied with such document.
 
If any event shall occur or condition shall exist as a result of which the Prospectus, in the opinion of counsel for the Agents or counsel for the Company, includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or if in the opinion of any such counsel it is necessary at any time to amend or supplement the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, as then amended or supplemented, to comply with applicable law, the Company shall prior to the acceptance of any offer to purchase Notes prepare and, subject to this Section III(a), cause to be filed with the Commission an amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, as then amended or supplemented, in form and substance satisfactory to counsel for the Agents, that corrects such untrue statement or omission or effects such compliance and shall furnish such amended or supplemented Prospectus to the Agents in such numbers as they may require.
 
(b) Reasonably in advance of each time any annual report of the Company filed under the Exchange Act is incorporated by reference into the Prospectus, and each time the Company sells Notes to such Agent as principal pursuant to a written Terms Agreement and such Terms Agreement specifies the delivery of an opinion or opinions by Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP, counsel to the Agents, as a condition to the purchase of Notes pursuant to such Terms Agreement, the Company shall furnish to such counsel such papers and information as they may reasonably request to enable them to furnish to such Agent the opinion or opinions referred to in Section II(b) hereof.
 
(c) The Company will endeavor, in cooperation with the Agents, to qualify the Notes for offering and sale under the applicable securities laws of such states and other jurisdictions as
 
the Agents may reasonably designate, and will maintain such qualifications in effect for as long as may be required for the distribution of the Notes; , , that the Company shall not be obligated to file any general consent to service of process or to qualify as a foreign corporation in any jurisdiction in which it is not so qualified. The Company will file such statements and reports as may be required by the laws of each jurisdiction in which the Notes have been qualified as above provided. The Company will promptly advise the Agents of the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of the Notes for sale in any such state or jurisdiction or the initiating or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose.
provided
however
 
(d) Between the date of any Terms Agreement and the Settlement Date with respect thereto, and if agreed to by the applicable Agent or Agents and the Company, the Company will not, without the prior written consent of each such Agent, directly or indirectly, sell, offer to sell, or enter into any agreement to sell, any debt securities of the Company which are substantially similar to the Notes that are to be sold pursuant to such Terms Agreement. Any notes sold under the Company's Medium-Term Note Program or Euro-Medium-Term Note Programme shall not be considered to be "substantially similar" to the Notes for purposes of the immediately preceding sentence.
 
(e) The Company shall make generally available to its security holders as soon as practicable, but in any event not later than 90 days after the effective date of the Registration Statement (as defined in Rule 158(c) under the Securities Act), an earnings statement of the Company and its subsidiaries (which need not be audited) complying with Section 11(a) of the Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder.
 
(f) The Company shall not be required to comply with the provisions of subsections (a) or (b) of this Section or the provisions of Section VII hereof during any period from the time that the Agents (i) shall have been notified (such notice to be confirmed in writing) by the Company to suspend solicitation of offers to purchase the Notes and (ii) shall not then hold any Notes purchased as principal pursuant hereto, until the time the Company shall have notified the Agents (such notice to be confirmed in writing) of the Company's determination that solicitation of purchases of the Notes should be resumed or any Agent shall subsequently purchase Notes from the Company as principal and the Company has subsequently delivered such documents required by Section VII.
 
(g) The Company will use the net proceeds received by it from the sale from time to time of Notes in the manner specified in the Prospectus under "Use of Proceeds".
 
 
(a) Notes shall be purchased by each Agent as principal. The Agents shall offer the Notes upon the terms and conditions set forth herein and in the Prospectus and upon the terms communicated to the Agents from time to time by the Company or the Purchasing Agent, as the case may be (which terms, unless otherwise agreed, may be agreed upon orally, with written confirmation prepared by such Agent or Agents and sent by facsimile to the Company). For the purpose of such sales the Agents will use the Prospectus, as then amended or supplemented, which has been most recently distributed to the Agents by the Company, and the Agents will
 
offer and sell the Notes only as permitted or contemplated thereby and herein and will offer and sell the Notes only as permitted by the Securities Act and the applicable securities laws or regulations of any jurisdiction. An Agent's commitment to purchase Notes as principal shall be deemed to have been made on the basis of the representations and warranties of the Company herein contained and shall be subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth. Unless the context otherwise requires, references herein to "this Agreement" shall include the agreement of one or more Agents to purchase Notes from the Company as principal.
 
The Company agrees to sell the Notes to the Purchasing Agent at a discount from the principal amount of each such Note equivalent to the applicable commission set forth in Exhibit A hereto; provided, however, that the Company and the Purchasing Agent may agree instead to a discount greater than or less than the percentages set forth on Exhibit A hereto. The actual aggregate discount with respect to each sale of Notes will be set forth in the related Pricing Supplement. The Purchasing Agent and the other Agents or selected broker-dealers (the "Selected Dealers") will share the above-mentioned discount in such proportions as they may agree.
 
(b) Procedural details relating to the issue and delivery of, and the solicitation of purchases and payment for, the Notes are set forth in the Administrative Procedures attached hereto as Exhibit B (the "Procedures"), as amended from time to time. Unless otherwise provided in a Terms Agreement, the provisions of the Procedures shall apply to all transactions contemplated hereunder. The Agents and the Company each agree to perform the respective duties and obligations specifically provided to be performed by each in the Procedures as amended from time to time. The Procedures may only be amended by written agreement of the Company and the Agents.
 
 
Each sale of Notes shall be made in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the Procedures and a separate agreement in substantially the form attached as Exhibit C (a "Terms Agreement") to be entered into which will provide for the sale of such Notes to, and the purchase and reoffering thereof, by the Purchasing Agent as principal. A Terms Agreement may also specify certain provisions relating to the reoffering of such Notes by the Purchasing Agent. The offering of Notes by the Company hereunder and the Purchasing Agent's agreement to purchase Notes pursuant to any Terms Agreement shall be deemed to have been made on the basis of the representations, warranties and agreements of the Company herein contained and shall be subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth. Each Terms Agreement shall describe the Notes to be purchased pursuant thereto by the Purchasing Agent as principal, and may specify, among other things, the principal amount of Notes to be purchased, the interest rate or interest rate basis (and whether such interest rate shall be fixed or floating) and maturity date or dates of such Notes, the interest payment dates, if any, the net proceeds to the Company, the initial public offering price at which the Notes are proposed to be reoffered, and the time, Settlement Date and place of delivery of and payment for such Notes, whether the Notes provide for a Survivor's Option (as such term is defined in the Prospectus), whether the Notes are redeemable or repayable and on what terms and conditions, and any other relevant terms. In connection with the resale of the Notes purchased, without the consent of the Company or the Purchasing Agent, the Agents are not authorized to appoint subagents or to engage the service of any other broker
 
or dealer, other than the Selected Dealers, nor may any Agent reallow any portion of the discount paid to it.
 
 
The Company represents and warrants to each Agent as of the date hereof, as of the date of each acceptance by the Company of an offer for the purchase of Notes (including any purchase by the Purchasing Agent as principal, pursuant to a Terms Agreement or otherwise), as of each Settlement Date, and as of any time that the Registration Statement or the Prospectus shall be amended or supplemented or there is filed with the Commission any document incorporated by reference into the Prospectus (other than any Current Report on Form 8-K relating exclusively to the issuance of debt securities under the Registration Statement) (each of the times referenced above being referred to herein as a "Representation Date") as follows:
 
(a) The Registration Statement has been filed with the Commission and has become effective; no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement is in effect, and, to the knowledge of the Company, no proceedings for such purpose are pending before or threatened by the Commission.
 
(b) (i) Each document, if any, filed or to be filed pursuant to the Exchange Act and incorporated by reference in the Prospectus complied or will comply when so filed in all material respects with the Exchange Act and the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder, (ii) each part of the Registration Statement, when such part became effective, did not contain and each such part, as amended or supplemented, if applicable, will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, (iii) the Registration Statement and the Prospectus comply and, as amended or supplemented, if applicable, will comply in all material respects with the Securities Act and the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder and (iv) the Prospectus does not contain and, if applicable, will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except that the representations and warranties set forth in this paragraph do not apply to statements or omissions in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus made in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by any Agent expressly for use therein.
 
(c) The Company has been duly incorporated and is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of New Jersey, with power and authority (corporate and other) to own its properties and to conduct its business as described in the Prospectus, and has been duly qualified as a foreign corporation for the transaction of business and is in good standing under the laws of each other jurisdiction in which it owns or leases properties or conducts any business so as to require such qualification, except to the extent that the failure to be so qualified or in good standing would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.
 
(d) Each of this Agreement and any other applicable Terms Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company; the Indenture has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act and has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company
 
and is a valid and binding agreement of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except as enforcement thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws relating to or affecting enforcement of creditors' rights generally or by general equitable principles; the Notes have been duly authorized by the Company and, when executed, authenticated and delivered in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, any applicable Terms Agreement and the Indenture against payment therefor, will have been duly executed and delivered by, and will constitute valid and binding obligations of, the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms, except as enforcement thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws relating to or affecting enforcement of creditors' rights generally or by general equitable principles; and the terms of the Indenture and the Notes in respect of which an offer to purchase has been accepted by the Company are in all material respects accurately described in the Prospectus.
 
(e) None of the Company or any of its subsidiaries has sustained since the date of the latest audited financial statements included in the Prospectus any loss or interference with its business that is, individually or in the aggregate, material to the Company and its subsidiaries, considered as a whole, from fire, explosion, flood or other calamity, whether or not covered by insurance (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any insurance underwriting losses of the Company or its subsidiaries), or from any labor dispute or court or governmental action, order or decree, in each case other than as set forth or contemplated in the Prospectus; and, since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Prospectus, except as may otherwise be stated therein or contemplated thereby, (i) there has been no material decrease in the capital or surplus of the Company, (i) there has been no decrease in the capital stock of the Company or any material increase in the consolidated long-term debt of the Company (other than, in each case, as a result of the sale of (A) Notes and the Company's Retail Medium-Term Notes, (B) notes issued pursuant to the Company's Medium-Term Note Programs, or Euro Medium-Term Note Programme or (C) notes issued pursuant to the Commercial Paper Program of Prudential Funding, LLC) and (iii) there has been no material adverse change, or any development which will involve a prospective material adverse change, in or affecting the business, management, financial position, shareholders' equity (in each case considered on a GAAP basis) or the financial strength ratings of the Company and its subsidiaries considered as a whole.
 
(f) The execution and delivery of this Agreement, any applicable Terms Agreement, the Indenture and the Notes, the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein and therein and compliance by the Company with its obligations hereunder and thereunder, as the case may be, will not conflict with, or result in a breach or violation of, any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under, any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement or other agreement or instrument to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company, or any of its subsidiaries is bound or to which any of the property or assets of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is subject, nor will such actions result in any violation of the provisions of the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws of the Company or the organizational documents of any of its subsidiaries or any statute or any order, rule or regulation of any court or insurance regulatory agency or other governmental agency or body having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any of their properties, except to the extent that such a conflict, breach, default or violation would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.
 
(g) Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries is, or at any time of delivery of the Notes will be, in violation of its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws or other organizational documents or instruments or in default in the performance or observance of any obligation, agreement, covenant or condition contained in any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement, lease or other agreement or instrument to which it is a party or by which it or any of its properties may be bound, which violation or default would have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.
 
(h) There are no legal or governmental proceedings pending to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or of which any property of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is the subject which, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, other than as set forth in the Prospectus; and, to the best of the Company's knowledge, no such proceedings are threatened or contemplated by governmental authorities or threatened by others, other than as set forth in the Prospectus.
 
(i) No consent or action of, or filing or registration with, any governmental or public regulatory body or authority, is required to be obtained by the Company in connection with the execution, delivery or performance by the Company of this Agreement, any applicable Terms Agreement, the Indenture or the Notes, except such as have been obtained and made under the Securities Act and the Trust Indenture Act and such as may be required under the securities or Blue Sky laws of the various states in connection with the offer and sale of the Notes.
 
(j) The Company is not, nor after giving effect to the transactions contemplated herein will be, an "investment company" as such term is defined in the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act").
 
(k) The obligations of the Company to pay the principal of and premium, if any, and interest on the Notes and any and all amounts that become due and payable under this Agreement constitute direct, unconditional and general obligations of the Company and rank and will rank in priority of payment with respect to all unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of the Company.
pari passu
 
(l) PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, who have certified certain financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries, are independent registered public accountants as required by the Securities Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder.
 
(m) The consolidated financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries, together with the related schedules, notes and supplemental information, set forth in the Prospectus, comply in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act and interpretations thereof and present fairly in all material respects the financial position, the results of operations and the changes in cash flows of such entities in conformity with GAAP at the respective dates or for the respective periods to which they apply; such statements and related schedules, notes and supplemental information have been prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied throughout the periods involved except for any normal year-end adjustments and except as described therein.
 
 
The Company covenants and agrees with each Agent that:
 
(a) Each acceptance by the Company of an offer for the purchase of Notes and each delivery of Notes, shall be deemed to be an affirmation that the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement are true and correct at the time of such acceptance or sale, as the case may be, and an undertaking that such representations and warranties will be true and correct at the time of delivery to the purchaser or its agent, or to the applicable Agent, of the Note or Notes relating to such acceptance or sale, as the case may be, as though made at and as of each such time (and it is understood that such representations and warranties shall relate to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus as amended and supplemented at each such time).
 
(b) Each time that there is filed with the Commission any Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or Annual Report on Form 10-K incorporated by reference into the Prospectus, and otherwise only (i) as may be required in connection with a sale pursuant to Section IV(a) or (ii) at such times as may be reasonably requested by the Agents in the event of a material change in circumstances in respect of the Company, the Company shall furnish or cause to be furnished to the Agent(s) forthwith a certificate dated the date of filing with the Commission of such document, the date requested by the Agents or the date of such sale, as the case may be, in form reasonably satisfactory to the Agent(s) to the effect that the statements contained in the certificate referred to in Section II(c) hereof which were last furnished to the Agents are true and correct at the time of such filing, as though made at and as of such time (except that such statements shall be deemed to relate to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus as amended and supplemented to such time) or, in lieu of such certificate, a certificate substantially similar to the certificate referred to in Section II(c) hereof, modified as necessary to relate to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus as amended and supplemented to the time of delivery of such certificate.
 
(c) Each time that there is filed with the Commission any Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or Annual Report on Form 10-K incorporated by reference into the Prospectus, and otherwise only as may be required in connection with a sale pursuant to Section IV(a), the Company shall furnish or cause to be furnished forthwith, and in any case promptly upon request, to the Agent(s) and to counsel to the Agents the written opinion of counsel to the Company referred to in Section II(a), or other counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Agent(s), dated the date of filing with the Commission of such document, the date requested by the Agent(s) or the date of such sale, as the case may be, in form and scope reasonably satisfactory to the Agent(s), of the same tenor as the opinions referred to in Section II(a) (except that, in the case of any interim report filed on Form 10-Q or other document or annual report on Form 10-K filed under the Exchange Act, such opinions need not be rendered as to the good standing of the entities referred to in Sections II(a)(2) and (3) hereof or as to the matters referred to in Section II(a)(9) and (10) hereof), but modified, as necessary, to relate to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus as amended and supplemented to the time of delivery of such opinion or, in lieu of such opinion, counsel last furnishing such opinion to the Agents shall furnish the Agent(s) with a letter substantially to the effect that the Agent(s) may rely on such last opinion to the same extent as though it were dated the date of such letter authorizing reliance (except that statements in such last opinion shall be deemed to relate to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus as amended and supplemented to the time of delivery of such letter authorizing reliance).
 
(d) Each time that there is filed with the Commission any Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or Annual Report on Form 10-K incorporated by reference into the Prospectus, and otherwise only as may be requested by the Agents in connection with a sale pursuant to Section IV(a), the Company shall furnish or cause their independent registered public accountants to furnish such Agents (i) in the case of a sale, a letter dated the date of such sale, in form reasonably satisfactory to the Agent(s), substantially in the form of the letter referred to in Section II(d) hereof, (ii) in the case of a filing of an Annual Report on Form 10-K, a letter in form reasonably satisfactory to the Agent(s), substantially in the form of the letter referred to in Section II(d) hereof, and (iii) in the case of a Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, a review letter from such accountants in conformity with the requirements of Statement of Accounting Standards No. 100, but modified as necessary to relate to the Registration Statement and Prospectus as amended and supplemented to the date of such letter, with such changes as may be necessary to reflect changes in the financial statements and other information derived from the accounting records of the Company.
 
 
(a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Agent against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Agent may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or any amendment thereof or the Prospectus, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse each Agent for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by it in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim as to which it is entitled to indemnification hereunder as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus as so amended or supplemented in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Agent expressly for use therein.
 
(b) Each Agent, severally and not jointly, will indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or any amendment thereof or the Prospectus, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in any Registration Statement or Prospectus as so amended or supplemented in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Agent expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by
 
the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred.
 
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party) and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party (or such other release of the indemnified party as shall be satisfactory to the indemnified party) from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
 
(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section VIII is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Agents on the other from the offering of the Notes to which such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Agents on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Agents on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering of such Notes purchased under this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total discounts and commissions received by the Agents with respect to such Notes purchased under this Agreement, in each case
 
as set forth in Schedule A hereto. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or the Agents on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Agents agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by allocation (even if the Agents were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Agent shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Notes purchased by it and distributed to or placed by it with investors were offered to investors exceeds the amount of any damages which such Agent has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Agents' obligations in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective purchase obligations and not joint.
pro rata
 
(e) The obligations of the Company under this Section VIII shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Agent within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act; and the obligations of the Agents under this Section VIII shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Agents may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company (including any person who, with his or her consent, is named in the Prospectus as about to become a director of the Company) and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act.
 
 
The Company may elect to suspend or terminate the offering of Notes under this Agreement at any time; the Company also (as to any one or more of the Agents) or any Agent (as to itself) may terminate the appointment and arrangements described in this Agreement. Upon receipt of instructions from the Company, the Purchasing Agent shall suspend or terminate the participation of any Selected Dealer under the Master Selected Dealer Agreement. Such actions may be taken, in the case of the Company, by giving prompt written notice of suspension to all of the Agents and by giving not less than five days' written notice of termination to the affected party and the other parties to this Agreement, or in the case of an Agent, by giving not less than five days' written notice of termination to the Company and except that, if at the time of termination an offer for the purchase of Notes shall have been accepted by the Company but the time of delivery to the purchaser or his agent of the Note or Notes relating thereto shall not yet have occurred, the Company shall have the obligations provided herein with respect to such Note
 
or Notes. The Company shall promptly notify the other parties in writing of any such termination.
 
The Purchasing Agent may, and, upon the request of an Agent with respect to any Notes being purchased by such Agent shall, terminate any agreement hereunder by the Purchasing Agent to purchase such Notes, immediately upon notice to the Company at any time at or prior to the Settlement Date relating thereto, if there shall have come to the attention of the Purchasing Agent or such Agent or Agents any facts that would cause them to believe that the Prospectus, at the time it was required to be delivered to a purchaser of Notes, included an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances existing at the time of such delivery, not misleading. As used in this Section IX, the term "Prospectus" means the Prospectus in the form first provided to the applicable Agent or Agents for use in confirming sales of the related Notes.
 
Any Terms Agreement shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Agents on the terms set forth or incorporated by reference therein. The termination of this Agreement shall not require termination of any agreement by the Purchasing Agent to purchase Notes as principal, and the termination of any such agreement shall not require termination of this Agreement.
 
If this Agreement is terminated, Sections VIII, XII and XIII hereof shall survive and shall remain in effect; provided that if at the time of termination of this Agreement an offer to purchase Notes has been accepted by the Company but the time of delivery to the Purchasing Agent of such Notes has not occurred, the provisions of all of Section III, Section IV and Section V shall also survive until the time of delivery.
 
In the event a proposed offering is not completed according to the terms of this Agreement, an Agent will be reimbursed by the Company only for out-of-pocket accountable expenses actually incurred.
 
 
Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, all statements, requests, notices and advices hereunder shall be in writing, or by telephone if promptly confirmed in writing, and if to an Agent shall be sufficient in all respects if delivered in person or sent by telex, facsimile, e-mail transmission (confirmed in writing), or registered mail to such Agent at its address, telex or facsimile number set forth on Annex A hereto and if to the Company shall be sufficient in all respects if delivered or sent by telex, facsimile, e-mail transmission (confirmed in writing) or registered mail to the Company at the address specified below. All such notices shall be effective on receipt.

or at such other address as any such party may designate from time to time by notice duly given to the other parties hereto in accordance with the terms of this Section X.
 
 
This Agreement shall be binding upon the Agents and the Company, and inure solely to the benefit of the Agents and the Company and any other person expressly entitled to indemnification hereunder and the respective personal representatives, successors and assigns of each, and no other person shall acquire or have any rights under or by virtue of this Agreement.
 
 
This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the substantive laws of the State of New York. Each party to this Agreement irrevocably agrees that any legal action or proceeding against it arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment rendered against it in connection with this Agreement may be brought in any federal or New York State court sitting in the County of New York, New York, and, by execution and delivery of this Agreement, such party hereby irrevocably accepts and submits to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of each of the aforesaid courts in person, generally and unconditionally with respect to any such action or proceeding for itself and in respect of its property, assets and revenues. Each party hereby also irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such action or proceeding brought in any such court and any claim that any such action or proceeding has been brought in an inconvenient forum.
 
 
Except as may otherwise be agreed by the Company, Banc of America Securities LLC and the Purchasing Agent, the Company will pay the following expenses incident to the performance of its obligations under this Agreement: (i) the preparation and filing of the Registration Statement; (ii) the preparation, issuance and delivery of the Notes; (iii) the fees and disbursements of the Company's auditors, of the Trustee and its counsel and of any paying or other agents appointed by the Company; (iv) the printing and delivery to the Agents in quantities as hereinabove stated of copies of the Registration Statement and the Prospectus; (v) if the Company lists Notes on a securities exchange, the costs and fees of such listing; (vi) the cost of providing CUSIP or other identification numbers for the Notes, (vii) the fees and expenses, if any, incurred with respect to any filing with the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.; (viii) all reasonable expenses (including fees and disbursements of any counsel specifically engaged for Blue Sky purposes) in connection with "Blue Sky" qualifications, (ix) any fees charged by rating agencies for the rating of the Notes and (x) the reasonable fees and disbursements of Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP, counsel for the Agents, incurred in connection with the establishment of the program relating to the Notes, and any amendment or supplement to this Agreement, the Indenture, any Terms Agreement, the Registration Statement
 
or the Prospectus or the Notes and, if agreed to by the Company and the Purchasing Agent, any purchase of Notes by the Purchasing Agent as principal.
 
This Agreement may be executed by each of the parties hereto in any number of counterparts, and by each of the parties hereto on separate counterparts, each of which counterparts, when so executed and delivered, shall be deemed to be an original, but all such counterparts shall together constitute but one and the same instrument. Facsimile signatures shall be deemed original signatures.
 
If the foregoing is in accordance with your understanding, please sign and return to us a counterpart hereof, and upon acceptance hereof by you, this letter and such acceptance hereof shall constitute a binding agreement between the Company and you.

Dear Selected Dealer:
 
In connection with public offerings of securities after the date hereof for which we are acting as manager of an underwriting syndicate or are otherwise responsible for the distribution of securities to the public by means of an offering of securities for sale to selected dealers, you may be offered the right as such a selected dealer to purchase as principal a portion of such securities. This will confirm our mutual agreement as to the general terms and conditions applicable to your participation in any such selected dealer group organized by us as follows.
 
1. . The terms and conditions of this Agreement shall be applicable to any public offering of securities ("Securities"), pursuant to a registration statement filed under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act"), or exempt from registration thereunder (other than a public offering of Securities effected wholly outside the United States of America), wherein Incapital LLC clearing through BNY Clearing Services, LLC (the "Account") (acting for its own Account or for the account of any underwriting or similar group or syndicate) is responsible for managing or otherwise implementing the sale of the Securities to selected dealers ("Selected Dealers") and has expressly informed you that such terms and conditions shall be applicable. Any such offering of Securities to you as a Selected Dealer is hereinafter called an "Offering". In the case of any Offering where we are acting for the account of any underwriting or similar group or syndicate ("Underwriters"), the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall be for the benefit of, and binding upon, such Underwriters, including, in the case of any Offering where we are acting with others as representatives of Underwriters, such other representatives.
Applicability of this Agreement
 
2. . Any Offering: (i) will be subject to delivery of the Securities and their acceptance by us and any other Underwriters; (ii) may be subject to the approval of all legal matters by counsel and the satisfaction of other conditions, and (iii) may be made on the basis of reservation of Securities or an allotment against subscription. We will advise you by electronic mail, facsimile or other form of written communication ("Written Communication", which term, in the case of any Offering described in Section 3(a) or 3(b) hereof, may include a prospectus or offering circular) of the particular method and supplementary terms and conditions (including, without limitation, the information as to prices and offering date referred to in Section 3(c) hereof) of any Offering in which you are invited to participate. To the extent such supplementary terms and conditions are inconsistent with any provision herein, such terms and conditions shall supersede any such provision. Unless otherwise indicated in any such Written Communication, acceptances and other communications by you with respect to
Conditions of Offering; Acceptance and Purchases
 
an Offering should be sent to Incapital LLC, One North LaSalle Street, Suite 3500, Chicago, IL 60602, (Facsimile: (312) 379-3701). We reserve the right to reject any acceptance in whole or in part. Unless notified otherwise by us, Securities purchased by you shall be paid for on such date as we shall determine, on one day's prior notice to you, by certified or official bank check, in an amount equal to the Public Offering Prices (as hereinafter defined) or, if we shall so advise you, at such Public Offering Price less the Concession (as hereinafter defined), payable in New York Clearing House funds to the order of BNY Clearing Services, LLC clearing for the account of Incapital LLC, against delivery of the Securities. If Securities are purchased and paid for at such Public Offering Price, such Concession will be paid after the termination of the provisions of Section 3(c) hereof with respect to such Securities. Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless notified otherwise by us, payment for and delivery of Securities purchased by you shall be made through the facilities of The Depository Trust Company, if you are a member, unless you have otherwise notified us prior to the date specified in a Written Communication to you from us or, if you are not a member, settlement may be made through a correspondent who is a member pursuant to instructions which you will send to us prior to such specified date.
 
3. .
Representations, Warranties and Agreements
 
(a) . In the case of any Offering of Securities that are registered under the Securities Act ("Registered Offering"), we shall provide you with such number of copies of each preliminary prospectus and of the final prospectus relating thereto as you may reasonably request for the purposes contemplated by the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission thereunder. You represent and warrant that you are familiar with Rule 15c2-8 under the Exchange Act relating to the distribution of preliminary and final prospectuses and agree that you will comply therewith. You agree to make a record of your distribution of each preliminary prospectus and, when furnished with copies of any revised preliminary prospectus, you will, upon our request, promptly forward copies thereof to each person to whom you have theretofore distributed a preliminary prospectus. You agree that in purchasing Securities in a Registered Offering you will rely upon no statement whatsoever, written or oral, other than the statements in the final prospectus delivered to you by us. You will not be authorized by the issuer or other seller of Securities offered pursuant to a prospectus or by any Underwriter to give any information or to make any representation not contained in the prospectus in connection with the sale of such Securities.
Registered Offerings
 
(b) . In the case of any Offering of Securities, other than a Registered Offering, which is made pursuant to an offering circular or other document comparable to a prospectus in a Registered Offering, we shall provide you with such number of copies of each preliminary offering circular and of the final offering circular relating thereto as you may reasonably request. You agree that you will comply with the applicable Federal and state laws, and the applicable rules and regulations of any regulatory body promulgated thereunder, governing the use and distribution of offering circulars by brokers or dealers. You agree that in purchasing Securities pursuant to an offering circular you will rely upon no statements whatsoever, written or oral, other than the statements in the final offering circular delivered to you by us.

or to make any representation not contained in the offering circular in connection with the sale of such Securities.
 
(c) . With respect to any Offering of Securities, we will inform you by a Written Communication of the public offering price, the selling concession, the reallowance (if any) to dealers and the time when you may commence selling Securities to the public. After such public offering has commenced, we may change the public offering price, the selling concession and the reallowance to dealers. The offering price, selling concession and reallowance (if any) to dealers at any time in effect with respect to an Offering are hereinafter referred to, respectively, as the "Public Offering Price", the "Concession" and the "Reallowance". With respect to each Offering of Securities, until the provisions of this Section 3(c) shall be terminated pursuant to Section 4 hereof, you agree to offer Securities to the public at no more than the Public Offering Price. If so notified by us, you may sell Securities to the public at a lesser negotiated price than the Public Offering Price, but in an amount not to exceed the "Concession". If a Reallowance is in effect, a reallowance from the Public Offering Price not in excess of such Reallowance may be allowed as consideration for services rendered in distribution to dealers who are actually engaged in the investment banking or securities business, who execute the written agreement prescribed by Rule 2740 of the Conduct Rules of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (the "NASD") and who are either members in good standing of the NASD or foreign banks, dealers or institutions not eligible for membership in the NASD who represent to you that they will promptly reoffer such Securities at the Public Offering Price and will abide by the conditions with respect to foreign banks, dealers and institutions set forth in Section 3(e) hereof.
Offer and Sale to the Public
 
(d) . We may, with respect to any Offering, be authorized to over-allot in arranging sales to Selected Dealers, to purchase and sell Securities for long or short account and to stabilize or maintain the market price of the Securities. You agree that, upon our request at any time and from time to time prior to the termination of the provisions of Section 3(c) hereof with respect to any Offering, you will report to us the amount of Securities purchased by you pursuant to such Offering which then remain unsold by you and will, upon our request at any such time, sell to us for our account or the account of one or more Underwriters such amount of such unsold Securities as we may designate at the Public Offering Price less an amount to be determined by us not in excess of the Concession. If, prior to the later of (i) the termination of the provisions of Section 3(c) hereof with respect to any Offering or (ii) the covering by us of any short position created by us in connection with such Offering for our account or the account of one or more Underwriters, we purchase or contract to purchase for our account or the account of one or more Underwriters in the open market or otherwise any Securities purchased by you under this Agreement as part of such Offering, you agree to pay us on demand an amount equal to the Concession with respect to such Securities (unless you shall have purchased such Securities pursuant to Section 2 hereof at the Public Offering Price in which case we shall not be obligated to pay such Concession to you pursuant to Section 2) plus transfer taxes and broker's commissions or dealer's mark-up, if any, paid in connection with such purchase or contract to purchase.
Over-allotment; Stabilization; Unsold Allotments
 
(e) . You represent and warrant that you are actually engaged in the investment banking or securities business and either a member in good standing of the NASD or, if you are not such a member, you are a foreign bank, dealer or institution not eligible for
NASD
 
membership in the NASD which agrees to make no sales within the United States, its territories or its possessions or to persons who are citizens thereof or residents therein, and in making other sales to comply with the NASD's interpretation with respect to free riding and withholding. You further represent, by your participation in an Offering, that you have provided to us all documents and other information required to be filed with respect to you, any related person or any person associated with you or any such related person pursuant to the supplementary requirements of the NASD's interpretation with respect to review of corporate financing as such requirements relate to such Offering.
 
You agree that, in connection with any purchase or sale of the Securities wherein a Concession, discount or other allowance is received or granted, (1) you will comply with the provisions of Rule 2740 of the NASD's Conduct Rules and (2) if you are a non-NASD member broker or dealer in a foreign country, you will also comply (a), as though you were an NASD member, with the provisions of IM-2110-1 and Rules 2730, 2740 and 2750 of the NASD's Conduct Rules and (b) with Rule 2420 thereof as that Rule applies to a non-NASD member broker or dealer in a foreign country.
 
You further agree that, in connection with any purchase of securities from us that is not otherwise covered by the terms of this Agreement (whether we are acting as manager, as a member of an underwriting syndicate or a selling group or otherwise), if a Concession or other allowance is granted to you, clauses (1) and (2) of the preceding paragraph will be applicable.
 
(f) . We may buy Securities from or sell Securities to any Underwriter or Selected Dealer and, without consent, the Underwriters (if any) and the Selected Dealers may purchase Securities from and sell Securities to each other at the Public Offering Price less all or any part of the Concession. Unless otherwise specified in a separate agreement between you and us, this agreement does not authorize you to act as agent for: (i) us; (ii) any Underwriter; (iii) the issuer; or (iv) other seller of any Securities in offering Securities to the public or otherwise. Neither we nor any Underwriter shall be under any obligation to you except for obligations assumed hereby or in any Written Communication from us in connection with any Offering. Nothing contained herein or in any Written Communication from us shall constitute the Selected Dealers an association or partners with us or any Underwriter or with one another. If the Selected Dealers, among themselves or with the Underwriters, should be deemed to constitute a partnership for Federal income tax purposes, then you elect to be excluded from the application of Subchapter K, Chapter 1, Subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and agree not to take any position inconsistent with that election. You authorize us, in our discretion, to execute and file on your behalf such evidence of that election as may be required by the Internal Revenue Service. In connection with any Offering, you shall be liable for your proportionate amount of any tax, claim, demand or liability that may be asserted against you alone or against one or more Selected Dealers participating in such Offering, or against us or the Underwriters, based upon the claim that the Selected Dealers, or any of them, constitute an association, an unincorporated business or other entity, including, in each case, your proportionate amount of any expense incurred in defending against any such tax, claim, demand or liability.
Relationship among Underwriters and Selected Dealers
 
(g) . Upon application to us, we shall inform you as to any advice we have received from counsel concerning the jurisdictions in which Securities have been
Blue Sky Laws
 
qualified for sale or are exempt under the securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions, but we do not assume any obligation or responsibility as to your right to sell Securities in any such jurisdiction.
 
(h) . You agree that in selling Securities pursuant to any Offering (which agreement shall also be for the benefit of the issuer or other seller of such Securities) you will comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations, including the applicable provisions of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission thereunder, the applicable rules and regulations of the NASD, the applicable rules and regulations of any securities exchange having jurisdiction over the Offering and the applicable laws, rules and regulations specified in Section 3(b) hereof.
Compliance with Law
 
4. . This Agreement shall continue in full force and effect until terminated by a written instrument executed by each of the parties hereto. This Agreement may be supplemented or amended by us by written notice thereof to you, and any such supplement or amendment to this Agreement shall be effective with respect to any Offering to which this Agreement applies after the date of such supplement or amendment. Each reference to "this Agreement" herein shall, as appropriate, be to this Agreement as so amended and supplemented.

Termination, Supplements and Amendments
 
5. . This Agreement shall be binding on, and inure to the benefit of, the parties hereto and other persons specified in Section 1 hereof, and the respective successors and assigns of each of them.
Successors and Assigns

(a) Prior to the termination of the offering of the Notes pursuant to this Agreement or any Terms Agreement, the Company will not file any prospectus supplement or, except as provided below, any pricing supplement relating to the Notes or any amendment to the Registration Statement unless the Company has previously furnished to the Agents copies thereof for their review and will not file any such proposed supplement or amendment to which the Agents reasonably object; , that (i) the foregoing requirement shall not apply to any of the Company's periodic filings with the Commission filed pursuant to Section 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the "Exchange Act"), copies of which filings, in the case of quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and annual reports on Form 10-K, the Company will cause to be delivered to the Agents promptly after being transmitted for filing with the Commission and (ii) any pricing supplement that merely sets forth

Subject to the foregoing sentence, the Company will promptly cause each prospectus supplement and Pricing Supplement to be filed with or transmitted for filing to the Commission in accordance with Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act. The Company will promptly advise the Agents (i) of the filing of any amendment or supplement to the Basic Prospectus (except that notice of the filing of an amendment or supplement to the Basic Prospectus that merely sets forth the terms or a description of particular Notes shall only be given to the Agent or Agents offering such Notes), (ii) of the filing and effectiveness of any amendment to the Registration Statement, (iii) of any request by the Commission for any amendment to the Registration Statement or any amendment or supplement to the Basic Prospectus or for any additional information, (iv) of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or the institution or threatening of any proceeding for that purpose and (v) of the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of the Notes for sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose. Prior to the termination of the offering of the Notes pursuant to this Agreement or any Terms Agreement, the Company will use its reasonable efforts to prevent the issuance of any such stop order or notice of suspension of qualification and, if issued, to obtain as soon as possible the withdrawal thereof. If the Basic Prospectus is amended or supplemented as a result of the filing under the Exchange Act of any document incorporated by reference in the Prospectus, no Agent shall be obligated to solicit offers to purchase Notes so long as it is not reasonably satisfied with such document.
 
If any event shall occur or condition shall exist as a result of which the Prospectus, in the opinion of counsel for the Agents or counsel for the Company, includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or if in the opinion of any such counsel it is necessary at any time to amend or supplement the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, as then amended or supplemented, to comply with applicable law, the Company shall prior to the acceptance of any offer to purchase Notes prepare and, subject to this Section III(a), cause to be filed with the Commission an amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, as then amended or supplemented, in form and substance satisfactory to counsel for the Agents, that corrects such untrue statement or omission or effects such compliance and shall furnish such amended or supplemented Prospectus to the Agents in such numbers as they may require.
 
(b) Reasonably in advance of each time any annual report of the Company filed under the Exchange Act is incorporated by reference into the Prospectus, and each time the Company sells Notes to such Agent as principal pursuant to a written Terms Agreement and such Terms Agreement specifies the delivery of an opinion or opinions by Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP, counsel to the Agents, as a condition to the purchase of Notes pursuant to such Terms Agreement, the Company shall furnish to such counsel such papers and information as they may reasonably request to enable them to furnish to such Agent the opinion or opinions referred to in Section II(b) hereof.
 
(c) The Company will endeavor, in cooperation with the Agents, to qualify the Notes for offering and sale under the applicable securities laws of such states and other jurisdictions as
 
the Agents may reasonably designate, and will maintain such qualifications in effect for as long as may be required for the distribution of the Notes; , , that the Company shall not be obligated to file any general consent to service of process or to qualify as a foreign corporation in any jurisdiction in which it is not so qualified. The Company will file such statements and reports as may be required by the laws of each jurisdiction in which the Notes have been qualified as above provided. The Company will promptly advise the Agents of the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of the Notes for sale in any such state or jurisdiction or the initiating or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose.

(f) The Company shall not be required to comply with the provisions of subsections (a) or (b) of this Section or the provisions of Section VII hereof during any period from the time that the Agents (i) shall have been notified (such notice to be confirmed in writing) by the Company to suspend solicitation of offers to purchase the Notes and (ii) shall not then hold any Notes purchased as principal pursuant hereto, until the time the Company shall have notified the Agents (such notice to be confirmed in writing) of the Company's determination that solicitation of purchases of the Notes should be resumed or any Agent shall subsequently purchase Notes from the Company as principal and the Company has subsequently delivered such documents required by Section VII.
 
(g) The Company will use the net proceeds received by it from the sale from time to time of Notes in the manner specified in the Prospectus under "Use of Proceeds".

For the purpose of such sales the Agents will use the Prospectus, as then amended or supplemented, which has been most recently distributed to the Agents by the Company, and the Agents will offer and sell the Notes only as permitted or contemplated thereby and herein and will offer and sell the Notes only as permitted by the Securities Act and the applicable securities laws or regulations of any jurisdiction. An Agent's commitment to purchase Notes as principal shall be deemed to have been made on the basis of the representations and warranties of the Company herein contained and shall be subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth. Unless the context otherwise requires, references herein to "this Agreement" shall include the agreement of one or more Agents to purchase Notes from the Company as principal.
 
The Company agrees to sell the Notes to the Purchasing Agent at a discount from the principal amount of each such Note equivalent to the applicable commission set forth in Exhibit A hereto; provided, however, that the Company and the Purchasing Agent may agree instead to a discount greater than or less than the percentages set forth on Exhibit A hereto. The actual aggregate discount with respect to each sale of Notes will be set forth in the related Terms Agreement and Pricing Supplement. The Purchasing Agent and the other Agents or selected broker-dealers (the "Selected Dealers") will share the above-mentioned discount in such proportions as they may agree.
 
(c) Procedural details relating to the issue and delivery of, and the solicitation of purchases and payment for, the Notes are set forth in the Administrative Procedures attached hereto as Exhibit B (the "Procedures"), as amended from time to time. Unless otherwise provided in a Terms Agreement, the provisions of the Procedures shall apply to all transactions contemplated hereunder. The Agents and the Company each agree to perform the respective duties and obligations specifically provided to be performed by each in the Procedures as amended from time to time. The Procedures may only be amended by written agreement of the Company and the Agents.

A Terms Agreement may also specify certain provisions relating to the reoffering of such Notes by the Purchasing Agent. The offering of Notes by the Company hereunder and the Purchasing Agent's agreement to purchase Notes pursuant to any Terms Agreement shall be deemed to have been made on the basis of the
 
representations, warranties and agreements of the Company herein contained and shall be subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth. Each Terms Agreement shall describe the Notes to be purchased pursuant thereto by the Purchasing Agent as principal, and may specify, among other things, the principal amount of Notes to be purchased, the interest rate or interest rate basis (and whether such interest rate shall be fixed or floating) and maturity date or dates of such Notes, the interest payment dates, if any, the net proceeds to the Company, the initial public offering price at which the Notes are proposed to be reoffered, and the time, Settlement Date and place of delivery of and payment for such Notes, total discounts and commissions received by the Agents with respect to such Notes, whether the Notes provide for a Survivor's Option (as such term is defined in the Prospectus), whether the Notes are redeemable or repayable and on what terms and conditions, and any other relevant terms.

case may be, will not conflict with, or result in a breach or violation of, any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under, any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement or other agreement or instrument to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company, or any of its subsidiaries is bound or to which any of the property or assets of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is subject, nor will such actions result in any violation of the provisions of the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws of the Company or the organizational documents of any of its subsidiaries or any statute or any order, rule or regulation of any court or insurance regulatory agency or other governmental agency or body having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any of their properties, except to the extent that such a conflict, breach, default or violation would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.
 
(g) Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries is, or at any time of delivery of the Notes will be, in violation of its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws or other organizational documents or instruments or in default in the performance or observance of any obligation, agreement, covenant or condition contained in any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement, lease or other agreement or instrument to which it is a party or by which it or any of its properties may be bound, which violation or default would have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.
 
(h) There are no legal or governmental proceedings pending to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or of which any property of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is the subject which, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, other than as set forth in the Prospectus; and, to the best of the Company's knowledge, no such proceedings are threatened or contemplated by governmental authorities or threatened by others, other than as set forth in the Prospectus.
 
(i) No consent or action of, or filing or registration with, any governmental or public regulatory body or authority, is required to be obtained by the Company in connection with the execution, delivery or performance by the Company of this Agreement, any applicable Terms Agreement, the Indenture or the Notes, except such as have been obtained and made under the Securities Act and the Trust Indenture Act and such as may be required under the securities or Blue Sky laws of the various states in connection with the offer and sale of the Notes.
 
(j) The Company is not, nor after giving effect to the transactions contemplated herein will be, an "investment company" as such term is defined in the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act").
 
(k) The obligations of the Company to pay the principal of and premium, if any, and interest on the Notes and any and all amounts that become due and payable under this Agreement constitute direct, unconditional and general obligations of the Company and rank and will rank in priority of payment with respect to all unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of the Company.
pari passu

(m) The consolidated financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries, together with the related schedules, notes and supplemental information, set forth in the Prospectus, comply in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act and interpretations thereof and present fairly in all material respects the financial position, the results of operations and the changes in cash flows of such entities in conformity with GAAP at the respective dates or for the respective periods to which they apply; such statements and related schedules, notes and supplemental information have been prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied throughout the periods involved except for any normal year-end adjustments and except as described therein.
 
 
The Company covenants and agrees with each Agent that:
 
(a) Each acceptance by the Company of an offer for the purchase of Notes and each delivery of Notes, shall be deemed to be an affirmation that the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement are true and correct at the time of such acceptance or sale, as the case may be, and an undertaking that such representations and warranties will be true and correct at the time of delivery to the purchaser or its agent, or to the applicable Agent, of the Note or Notes relating to such acceptance or sale, as the case may be, as though made at and as of each such time (and it is understood that such representations and warranties shall relate to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus as amended and supplemented at each such time).
 
(b) Each time that there is filed with the Commission any Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or Annual Report on Form 10-K incorporated by reference into the Prospectus, and otherwise only (i) as may be required in connection with a sale pursuant to Section IV(a) or (ii) at such times as may be reasonably requested by the Agents in the event of a material change in circumstances in respect of the Company, the Company shall furnish or cause to be furnished to the Agent(s) forthwith a certificate dated the date of filing with the Commission of such document, the date requested by the Agents or the date of such sale, as the case may be, in form reasonably satisfactory to the Agent(s) to the effect that the statements contained in the certificate referred to in Section II(c) hereof which were last furnished to the Agents are true and correct at the time of such filing, as though made at and as of such time (except that such statements shall be deemed to relate to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus as amended and supplemented to such time) or, in lieu of such certificate, a certificate substantially similar to the certificate referred to in Section II(c) hereof, modified as necessary to relate to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus as amended and supplemented to the time of delivery of such certificate.
 
(c) Each time that there is filed with the Commission any Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or Annual Report on Form 10-K incorporated by reference into the Prospectus, and otherwise only as may be required in connection with a sale pursuant to Section IV(a), the Company shall furnish or cause to be furnished forthwith, and in any case promptly upon request, to the Agent(s) and to counsel to the Agents the written opinion of counsel to the Company referred to in Section II(a), or other counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Agent(s), dated the date of filing with the Commission of such document, the date requested by the Agent(s) or the date of such sale, as the case may be, in form and scope reasonably satisfactory
 
to the Agent(s), of the same tenor as the opinions referred to in Section II(a) (except that, in the case of any interim report filed on Form 10-Q or other document or annual report on Form 10-K filed under the Exchange Act, such opinions need not be rendered as to the good standing of the entities referred to in Sections II(a)(2) and (3) hereof or as to the matters referred to in Section II(a)(9) and (10) hereof), but modified, as necessary, to relate to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus as amended and supplemented to the time of delivery of such opinion or, in lieu of such opinion, counsel last furnishing such opinion to the Agents shall furnish the Agent(s) with a letter substantially to the effect that the Agent(s) may rely on such last opinion to the same extent as though it were dated the date of such letter authorizing reliance (except that statements in such last opinion shall be deemed to relate to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus as amended and supplemented to the time of delivery of such letter authorizing reliance).
 
(d) Each time that there is filed with the Commission any Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or Annual Report on Form 10-K incorporated by reference into the Prospectus, and otherwise only as may be requested by the Agents in connection with a sale pursuant to Section IV(a), the Company shall furnish or cause their independent registered public accountants to furnish such Agents (i) in the case of a sale, a letter dated the date of such sale, in form reasonably satisfactory to the Agent(s), substantially in the form of the letter referred to in Section II(d) hereof, (ii) in the case of a filing of an Annual Report on Form 10-K, a letter in form reasonably satisfactory to the Agent(s), substantially in the form of the letter referred to in Section II(d) hereof, and (iii) in the case of a Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, a review letter from such accountants in conformity with the requirements of Statement of Accounting Standards No. 100, but modified as necessary to relate to the Registration Statement and Prospectus as amended and supplemented to the date of such letter, with such changes as may be necessary to reflect changes in the financial statements and other information derived from the accounting records of the Company.
 
 
(a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Agent against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Agent may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or any amendment thereof or the Prospectus, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse each Agent for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by it in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim as to which it is entitled to indemnification hereunder as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus as so amended or supplemented in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Agent expressly for use therein.
 
(b) Each Agent, severally and not jointly, will indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become
 
subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or any amendment thereof or the Prospectus, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in any Registration Statement or Prospectus as so amended or supplemented in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Agent expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred.
 
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party) and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party (or such other release of the indemnified party as shall be satisfactory to the indemnified party) from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
 
(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section VIII is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Agents on the other from the offering of the Notes to which such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party
 
failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Agents on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Agents on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering of such Notes purchased under this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total discounts and commissions received by the Agents with respect to such Notes purchased under this Agreement, in each case as set forth in Schedule A hereto. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or the Agents on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Agents agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by allocation (even if the Agents were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Agent shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Notes purchased by it and distributed to or placed by it with investors were offered to investors exceeds the amount of any damages which such Agent has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Agents' obligations in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective purchase obligations and not joint.
pro rata
 
(e) The obligations of the Company under this Section VIII shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Agent within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act; and the obligations of the Agents under this Section VIII shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Agents may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company (including any person who, with his or her consent, is named in the Prospectus as about to become a director of the Company) and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act.
 
 
The Company may elect to suspend or terminate the offering of Notes under this Agreement at any time; the Company also (as to any one or more of the Agents) or any Agent (as
 
to itself) may terminate the appointment and arrangements described in this Agreement. Upon receipt of instructions from the Company, the Purchasing Agent shall suspend or terminate the participation of any Selected Dealer under the Master Selected Dealer Agreement. Such actions may be taken, in the case of the Company, by giving prompt written notice of suspension to all of the Agents and by giving not less than five days' written notice of termination to the affected party and the other parties to this Agreement, or in the case of an Agent, by giving not less than five days' written notice of termination to the Company and except that, if at the time of termination an offer for the purchase of Notes shall have been accepted by the Company but the time of delivery to the purchaser or his agent of the Note or Notes relating thereto shall not yet have occurred, the Company shall have the obligations provided herein with respect to such Note or Notes. The Company shall promptly notify the other parties in writing of any such termination.
 
The Purchasing Agent may, and, upon the request of an Agent with respect to any Notes being purchased by such Agent shall, terminate any agreement hereunder by the Purchasing Agent to purchase such Notes, immediately upon notice to the Company at any time at or prior to the Settlement Date relating thereto, if there shall have come to the attention of the Purchasing Agent or such Agent or Agents any facts that would cause them to believe that the Prospectus, at the time it was required to be delivered to a purchaser of Notes, included an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances existing at the time of such delivery, not misleading. As used in this Section IX, the term "Prospectus" means the Prospectus in the form first provided to the applicable Agent or Agents for use in confirming sales of the related Notes.
 
Any Terms Agreement shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Agents on the terms set forth or incorporated by reference therein. The termination of this Agreement shall not require termination of any agreement by the Purchasing Agent to purchase Notes as principal, and the termination of any such agreement shall not require termination of this Agreement.
 
If this Agreement is terminated, Sections VIII, XII and XIII hereof shall survive and shall remain in effect; provided that if at the time of termination of this Agreement an offer to purchase Notes has been accepted by the Company but the time of delivery to the Purchasing Agent of such Notes has not occurred, the provisions of all of Section III, Section IV and Section V shall also survive until the time of delivery.
 
In the event a proposed offering is not completed according to the terms of this Agreement, an Agent will be reimbursed by the Company only for out-of-pocket accountable expenses actually incurred.
 
 
Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, all statements, requests, notices and advices hereunder shall be in writing, or by telephone if promptly confirmed in writing, and if to an Agent shall be sufficient in all respects if delivered in person or sent by telex, facsimile, e-mail transmission (confirmed in writing), or registered mail to such Agent at its address, telex or facsimile number set forth on Annex A hereto and if to the Company shall be sufficient in all respects if delivered or sent by telex, facsimile, e-mail transmission (confirmed in writing) or
 
registered mail to the Company at the address specified below. All such notices shall be effective on receipt.

This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the substantive laws of the State of New York.

Each party hereby also irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such action or proceeding brought in any such court and any claim that any such action or proceeding has been brought in an inconvenient forum.
 
 
Except as may otherwise be agreed by the Company and Banc of America Securities LLC, the Company will pay the following expenses incident to the performance of its obligations under this Agreement: (i) the preparation and filing of the Registration Statement; (ii) the preparation, issuance and delivery of the Notes; (iii) the fees and disbursements of the Company's auditors, of the Trustee and its counsel and of any paying or other agents appointed by the Company; (iv) the printing and delivery to the Agents in quantities as hereinabove stated of copies of the Registration Statement and the Prospectus; (v) if the Company lists Notes on a

This Agreement may be executed by each of the parties hereto in any number of counterparts, and by each of the parties hereto on separate counterparts, each of which counterparts, when so executed and delivered, shall be deemed to be an original, but all such counterparts shall together constitute but one and the same instrument. Facsimile signatures shall be deemed original signatures.
 
If the foregoing is in accordance with your understanding, please sign and return to us a counterpart hereof, and upon acceptance hereof by you, this letter and such acceptance hereof shall constitute a binding agreement between the Company and you.

The following Concessions are payable as a percentage of the non-discounted Price to Public of each Note sold through the Purchasing Agent.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Prudential Financial Inc.'s Retail Medium-Term Notes, due one year or more from date of issue (the "Notes") may be offered on a continuing basis by Prudential Financial, Inc. (the "Company"). The Notes will be offered by a purchasing agent (the "Purchasing Agent"), who shall be designated for each issuance and sale of Notes in accordance with the terms of the Selling Agent Agreement (as defined herein), Banc of America Securities LLC, A.G. Edward & Sons, Inc, Bear, Stearns & Co. Inc., Charles Schwab & Company, Incorporated, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Edward D. Jones & Co., L.P., Fidelity Capital Markets, a division of National Financial Services, LLC, Incapital LLC, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, Muriel Siebert & Co., Samuel A. Ramirez & Co., Inc, Raymond James & Associates, Inc., RBC Dain Rauscher Inc., UBS Financial Services, Inc., and Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC (collectively, the "Agents") pursuant to a Selling Agent Agreement among the Company and the Agents dated as of the date hereof (the "Selling Agent Agreement") and one or more terms agreements substantially in the form attached to the Selling Agent Agreement as Exhibit C (each a "Terms Agreement"). The Notes are being resold by the Purchasing Agent (and by any Agent that purchases them from the Purchasing Agent) (i) directly to customers of the Agents or (ii) to selected broker-dealers (the "Selected Dealers") for distribution to their customers pursuant to a Master Selected Dealer Agreement (a "Dealers Agreement") attached to the Selling Agent Agreement as Exhibit E. The Notes have been registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission"). Citibank, N.A. is the trustee (the "Trustee") under the indenture, dated as of April 25, 2003, between the Company and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (formerly known as JPMorgan Chase Bank) as amended to designate the Trustee for the Notes by a supplemental indenture, dated as of March 25, 2004 (as amended or supplemented from time to time, the "Indenture"), between the Company and the Trustee, covering, among other debt securities, the Notes. Pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, Citibank, N.A. also will serve as authenticating agent, issuing agent and paying agent.
 
Unless otherwise agreed by the Agents and the Company, Notes will be purchased by the Purchasing Agent as principal as set forth herein. Such purchases will be made in accordance with terms agreed upon by the Purchasing Agent and the Company (which terms, unless otherwise agreed, shall be agreed upon orally, with written confirmation prepared by the Agents and mailed, facsimiled or e-mailed to the Company).
 
Unless otherwise agreed by the Agents and the Company, the Notes will be issued in book-entry form only (each, a "Book-Entry Note") and represented by a fully registered master global note without coupons (each, a "Master Global Note") held by the Trustee, as agent for The Depository Trust Company ("DTC") and recorded in the book-entry system maintained by DTC. Owners of beneficial interests in Book-Entry Notes will be entitled to physical delivery of Notes
 
issued in certificated form equal in principal amount to their respective beneficial interests only upon certain limited circumstances described in the Indenture.
 
Administrative procedures and specific terms of the offering are explained below. Administrative and record-keeping responsibilities will be handled for the Company by its Treasury Department. The Company will advise the Agents and the Trustee in writing of those persons handling administrative responsibilities with whom the Agents and the Trustee are to communicate regarding offers to purchase Notes and the details of their delivery.
 
Notes will be issued in accordance with the administrative procedures set forth herein. To the extent the procedures set forth below conflict with or omit certain of the provisions of the Notes, the Indenture, the Selling Agent Agreement or information set forth in the Prospectus (as defined in the Selling Agent Agreement) and the Pricing Supplement (together referred to herein as the "Prospectus"), the relevant provisions of the Notes, the Indenture, the Selling Agent Agreement and the information set forth in Prospectus shall control. Capitalized terms used herein that are not otherwise defined shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Selling Agent Agreement, the Prospectus in the form most recently filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, (the "Securities Act"), or in the Indenture.
 
 
In connection with the qualification of Notes for eligibility in the book-entry system maintained by DTC, the Trustee will perform the custodial, document control and administrative functions described below, in accordance with its obligations under a Letter of Representations from the Company and the Trustee to DTC, dated April 29, 2005 and a Medium-Term Note Certificate Agreement between the Trustee and DTC (the "Certificate Agreement") dated October 31, 1988 and its obligations as a participant in DTC, including DTC's Same-Day Funds Settlement System ("SDFS").

In connection with public offerings of securities after the date hereof for which there will be a manager of an underwriting syndicate for each such offering (the "Purchasing Agent"), where such Purchasing Agent may be any one of the parties to this Agreement, and such Purchasing Agent will be responsible for the distribution of securities to the public by means of an offering of securities for sale to selected dealers (the "Selected Dealers"), each Selected Dealer may be offered the right to purchase as principal a portion of such securities. This will confirm the agreement between the parties hereto that if any such party acts as Purchasing Agent, it agrees with each of the other parties hereto as Selected Dealers, through each Selected Dealer's execution of this Agreement, as to the general terms and conditions applicable to each Selected Dealer's participation in any such Selected Dealer group organized by the Purchasing Agent as follows.
 
1. . The terms and conditions of this Agreement shall be applicable to any public offering of securities ("Securities"), pursuant to a registration statement filed under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act"), or exempt from registration thereunder (other than a public offering of Securities effected wholly outside the United States of America), wherein the Purchasing Agent clearing through BNY Clearing Services, LLC (the "Account") (acting for its own Account or for the account of any underwriting or similar group or syndicate) is responsible for managing or otherwise implementing the sale of the Securities to the Selected Dealers and has expressly informed the Selected Dealers that such terms and conditions shall be applicable. Any such offering of Securities to the Selected Dealers is hereinafter called an "Offering". In the case of any Offering where the Purchasing Agent is acting for the account of any underwriting or similar group or syndicate ("Underwriters"), the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall be for the benefit of, and binding upon, such Underwriters, including, in the case of any Offering where the Purchasing Agent is acting with others as representatives of Underwriters, such other representatives.
Applicability of this Agreement
 
2. . Any Offering: (i) will be subject to delivery of the Securities and their acceptance by the Purchasing Agent and any other Underwriters; (ii) may be subject to the approval of all legal matters by counsel and the satisfaction of other conditions, and (iii) may be made on the basis of reservation of Securities or an allotment against subscription. The Purchasing Agent will advise the Selected Dealers by electronic mail, facsimile or other form of written communication ("Written Communication", which term, in the case of any Offering described in Section 3(a) or 3(b) hereof, may include a prospectus or offering circular) of the particular method and supplementary terms and conditions (including, without limitation, the information as to prices and offering date referred to in Section 3(c) hereof) of any Offering in which the Selected Dealers are invited to participate. To the extent such supplementary terms and conditions are inconsistent with any provision herein, such terms and conditions shall supersede any such provision. Unless otherwise indicated in any such Written Communication, acceptances and other communications by any of the Selected Dealers with
Conditions of Offering; Acceptance and Purchases
 
respect to an Offering should be sent to the Purchasing Agent at the address indicated on the signature page hereto. The Purchasing Agent reserves the right to reject any acceptance in whole or in part. Unless notified otherwise by the Purchasing Agent, Securities purchased by the Selected Dealers shall be paid for on such date as the Purchasing Agent shall determine, on one day's prior notice to the Selected Dealers, by certified or official bank check, in an amount equal to the Public Offering Prices (as hereinafter defined) or, if the Purchasing Agent shall so advise the Selected Dealers, at such Public Offering Price less the Concession (as hereinafter defined), payable in New York Clearing House funds to the order of BNY Clearing Services, LLC clearing for the account of the Purchasing Agent, against delivery of the Securities. If Securities are purchased and paid for at such Public Offering Price, such Concession will be paid after the termination of the provisions of Section 3(c) hereof with respect to such Securities. Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless notified otherwise by the Purchasing Agent, payment for and delivery of Securities purchased by a Selected Dealer shall be made through the facilities of The Depository Trust Company, if such Selected Dealer is a member, unless the Selected Dealer has otherwise notified us prior to the date specified in a Written Communication to the Selected Dealers from us or, if such Selected Dealer is not a member, settlement may be made through a correspondent who is a member pursuant to instructions which such Selected Dealer will send to the Purchasing Agent prior to such specified date.
 
3. .
Representations, Warranties and Agreements
 
(a) . In the case of any Offering of Securities that are registered under the Securities Act ("Registered Offering"), the Purchasing Agent shall provide each Selected Dealer with such number of copies of each preliminary prospectus and of the final prospectus relating thereto as it may reasonably request for the purposes contemplated by the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission thereunder. Each Selected Dealer represents and warrants that it is familiar with Rule 15c2-8 under the Exchange Act relating to the distribution of preliminary and final prospectuses and agrees to comply therewith. Each Selected Dealer agrees to make a record of its distribution of each preliminary prospectus and, when furnished with copies of any revised preliminary prospectus, will, upon the request of the Purchasing Agent, promptly forward copies thereof to each person to whom it has theretofore distributed a preliminary prospectus. Each Selected Dealer agrees that in purchasing Securities in a Registered Offering it will rely upon no statement whatsoever, written or oral, other than the statements in the final prospectus delivered to it by the Purchasing Agent. The Selected Dealers ill not be authorized by the issuer or other seller of Securities offered pursuant to a prospectus or by any Underwriter, to give any information or to make any representation not contained in the prospectus in connection with the sale of such Securities.
Registered Offerings
 
(b) . In the case of any Offering of Securities, other than a Registered Offering, which is made pursuant to an offering circular or other document comparable to a prospectus in a Registered Offering, the Purchasing Agent shall provide each Selected Dealer with such number of copies of each preliminary offering circular and of the final offering circular relating thereto as it may reasonably request. Each Selected Dealer agrees that it will comply with the applicable Federal and state laws, and the applicable rules and regulations of any regulatory body promulgated thereunder, governing the use and
Offerings Pursuant to Offering Circular
 
distribution of offering circulars by brokers or dealers. Each Selected Dealer agrees that in purchasing Securities pursuant to an offering circular, it will rely upon no statements whatsoever, written or oral, other than the statements in the final offering circular delivered to such Selected Dealer by the Purchasing Agent. The Selected Dealers will not be authorized by the issuer or other seller of Securities offered pursuant to an offering circular or by any Underwriter, to give any information or to make any representation not contained in the offering circular in connection with the sale of such Securities.
 
(c) . With respect to any Offering of Securities, the Purchasing Agent will inform the Selected Dealers by a Written Communication of the public offering price, the selling concession, the reallowance (if any) to dealers and the time when the Selected Dealers may commence selling Securities to the public. After such public offering has commenced, the Purchasing Agent may change the public offering price, the selling concession and the reallowance to dealers. The offering price, selling concession and reallowance (if any) to dealers at any time in effect with respect to an Offering are hereinafter referred to, respectively, as the "Public Offering Price", the "Concession" and the "Reallowance". With respect to each Offering of Securities, until the provisions of this Section 3(c) shall be terminated pursuant to Section 4 hereof, the Selected Dealers agree to offer Securities to the public at no more than the Public Offering Price. If so notified by the Purchasing Agent, the Selected Dealers may sell Securities to the public at a lesser negotiated price than the Public Offering Price, but in an amount not to exceed the "Concession". If a Reallowance is in effect, a reallowance from the Public Offering Price not in excess of such Reallowance may be allowed as consideration for services rendered in distribution to dealers who are actually engaged in the investment banking or securities business, who execute the written agreement prescribed by Rule 2740 of the Conduct Rules of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (the "NASD") and who are either members in good standing of the NASD or foreign banks, dealers or institutions not eligible for membership in the NASD who represent to the Selected Dealer that they will promptly reoffer such Securities at the Public Offering Price and will abide by the conditions with respect to foreign banks, dealers and institutions set forth in Section 3(e) hereof.
Offer and Sale to the Public
 
(d) . The Purchasing Agent may, with respect to any Offering, be authorized to over-allot in arranging sales to Selected Dealers, to purchase and sell Securities for long or short account and to stabilize or maintain the market price of the Securities. Each Selected Dealer agrees that, upon the request of the Purchasing Agent at any time and from time to time prior to the termination of the provisions of Section 3(c) hereof with respect to any Offering, it will report to the Purchasing Agent the amount of Securities it purchased pursuant to such Offering which then remain unsold and will, upon the request of the Purchasing Agent at any such time, sell to the Purchasing Agent for its account or the account of one or more Underwriters such amount of such unsold Securities as the Purchasing Agent may designate at the Public Offering Price less an amount to be determined by the Purchasing Agent not in excess of the Concession. If, prior to the later of (i) the termination of the provisions of Section 3(c) hereof with respect to any Offering or (ii) the covering by the Purchasing Agent of any short position created by the Purchasing Agent in connection with such Offering for its account or the account of one or more Underwriters, the Purchasing Agent purchases or contracts to purchase for its account or the account of one or more Underwriters in
Over-allotment; Stabilization; Unsold Allotments
 
the open market or otherwise any Securities purchased by a Selected Dealer under this Agreement as part of such Offering, such Selected Dealer agrees to pay us on demand an amount equal to the Concession with respect to such Securities (unless such Selected Dealer shall have purchased such Securities pursuant to Section 2 hereof at the Public Offering Price in which case the Purchasing Agent shall not be obligated to pay such Concession to such Selected Dealer pursuant to Section 2) plus transfer taxes and broker's commissions or dealer's mark-up, if any, paid in connection with such purchase or contract to purchase.
 
(e) . Each Selected Dealer represents and warrants that it is actually engaged in the investment banking or securities business and either a member in good standing of the NASD or, if it is not such a member, is a foreign bank, dealer or institution not eligible for membership in the NASD which agrees to make no sales within the United States, its territories or its possessions or to persons who are citizens thereof or residents therein, and in making other sales to comply with the NASD's interpretation with respect to free riding and withholding. Each Selected Dealer further represents, by its participation in an Offering, that it has provided to us all documents and other information required to be filed with respect to it, any related person or any person associated with it or any such related person pursuant to the supplementary requirements of the NASD's interpretation with respect to review of corporate financing as such requirements relate to such Offering.
NASD
 
Each Selected Dealer agrees that, in connection with any purchase or sale of the Securities wherein a Concession, discount or other allowance is received or granted, (1) it will comply with the provisions of Rule 2740 of the NASD's Conduct Rules and (2) if it is a non-NASD member broker or dealer in a foreign country, it will also comply (a), as though it were an NASD member, with the provisions of IM-2110-1 and Rules 2730, 2740 and 2750 of the NASD's Conduct Rules and (b) with Rule 2420 thereof as that Rule applies to a non-NASD member broker or dealer in a foreign country.
 
Each Selected Dealer further agrees that, in connection with any purchase of securities from the Purchasing Agent that is not otherwise covered by the terms of this Agreement (whether the Purchasing Agent is acting as manager, as a member of an underwriting syndicate or a selling group or otherwise), if a Concession or other allowance is granted to a Selected Dealer, clauses (1) and (2) of the preceding paragraph will be applicable.
 
(f) . The Purchasing Agent may buy Securities from or sell Securities to any Underwriter or Selected Dealer and, without consent, the Underwriters (if any) and the Selected Dealers may purchase Securities from and sell Securities to each other at the Public Offering Price less all or any part of the Concession. Unless otherwise specified in a separate agreement between the Purchasing Agent and the Selected Dealers, this agreement does not authorize any Selected Dealer to act as agent for: (i) the Purchasing Agent; (ii) any Underwriter; (iii) the issuer; or (iv) other seller of any Securities in offering Securities to the public or otherwise. Neither the Purchasing Agent nor any Underwriter shall be under any obligation to any Selected Dealer except for obligations assumed hereby or in any Written Communication from the Purchasing Agent in connection with any Offering. Nothing contained herein or in any Written Communication from the Purchasing Agent shall constitute the Selected Dealers an association or partners with the Purchasing Agent or any Underwriter or with one another. If the Selected Dealers, among themselves or with the
Relationship among Underwriters and Selected Dealers
 
Underwriters, should be deemed to constitute a partnership for Federal income tax purposes, then each Selected Dealers elects to be excluded from the application of Subchapter K, Chapter 1, Subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and agrees not to take any position inconsistent with that election. Each Selected Dealer authorizes us, in our discretion, to execute and file on its behalf such evidence of that election as may be required by the Internal Revenue Service. In connection with any Offering, each Selected Dealer shall be liable for its proportionate amount of any tax, claim, demand or liability that may be asserted against it alone or against one or more Selected Dealers participating in such Offering, or against us or the Underwriters, based upon the claim that the Selected Dealers, or any of them, constitute an association, an unincorporated business or other entity, including, in each case, its proportionate amount of any expense incurred in defending against any such tax, claim, demand or liability.
 
(g) . Upon application to the Purchasing Agent, the Purchasing Agent shall inform the Selected Dealers as to any advice it has received from counsel concerning the jurisdictions in which Securities have been qualified for sale or are exempt under the securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions, but the Purchasing Agent does not assume any obligation or responsibility as to the Selected Dealers' right to sell Securities in any such jurisdiction.
Blue Sky Laws
 
(h) . Each Selected Dealer agrees that in selling Securities pursuant to any Offering (which agreement shall also be for the benefit of the issuer or other seller of such Securities), it will comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations, including the applicable provisions of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission thereunder, the applicable rules and regulations of the NASD, the applicable rules and regulations of any securities exchange having jurisdiction over the Offering and the applicable laws, rules and regulations specified in Section 3(b) hereof.
Compliance with Law
 
4. . This Agreement shall continue in full force and effect until terminated by a written instrument executed by each of the parties hereto. This Agreement may be supplemented or amended by the Purchasing Agent by written notice thereof to the Selected Dealers, and any such supplement or amendment to this Agreement shall be effective with respect to any Offering to which this Agreement applies after the date of such supplement or amendment. Each reference to "this Agreement" herein shall, as appropriate, be to this Agreement as so amended and supplemented. The terms and conditions set forth in Section 3(c) hereof with regard to any Offering will terminate at the close of business on the 30th day after the commencement of the public offering of the Securities to which such Offering relates, but in Purchasing Agent's discretion may be extended by us for a further period not exceeding 30 days and in the Purchasing Agent's discretion, whether or not extended, may be terminated at any earlier time.
Termination, Supplements and Amendments
 
5. . This Agreement shall be binding on, and inure to the benefit of, the parties hereto and other persons specified in Section 1 hereof, and the respective successors and assigns of each of them.
Successors and Assigns
 
6. . This Agreement and the terms and conditions set forth herein with respect to any Offering together with such supplementary terms and conditions with
Governing Law
