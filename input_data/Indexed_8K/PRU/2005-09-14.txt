Effective September 13, 2005, Prudential Financial, Inc. (the "Company") adopted a policy permitting certain employees to enter into prearranged trading plans ("Individual Trading Plans") that are designed to meet the requirements of Rule 10b5-1(c) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Employees who may enter into Individual Trading Plans under the new policy include, among others, the Company's principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer, controller and other members of senior management. Under a properly implemented Individual Trading Plan, an employee who is not aware of material non-public information at the time the employee enters into the Individual Trading Plan may effect prearranged sales of Company common stock regardless of whether the employee is aware of material non-public information at the time of such sales. Under Company policy, Company employees may begin implementing Individual Trading Plans following the announcement of earnings for the third quarter of 2005.
 
In connection with the adoption of this new policy, the Company has amended its code of business conduct and ethics, known as "Making the Right Choices", which is posted on the Company's website at www.investor.prudential.com.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
