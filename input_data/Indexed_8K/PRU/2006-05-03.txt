Prudential Financial, Inc., a New Jersey corporation, furnishes herewith, as Exhibit 99.0, a news release announcing first quarter 2006 results.
 
 
 
 
As indicated in the news release furnished as Exhibit 99.0 to this Current Report on Form 8-K, first quarter 2006 results of operations of our Financial Advisory segment, which reflects the combination of our former Prudential Securities (PSI) retail brokerage operations with those of Wachovia Securities, LLC on July 1, 2003, include expenses of $176 million related to obligations and costs we retained in connection with the contributed businesses, primarily to increase our reserve for estimated settlement costs related to market timing issues under active negotiation with state and federal authorities. We are actively seeking global resolution of these issues with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the United States Attorney, District of Massachusetts, the New York Attorney General's Office, the New York Stock Exchange, the National Association of Securities Dealers, the New Jersey Bureau of Securities and the Securities Division of Massachusetts. While not assured, we currently expect to achieve such a settlement without material additions to our reserve for estimated settlement costs. If achieved, any settlement would involve fines and penalties and could involve continuing monitoring and changes to and/or supervision of business practices, findings that may adversely affect existing litigation or cause additional litigation, adverse publicity and other adverse impacts to our businesses.
Please see our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2005 for further discussion of these and other litigation and regulatory matters.
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
Date: May 3, 2006
 
 

Exhibit 99.0
 
Prudential Financial, Inc. (NYSE:PRU) today reported net income for its Financial Services Businesses of $675 million ($1.38 per Common share) for the first quarter of 2006, compared to $766 million ($1.49 per Common share) for the year-ago quarter. After-tax adjusted operating income for the Financial Services Businesses for the first quarter of 2006 was $669 million ($1.36 per Common share), including pre-tax expenses of $176 million related to obligations and costs we retained in connection with the businesses contributed to the retail securities brokerage joint venture with Wachovia. These expenses had an impact on earnings per share of approximately 25 cents, and primarily reflect an increase in our reserve for estimated settlement costs related to market timing issues under active negotiation with state and federal authorities. We currently expect to achieve a settlement without material additions to our reserve for estimated settlement costs. For the first quarter of 2005, after-tax adjusted operating income was $601 million ($1.18 per Common share).
NEWARK, N.J. 
"Our first quarter business results are on track with our objectives for the year. Our annuity business is continuing to benefit from attractive product offerings and expanded distribution, and will be further strengthened by the acquisition of Allstate's variable annuity business, which we expect to close by the end of the second quarter. The integration of the retirement business we acquired from CIGNA is now complete, and we're investing in the expansion of our capabilities in full service retirement, where we see attractive long-term market prospects. Our domestic protection businesses  Individual Life and Group Insurance  are performing well. In our Asset Management business, greater asset management fees contributed to earnings growth this quarter, and results continued to benefit from a strong commercial real estate market. Our International businesses are benefiting from business growth and the actions we've taken to enhance investment returns," said Chairman and CEO Arthur F. Ryan.

"We continue to believe that Prudential Financial will achieve Common Stock earnings per share in the range of $5.40 to $5.60 for the year 2006, based on after-tax adjusted operating income of the Financial Services Businesses. This expectation assumes appreciation in the S&P 500 index of 2 percent per quarter for the balance of the year," Ryan said. The 2006 expectation is subject to change if this assumption is not realized and as discussed under "Forward-Looking Statements" below.
Adjusted operating income excludes "Realized investment gains (losses), net" (other than those representing profit or loss of certain of our businesses which primarily originate investments for sale or syndication to unrelated investors, and those associated with terminating hedges of foreign currency earnings and current period yield adjustments) and related charges and adjustments, and results from divested businesses. In addition, recorded changes in asset values that will ultimately accrue to contractholders are excluded from adjusted operating income. Similarly, recorded changes in contractholder liabilities resulting from changes in related asset values are also excluded from adjusted operating income. Adjusted operating income also excludes discontinued operations, which is presented as a separate component of net income under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).
Financial Services Businesses
Prudential Financial's Common Stock (NYSE:PRU) reflects the performance of its Financial Services Businesses, which consist of its Insurance, Investment, and International Insurance and Investments divisions and its Corporate and Other operations.
Presented below is a discussion of the results of our divisions, based on a non-GAAP financial measure we call adjusted operating income. We believe that the presentation of adjusted operating income as we measure it for management purposes enhances understanding of the results of operations of the Financial Services Businesses by highlighting the results from ongoing operations and the underlying profitability of our businesses. The schedules accompanying this release provide a reconciliation of adjusted operating income for the Financial Services Businesses to income from continuing operations in accordance with GAAP.

In the following business-level discussion, adjusted operating income refers to pre-tax results. As discussed below, results for the year-ago quarter for several segments benefited from collection of a previously defaulted bond, which contributed a total of $30 million to first quarter 2005 pre-tax adjusted operating income of the Financial Services Businesses.
The reported adjusted operating income of $298 million for the first quarter of 2006, an increase of $43 million from $255 million in the year-ago quarter. Our Individual Life and Annuities segment reported adjusted operating income of $251 million for the current quarter, compared to $217 million in the year-ago quarter. The segment's individual life insurance business reported adjusted operating income of $133 million in the current quarter, a $16 million increase from the year-ago quarter. Current quarter results benefited from mortality experience more favorable than that of the year-ago quarter, higher asset-based fees and increased net investment spread on general account business, while results for the year-ago quarter included $10 million from collection of investment income on a previously defaulted bond. The segment's individual annuity business reported adjusted operating income of $118 million in the current quarter, an $18 million increase from the year-ago quarter. Current quarter results benefited from higher asset-based fees due to growth in variable annuity account values, while results for the year-ago quarter included $9 million from collection of investment income on a previously defaulted bond. Our Group Insurance segment reported adjusted operating income of $47 million in the current quarter, a $9 million increase from the year-ago quarter. Current quarter results benefited from more favorable disability claims experience than that of the year-ago quarter, which was partly offset by less favorable group life claims experience. Group Insurance results for the year-ago quarter included $4 million from collection of investment income on a previously defaulted bond.
Insurance division
The reported adjusted operating income of $240 million for the first quarter of 2006, compared to $304 million in the year-ago quarter. The Retirement segment reported adjusted operating income of $137 million for the current quarter, compared to $155 million in the year-ago quarter. Retirement segment results for the year-ago quarter benefited from reserve releases from updates of client census data on a block of business and collection of

investment income on a previously defaulted bond, totaling $17 million. Excluding the effect of these items, adjusted operating income for the Retirement segment was essentially unchanged from the year-ago quarter. Increased expenses in the current quarter, including costs incurred to expand distribution and client servicing capabilities of the segment's full service retirement business, more than offset higher fees from growth in retirement account values and a decrease in transition costs associated with integration of the retirement business acquired from CIGNA which was completed during the current quarter. These transition costs amounted to $6 million in the current quarter and $9 million in the year-ago quarter. The Asset Management segment reported adjusted operating income of $169 million for the current quarter, an increase of $35 million from the year-ago quarter. Current quarter results benefited from increased incentive fees primarily related to real estate investment management and greater asset management fees in our investment management and advisory services operation. Results from the segment's proprietary investing business were essentially unchanged from the year-ago quarter, which included income of $35 million from a single sale in the proprietary investing business. Our Financial Advisory segment, which reflects our retail securities brokerage joint venture with Wachovia, reported a loss, on an adjusted operating income basis, of $66 million for the current quarter compared to adjusted operating income of $15 million in the year-ago quarter. Our 38% share of the venture's results resulted in adjusted operating income of $69 million for the current quarter, compared to $50 million in the year-ago quarter before transition costs, reflecting increased fee income. However, current quarter results also include expenses of $176 million related to obligations and costs we retained in connection with the contributed businesses primarily for litigation and regulatory matters, primarily to increase a reserve for estimated settlement costs related to market timing issues under active negotiation with state and federal authorities. There were no transition costs in the current quarter as the business integration was completed in 2005. The segment's current quarter results also include income of $42 million from securities relating to trading exchange memberships, primarily representing shares received in connection with the commencement of public trading of exchange shares. Segment results for the year-ago quarter included absorption of $11 million of transition costs and $27 million related to the obligations and costs we retained.

The reported adjusted operating income of $382 million for the first quarter of 2006, an increase of $72 million from $310 million in the year-ago quarter. The International Insurance segment reported adjusted operating income of $338 million for the current quarter, compared to $285 million for the year-ago quarter. Adjusted operating income from our international insurance operations other than Gibraltar Life increased $49 million to $228 million in the current quarter. Adjusted operating income benefited from continued business growth in our Life Planner operations, a more favorable level of policy benefits and expenses in the current quarter, increased net investment spreads, and a favorable impact of $13 million, versus the year-ago quarter, from foreign currency exchange rates. The segment's Gibraltar Life operations reported adjusted operating income of $110 million for the current quarter, compared to $106 million in the year-ago quarter. Current quarter results benefited from increased net investment spreads and a favorable impact of $5 million from foreign currency exchange rates, versus the year-ago quarter, but reflected a less favorable level of policy benefits and expenses than the year-ago quarter. The International Investments segment reported adjusted operating income of $44 million for the current quarter, compared to $25 million in the year-ago quarter. Current quarter results include income of $15 million from market value changes in securities held relating to trading exchange memberships and benefited from more favorable results from the segment's joint venture operations.

resulted in adjusted operating income of $26 million in the first quarter of 2006, compared to $17 million in the year-ago quarter.

of the Financial Services Businesses for the first quarter of 2006 amounted to $675 million, compared to $766 million in the year-ago quarter. Current quarter net income reflects pre-tax decreases of $114 million in recorded asset values and $66 million in recorded liabilities representing changes in value which will ultimately accrue to contractholders. These changes primarily represent interest-rate related mark-to-market adjustments. Net income for the current quarter also includes $51 million of net realized investment gains and related charges and adjustments, and $8 million income from divested businesses, in each case before income taxes.
Net income
Net realized investment gains in the current quarter include $15 million of losses from impairments and sales of credit-impaired securities. At March 31, 2006, gross unrealized losses on general account fixed maturity investments of the Financial Services Businesses amounted to $1.058 billion, including $967 million on investment-grade securities, which are substantially all interest rate related.

guarantee of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties, and there are certain important factors that could cause actual results to differ, possibly materially, from expectations or estimates reflected in such forward-looking statements, including, among others: (1) general economic, market and political conditions, including the performance and fluctuations of stock, real estate, and other financial markets; (2) interest rate fluctuations; (3) reestimates of our reserves for future policy benefits and claims; (4) differences between actual experience regarding mortality, morbidity, persistency, surrender experience, interest rates or market returns and the assumptions we use in pricing our products, establishing liabilities and reserves or for other purposes; (5) changes in our assumptions related to deferred policy acquisition costs, valuation of business acquired or goodwill; (6) changes in our claims-paying or credit ratings; (7) investment losses and defaults; (8) competition in our product lines and for personnel; (9) changes in tax law; (10) economic, political, currency and other risks relating to our international operations; (11) fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and foreign securities markets; (12) regulatory or legislative changes; (13) adverse determinations in litigation or regulatory matters and our exposure to contingent liabilities, including in connection with our divestiture or winding down of businesses; (14) domestic or international military actions, natural or man-made disasters including terrorist activities or pandemic disease, or other events resulting in catastrophic loss of life; (15) ineffectiveness of risk management policies and procedures in identifying, monitoring and managing risks; (16) effects of acquisitions, divestitures and restructurings, including possible difficulties in integrating and realizing the projected results of acquisitions; (17) changes in statutory or U.S. GAAP accounting principles, practices or policies; (18) changes in assumptions for retirement expense; (19) Prudential Financial, Inc.'s primary reliance, as a holding company, on dividends or distributions from its subsidiaries to meet debt payment obligations and continue share repurchases, and the applicable regulatory restrictions on the ability of the subsidiaries to pay such dividends or distributions; and (20) risks due to the lack of legal separation between our Financial Services Businesses and our Closed Block Business.

As indicated above, our expectation of Common Stock earnings per share is based on after-tax adjusted operating income. Adjusted operating income, a non-GAAP measure, excludes Realized investment gains (losses), net (other than those representing profit or loss of certain of our businesses which primarily originate investments for sale or syndication to unrelated investors, and those associated with terminating hedges of foreign currency earnings and current period yield adjustments). A significant element of realized losses is impairments and losses from sales of credit-impaired securities, the timing of which depends largely on market credit cycles and can vary considerably across periods. The timing of other sales that would result in gains or losses is largely subject to our discretion and influenced by market opportunities. Similarly, adjusted operating income excludes investment gains and losses on trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities and changes in experience-rated contractholder liabilities due to asset value changes, because these recorded changes in asset and liability values will ultimately accrue to contractholders. Trends in the underlying profitability of our businesses can be more clearly identified without the fluctuating effects of these transactions. Adjusted operating income also excludes the results of divested businesses, which are not relevant to our ongoing operations. Because we do not predict future realized investment gains / losses or recorded changes in asset and liability values that will ultimately accrue to contractholders, we cannot provide a measure of our Common Stock earnings per share expectation based on income from continuing operations of the Financial Services Businesses, which is the GAAP measure most comparable to adjusted operating income.
The information referred to above, as well as the risks of our businesses described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2005, should be considered by readers when reviewing forward-looking statements contained in this release.

KEY DEFINITIONS AND FORMULAS
1. Adjusted operating income before income taxes:
Adjusted operating income is a non-GAAP measure that excludes Realized investment gains (losses), net (other than those representing profit or loss of certain of our businesses which primarily originate investments for sale or syndication to unrelated investors, and those associated with terminating hedges of foreign currency earnings and current period yield adjustments), and related charges and adjustments; net investment gains and losses on trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities; change in experience-rated contract holder liabilities due to asset value changes; results of divested businesses and discontinued operations; and the related tax effects thereof. Revenues and benefits and expenses shown as components of adjusted operating income, are presented on the same basis as pre-tax adjusted operating income and exclude these items as well. Adjusted operating income does not equate to "Income from continuing operations before income taxes" as determined in accordance with GAAP but is the measure of profit or loss we use to evaluate segment performance. Adjusted operating income is not a substitute for income determined in accordance with GAAP, and our definition of adjusted operating income may differ from that used by other companies. The excluded items are important to an understanding of our overall results of operations. However, we believe that the presentation of adjusted operating income as we measure it for management purposes enhances the understanding of our results of operations by highlighting the results from ongoing operations and the underlying profitability factors of our businesses.
2. After-tax adjusted operating income:
Adjusted operating income before taxes, as defined above, less the income tax effect applicable to adjusted operating income before taxes.
3. Assets Under Management:
Fair market value or account value of assets which Prudential manages directly in proprietary products, such as mutual funds and variable annuities, in separate accounts, wrap-fee products and the general account, and assets invested in investment options included in the Company's products that are managed by third party sub-managers (i.e., the non-proprietary investment options in the Company's products).
4. Attributed Equity:
Amount of capital assigned to each of the Company's segments for purposes of measuring segment adjusted operating income before income taxes, established at a level which management considers necessary to support the segment's risks. Attributed equity for the Financial Services Businesses represents all of the Company's equity that is not included in the Closed Block Business.
5. Book value per share of Common Stock:
Equity attributed to Financial Services Businesses divided by the number of Common shares outstanding at end of period, on a diluted basis.
6. Borrowings - Capital Debt:
Borrowings that are or will be used for capital requirements at Prudential Financial, Inc as well as borrowings invested in equity or debt securities of direct or indirect subsidiaries of Prudential Financial, Inc., and subsidiary borrowings, utilized for capital requirements.
7. Borrowings - Investment Related:
Debt issued to finance specific investment assets or portfolios of investment assets, including institutional spread lending investment portfolios, real estate, and real estate related investments held in consolidated joint ventures, as well as institutional and insurance company portfolio cash flow timing differences.

KEY DEFINITIONS AND FORMULAS
11. Earned Premiums:
The portion of a premium, net of any amount ceded, that represents coverage already provided or that belongs to the insurer based on the part of the policy period that has passed.
12. Earnings Per Share of Common Stock:
Net income for the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business is determined in accordance with GAAP and includes general and administrative expenses charged to each of the businesses based on the Company's methodology for the allocation of such expenses. Cash flows between the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business related to administrative expenses are determined by a policy servicing fee arrangement that is based upon insurance and policies in force and statutory cash premiums. To the extent reported administrative expenses vary from these cash flow amounts, the differences are recorded, on an after-tax basis, as direct equity adjustments to the equity balances of each business. The direct equity adjustments modify earnings available to holders of Common Stock and Class B Stock for earnings per share purposes. Earnings per share of Common Stock based on adjusted operating income of the Financial Services Businesses reflects these adjustments as well.
13. Full Service:
The Full Service line of business provides retirement plan products and services to public, private and not-for-profit organizations. This business provides recordkeeping, plan administration, actuarial advisory services, participant education and communication services, trustee services and institutional and retail investment funds. This business mainly services defined contribution and defined benefit plans; non-qualified plans are also serviced. For clients with both defined contribution and defined benefit plans, integrated recordkeeping services are available. For participants leaving these plans, a range of rollover products are provided through a broker-dealer bank.
14. Full Service Stable Value:
Our Full Service Stable Value products represent fixed rate options on investment funds offered to customers. These products contain an obligation to pay interest at a specified rate for a specific period of time. Upon termination these products repay account balances at market value immediately or may be liquidated at book value over time. Substantially all of these products are either fully or partially participating, with annual or semi-annual resets giving effect to previous investment experience. These products are issued through the general account, separate accounts or client-owned trusts. Profits from partially participating general account products result from the spread between the rate of return on investment assets and the interest rates credited to the customer, less expenses. For fully participating products, generally subject to a minimum interest rate guarantee, we earn fee income.
15. General Account:
Invested assets and policyholder liabilities and reserves for which the Company bears the investment risk. Excludes assets recognized for statutory purposes that are specifically allocated to a separate account. General account assets also include assets of the parent company, Prudential Financial, Inc.

Scheduled premiums from new sales on an annualized basis and first year excess premiums and deposits on a cash-received basis.

Premiums from new sales that are expected to be collected over a one year period. Group insurance new annualized premiums exclude new premiums resulting from rate changes on existing policies, from additional coverage issued under our Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance contract, and from excess premiums on group universal life insurance that build cash value but do not purchase face amounts. Group insurance new annualized premiums include premiums from the takeover of claim liabilities. Single premium business for the Company's international insurance operations is included in annualized new business premiums based on 10% credit.
23. Non-recourse and Limited-recourse Debt:
Limited and non-recourse borrowing is where the holder is entitled to collect only against the assets pledged to the debt as collateral or has only very limited rights to collect against other assets.
24. Operating return on average equity (based on adjusted operating income):
Adjusted operating income after-tax (giving effect to the direct equity adjustment for earnings per share calculation), annualized for interim periods, divided by average attributed equity for the Financial Services Businesses excluding unrealized gains and losses on investments.
An alternative measure to operating return on average equity (based on adjusted operating income) is return on average equity (based on income from continuing operations). Return on average equity (based on income from continuing operations) represents income from continuing operations after-tax as determined in accordance with GAAP (giving effect to the direct equity adjustment for earnings per share calculation), annualized for interim periods, divided by average total attributed equity for the Financial Services Businesses.
