Item 2.03 Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.
In 2003, The Prudential Insurance Company of America ("Prudential Insurance"), a wholly owned domestic insurance subsidiary of the registrant, established a Funding Agreement Notes Issuance Program (the "Program") pursuant to which a Delaware statutory trust issues medium-term notes (which are included in the registrant's consolidated balance sheet) secured by funding agreements issued to the trust by Prudential Insurance and included in the registrant's Retirement segment. The funding agreements provide cash flow sufficient for the debt service on the medium-term notes. The medium-term notes are sold in transactions not requiring registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. On September 12, 2006, Prudential Insurance approved an expansion of the maximum authorized aggregate principal amount of medium-term notes at any one time outstanding under the Program from $6 billion to $15 billion (or the equivalent in other currencies, currency units or composite currencies). As of September 14, 2006, the aggregate principal amount of notes outstanding was $5.85 billion. The notes have fixed or floating interest rates and original maturities ranging from two to ten years.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
