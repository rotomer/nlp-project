Item 4.01 Changes in Registrant's Certifying Accountant.
Effective November 21, 2006, Mitchell & Titus, LLP ("Mitchell & Titus") resigned as the independent registered public accounting firm of The Prudential Employee Savings Plan (the "Plan"). The resignation of Mitchell & Titus was accepted by the Administrative Committee of the Plan on November 21, 2006. The Plan has not yet engaged a new independent registered public accounting firm.
Mitchell & Titus was engaged as the independent registered public accounting firm of the Plan in 2005 and, except for services rendered in connection with its audit of the financial statements of the Plan for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2005, has not rendered any services to the Plan.
The report of Mitchell & Titus on the Plan's financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2005 contained no adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion and was not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principle.
During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2005 and through November 21, 2006, there have been (1) no disagreements with Mitchell & Titus on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements if not resolved to the satisfaction of Mitchell & Titus would have caused them to make reference thereto in their reports on the financial statements for such years, and (2) no reportable events (as defined in Regulation S-K Item 304(a)(1)(v)).
The Plan has requested that Mitchell & Titus furnish it with a letter addressed to the SEC stating whether or not Mitchell & Titus agrees with the above statements. A copy of such letter dated November 21, 2006 from Mitchell & Titus is being filed as Exhibit 16.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
