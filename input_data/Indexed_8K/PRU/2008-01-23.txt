Prudential Financial, Inc. (the "Company") has announced that Vice Chairman, Mark B. Grier, who since April 2007 has had primary responsibility for the Company's international businesses and who as previously reported became a member of the Board of Directors of the Company effective January 1, 2008, is assuming broad new responsibilities with the Company. Mr. Grier's new responsibilities will include finance, risk management, investor relations, operations and systems, auditing, external affairs, global marketing and communications and certain global strategic initiatives. As previously announced, John R. Strangfeld, who became Chief Executive Officer and a member of the Board of Directors of the Company effective January 1, 2008, and Mr. Grier will together comprise the Office of the Chairman and will work closely to shape and drive the Company's strategic agenda.
(c)
On January 18, 2008, the Company elected Bernard B. Winograd as Executive Vice President with primary responsibility for the Company's U.S. businesses. Mr. Winograd will report to Mr. Strangfeld.
Mr. Winograd, age 57, was elected a Senior Vice President of the Company in March 2002. Since that time, he has served as President and Chief Executive Officer of Prudential Investment Management. Previously, he was Chief Executive Officer, Prudential Real Estate Investors. Mr. Winograd has been with Prudential since December 1996. Before joining Prudential, he was Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Taubman Centers, Inc., and prior to that was Treasurer of the Bendix Corporation.
On January 18, 2008, the Company also elected Edward P. Baird as Executive Vice President with primary responsibility for the Company's international businesses. Mr. Baird will also report to Mr. Strangfeld.
Mr. Baird, age 59, was elected a Senior Vice President of the Company in September 2002. He has served as President of Prudential's Group Insurance business since 2002. He has been with Prudential since 1979 serving in various management positions, including Chief Representative of Prudential Investment Management, Inc. in Japan; Corporate Vice President of Health Care Group; Corporate Vice President for Agencies, Individual Insurance; President of Pruco Life Insurance Co.; Chairman of Pruco Securities Inc.; and Department Vice President of Individual Insurance.
Additionally, the Company has announced that Richard J. Carbone, most recently Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, has been elected Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
Messrs. Grier, Carbone, Winograd and Baird participate or will participate in the executive officer compensation plans and arrangements described in the Company's 2007 proxy statement. See below for a description of certain compensation actions taken in connection with these appointments.
A copy of the Company's news release, dated January 23, 2008, announcing the appointments disclosed above is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein by reference.
On January 18, 2008, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Committee") approved the following actions:
(e)
 
John R. Strangfeld, Chief Executive Officer (from $600,000 to $1,000,000);
Mark B. Grier, Vice Chairman (from $600,000 to $850,000);
Richard J. Carbone, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (from $470,000 to $500,000);
Bernard B. Winograd, Executive Vice President (from $500,000 to $600,000); and
 
Edward P. Baird, Executive Vice President (from $350,000 to $450,000).
 
The Committee approved the grant to Mr. Carbone under the Company's Omnibus Incentive Plan of options to purchase 45,393 shares of the Company's Common Stock at $80.00 per share, representing the closing price of the Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on January 18, 2008. Two-thirds of these options will become exerciseable after two years from the date of grant and, except as provided in the Grant Acceptance Agreement relating to this grant, the remaining one-third will become exerciseable after three years from the date of grant. The form of Grant Acceptance Agreement relating to this grant is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.2 and incorporated herein by reference.
The number of stock options awarded to each individual named above was determined by dividing 40 percent of the total compensation value of the stock options and restricted stock units being awarded by the fair value of the Company's stock options based on the average closing price of the Company's Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange for the final 20-day trading period in December 2007, or $94.29. The fair value of the Company's stock options was developed under a binomial option pricing model, which is a complex mathematical formula.
 
The Committee approved the award to Mr. Carbone under the Company's Omnibus Incentive Plan of 15,909 restricted stock units. The restrictions on two-thirds of these units will lapse after two years from the date of award and, except as provided in the Grant Acceptance Agreement relating to this award, the restrictions on the remaining one-third of these units will lapse after three years from the date of award. The form of Grant Acceptance Agreement relating to this award is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.4 and incorporated herein by reference.
The number of restricted stock units awarded to each individual named above was determined by dividing 60 percent of the total compensation value of the stock options and restricted stock units being awarded by the average closing price of the Company's Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange for the final 20-day trading period in December 2007, or $94.29.

Except as specified otherwise, this Agreement is not a substitute for the official Plan document, which governs the operation of the Plan. Also, this is not a stock certificate or negotiable instrument.
The benefits provided by this Agreement and the Options will be determined pursuant to, and are governed by, the provisions of the Plan document and this Agreement, including any decisions of the committee designated under the Plan by Prudential Financial, Inc. ("Prudential") Board of Directors (the "Compensation Committee" or the "Committee"). Except as specifically stated otherwise in this Agreement, if there is any discrepancy between the information in this Agreement and the Plan document, or if there is a conflict between information discussed by anyone acting on behalf of Prudential and the actual Plan document, the Plan document, as interpreted by the Committee (or its delegate), in its sole discretion, will always govern.

Cash Exercise
 lets you exercise the Options, direct the immediate sale of the portion of Common Stock purchased necessary to pay the Grant Price, applicable taxes and fees, without paying cash out of your pocket, and receive the remaining shares of Common Stock.
Sell to Cover
One or more of these Exercise Methods outlined above may not be available to you (or may be unavailable during a specified period) should Prudential determine that its availability will or could violate the terms of any relevant law or regulation. You may not exercise the Options at a time when the market price of the Common Stock does not exceed the Grant Price.
 
Prudential or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company Group"), as applicable, shall have the right to deduct and report taxes (federal, state, local or foreign taxes, including social insurance taxes) or other obligations required to be withheld by law on Options from any Common Stock or cash payments or distributions made to you. Prudential (or, if appropriate, any other member of the Company Group) also shall have the right to require you to remit to Prudential (or, if appropriate, any other member of the Company Group) an amount necessary to satisfy any such taxes or other obligations. Prudential may defer issuance of Common Stock upon the exercise of any Options until such withholding is satisfied.
 
Once the Options vest, you will have until the Expiration Date to exercise the Options, unless your employment ends prior to the Expiration Date or the Options are otherwise settled in cash upon a Change of Control.
 
Prudential makes no representation as to the value of the Options or whether you will be able to realize any profit based on any award of Options to you.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Options and the obligation of Prudential to sell and deliver shares of Common Stock hereunder shall be subject in all respects to (a) all applicable federal, state, local and foreign laws, rules and regulations, and (b) any registration, qualification, approvals or other requirements imposed by any government or regulatory agency or body which the Committee shall, in its sole discretion, determine to be necessary or applicable. Moreover, the Options may not be exercised if their exercise, or the receipt of shares of Common Stock pursuant thereto, would be contrary to applicable law or the rules of any stock exchange.
 
If at the time of exercise of all or part of the Options, the Common Stock is not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), or there is no current prospectus in effect under the Securities Act with respect to the Common Stock, you shall, if requested by the Committee, execute, prior to the delivery of any shares of Common Stock to you by Prudential, an agreement (in such form as the Committee may specify) in which you represent and warrant that you are purchasing or acquiring the shares acquired under this Agreement for your own account, for investment only and not with a view to the resale or distribution thereof, and represent and agree that any subsequent offer for sale or distribution of any kind of such shares shall be made only pursuant to either (a) a registration statement on an appropriate form under the Securities Act, which registration statement has become effective and is current with regard to the shares being offered or sold, or (b) a specific exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, but in claiming such exemption you shall, prior to any offer for sale of such shares, obtain a prior favorable written opinion, in form and substance satisfactory to the Committee, from counsel for or approved by the Committee, as to the applicability of such exemption thereto.
 
You agree to retain ownership of 50% of the net shares (after payment of the applicable exercise price, if any, applicable fees and applicable taxes) of Common Stock acquired upon exercise of any of your Options. You also agree to hold all
 
Common Stock retained pursuant to the preceding sentence until the later of (i) one year following the date of acquisition of such Common Stock, or (ii) the date that you have satisfied the Share Ownership Guidelines set forth in a letter from Arthur Ryan dated April 4, 2002 (the "Guidelines"). Once you have satisfied the holding period set forth in the preceding sentence, you may dispose of any Common Stock held in excess of the Guidelines, subject only to the Personal Securities Trading Policy, including the "Reporting Responsibilities and Procedures for Section 16 Officers and Directors and Control Persons of Prudential." This agreement to retain Common Stock is applicable to this grant and for as long as you are an insider for the purpose of Section 16(a) of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
 
The validity, construction and effect of this Agreement and the Plan shall be determined in accordance with the laws of the State of New Jersey without regard to principles of conflict of laws.
 
The award of the Options does not entitle you to any benefit other than that granted under the Plan. Any benefits granted under the Plan are not deemed compensation under any Prudential pension plan, welfare plan or any compensation plan or program and shall not be considered as part of such compensation for purposes of calculating pension, bonuses, service awards, or in the event of severance, redundancy or resignation.
Prudential and other members of the Company Group will not be responsible if you do not exercise the Options.
You understand and accept that the benefits granted under the Plan are entirely at the sole discretion of Prudential, and that Prudential may modify, amend, suspend or terminate this Agreement, the Plan or any and all of the policies, programs and plans described in this Agreement in whole or in part, at any time, without notice to you or your consent. Further, this grant of Options does not give you the right to be granted any further options or other forms of compensation or benefits at any time in the future.
You understand that you do not have any rights as a stockholder by virtue of the grant of the Options but only with respect to shares of Common Stock, if any, actually issued to you in accordance with the terms hereof.
You understand and accept that if the Options are exercised at a time or in a manner not specifically authorized by the Plan, this Agreement, or Plan administrative rules (i.e., in "Error"), Prudential will be entitled to correct the Error, including reversing the transaction and recouping any Common Stock or gain that you might receive following the exercise.
 
Nothing contained in this Agreement is intended to constitute or create a contract of employment nor shall it constitute or create the right to remain associated with or in the employ of any member of the Company Group for any particular period of time. Employment with any member of the Company Group is employment at will, which means that either you or any member of the Company Group may terminate the employment relationship at any time, with or without cause or notice.
I accept the terms of this Agreement, and acknowledge that I understand this Agreement and the terms of the Plan.

Each Restricted Unit represents the right to receive one share of Common Stock in accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions and restrictions set forth in this Grant Acceptance Agreement (this "Agreement") and the Prudential Financial, Inc.

This Agreement is subject to the terms, conditions and restrictions contained in the Plan. Except as specified otherwise, this Agreement is not a substitute for the official Plan document, which governs the operation of the Plan. Also, this is not a stock certificate or negotiable instrument.
The benefits provided by this Agreement and the Restricted Units will be determined pursuant to, and are governed by, the provisions of the Plan document and this Agreement, including any decisions of the committee designated under the Plan by Prudential Financial, Inc. ("Prudential") Board of Directors (the "Compensation Committee" or the "Committee"). Except as specifically stated otherwise in this Agreement, if there is any discrepancy between the information in this Agreement and the Plan document, or if there is a conflict between information discussed by anyone acting on behalf of Prudential and the actual Plan document, the Plan document, as interpreted by the Committee (or its delegate), in its sole discretion, will always govern.
 
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Plan, the restricted period (the "Restricted Period") applicable to the Restricted Units will begin on the Grant Date and will end on the dates set forth below (each a "Payment Date") as to that percentage of the Restricted Units subject to this Agreement set forth opposite each such date:
 
 
Subject to the terms, conditions and restrictions of the Plan and this Agreement, if you are actively employed by Prudential or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company Group") as of a Payment Date, you will receive a number of shares of Common Stock corresponding to the vested percentage of Restricted Units on such Payment Date or as soon as administratively practicable (but not later than 90 days) thereafter, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or the Plan.
You, as a Participant, shall not have any right to vote on any matter submitted to Prudential's stockholders until such time as the Common Stock (if any) attributable to the Restricted Units has been issued to you. You shall be eligible to receive Dividend Equivalents on the Restricted Units based on any regular cash dividends declared on Common Stock from the Grant Date until the Payment Date (or until the date of forfeiture, if sooner). Any such Dividend Equivalents shall be paid in cash as soon as administratively practicable after such cash dividends are paid to Common Stock holders, unless determined otherwise by the Committee in its sole discretion. The Dividend Equivalents payable hereunder shall be treated as separate payments from the underlying Restricted Units for purposes of Section 409A of the Code.
 
Prudential (or, if appropriate, any other member of the Company Group) shall have the right to deduct and report taxes (federal, state, local or foreign taxes, including social insurance taxes) or other obligations required to be withheld by law prior to distributions made to you. Prudential (or, if appropriate, any other member of the Company Group) also shall have the right to require you to remit to Prudential (or, if appropriate, any other member of the Company Group) an amount necessary to satisfy any such taxes or other obligations. Upon vesting of the Restricted Units, Prudential (or, if appropriate, any other member of the Company Group) shall withhold, either through payroll, through the withholding of sufficient shares of Common Stock or otherwise, to satisfy any such tax withholding requirements as may be required by applicable law.
 
The validity, construction and effect of this Agreement and the Plan shall be determined in accordance with the laws of the State of New Jersey without regard to principles of conflict of laws.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
. Until the end of the last Restricted Period or, if later, the end of one year after the termination of your employment with any member of the Company Group for any reason, you shall not Induce Departures or hire or employ, or assist in the hire or employment of, either directly or indirectly, any individual (other than your administrative assistant) whose employment by the Company Group ended within sixty (60) days preceding that individual's hire or employment by you or your successor employer.
Non-solicitation
 
 
 
 
This award of Restricted Units and the obligation of Prudential to deliver shares of Common Stock hereunder shall be subject in all respects to (a) all applicable federal, state, local and foreign laws, rules and regulations, and (b) any registration, qualification, approvals or other requirements imposed by any government or regulatory agency or body which the Committee shall, in its sole discretion, determine to be necessary or applicable. Moreover, shares of Common Stock shall not be delivered hereunder if such delivery would be contrary to applicable law or the rules of any stock exchange.
 
If at the time of any delivery of shares of Common Stock hereunder, the Common Stock is not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), or there is no current prospectus in effect under the Securities Act with respect to the Common Stock, you shall, if requested by the Committee, execute, prior to the delivery of any shares of Common Stock to you by Prudential, an agreement (in such form as the Committee may specify) in which you represent and warrant that you are acquiring the shares acquired under this Agreement for your own account, for investment only and not with a view to the resale or distribution thereof, and represent and agree that any subsequent offer for sale or distribution of any kind of such shares shall be made only pursuant to either (a) a registration statement on an appropriate form under the Securities Act, which registration statement has become effective and is current with regard to the shares being offered or sold, or (b) a specific exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, but in claiming such exemption you shall, prior to any offer for sale of such shares, obtain a prior favorable written opinion, in form and substance satisfactory to the Committee, from counsel for or approved by the Committee, as to the applicability of such exemption thereto.
 
You agree to retain ownership of 50% of the net shares (after payment of applicable fees and taxes) of Common Stock acquired upon vesting of your Restricted Units. You also agree to hold all Common Stock retained pursuant to the preceding sentence until the later of (i) one year following the date of acquisition of such Common Stock, or (ii) the date that you have satisfied the Share Ownership Guidelines set forth in a letter from Arthur Ryan dated April 4, 2002 (the "Guidelines"). Once you have satisfied the holding period set forth in the preceding sentence, you may dispose of any Common Stock held in excess of the Guidelines, subject only to the Personal Securities Trading Policy, including the "Reporting Responsibilities and Procedures for Section 16 Officers and Directors and Control Persons of
 
Prudential." This agreement to retain Common Stock is applicable to this grant and for as long as you are an insider for purposes of Section 16(a) of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
 
This award of Restricted Units does not entitle you to any benefit other than the benefits granted under the Plan. Any benefits granted under the Plan are not deemed compensation under any Prudential pension plan, welfare plan or any compensation plan or program and shall not be considered as part of such compensation for purposes of calculating pension, bonuses, service awards, or in the event of severance, redundancy or resignation.
You understand and accept that the benefits granted under the Plan are entirely at the sole discretion of Prudential, and that Prudential may modify, amend suspend or terminate this Agreement, the Plan or any and all of the policies, programs and plans described in this Agreement in whole or in part, at any time, without notice to you or your consent. Further, this grant of Restricted Units does not give you the right to be granted any further Restricted Units or other forms of compensation or benefits at any time in the future.
Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan or this Agreement to the contrary, no acceleration of the time or schedule of any delivery of shares or other payment related to this award of Restricted Units shall be permitted to the extent necessary to comply with Code Section 409A. The Committee may amend, modify, adjust or supplement any provision of this Agreement without your consent if the Committee, in its sole discretion, determines that such amendment, modification, adjustment or supplementation is required or advisable for this award of Restricted Units or Prudential to comply with, or not violate, any applicable law, regulation or rule, including, without limitation, Code Section 409A.
You understand and accept that if you gain access to unrestricted Common Stock related to the Restricted Units, or you transfer Restricted Units or Common Stock at a time or in a manner not specifically authorized by the Plan, this Agreement, or Plan administrative rules (i.e., in "Error"), Prudential will be entitled to correct the Error, including reversing the transaction and recouping any Common Stock or gain that you might receive as a result of the Error.
Nothing contained in this Agreement is intended to constitute or create a contract of employment nor shall it constitute or create the right to remain associated with or in the employ of any member of the Company Group for any particular period of time. Employment with any member of the Company Group is employment at will, which means that either you or any member of the Company Group may terminate the employment relationship at any time, with or without cause or notice.
I accept the terms of this Agreement, and acknowledge that I understand this Agreement and the terms of the Plan.

Omnibus Incentive Plan (the "Plan") (capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the meanings given such terms in the Plan).
XXX
January 18, 2008
This Agreement is subject to the terms, conditions and restrictions contained in the Plan. Except as specified otherwise, this Agreement is not a substitute for the official Plan document, which governs the operation of the Plan. Also, this is not a stock certificate or negotiable instrument.
The benefits provided by this Agreement and the Restricted Units will be determined pursuant to, and are governed by, the provisions of the Plan document and this Agreement, including any decisions of the committee designated under the Plan by Prudential Financial, Inc. ("Prudential") Board of Directors (the "Compensation Committee" or the "Committee"). Except as specifically stated otherwise in this Agreement, if there is any discrepancy between the information in this Agreement and the Plan document, or if there is a conflict between information discussed by anyone acting on behalf of Prudential and the actual Plan document, the Plan document, as interpreted by the Committee (or its delegate), in its sole discretion, will always govern.
 
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Plan, the restricted period (the "Restricted Period") applicable to the Restricted Units will begin on the Grant Date and will end on the dates set forth below (each a "Payment Date") as to that percentage of the Restricted Units subject to this Agreement set forth opposite each such date:
 
 
Subject to the terms, conditions and restrictions of the Plan and this Agreement, if you are actively employed by Prudential or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company Group") as of a Payment Date, you will receive a number of shares of Common Stock corresponding to the vested percentage of Restricted Units on such Payment Date or as soon as administratively practicable (but not later than 90 days) thereafter, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or the Plan.
You, as a Participant, shall not have any right to vote on any matter submitted to Prudential's stockholders until such time as the Common Stock (if any) attributable to the Restricted Units has been issued to you. You shall be eligible to receive Dividend Equivalents on the Restricted Units based on any regular cash dividends declared on Common Stock from the Grant Date until the Payment Date (or until the date of forfeiture, if sooner). Any such Dividend Equivalents shall be paid in cash as soon as administratively practicable after such cash dividends are paid to Common Stock holders, unless determined otherwise by the Committee in its sole discretion. The Dividend Equivalents payable hereunder shall be treated as separate payments from the underlying Restricted Units for purposes of Section 409A of the Code.
 
Prudential (or, if appropriate, any other member of the Company Group) shall have the right to deduct and report taxes (federal, state, local or foreign taxes, including social insurance taxes) or other obligations required to be withheld by law prior to distributions made to you. Prudential (or, if appropriate, any other member of the Company Group) also shall have the right to require you to remit to Prudential (or, if appropriate, any other member of the Company Group) an amount necessary to satisfy any such taxes or other obligations. Upon vesting of the Restricted Units, Prudential (or, if appropriate, any other member of the Company Group) shall withhold, either through payroll, through the withholding of sufficient shares of Common Stock or otherwise, to satisfy any such tax withholding requirements as may be required by applicable law.
 
The validity, construction and effect of this Agreement and the Plan shall be determined in accordance with the laws of the State of New Jersey without regard to principles of conflict of laws.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
. Until the end of the last Restricted Period or, if later, the end of one year after the termination of your employment with any member of the Company Group for any reason, you shall not Induce Departures or hire or employ, or assist in the hire or employment of, either directly or indirectly, any individual (other than your administrative assistant) whose employment by the Company Group ended within sixty (60) days preceding that individual's hire or employment by you or your successor employer.
Non-solicitation
 
 
 
 
This award of Restricted Units and the obligation of Prudential to deliver shares of Common Stock hereunder shall be subject in all respects to (a) all applicable federal, state, local and foreign laws, rules and regulations, and (b) any registration, qualification, approvals or other requirements imposed by any government or regulatory agency or body which the Committee shall, in its sole discretion, determine to be necessary or applicable. Moreover, shares of Common Stock shall not be delivered hereunder if such delivery would be contrary to applicable law or the rules of any stock exchange.
 
If at the time of any delivery of shares of Common Stock hereunder, the Common Stock is not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), or there is no current prospectus in effect under the Securities Act with respect to the Common Stock, you shall, if requested by the Committee, execute, prior to the delivery of any shares of Common Stock to you by Prudential, an agreement (in such form as the Committee may specify) in which you represent and warrant that you are acquiring the shares acquired under this Agreement for your own account, for investment only and not with a view to the resale or distribution thereof, and represent and agree that any subsequent offer for sale or distribution of any kind of such shares shall be made only pursuant to either (a) a registration statement on an appropriate form under the Securities Act, which registration statement has become effective and is current with regard to the shares being offered or sold, or (b) a specific exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, but in claiming such exemption you shall, prior to any offer for sale of such shares, obtain a prior favorable written opinion, in form and substance satisfactory to the Committee, from counsel for or approved by the Committee, as to the applicability of such exemption thereto.
 
You agree to retain ownership of 50% of the net shares (after payment of applicable fees and taxes) of Common Stock acquired upon vesting of your Restricted Units. You also agree to hold all Common Stock retained pursuant to the preceding sentence until the later of (i) one year following the date of acquisition of such Common Stock, or (ii) the date that you have satisfied the Share Ownership Guidelines set forth in a letter from Arthur Ryan dated April 4, 2002 (the "Guidelines"). Once you have satisfied the holding period set forth in the
 
preceding sentence, you may dispose of any Common Stock held in excess of the Guidelines, subject only to the Personal Securities Trading Policy, including the "Reporting Responsibilities and Procedures for Section 16 Officers and Directors and Control Persons of Prudential." This agreement to retain Common Stock is applicable to this grant and for as long as you are an insider for purposes of Section 16(a) of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
 
This award of Restricted Units does not entitle you to any benefit other than the benefits granted under the Plan. Any benefits granted under the Plan are not deemed compensation under any Prudential pension plan, welfare plan or any compensation plan or program and shall not be considered as part of such compensation for purposes of calculating pension, bonuses, service awards, or in the event of severance, redundancy or resignation.
You understand and accept that the benefits granted under the Plan are entirely at the sole discretion of Prudential, and that Prudential may modify, amend suspend or terminate this Agreement, the Plan or any and all of the policies, programs and plans described in this Agreement in whole or in part, at any time, without notice to you or your consent. Further, this grant of Restricted Units does not give you the right to be granted any further Restricted Units or other forms of compensation or benefits at any time in the future.
Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan or this Agreement to the contrary, no acceleration of the time or schedule of any delivery of shares or other payment related to this award of Restricted Units shall be permitted to the extent necessary to comply with Code Section 409A. The Committee may amend, modify, adjust or supplement any provision of this Agreement without your consent if the Committee, in its sole discretion, determines that such amendment, modification, adjustment or supplementation is required or advisable for this award of Restricted Units or Prudential to comply with, or not violate, any applicable law, regulation or rule, including, without limitation, Code Section 409A.
You understand and accept that if you gain access to unrestricted Common Stock related to the Restricted Units, or you transfer Restricted Units or Common Stock at a time or in a manner not specifically authorized by the Plan, this Agreement, or Plan administrative rules (i.e., in "Error"), Prudential will be entitled to correct the Error, including reversing the transaction and recouping any Common Stock or gain that you might receive as a result of the Error.
Nothing contained in this Agreement is intended to constitute or create a contract of employment nor shall it constitute or create the right to remain associated with or in the employ of any member of the Company Group for any particular period of time. Employment with any member of the Company Group is employment at will, which means that either you or any member of the Company Group may terminate the employment relationship at any time, with or without cause or notice.

I accept the terms of this Agreement, and acknowledge that I understand this Agreement and the terms of the Plan
