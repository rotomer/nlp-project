In relation to each member state of the European Economic Area that has implemented the Prospectus Directive (each, a "relevant member state"), with effect from and including the date on which the Prospectus Directive is implemented in that relevant member state (the "relevant implementation date"), an offer of the Securities may not be made to the public in that relevant member state prior to the publication of a prospectus in relation to the Securities that has been approved by the competent authority in that relevant member state or, where appropriate, approved in another relevant member state and notified to the competent authority in that relevant member state, all in accordance with the Prospectus Directive, except that, with effect from and including the relevant implementation date, an offer of Securities may be offered to the public in that relevant member state at any time:
 
 
 
 
Each purchaser of the Securities located within a relevant member state will be deemed to have represented, acknowledged and agreed that it is a "qualified investor" within the meaning of Article 2(1)(e) of the Prospectus Directive.
 
For purposes of this provision, the expression an "offer to the public" in any relevant member state means the communication in any form and by any means of sufficient information on the terms of the offer and the Securities to be offered so as to enable an investor to decide to purchase or subscribe the securities, as the expression may be varied in that member state by any measure implementing the Prospectus Directive in that member state, and the expression "Prospectus Directive" means Directive 2003/71/EC and includes any relevant implementing measure in each relevant member state.
The Company has not authorized and does not authorize the making of any offer of the Securities through any financial intermediary on their behalf, other than offers made by the Underwriters with a view to the final placement of the Securities as contemplated in this Agreement. Accordingly, no purchaser of the Securities, other than the Underwriters, is authorized to make any further offer of the Securities on behalf of the Company or the Underwriters.
United Kingdom
The Prospectus is only being distributed to, and is only directed at, persons in the United Kingdom that are qualified investors within the meaning of Article 2(1)(e) of the Prospectus Directive that are also (i) investment professionals falling within Article 19(5) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion) Order 2005 (as amended) (the "Order") or (ii) high net worth entities, and other persons to whom it may lawfully be communicated, falling within Article 49(2)(a) to (d) of the Order (all such persons together being referred to as "relevant persons"). The Prospectus and its contents are confidential and should not be distributed, published or reproduced (in whole or in part) or disclosed by recipients to any other persons in the United Kingdom. Any person in the United Kingdom that is not a relevant person should not act or rely on the Prospectus or any of its contents. Any investment activity to which the Prospectus relates is available in the United Kingdom only to relevant persons, and will be engaged in only with such persons.
France
Neither the Prospectus nor any other offering material relating to the Securities described in the Prospectus has been submitted to the clearance procedures of the or of the competent authority of another member state of the European Economic Area and notified to the . The Securities have not been offered or sold and will not be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, to the public in France.

Such offers, sales and distributions will be made in France only:
 
 
The Securities may only be resold directly or indirectly to the public in compliance with Articles L.411-1, L.411-2, L.412-1 and L.621-8 through L.621-8-3 of the French .
Code montaire et financier
Italy
The offering of the Securities has not been cleared by the Italian Securities Exchange Commission (, or the "CONSOB") and, accordingly, the Securities may not and will not be offered, sold or delivered, nor may or will copies of the Prospectus or any other documents relating to the Securities, be distributed in Italy, other than to qualified investors (), as defined (i) in Article 2, paragraph (e)(i) to (iii) of the Prospectus Directive (with the exception of (a) management companies () authorized to manage individual portfolios on behalf of third parties and (b) fiduciary companies () authorized to manage individual portfolios pursuant to Article 60(4) of the Legislative Decree No. 415 of July 23, 1996, as amended) or (ii) pursuant to another exemption from the requirements of Articles 94 et seq. of Legislative Decree No. 58 of February 24, 1998, as amended (the "Italian Finance Law") and CONSOB Regulation No. 11971 of May 14, 1999 ("Regulation No. 11971").

Any offer, sale or delivery of the Securities or distribution of copies of the Prospectus, or any other document relating to the Securities, in Italy may and will be effected in accordance with all Italian securities, tax, exchange control and other applicable laws and regulations, and, in particular, will be:
 
 
 
 
The Prospectus and the information contained therein are intended only for the use of its recipient and are not to be distributed to any third-party resident or located in Italy for any reason. No person resident or located in Italy other than the original recipients of the Prospectus may rely on it or its contents.
Article 100-bis of the Italian Finance Law affects the transferability of the Securities in the Republic of Italy to the extent that any placing of the Securities is made solely with qualified investors and such Securities are then systematically resold to non-qualified investors on the secondary market at any time in the 12 months following such placing. Where this occurs, if a prospectus compliant with the Prospectus Directive has not been published, purchasers of Securities who are acting outside of the course of their business or profession may in certain circumstances be entitled to declare such purchase void and to claim damages from any authorized person at whose premises the Securities were purchased, unless an exemption provided for under the Italian Finance Law applies.
In addition to the above (which shall continue to apply to the extent not inconsistent with the implementing measures of the Prospectus Directive in Italy), after the implementation of the Prospectus Directive in Italy, the restrictions, warranties and representations set out under the heading "European Economic Area" above shall apply to Italy.

Indemnification and Contribution

Indemnification of the Underwriters.
(b) Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company to the same extent as the indemnity
Indemnification of the Company.
 
set forth in paragraph (a) above, but only with respect to any losses, claims, damages or liabilities that arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with any information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use in the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any Time of Sale Information, it being understood and agreed that the only such information consists of the following: (i) the initial public offering price, (ii) the names of the Underwriters on the cover pages of the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus and (iii) under the heading "Underwriting" in the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus, (A) the list of Underwriters, (B) the fourth paragraph related to concessions and reallowances and (C) the seventh and eighth paragraphs related to stabilization and syndicate covering transactions.
(c) Promptly after receipt of notice of the commencement of any action by any person in respect of which indemnification may be sought pursuant to paragraph (a) or (b) above, such person (the "Indemnified Person"), shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the person against whom such indemnification may be sought under such paragraph (the "Indemnifying Person"), notify the Indemnifying Person in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any Indemnified Person otherwise than under such paragraph. In case any such action shall be brought against any Indemnified Person and it shall notify the Indemnifying Person of the commencement thereof, the Indemnifying Person shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other Indemnifying Person similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such Indemnified Person (who shall not, except with the consent of the Indemnified Person, be counsel to the Indemnifying Person) and, after notice from the Indemnifying Person to such Indemnified Person of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the Indemnifying Person shall not be liable to such Indemnified Person under such paragraph for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Person, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. No Indemnifying Person shall, without the written consent of the Indemnified Person, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the Indemnified Person is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the Indemnified Person (or such other release of the Indemnified Person as shall be satisfactory to the Indemnified Person) from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any Indemnified Person.
Notice and Procedures.
(d) If the indemnification provided for in paragraphs (a) and (b) above is unavailable to an Indemnified Person or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each Indemnifying Person under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Person thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such
Contribution.
 
Indemnified Person as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law or if the Indemnified Person failed to give the notice required under paragraph (c) above, then each Indemnifying Person shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds (before deducting expenses) received by the Company from the sale of the Securities and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters in connection therewith, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate offering price of the Securities. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
(e) The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in paragraph (d) above. The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Person as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in paragraph (d) above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, in no event shall an Underwriter be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriter with respect to the offering of the Securities exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to their respective purchase obligations hereunder and not joint.
Limitation on Liability.
pro
rata
(f) The obligations of the Company under this Section 7 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to affiliates of the Underwriters and to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 7 shall be in addition to any liability
 
which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company (including any person who, with his or her consent, is named in the Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus as about to become a director of the Company) and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act.
8. . This Agreement shall become effective upon the execution and delivery hereof by the parties hereto.
Effectiveness of Agreement
9. . This Agreement may be terminated by the Representatives, by notice to the Company, if after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date (i) since the date as of which information is given in the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus, any Material Adverse Change or any development involving a prospective Material Adverse Change, whether or not arising in the ordinary course of business; (ii) suspension of trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq National Market or limitation on prices (other than limitations on hours or numbers of days of trading) for securities on any such exchange or market; (iii) the suspension of trading of the Company's securities by the New York Stock Exchange, the Commission, or any other governmental authority; (iv) the enactment, publication, decree or other promulgation of any statute, regulation, rule or order of any court or other governmental authority which in the opinion of the Representatives materially and adversely affects or may materially and adversely affect the business or operations of the Company; (v) the declaration of a banking moratorium by United States, New York State or New Jersey State authorities or a material disruption in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States or other relevant jurisdiction; (vi) the taking of any action by any governmental body or agency in respect of its monetary or fiscal affairs which in the reasonable opinion of the Representatives has a material adverse effect on the securities markets in the United States, or (vii) any outbreak or escalation of hostilities or declaration of war or national emergency or other national or international calamity or crisis or change in economic or political conditions if the effect of such outbreak, escalation, declaration, emergency, calamity, crisis or change on the financial markets of the United States would, in the sole judgment of the Representatives, make it impracticable or inadvisable to market the Securities or to enforce contracts for the sale of the Securities.
Termination
10. . (a) If, on the Closing Date, any Underwriter defaults on its obligation to purchase the Securities that it has agreed to purchase hereunder (the "Defaulted Securities"), the non-defaulting Underwriters may in their discretion arrange for the purchase of the Defaulted Securities by one or more of the non-defaulting Underwriters or any other persons satisfactory to the Company on the terms contained in this Agreement. If, within 36 hours after any such default by any Underwriter, the non-defaulting Underwriters do not arrange for the purchase of the Defaulted Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of 36 hours within which to procure other persons satisfactory to the non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase the Defaulted Securities on such terms. If other persons become obligated or agree to purchase the Defaulted Securities of a defaulting Underwriter, either the non-defaulting Underwriters or the Company may postpone the Closing Date for up to five full business days in order to effect any changes that in the opinion of counsel for the Company or counsel for the Underwriters may be necessary in the
Defaulting Underwriter
 
Registration Statement and the Prospectus or in any other document or arrangement, and the Company agrees to promptly prepare any amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus that effects any such changes. As used in this Agreement, the term "Underwriter" includes, for all purposes of this Agreement unless the context otherwise requires, any person not listed in Schedule 1 hereto that, pursuant to this Section 10, purchases Defaulted Securities that a defaulting Underwriter agreed but failed to purchase.
(b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Defaulted Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the non-defaulting Underwriters and the Company as provided in paragraph (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of the Defaulted Securities that remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of the Defaulted Securities that such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder plus such Underwriter's share (based on the principal amount of Securities that such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder) of the Defaulted Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made.
pro
rata
(c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Defaulted Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the non-defaulting Underwriters and the Company as provided in paragraph (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Defaulted Securities that remains unpurchased exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in paragraph (b) above, then this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of the non-defaulting Underwriters. Any termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10 shall be without liability on the part of the Company, except that the Company will continue to be liable for the payment of expenses as set forth in Section 11 hereof and except that the provisions of Section 7 hereof shall not terminate and shall remain in effect.
(d) Nothing contained herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter of any liability it may have to the Company or any non-defaulting Underwriter for damages caused by its default.
11. . (a) Whether or not the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated or this Agreement is terminated, the Company will pay or cause to be paid all costs and expenses incident to the performance of its obligations hereunder, including without limitation, (i) the costs incident to the authorization, issuance, sale, preparation and delivery of the Securities and any taxes payable in that connection; (ii) the costs incident to the preparation, printing, reproduction, delivery to or at the direction of the Representatives and filing under the Securities Act of the Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, any Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus (including all exhibits, amendments and supplements thereto); (iii) the costs of reproducing and distributing each of this Agreement, the Securities, the Indenture and the Replacement Capital Covenant; (iv) the fees and expenses of the Company's counsel and independent accountants; (v) the fees and expenses incurred in connection with the qualification of the Securities under the laws of such jurisdictions as the Representatives may designate
Payment of Expenses
 
(including the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel for the Underwriters); (vi) any fees charged by rating agencies for rating the Securities; (vii) the fees and expenses of the Trustee and any paying agent (including related fees and expenses of any counsel to such parties); and (viii) if required, all expenses and application fees incurred in connection with any filing with, and clearance of the offering by, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.
(b) If (i) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 9, (ii) the Company for any reason fails to tender the Securities for delivery to the Underwriters or (iii) the Underwriters decline to purchase the Securities for any reason permitted under this Agreement, the Company agrees to reimburse the Underwriters for all out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including the fees and expenses of their counsel) reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in connection with this Agreement and the offering contemplated hereby.
12. . This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective successors and the Indemnified Persons referred to in Section 7 hereof. Nothing in this Agreement is intended or shall be construed to give any other person any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this Agreement or any provision contained herein. No purchaser of Securities from any Underwriter shall be deemed to be a successor merely by reason of such purchase.
Persons Entitled to Benefit of Agreement
13. . The respective indemnities, rights of contribution, representations, warranties and agreements of the Company and the Underwriters contained in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of the Company or the Underwriters pursuant to this Agreement or any certificate delivered pursuant hereto shall survive the delivery of and payment for the Securities and shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any termination of this Agreement or any investigation made by or on behalf of the Company or the Underwriters.

For purposes of this Agreement, (a) except where otherwise expressly provided, the term "affiliate" has the meaning set forth in Rule 405 under the Securities Act; (b) the term "business day" means any day other than a day on which banks are permitted or required to be closed in New York City; and (c) the term "subsidiary" has the meaning set forth in Rule 405 under the Securities Act.

In rendering such opinion, such counsel may state that such counsel expresses no opinion as to the laws of any jurisdiction other than the federal laws of the United States, the laws of the State of New York and the laws of the State of New Jersey and that such counsel is expressing no opinion as to the effect of the laws of any other jurisdiction; that, as to certain factual matters, such counsel has relied upon certificates of officers of the Company and its subsidiaries and certificates of public officials and other sources believed by such counsel to be responsible; and that such counsel has assumed that the Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Trustee, that the Securities conform to the form thereof examined by such counsel, and that the signatures on all documents examined by such counsel (or members of the Company's legal department) are genuine (assumptions that such counsel has not independently verified). In addition, such counsel may state that such counsel has examined or caused to be examined under such counsel's direction certificates of public officials, and copies, certified or otherwise identified to such counsel's satisfaction, of such corporate documents and records of the Company, and of such other records, certificates, documents and other instruments, as such counsel has deemed relevant and necessary or appropriate as a basis for such opinion. Such counsel may also state that such counsel has consulted with certain attorneys in the Company's Law Department and has relied, to the extent such counsel deemed such reliance proper, upon certificates of officers of the Company with respect to the accuracy of material factual matters that were not independently established.
Such counsel also may state that to the extent any of the opinions in this Annex A involve the law of Japan, such counsel has relied with your permission on the opinion of the opinion of the Chief Legal Officer of each of The Gibraltar Life Insurance Company, Ltd. and The Prudential Life Insurance Company, Ltd., addressed to the Representatives.
In addition, such counsel shall confirm that, on the basis of such counsel's own knowledge and knowledge such counsel has gained from attorneys in the Company's law department, with whom such counsel has consulted for the purpose of preparing the Company's disclosure documents incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, considered in the light of such counsel's understanding of the applicable law and experience such counsel has gained through such counsel's practice in this field, (i) the Registration Statement, as of its most recent effective date determined pursuant to Rule 430B(f)(2) under the Securities Act, and the Prospectus, as of the date thereof and as of the Closing Date, appeared or appear on their face to be appropriately responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the Securities Act and the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder and (ii) nothing has come to such counsel's attention that has caused such counsel to believe that (x) the Registration Statement, as of its most recent effective date determined pursuant to Rule 430B(f)(2) under the Securities Act, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the

Registration, Registration of Transfer and Exchange
(a) The Company shall cause to be kept at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee a register (the register maintained in such office being herein sometimes referred to as the "Security Register") in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Company shall provide for the registration of Securities and of transfers of Securities. The Trustee is hereby appointed "Security Registrar" for the purpose of registering Securities and transfers of Securities as herein provided.
(b) Upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Security of any series at the office or agency in a Place of Payment for that series, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in the name of the designated transferee or transferees, one or more new Securities of the same series, of any authorized denominations and of a like aggregate principal amount and tenor.
(c) At the option of the Holder, Securities of any series may be exchanged for other Securities of the same series of any authorized denominations and of a like aggregate principal amount and tenor, upon surrender of the Securities to be exchanged at such office or agency. Whenever any Securities are so surrendered for exchange, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the Securities which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive.
 
(d) All Securities issued upon any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities shall be the valid obligations of the Company, evidencing the same debt, and entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture, as the Securities surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange.
(e) Every Security presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or for exchange shall (if so required by the Company or the Trustee) be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar duly executed, by the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing.
(f) No service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, other than exchanges pursuant to Section 304, 906 or 1207 not involving any transfer.
(g) If the Securities of any series (or of any series and specified tenor) are to be redeemed in part, the Company shall not be required (i) to issue, register the transfer of or exchange Securities of any series during a period beginning at the opening of business 15 days before the day of the mailing of a notice of redemption of Securities of that series selected for redemption under Section 1203 and ending at the close of business on the day of such mailing, or (ii) to register the transfer of or exchange any Security so selected for redemption in whole or in part, except the unredeemed portion of any Security being redeemed in part.
(h) Each Global Security authenticated under this Indenture shall be registered in the name of the Depositary designated for such Global Security or a nominee thereof and delivered to such Depositary or a custodian therefor, and each such Global Security shall constitute a single Security for all purposes of this Indenture.

Upon the occurrence in respect of any Global Security of any series of any one or more of the conditions specified in clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) of the preceding sentence or such other conditions as may be specified as contemplated by Section 301 for such series, such Global Security may be registered for transfer or exchange for Securities registered in the names of, or authenticated and delivered to, such Persons as the Depositary with respect to such series shall direct.
 
(i) Except as provided in the preceding paragraph, any Security authenticated and delivered upon registration of transfer of, or in exchange for, or in lieu of, any Global Security or any portion thereof, whether pursuant to this Section, Section 304, 306, 906 or 1207 or otherwise, shall also be a Global Security and bear the legend specified in Section 204. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture, a Global Security may not be transferred except as a whole by the Depositary for such Global Security to a nominee of such Depositary or to another Depositary or a nominee thereof or by a nominee of such Depositary to such Depositary or another nominee of such Depositary or to another Depositary or a nominee thereof.
Section 306. .
Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen Securities

(b) If there shall be delivered to the Company and the Trustee (i) evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Security and (ii) such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them and any agent of either of them harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the Company or the Trustee that such Security has been acquired by a protected purchaser, the Company shall execute and upon its request the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in lieu of any such destroyed, lost or stolen Security, a new Security of the same series and of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.
(c) In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security has become or is about to become due and payable, the Company in its discretion may, instead of issuing a new Security, pay such Security upon compliance with the foregoing conditions.
(d) Upon the issuance of any new Security under this Section, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected therewith.
(e) Every new Security of any series issued pursuant to this Section in lieu of any destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall constitute an original additional contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Securities of that series duly issued hereunder.
 
(f) The provisions of this Section are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities.

(b) Any interest on any Security of any series which is payable, but is not punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date (herein called "Defaulted Interest") shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on the relevant Regular Record Date by virtue of having been such Holder, and such Defaulted Interest may be paid by the Company, at its election in each case, as provided in Clause (1) or (2) below:

The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of Defaulted Interest proposed to be paid on each Security of such series and the date of the proposed payment, and at the same time the Company shall deposit with the Trustee an amount of money equal to the aggregate amount proposed to be paid in respect of such Defaulted Interest or shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for such deposit prior to the date of the proposed payment, such money when deposited to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such Defaulted Interest as in this Clause provided. Thereupon the Trustee shall fix a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest which shall be not more than 15 days and not less than 10 days prior to the date of the proposed payment and not less than 10 days after the receipt by the Trustee of the notice of the proposed payment. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company of such Special Record Date and, in the name and at the expense of the Company, shall cause notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor to be mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to each Holder of Securities of such series at such Holder's address as it appears in the Security Register, not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date. Notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor having been so mailed, such Defaulted Interest shall be paid to the Persons in whose names the Securities of such series (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on such Special Record Date and shall no longer be payable pursuant to the following Clause (2).
 
(2) The Company may make payment of any Defaulted Interest on the Securities of any series in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which such Securities may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, if, after notice given by the Company to the Trustee of the proposed payment pursuant to this Clause, such manner of payment shall be deemed practicable by the Trustee.
(c) Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section, each Security delivered under this Indenture upon registration of transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of any other Security shall carry the rights to interest accrued and unpaid, and to accrue, which were carried by such other Security.

(c) None of the Company, the Trustee or any agent of the Company or the Trustee shall have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in a Global Security or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interests.

In the event that the Company was unable, although no Market Disruption Event occurred, after Commercially Reasonable Efforts to raise sufficient net proceeds during the 180-day or 90-day period, as the case may be, to permit repayment of the Notes in full on such Repayment Date, the Company shall deliver an Officers' Certificate that certifies the same to the Trustee (who shall forward such certificate to each Holder of the Notes) on the Cut-off Date.

If the Company raises less than $5,000,000 of net proceeds from the sale of Qualifying Capital Securities during the relevant 180-day or 90-day period, the Company will not be required to repay any Notes on the Scheduled Maturity Date or the next Repayment Date, as applicable. On the next Repayment Date as of which the Company has raised at least $5,000,000 of net proceeds during the 180-day period (or, if shorter, the period beginning on the date on which the Company last repaid any principal amount of Notes) ending on the Cut-off Date, the Company shall be required to repay a principal amount of the Notes equal to the entire net proceeds from the sale of Qualifying Capital Securities during such 180-day or shorter period on such Repayment Date.

No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on this Security at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.

(c) For purposes of Sections 4(a) and 4(b), the Holders whose consent or agreement is required to terminate, amend or supplement the obligations of the Corporation under this Replacement Capital Covenant shall be the Holders of the then-effective Covered Debt as of a record date established by the Corporation that is not more than 30 days prior to the date on which the Corporation proposes that such termination, amendment or supplement becomes effective.
