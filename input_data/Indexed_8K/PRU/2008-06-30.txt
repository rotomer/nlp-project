Ladies and Gentlemen:
Prudential Financial, Inc., a New Jersey corporation (the "Company"), proposes to issue and sell to the several Underwriters listed in Schedule 1 hereto (the "Underwriters"), for whom Citigroup Global Markets Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, UBS Securities LLC and Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC are acting as representatives (the "Representatives"), $800,000,000 principal amount of its 9.0% Junior Subordinated Notes due 2068 (the "Underwritten Securities"), and, at the option of the Representatives acting on behalf of the Underwriters, up to an additional $120,000,000 aggregate principal amount of such 9.0% Junior Subordinated Notes due 2068 (the "Option Securities"), solely to cover over-allotments. The Underwritten Securities and the Option Securities are herein referred to collectively as the "Securities." The Securities will be issued pursuant to an Indenture dated as of June 17, 2008 (the "Base Indenture") between the Company and The Bank of New York, as trustee (the "Trustee"), as supplemented by a second supplemental indenture, to be dated as of June 30, 2008 (the "Supplemental Indenture" and, together with the Base Indenture, the "Indenture").
The Company hereby confirms its agreement with the several Underwriters concerning the purchase and sale of the Securities, as follows:
1. . The Company has prepared and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") an automatic shelf registration statement, as defined under Rule 405 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder (collectively, the "Securities Act"), on Form S-3 (File Nos. 333-132469, 333-132469-01 and 333-132469-02), including a prospectus (the "Base Prospectus"), relating to securities, including the Securities, to be issued from time to time by the Company. Such registration statement, as amended as of its most recent effective date, is referred to herein as the "Registration Statement"; and as used herein, the term "Preliminary Prospectus" means any preliminary prospectus supplement specifically relating to the Securities filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act, together with the Base Prospectus, and the term "Prospectus" means the prospectus supplement specifically relating to the Securities, together with the Base Prospectus, in the form first used (or made available upon request of purchasers pursuant to Rule 173 under the Securities Act) in connection with confirmation of sales of the Securities. Any reference in this Agreement to the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 under the Securities Act, as of the most recent effective date of the Registration Statement or the date of such Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus, as the case may be and any reference to "amend", "amendment" or "supplement" with respect to the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and
Registration Statement
 
include any documents filed after such date under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder (collectively, the "Exchange Act") that are deemed to be incorporated by reference therein. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings given to such terms in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus.
At or prior to the time when sales of the Securities were first made at 4:45 P.M. (Eastern time) on June 24, 2008 (the "Time of Sale"), the Company had prepared the following information (collectively, the "Time of Sale Information"): a Preliminary Prospectus dated June 23, 2008 (including the Base Prospectus), and each "free-writing prospectus" (as defined pursuant to Rule 405 under the Securities Act) listed on Annex B hereto as constituting part of the Time of Sale Information. The final term sheet relating to the Securities in substantially the form of Annex C hereto is referred to herein as the "Final Term Sheet."
2. . (a) The Company agrees to issue and sell the Underwritten Securities to the several Underwriters as provided in this Agreement, and each Underwriter, on the basis of the representations, warranties and agreements set forth herein and subject to the conditions set forth herein, agrees, severally and not jointly, to purchase from the Company the respective principal amount of Underwritten Securities set forth opposite such Underwriter's name in Schedule 1 hereto at a price equal to (i) 98.00% of the principal amount thereof (the "Institutional Purchase Price"), in the case of sales made by the Underwriters to certain institutional purchasers (the "Institutional Purchasers") and (ii) 96.85% of the principal amount thereof (the "Retail Purchase Price"), in the case of sales made by the Underwriters in all other cases, plus, in each case, accrued interest, if any, from June 24, 2008 to the Initial Closing Date (as defined below). The Representatives confirm to the Company that for this purpose, the number of Underwritten Securities sold to Institutional Purchasers is 657,380.
Purchase of the Securities by the Underwriters
Subject to the terms and conditions and in reliance upon the representations and warranties herein set forth, the Company hereby grants a one-time option to the several Underwriters to purchase, severally and not jointly, the Option Securities at the Retail Purchase Price or Institutional Purchase Price, as applicable. Upon the exercise of such option, the Underwriters agree to purchase the Option Securities in accordance the terms set forth herein. Said option may be exercised solely to cover over-allotments in the sale of the Underwritten Securities by the Underwriters. Said option may be exercised in whole or in part at any time on or before the 30th day after the date of the Prospectus upon written notice by the Representatives to the Company setting forth the aggregate principal amount of Option Securities as to which the several Underwriters are exercising the option and the settlement date, which may be the same date as the Closing Date (as defined below) but shall not be (i) earlier than the Closing Date nor (ii) earlier than the third business day after the date of such notice, except as the Company and the Representatives may otherwise agree. The principal amount of Option Securities to be purchased by each Underwriter shall be the same percentage of the aggregate principal amount of Option Securities to be purchased by the several Underwriters as such Underwriter is purchasing of the Underwritten Securities, subject to such adjustments as the Representatives in their absolute discretion shall make to eliminate any fractional shares.
 
The Company will not be obligated to deliver any of the Securities except upon payment for all the Securities to be purchased as provided herein.
(b) The Company understands that the Underwriters intend to make a public offering of the Securities as soon after the effectiveness of this Agreement as in the judgment of the Representatives is advisable, and initially to offer the Securities on the terms set forth in the Prospectus. The Company acknowledges and agrees that the Underwriters may offer and sell Securities to or through any affiliate of an Underwriter and that any such affiliate may offer and sell Securities purchased by it to or through any Underwriter.
(c) Payment for and delivery of the Underwritten Securities will be made at 10:00 A.M., New York City time, on June 30, 2008, or at such other time on the same or such other date, not later than the fifth business day thereafter, as the Representatives and the Company may agree upon in writing and payment for and delivery of the Option Securities will be made at 10:00 A.M., New York City time, on the date specified by the Representatives in the written notice of the Underwriters' election to purchase such Option Securities, or at such other time on the same or such other date, not later than the fifth business day thereafter, as the Representatives and the Company may agree upon in writing. The time and date of such payment and delivery for the Underwritten Securities is referred to herein as the "Initial Closing Date," and the time and date for such payment for the Option Securities, if other than the Closing Date, is herein referred to as the "Additional Closing Date." The Initial Closing Date and the Additional Closing Date are herein referred to collectively as the "Closing Dates" and individually as a "Closing Date."
(d) Payment for the Securities to be purchased on any Closing Date shall be made by wire transfer in immediately available funds to the account(s) specified by the Company to the Representatives against delivery to the nominee of The Depository Trust Company, for the account of the Underwriters, of one or more global notes representing the Securities (collectively, the "Global Note"), with any transfer taxes payable in connection with the sale of the Securities duly paid by the Company. The Global Note will be made available for inspection by the Representatives not later than 1:00 P.M., New York City time, on the business day prior to the applicable Closing Date.
(e) The Company acknowledges and agrees that the Underwriters are acting solely in the capacity of an arm's length contractual counterparty to the Company with respect to the offering of Securities contemplated hereby (including in connection with determining the terms of the offering) and not as a financial advisor or a fiduciary to, or an agent of, the Company or any other person. Additionally, neither the Representatives nor any other Underwriter is advising the Company or any other person as to any legal, tax, investment, accounting or regulatory matters in any jurisdiction. The Company shall consult with its own advisors concerning such matters and shall be responsible for making its own independent investigation and appraisal of the transactions contemplated hereby, and the Underwriters shall have no responsibility or liability to the Company with respect thereto. Any review by the Underwriters of the Company, the transactions contemplated hereby or other matters relating to such transactions will be performed solely for the benefit of the Underwriters and shall not be on behalf of the Company.

Where this occurs, if a prospectus compliant with the Prospectus Directive has not been published, purchasers of Securities who are acting outside of the course of their business or profession may in certain circumstances be entitled to declare such purchase void and to claim damages from any authorized person at whose premises the Securities were purchased, unless an exemption provided for under the Italian Finance Law applies.

Indemnification of the Underwriters.
 
(b) Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company to the same extent as the indemnity set forth in paragraph (a) above, but only with respect to any losses, claims, damages or liabilities that arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with any information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use in the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any Time of Sale Information, it being understood and agreed that the only such information consists of the following: (i) the initial public offering price, (ii) the names of the Underwriters on the cover pages of the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus and (iii) under the heading "Underwriting" in the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus, (A) the list of Underwriters, (B) the fourth paragraph related to concessions and reallowances and (C) the seventh and eighth paragraphs related to stabilization and syndicate covering transactions.
Indemnification of the Company.
(c) Promptly after receipt of notice of the commencement of any action by any person in respect of which indemnification may be sought pursuant to paragraph (a) or (b) above, such person (the "Indemnified Person"), shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the person against whom such indemnification may be sought under such paragraph (the "Indemnifying Person"), notify the Indemnifying Person in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any Indemnified Person otherwise than under such paragraph. In case any such action shall be brought against any Indemnified Person and it shall notify the Indemnifying Person of the commencement thereof, the Indemnifying Person shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other Indemnifying Person similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such Indemnified Person (who shall not, except with the consent of the Indemnified Person, be counsel to the Indemnifying Person) and, after notice from the Indemnifying Person to such Indemnified Person of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the Indemnifying Person shall not be liable to such Indemnified Person under such paragraph for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Person, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. No Indemnifying Person shall, without the written consent of the Indemnified Person, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the Indemnified Person is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the Indemnified Person (or such other release of the Indemnified Person as shall be satisfactory to the Indemnified Person) from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any Indemnified Person.
Notice and Procedures.
(d) If the indemnification provided for in paragraphs (a) and (b) above is unavailable to an Indemnified Person or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each Indemnifying Person under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such
Contribution.
 
Indemnified Person thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law or if the Indemnified Person failed to give the notice required under paragraph (c) above, then each Indemnifying Person shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds (before deducting expenses) received by the Company from the sale of the Securities and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters in connection therewith, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate offering price of the Securities. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
(e) The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in paragraph (d) above. The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Person as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in paragraph (d) above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, in no event shall an Underwriter be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriter with respect to the offering of the Securities exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to their respective purchase obligations hereunder and not joint.
Limitation on Liability.
pro
rata
(f) The obligations of the Company under this Section 7 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to affiliates of the Underwriters and to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 7 shall be in addition to any liability
 
which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company (including any person who, with his or her consent, is named in the Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus as about to become a director of the Company) and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act.

Effectiveness of Agreement
9. . This Agreement may be terminated by the Representatives, by notice to the Company, if after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the Initial Closing Date (i) since the date as of which information is given in the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus, any Material Adverse Change or any development involving a prospective Material Adverse Change, whether or not arising in the ordinary course of business; (ii) suspension of trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq National Market or limitation on prices (other than limitations on hours or numbers of days of trading) for securities on any such exchange or market; (iii) the suspension of trading of the Company's securities by the New York Stock Exchange, the Commission, or any other governmental authority; (iv) the enactment, publication, decree or other promulgation of any statute, regulation, rule or order of any court or other governmental authority which in the opinion of the Representatives materially and adversely affects or may materially and adversely affect the business or operations of the Company; (v) the declaration of a banking moratorium by United States, New York State or New Jersey State authorities or a material disruption in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States or other relevant jurisdiction; (vi) the taking of any action by any governmental body or agency in respect of its monetary or fiscal affairs which in the reasonable opinion of the Representatives has a material adverse effect on the securities markets in the United States, or (vii) any outbreak or escalation of hostilities or declaration of war or national emergency or other national or international calamity or crisis or change in economic or political conditions if the effect of such outbreak, escalation, declaration, emergency, calamity, crisis or change on the financial markets of the United States would, in the sole judgment of the Representatives, make it impracticable or inadvisable to market the Securities or to enforce contracts for the sale of the Securities.
Termination
10. . (a) If, on any Closing Date, any Underwriter defaults on its obligation to purchase the Securities that it has agreed to purchase hereunder (the "Defaulted Securities"), the non-defaulting Underwriters may in their discretion arrange for the purchase of the Defaulted Securities by one or more of the non-defaulting Underwriters or any other persons satisfactory to the Company on the terms contained in this Agreement. If, within 36 hours after any such default by any Underwriter, the non-defaulting Underwriters do not arrange for the purchase of the Defaulted Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of 36 hours within which to procure other persons satisfactory to the non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase the Defaulted Securities on such terms. If other persons become obligated or agree to purchase the Defaulted Securities of a defaulting Underwriter, either the non-defaulting Underwriters or the Company may postpone such Closing Date, for up to five full business days in order to effect any changes that in the opinion of counsel for the Company or counsel for the Underwriters may be necessary in the Registration
Defaulting Underwriter
 
Statement and the Prospectus or in any other document or arrangement, and the Company agrees to promptly prepare any amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus that effects any such changes. As used in this Agreement, the term "Underwriter" includes, for all purposes of this Agreement unless the context otherwise requires, any person not listed in Schedule 1 hereto that, pursuant to this Section 10, purchases Defaulted Securities that a defaulting Underwriter agreed but failed to purchase.
(b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Defaulted Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the non-defaulting Underwriters and the Company as provided in paragraph (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of the Defaulted Securities that remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of the Defaulted Securities that such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder plus such Underwriter's share (based on the principal amount of Securities that such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder) of the Defaulted Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made.
pro rata
(c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Defaulted Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the non-defaulting Underwriters and the Company as provided in paragraph (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Defaulted Securities that remains unpurchased exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in paragraph (b) above, then this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of the non-defaulting Underwriters. Any termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10 shall be without liability on the part of the Company, except that the Company will continue to be liable for the payment of expenses as set forth in Section 11 hereof and except that the provisions of Section 7 hereof shall not terminate and shall remain in effect.
(d) Nothing contained herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter of any liability it may have to the Company or any non-defaulting Underwriter for damages caused by its default.
11.

(iv) Until the Company has repaid the Notes in full, or such earlier date on which the Notes are redeemed pursuant to Article Four or become due and payable pursuant to Sections 501 and 502 of the Indenture:
(A) the Company shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts, subject to a Market Disruption Event, to raise sufficient net proceeds from
 
the issuance of Qualifying Capital Securities during the 180-day period ending on the Cut-off Date to permit repayment of the Notes in full on the Scheduled Maturity Date pursuant to Section 2.02(a)(i); and
(B) if the Company is unable for any reason to raise sufficient net proceeds from the issuance of Qualifying Capital Securities to permit repayment in full of the Notes on any Repayment Date (other than the Final Maturity Date), the Company shall continue to use its Commercially Reasonable Efforts, subject to a Market Disruption Event, to raise sufficient net proceeds from the sale of Qualifying Capital Securities during the 90-day period ending on each subsequent Cut-off Date to permit repayment of the Notes on such following Repayment Date pursuant to Section 2.02(a)(i); and
(C) the Company shall repay the Notes to the extent required by Section 2.02(a)(vi).
For the avoidance of doubt, the Company is not obligated to sell any securities other than Qualifying Capital Securities to raise net proceeds for repayment of the Notes pursuant to this Section 2.02(a), or to apply the proceeds of any such sale of other securities for repayment of the Notes pursuant to this Section 2.02(a), and no Holder of Notes may require the Company to issue any such other securities in satisfaction of its obligations under this Section 2.02(a).
(v) The Company, if it has not raised sufficient net proceeds from the issuance of Qualifying Capital Securities pursuant to Section 2.02(a)(iv) to permit repayment of the Notes in full on any Repayment Date (other than the Final Maturity Date) pursuant to Section 2.01(a)(i) or (ii), as applicable, shall deliver an Officers' Certificate to the Trustee (who shall forward such certificate to each Holder of the Notes) on and dated the Cut-off Date stating the amount of net proceeds, if any, raised pursuant to Section 2.02(a)(iv) in connection with such Repayment Date. The Company shall not be obligated to sell Qualifying Capital Securities pursuant to Section 2.02(a)(iv) if such Officers' Certificate further certifies that: (A) a Market Disruption Event was existing during the entire 180-day period ending on the Cut-off Date or, in the case of any Repayment Date after the Scheduled Maturity Date, the entire 90-day period preceding the Cut-off Date; or (B) the Market Disruption Event continued for only part of the 180-day period or 90-day period, as the case may be, but the Company was unable after Commercially Reasonable Efforts to raise sufficient net proceeds during the rest of that period to permit repayment of the Notes in full. In the event that the Company was unable, although no Market Disruption Event occurred, after Commercially Reasonable Efforts to raise sufficient net proceeds during the 180-day or 90-day period, as the case may be, to permit repayment of the Notes in full on such Repayment Date, the Company shall deliver an Officers' Certificate that certifies the same to the Trustee (who shall forward such certificate to each Holder of the Notes) on the Cut-off Date. Each Officers' Certificate delivered pursuant to this clause (v), unless no principal amount of Notes is to be repaid on
 
the applicable Repayment Date, shall be accompanied by a notice of repayment pursuant to Section 5.01 setting forth the principal amount of the Notes to be repaid on such Repayment Date, which amount shall be determined after giving effect to Section 2.02(a)(vi). In the event the Company fails to deliver an Officer's Certificate to the Trustee in the manner described herein in connection with a Repayment Date, the Company shall be deemed to have confirmed that sufficient proceeds have been raised from an issuance of Qualifying Capital Securities, and all outstanding principal of the Notes will be due on such Repayment Date.
(vi) Payments in respect of the Notes on any Repayment Date will be applied as follows: first, to deferred interest on the Notes (including compounded interest thereon) to the extent of Eligible Proceeds raised pursuant to Section 2.06; second, to pay current interest on the Notes to the extent not paid from other sources; and third, to the principal amount of the Notes; that if the Company is obligated to sell Qualifying Capital Securities and repay principal on any outstanding Securities in addition to the Notes in respect thereof, then on any date and for any period, such payments shall be made on the Notes and those other Securities having the same scheduled maturity date as the Notes (including the Fixed-to-Floating Rate Notes) in accordance with their respective outstanding principal amounts, and no such payments shall be made to any other such Securities having a later scheduled maturity date until the principal of and all accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes have been paid in full, except to the extent permitted by Sections 3.01 and 2.06(c). If at any time the Company is obligated to sell Qualifying Capital Securities and repay principal on any outstanding Securities having an earlier scheduled maturity date in addition to the Notes, then no payment shall be made on the Notes until the principal of and all accrued and unpaid interest on such Securities having an earlier scheduled maturity date is paid in full. If the Company raises less than $5,000,000 of net proceeds from the sale of Qualifying Capital Securities during the relevant 180-day or 90-day period, the Company will not be required to repay any Notes on the Scheduled Maturity Date or the next Repayment Date, as applicable. On the next Repayment Date as of which the Company has raised at least $5,000,000 of net proceeds during the 180-day period (or, if shorter, the period beginning on the date on which the Company last repaid any principal amount of Notes) ending on the Cut-off Date, the Company shall be required to repay a principal amount of the Notes (and any Securities having the same scheduled maturity date as the Notes, as described in the proviso to the first sentence of this clause (vi)) equal to the entire net proceeds from the sale of Qualifying Capital Securities during such 180-day or shorter period on such Repayment Date.

The Company may, without the consent of any Holders of the Notes, amend the definition of Qualifying APM Securities to eliminate Common Stock or Qualifying Warrants (but not both) and/or Mandatorily Convertible Preferred Stock from the definition of Qualifying APM Securities if, after the date hereof, an accounting standard or interpretive guidance of an existing accounting standard issued by an organization or regulator that has responsibility for establishing or interpreting accounting standards used by the Company in its principal public financial reports becomes effective or applicable to the Company such that there is more than an insubstantial risk that failure to eliminate Common Stock or Qualifying Warrants and/or
 
Mandatorily Convertible Preferred Stock, as the case may be, from the definition would result in a reduction in the Company's earnings per share as calculated in accordance with such accounting standards or interpretive guidance.

For this purpose, an amendment or supplement that adds new types of securities qualifying as Replacement Capital Securities or modifies the requirements of securities qualifying as Replacement Capital Securities will not be deemed adverse to the Covered Debtholders if, following such amendment or supplement, this Replacement Capital Covenant would constitute a Qualifying Replacement Capital Covenant.
(c) For purposes of Sections 4(a) and 4(b), the Holders whose consent or agreement is required to terminate, amend or supplement the obligations of the Corporation under this Replacement Capital Covenant shall be the Holders of the then-effective Covered Debt as of a record date established by the Corporation that is not more than 30 days prior to the date on which the Corporation proposes that such termination, amendment or supplement becomes effective.
