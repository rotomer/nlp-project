Amendment of Bylaws

Item 8.01 Other Events.
Clarification Regarding Committed Lines of Credit
The Company wishes to clarify the requirements associated with its ability to borrow under its committed lines of credit, totaling $5.0 billion as of September 30, 2008, referred to under "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Lines of Credit and Other Credit Facilities" in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed on October 30, 2008, as amended by its Form 10-Q/A report filed on November 7, 2008, for the quarter ended September 30, 2008. Under the pertinent agreements, the ability to borrow under these facilities is conditioned on the continued satisfaction of customary conditions including, among other requirements, Prudential Financial, Inc.'s maintenance of consolidated net worth of at least $12.5 billion, calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The agreements specify that "net worth" for this purpose is based on the GAAP amount, excluding unrealized gains and losses on investments.
