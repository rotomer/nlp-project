Indemnification and Contribution
(a) . The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (and will reimburse each Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by it in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim as to which it is entitled to indemnification hereunder as such expenses are incurred), joint or several, that arise out of, or are based upon, (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, not misleading, (ii) or any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, any Time of Sale Information, or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, in each case except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with any information furnished to the Company in writing by any Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein.
Indemnification of the Underwriters
(b) . Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company to the same extent as the indemnity set forth in paragraph (a) above, but only with respect to any losses, claims, damages or liabilities that arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with any information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use in the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any Time of Sale Information, it being understood and agreed that the only such information consists of the following: (i) the names of the Underwriters (A) on the cover pages of the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus and (B) under the heading "Underwriters" in the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus; (ii) the fifth paragraph of text under the caption "Underwriting" in the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus, concerning the terms of the offering by the Underwriters; (iii) the initial public offering price; and (iv) the seventh, eighth and ninth paragraphs of text under the caption "Underwriting" in the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus, concerning short sales, stabilizing transactions and purchases to cover positions created by short sales by the Underwriters.
Indemnification of the Company
 
(c) . Promptly after receipt of notice of the commencement of any action by any person in respect of which indemnification may be sought pursuant to paragraph (a) or (b) above, such person (the "Indemnified Person"), shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the person against whom such indemnification may be sought under such paragraph (the "Indemnifying Person"), notify the Indemnifying Person in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any Indemnified Person otherwise than under such paragraph. In case any such action shall be brought against any Indemnified Person and it shall notify the Indemnifying Person of the commencement thereof, the Indemnifying Person shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other Indemnifying Person similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such Indemnified Person (who shall not, except with the consent of the Indemnified Person, be counsel to the Indemnifying Person) and, after notice from the Indemnifying Person to such Indemnified Person of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the Indemnifying Person shall not be liable to such Indemnified Person under such paragraph for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Person, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. No Indemnifying Person shall, without the written consent of the Indemnified Person, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the Indemnified Person is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the Indemnified Person (or such other release of the Indemnified Person as shall be satisfactory to the Indemnified Person) from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any Indemnified Person.
Notice and Procedures
(d) . If the indemnification provided for in paragraphs (a) and (b) above is unavailable to an Indemnified Person or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each Indemnifying Person under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Person thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law or if the Indemnified Person failed to give the notice required under paragraph (c) above, then each Indemnifying Person shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds (before deducting expenses) received by the Company from the sale of the Securities and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters in connection therewith, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate offering price of the Securities. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
Contribution
(e) . The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in paragraph (d) above. The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Person as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in paragraph (d) above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, in no event shall an Underwriter be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriter with respect to the offering of the Securities exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to
Limitation on Liability
pro
rata
 
pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to their respective purchase obligations hereunder and not joint.
(f) The obligations of the Company under this Section 7 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to affiliates of the Underwriters and to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 7 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company (including any person who, with his or her consent, is named in the Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus as about to become a director of the Company) and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act.
8. . This Agreement shall become effective upon the execution and delivery hereof by the parties hereto.
Effectiveness of Agreement
9. . This Agreement may be terminated by the Representatives, by notice to the Company, if after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the Initial Closing Date (i) since the date as of which information is given in the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus, any Material Adverse Change or any development involving a prospective Material Adverse Change, whether or not arising in the ordinary course of business; (ii) suspension of trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange, the NYSE Alternext U.S. or the Nasdaq National Market or limitation on prices (other than limitations on hours or numbers of days of trading) for securities on any such exchange or market; (iii) the suspension of trading of the Company's securities by the New York Stock Exchange, the Commission, or any other governmental authority; (iv) the enactment, publication, decree or other promulgation of any statute, regulation, rule or order of any court or other governmental authority which in the opinion of the Representatives materially and adversely affects or may materially and adversely affect the business or operations of the Company; (v) the declaration of a banking moratorium by United States, New York State or New Jersey State authorities or a material disruption in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States or other relevant jurisdiction; (vi) the taking of any action by any governmental body or agency in respect of its monetary or fiscal affairs which in the reasonable opinion of the Representatives has a material adverse effect on the securities markets in the United States, or (vii) any outbreak or escalation of hostilities or declaration of war or national emergency or other national or international calamity or crisis or change in economic or political conditions if the effect of such outbreak, escalation, declaration, emergency, calamity, crisis or change on the financial markets of the United States would, in the sole judgment of the Representatives, make it impracticable or inadvisable to market the Securities or to enforce contracts for the sale of the Securities.
Termination
10. . (a) If, on any Closing Date, any Underwriter defaults on its obligation to purchase the Securities that it has agreed to purchase hereunder (the "Defaulted Securities"), the non-defaulting Underwriters may in their discretion arrange for the purchase of the Defaulted Securities by one or more of the non-defaulting Underwriters or any other persons satisfactory to the Company on the terms contained in this Agreement. If, within 36 hours after any such default by any Underwriter, the non-defaulting Underwriters do not arrange for the purchase of the Defaulted Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of 36 hours within which to procure other persons satisfactory to the non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase the Defaulted Securities on such terms. If other persons become obligated or agree to purchase the Defaulted Securities of a defaulting Underwriter, either the non-defaulting Underwriters or the Company may postpone such Closing Date, for up to five full business days in order to effect any changes that in the opinion of counsel for the Company or counsel for the Underwriters may be necessary in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus or in any other document or arrangement, and the Company agrees to promptly prepare any amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus that effects any such changes. As used in this Agreement, the term "Underwriter" includes, for all purposes of this Agreement unless the context otherwise requires, any person not listed in Schedule 1 hereto that, pursuant to this Section 10, purchases Defaulted Securities that a defaulting Underwriter agreed but failed to purchase.
Defaulting Underwriter
 
(b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Defaulted Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the non-defaulting Underwriters and the Company as provided in paragraph (a) above, the aggregate number of the Defaulted Securities that remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate number of all the Securities, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the number of the Defaulted Securities that such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder plus such Underwriter's share (based on the number of Securities that such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder) of the Defaulted Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made.
pro
rata
(c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Defaulted Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the non-defaulting Underwriters and the Company as provided in paragraph (a) above, the aggregate number of such Defaulted Securities that remains unpurchased exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate number of all the Securities, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in paragraph (b) above, then this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of the non-defaulting Underwriters. Any termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10 shall be without liability on the part of the Company, except that the Company will continue to be liable for the payment of expenses as set forth in Section 11 hereof and except that the provisions of Section 7 hereof shall not terminate and shall remain in effect.
(d) Nothing contained herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter of any liability it may have to the Company or any non-defaulting Underwriter for damages caused by its default.
11. . (a) Whether or not the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated or this Agreement is terminated, the Company will pay or cause to be paid all costs and expenses incident to the performance of its obligations hereunder, including without limitation, (i) the costs incident to the authorization, issuance, sale, preparation and delivery of the Securities and any taxes payable in that connection; (ii) the costs incident to the preparation, printing, reproduction, delivery to or at the direction of the Representatives and filing under the Securities Act of the Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, any Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus (including all exhibits, amendments and supplements thereto); (iii) the costs of reproducing and distributing each of this Agreement, the Securities and any Blue Sky Memorandum; (iv) the fees and expenses of the Company's counsel and independent accountants; (v) the fees and expenses incurred in connection with the qualification of the Securities under the laws of such jurisdictions as the Representatives may designate (including the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel for the Underwriters); (vi) any fees charged by rating agencies for rating the Securities; (vii) the fees and expenses of any transfer agent or registrar (including related fees and expenses of any counsel to such parties); (viii) if required, all expenses and application fees incurred in connection with any filing with, and clearance of the offering by, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority; (ix) all expenses and application fees related to the listing of the Securities on the New York Stock Exchange; and (x) the transportation and other expenses incurred by or on behalf of the Company representatives (but excluding for the avoidance of doubt such transportation and other expenses incurred by or on behalf of representatives of the Underwriters) in connection with presentations to prospective purchasers of the Securities.
Payment of Expenses
(b) If (i) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 9, (ii) the Company for any reason fails to tender the Securities for delivery to the Underwriters or (iii) the Underwriters decline to purchase the Securities for any reason permitted under this Agreement, the Company agrees to reimburse the Underwriters for all out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including the fees and expenses of their counsel) reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in connection with this Agreement and the offering contemplated hereby.
12. . This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective successors and the Indemnified Persons referred to in Section 7 hereof. Nothing in this Agreement is intended or shall be construed to give any other person any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this Agreement or any provision contained herein. No purchaser of Securities from any Underwriter shall be deemed to be a successor merely by reason of such purchase.
Persons Entitled to Benefit of Agreement
13. . The respective indemnities, rights of contribution, representations, warranties and agreements of the Company and the Underwriters contained in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of the Company or the Underwriters pursuant to this Agreement or any certificate delivered pursuant hereto shall survive the delivery of and payment for the Securities and shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any termination of this Agreement or any investigation made by or on behalf of the Company or the Underwriters.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
As Vice President and Chief Corporate Finance Counsel of The Prudential Insurance Company of America ("Prudential"), I am familiar with the arrangements whereby Prudential Financial, Inc., a New Jersey corporation (the "Company"), has been authorized to issue and sell 32,051,283 shares (the "Securities") of the Company's common stock, par value $0.01 per share, to you and the other Underwriters listed on Schedule 1 of the Underwriting Agreement, dated June 2, 2009 (the "Underwriting Agreement"), among the Company and you, as representatives of the several Underwriters named therein (the "Underwriters"), pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement.
I am also familiar with the Prospectus, dated March 11, 2009, the accompanying Prospectus Supplement for the Securities, dated June 2, 2009 (the "Prospectus Supplement"), and the documents incorporated by reference therein (such Prospectus, Prospectus Supplement and such other documents collectively, the "Prospectus"), included in the Company's Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File Nos. 333-157848, 333-157848-01 and 333-157848-02) (the "Registration Statement"). Capitalized terms used and not defined herein have the meanings given them in the Underwriting Agreement.
I have examined or caused to be examined under my direction certificates of public officials, and copies, certified or otherwise identified to my satisfaction, of such corporate documents and records of the Company, and of such other records, certificates, documents and other instruments, as I have deemed relevant and necessary or appropriate as a basis for this opinion. In addition, I have consulted with certain attorneys in the Company's Law Department and I have relied, to the extent I deemed such reliance proper, upon certificates of officers of the Company with respect to the accuracy of material factual matters that were not independently established.

2. The Company has been duly incorporated and is an existing corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of New Jersey.

6. The Securities have been duly and validly authorized and, when issued and delivered against payment therefor as provided in the Underwriting Agreement, will be duly and validly issued and fully paid and non-assessable. The issuance of the Securities is not subject to any preemptive or similar rights of any securityholder of the Company.
7. I do not know of any litigation or governmental proceeding instituted or threatened against the Company or any of its consolidated subsidiaries that would be required to be described in the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus, and is not so described; and, to my knowledge, no legal or governmental proceeding is pending or is currently being threatened challenging the offering of the Securities by the Underwriters that would be required to be described in the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus, and is not so described.

9. The execution and delivery of the Underwriting Agreement, the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated therein and the compliance by the Company with its obligations thereunder will not result in a breach of, or default under, any material contract, indenture, mortgage, loan agreement, note, lease or other material agreement or instrument known to me (after due inquiry and investigation) to which the Company is a party or by which it may be bound or to which any of the property or assets of the Company is subject, nor will such action result in any violation of the provisions of the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the Amended and Restated By-Laws of the Company or any New York, New Jersey or United States federal statute or law or any order, rule or regulation of any court or insurance regulatory agency or other governmental agency or body having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its properties, except (other than with respect to the provisions of the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and the Amended and Restated By-Laws of the Company) to the extent that such breach, default or violation would not have individually or in the aggregate a Material Adverse Effect; provided, however, that, for purposes of this opinion (9), I do not express any opinion with respect to federal and state securities laws, other antifraud laws and fraudulent transfer laws.
10. (A) To my knowledge, each of the Company, and, to the extent that each of the following entities is a "significant subsidiary" of the Company within the meaning of Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X under the Securities Act, each of Prudential Holdings, LLC and Prudential is registered in all capacities with each federal, state, local or other governmental authority and is registered with, a member of, or a participant in, each self-regulatory organization, in each case, as is necessary to conduct its business as described in or contemplated by the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus except as set forth in the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus and except where failure to be so registered would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect; (B) to my knowledge, all such registrations and memberships are in full force and effect and neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has received any notice of any event, inquiry, investigation or proceeding that would reasonably be expected to result in the suspension, revocation or limitation of any such registrations or memberships, except as set forth in the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus and except as would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect; and (C) to my knowledge, each of the Company and its
 
subsidiaries is in compliance with all applicable laws, rules, regulations, orders, By-Laws and similar requirements in connection with such registrations or memberships, as the case may be, except as set forth in the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus and except as would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.
11. To my knowledge, and, to the extent that each of the following entities is a "significant subsidiary" of the Company within the meaning of Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X under the Securities Act, (A) each of The Gibraltar Life Insurance Company, Ltd. and The Prudential Life Insurance Company, Ltd. is registered with the Japanese Financial Supervisory Authority; (B) such registration is in full force and effect and neither The Gibraltar Life Insurance Company, Ltd. nor The Prudential Life Insurance Company, Ltd. has received any notice of any event, inquiry, investigation or proceeding that would reasonably be expected to result in the suspension, revocation or limitation of any such registration, except as set forth in the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus and except as would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect; and (C) each of The Gibraltar Life Insurance Company, Ltd. and The Prudential Life Insurance Company, Ltd. is in compliance with all applicable laws, rules, regulations, orders, By-Laws and similar requirements in connection with such registration, except as set forth in the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus and except as would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.
12. The Securities conform in all material respects to the descriptions thereof in the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus. The statements set forth under the heading "Description of Our Common Stock" in the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus provide a fair summary of such provisions.
13. The Company has the authorized capitalization set forth in the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus.
In addition, on the basis of my own knowledge and knowledge I have gained from attorneys in the Company's Law Department, with whom I have consulted for the purpose of preparing the Company's disclosure documents incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, considered in the light of my understanding of the applicable law and experience I have gained through my practice in this field, I confirm to you that (i) the Registration Statement, as of its most recent effective date determined pursuant to Rule 430B(f)(2) under the Securities Act, and the Prospectus, as of the date thereof and as of the Closing Date, appeared or appear on their face to be appropriately responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the Securities Act and the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder and (ii) nothing has come to my attention that has caused me to believe that (x) the Registration Statement, as of its most recent effective date determined pursuant to Rule 430B(f)(2) under the Securities Act, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, (y) the Time of Sale Information, as amended or supplemented at the Time of Sale, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or (z) the Prospectus, as of the date thereof and as of the Closing Date, included or includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
The limitations inherent in the independent verification of factual matters and the character of determinations involved in the preparation of the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus are such, however, that (except to the extent expressly set forth in opinion (12)) I do not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information or the Prospectus. Also, I do not express any opinion or belief as to the financial statements or other financial data contained in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information or the Prospectus, or as to the statement of the eligibility of the trustee under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended.
As to certain factual matters, I have relied upon certificates of officers of the Company and its subsidiaries and certificates of public officials and other sources believed by me to be responsible; and I have assumed that the Underwriting Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Underwriters and that the signatures on all documents examined by me (or members of the Company's Law Department) are genuine (assumptions that I have not independently verified).
The opinions expressed herein are limited to the laws of the State of New Jersey, the laws of the State of New York and the federal laws of the United States of America, and I am expressing no opinion as to the effect of the laws of
 
any other jurisdiction. I am not a member of the bar of Japan and to the extent the opinions set forth above are affected or controlled by the laws of Japan, I have, with your approval, relied on the opinions of Jonathan S. Malamud, Esq., Corporate Vice President and Chief Legal Officer of each of The Gibraltar Life Insurance Company, Ltd. and The Prudential Life Insurance Company, Ltd., dated the date hereof, copies of which are being delivered to you concurrently herewith. I am delivering this opinion pursuant to Section 6(g) of the Underwriting Agreement, at the request of the Company, and no person other than the Underwriters is entitled to rely hereon.
