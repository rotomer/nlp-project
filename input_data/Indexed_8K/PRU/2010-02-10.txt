For the fourth quarter of 2009, net income for the Financial Services Businesses attributable to Prudential Financial, Inc. amounted to $1.788 billion ($3.79 per Common share) compared to a net loss of $1.656 billion ($3.89 per Common share) for the fourth quarter of 2008. After-tax adjusted operating income for the fourth quarter of 2009 for the Financial Services Businesses amounted to $495 million ($1.07 per Common share), compared to a loss, based on after-tax adjusted operating income, of $879 million ($2.04 per Common share) for the fourth quarter of 2008.
"Each of our divisions recorded solid results for the fourth quarter and the year. Our businesses benefited from improving financial market conditions, from successful product offerings, and from expanded distribution. Turbulent financial market conditions in the recent past gave us an exceptional opportunity to enhance our competitive position, and we have done so. We completed over $4 billion of long-term debt and equity issues during the year, significantly adding to our financial strength and flexibility. In December, we sold our stake in the Wachovia Securities joint venture for $4.5 billion of cash proceeds. With this transaction we realized a substantial return on our investment, which had an initial book value of $1.0 billion in 2003. Our strong sales and flows, virtually across the board for the fourth quarter and the year, attest to our success in building our franchise. We are gaining ground as our innovative value propositions and underlying financial strength set us apart. While we are mindful that we remain in uncertain times, we have never felt better about our balanced mix of quality businesses and our ability to benefit from further changes in the industry landscape," said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John Strangfeld.
Adjusted operating income is not calculated under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Information regarding adjusted operating income, a non-GAAP measure, is discussed later in this press release under "Forward-Looking Statements and Non-GAAP Measures," and a reconciliation of adjusted operating income to the most comparable GAAP measure is provided in the tables that accompany this release.

Financial Services Businesses
Prudential Financial's Common Stock (NYSE:PRU) reflects the performance of its Financial Services Businesses, which consist of its U.S. Retirement Solutions and Investment Management, U.S. Individual Life and Group Insurance, and International Insurance and Investments divisions and its Corporate and Other operations.
In the following business-level discussion, adjusted operating income refers to pre-tax results.
The reported adjusted operating income of $215 million for the fourth quarter of 2009, compared to a loss of $975 million in the year-ago quarter.
U.S. Retirement Solutions and Investment Management division
The Individual Annuities segment reported adjusted operating income of $88 million in the current quarter, compared to a loss of $1.039 billion in the year-ago quarter. Current quarter results benefited $47 million from net reductions in reserves for guaranteed minimum death and income benefits and $32 million from a net reduction in amortization of deferred policy acquisition and other costs, reflecting an updated estimate of profitability for this business. These benefits to results were largely driven by increases in customer account values during the current quarter. Results for the year-ago quarter included a net charge of $907 million from similar adjustment of these items to reflect an update of estimated profitability, largely driven by declines in customer account values associated with adverse financial market conditions during that quarter. Mark-to-market of embedded derivatives and related hedge positions associated with living benefits, after amortization of deferred policy acquisition and other costs, resulted in a net charge of $71 million to current quarter adjusted operating income. In addition, current quarter results included a $38 million charge for mark-to-market of hedging positions initiated in 2009 to mitigate exposure to declines in capital from adverse financial market conditions. Results for the year-ago quarter included net charges of $130 million from mark-to-market of embedded derivatives and related hedge positions associated with living benefits. In addition, results for the year-ago quarter included a charge of $97 million to write off the entire balance of goodwill associated with the
 
Page 5.
 
company's acquisition of Allstate's variable annuity business in 2006. Excluding the effect of the foregoing items, adjusted operating income for the Individual Annuities segment increased $23 million from the year-ago quarter, primarily reflecting higher asset-based fees due to growth in variable annuity account values.
The Retirement segment reported adjusted operating income of $133 million for the current quarter, unchanged from the year-ago quarter. Results for the year-ago quarter benefited $33 million from a refinement of reserves for traditional group annuity business based on an actuarial review of beneficiary census data. Excluding this item, adjusted operating income of the Retirement segment increased $33 million from the year-ago quarter, primarily due to a greater contribution from investment results.
The Asset Management segment reported a loss, on an adjusted operating income basis, of $6 million for the current quarter, compared to a loss of $69 million in the year-ago quarter. Investment results associated with proprietary investing activities contributed income of approximately $10 million in the current quarter compared to losses of approximately $150 million in the year-ago quarter, with the latter driven largely by fixed income and equity fund investments that were subsequently redeemed. The improved results from proprietary investing activities were partially offset by unfavorable current quarter results from commercial mortgage activities.
The reported adjusted operating income of $210 million for the fourth quarter of 2009, compared to $78 million in the year-ago quarter.
U.S. Individual Life and Group Insurance division
The Individual Life segment reported adjusted operating income of $141 million for the current quarter, compared to $9 million in the year-ago quarter. Current quarter results benefited from lower net amortization of deferred policy acquisition and other costs primarily relating to separate account performance, together with related costs, reflecting unfavorable financial market conditions in the year-ago quarter. In addition, current quarter results reflected more favorable mortality experience, with an estimated impact of approximately $20 million in comparison to the year-ago quarter.
The Group Insurance segment reported adjusted operating income of $69 million in the current quarter, unchanged from the year-ago quarter.

The reported adjusted operating income of $457 million for the fourth quarter of 2009, compared to $1 million in the year-ago quarter.
International Insurance and Investments division
The International Insurance segment reported adjusted operating income of $453 million for the current quarter, an increase of $32 million from the year-ago quarter. Adjusted operating income of the segment's Life Planner insurance operations increased $41 million, to $302 million for the current quarter from $261 million in the year-ago quarter, primarily reflecting continued business growth and more favorable mortality experience in the current quarter. The segment's Gibraltar Life operations reported adjusted operating income of $151 million for the current quarter, compared to $160 million in the year-ago quarter. Current quarter results for Gibraltar Life included $11 million from the former Yamato Life business acquired on May 1, 2009. Gibraltar Life's current quarter results also include expenses of $11 million related to an ongoing technology improvement program, while results for the year-ago quarter included $9 million income from the sale of a former branch office property. Foreign currency exchange rates, including the impact of the Company's currency hedging programs, did not have a significant effect on the comparison of results for the segment's international insurance businesses.
The International Investments segment reported adjusted operating income of $4 million for the current quarter, compared to a loss of $420 million in the year-ago quarter. The year-ago quarter loss included charges totaling $316 million to record declines in value of several joint venture investments, and a charge of $110 million to write off the segment's entire balance of goodwill, relating to several acquired businesses. Excluding these items, adjusted operating income for the International Investments segment was essentially unchanged from the year-ago quarter.
resulted in a loss, on an adjusted operating income basis, of $199 million in the fourth quarter of 2009, compared to a loss of $288 million in the year-ago quarter. Results for the year-ago quarter included a charge of $117 million to write off the entire balance of goodwill for the Company's real estate and relocation business, and a $32 million benefit from the repurchase of Prudential Financial convertible debt securities at a discount. Excluding these items, the loss from corporate and other operations was essentially unchanged

from the year-ago quarter. The current quarter loss reflects increased interest expense, net of investment income, reflecting the negative spread associated with the investment of debt issuance proceeds in cash and short-term investments, as well as a greater level of capital debt, in comparison to the year-ago quarter. Lower expenses, reflecting certain liabilities that are impacted by changes in equity and other markets, were a partial offset. In addition, the Company's real estate and relocation business reported a reduced loss in comparison to the year-ago quarter, with losses amounting to $6 million in the current quarter and $42 million, excluding the goodwill writeoff, in the year-ago quarter.
amounted to $667 billion at December 31, 2009, compared to $558 billion a year earlier.
Assets under management
of the Financial Services Businesses attributable to Prudential Financial, Inc. amounted to $1.788 billion for the fourth quarter of 2009, compared to a net loss of $1.656 billion in the year-ago quarter.
Net income
Current quarter net income includes $38 million of pre-tax net realized investment gains and related charges and adjustments. Net realized investment gains from general portfolio activities, together with increases in market value of certain externally managed investments in the European market, were largely offset by $225 million of losses from impairments and sales of credit-impaired investments. The losses from impairments and sales of credit-impaired investments include $201 million on fixed maturity investments, including $70 million relating to asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages, $10 million of impairments on equity securities, and $14 million of impairments on other investments.
At December 31, 2009, gross unrealized losses on general account fixed maturity investments of the Financial Services Businesses amounted to $4.389 billion, including $3.135 billion on high and highest quality securities based on NAIC or equivalent ratings. Gross unrealized losses include $1.293 billion related to asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages. Gross unrealized losses on general account fixed maturity investments of the Financial Services Businesses at December 31, 2009 include $2.446 billion of declines in value of 20% or more of amortized cost, of which $2.179 billion represents such declines in value for three months or more. Gross unrealized losses on general account fixed maturity investments of the
 
Page 8.
 
Financial Services Businesses amounted to $11.251 billion at December 31, 2008. Net unrealized gains on general account fixed maturity investments of the Financial Services Businesses amounted to $998 million at December 31, 2009, compared to net unrealized losses of $6.567 billion at December 31, 2008.
Net income for the current quarter includes $2.162 billion of pre-tax income from divested businesses, primarily reflecting a pre-tax gain of $2.143 billion from the sale of the Company's interest in the retail securities brokerage joint venture with Wachovia, to Wells Fargo on December 31, 2009 after certain related one-time compensation and other expenses totaling $104 million. Net income for the current quarter also reflects pre-tax increases of $76 million in recorded asset values and $49 million in recorded liabilities representing changes in value which are expected to ultimately accrue to contractholders. These changes primarily represent interest rate related mark-to-market adjustments.
Net income of the Financial Services Businesses for the year-ago quarter included $511 million of pre-tax net realized investment losses and related charges and adjustments, decreases of $815 million in recorded assets and $481 million in recorded liabilities for which changes in value are expected to ultimately accrue to contractholders, and a loss of $230 million from divested businesses, in each case before income taxes.
Closed Block Business
Prudential's Class B Stock, which is not traded on any exchange, reflects the performance of its Closed Block Business.
The Closed Block Business includes our in-force participating life insurance and annuity policies, and assets that are being used for the payment of benefits and policyholder dividends on these policies, as well as other assets and equity that support these policies. We have ceased offering these participating policies.
The Closed Block Business reported income from continuing operations before income taxes of $92 million for the fourth quarter of 2009, compared to $117 million for the year-ago

quarter. The Closed Block Business reported net income attributable to Prudential Financial, Inc. of $77 million for the fourth quarter of 2009 and $74 million for the year-ago quarter.

The Closed Block Business reported a net loss attributable to Prudential Financial, Inc. of $287 million for 2009 and net income of $23 million for 2008.
Consolidated Results

On a consolidated basis, which includes the results of both the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business, Prudential Financial, Inc. reported net income attributable to Prudential Financial, Inc. of $1.865 billion for the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to a net loss of $1.582 billion for the year-ago quarter, and reported net income attributable to Prudential Financial, Inc. of $3.124 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to a net loss of $1.117 billion for 2008.
Forward-Looking Statements and Non-GAAP Measures
Certain of the statements included in this release constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the U. S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Words such as "expects," "believes," "anticipates," "includes," "plans," "assumes," "estimates," "projects," "intends," "should," "will," "shall," or variations of such words are generally part of forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are made based on management's current expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effects upon Prudential Financial, Inc. and its subsidiaries. There can be no assurance that future developments affecting
 
Page 10.
 
Prudential Financial, Inc. and its subsidiaries will be those anticipated by management. These forward-looking statements are not a guarantee of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties, and there are certain important factors that could cause actual results to differ, possibly materially, from expectations or estimates reflected in such forward-looking statements, including, among others: (1) general economic, market and political conditions, including the performance and fluctuations of fixed income, equity, real estate and other financial markets, particularly in light of the severe economic conditions and the severe stress experienced by the global financial markets that began in the second half of 2007 and continued into 2009; (2) the availability and cost of external financing for our operations, which has been affected by the stress experienced by the global financial markets; (3) interest rate fluctuations; (4) reestimates of our reserves for future policy benefits and claims; (5) differences between actual experience regarding mortality, morbidity, persistency, surrender experience, interest rates or market returns and the assumptions we use in pricing our products, establishing liabilities and reserves or for other purposes; (6) changes in our assumptions related to deferred policy acquisition costs, valuation of business acquired or goodwill; (7) changes in our claims-paying or credit ratings; (8) investment losses, defaults and counterparty non-performance; (9) competition in our product lines and for personnel; (10) changes in tax law; (11) economic, political, currency and other risks relating to our international operations; (12) fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and foreign securities markets; (13) regulatory or legislative changes, including government actions in response to the stress experienced by the global financial markets; (14) adverse determinations in litigation or regulatory matters and our exposure to contingent liabilities, including in connection with our divestiture or winding down of businesses; (15) domestic or international military actions, natural or man-made disasters including terrorist activities or pandemic disease, or other events resulting in catastrophic loss of life; (16) ineffectiveness of risk management policies and procedures in identifying, monitoring and managing risks; (17) effects of acquisitions, divestitures and restructurings, including possible difficulties in integrating and realizing the projected results of acquisitions; (18) changes in statutory or U.S. GAAP accounting principles, practices or policies; (19) changes in assumptions for retirement expense; (20) Prudential Financial, Inc.'s primary
 
Page 11.
 
reliance, as a holding company, on dividends or distributions from its subsidiaries to meet debt payment obligations and the ability of the subsidiaries to pay such dividends or distributions in light of our ratings objectives and/or applicable regulatory restrictions; and (21) risks due to the lack of legal separation between our Financial Services Businesses and our Closed Block Business. As noted above, the period from the second half of 2007 continuing into 2009 was characterized by extreme adverse market and economic conditions. The foregoing risks are even more pronounced in such unprecedented market and economic conditions. Prudential Financial, Inc. does not intend, and is under no obligation, to update any particular forward-looking statement included in this document.
Adjusted operating income is a non-GAAP measure of performance of our Financial Services Businesses. Adjusted operating income excludes "Realized investment gains (losses), net," as adjusted, and related charges and adjustments. A significant element of realized investment gains and losses are impairments and credit-related and interest rate-related gains and losses. Impairments and losses from sales of credit-impaired securities, the timing of which depends largely on market credit cycles, can vary considerably across periods. The timing of other sales that would result in gains or losses, such as interest rate-related gains or losses, is largely subject to our discretion and influenced by market opportunities as well as our tax and capital profile.
Realized investment gains (losses) representing profit or loss of certain of our businesses which primarily originate investments for sale or syndication to unrelated investors, and those associated with terminating hedges of foreign currency earnings and current period yield adjustments are included in adjusted operating income. Realized investment gains and losses from products that are free standing derivatives or contain embedded derivatives, and from associated derivative portfolios that are part of an economic hedging program related to the risk of those products, are included in adjusted operating income. Adjusted operating income excludes gains and losses from changes in value of certain assets and liabilities related to foreign currency exchange movements that have been economically hedged, as well as gains and losses on certain investments that are classified as other trading account assets and debt that is carried at fair value.
 
Page 12.
 
Adjusted operating income also excludes investment gains and losses on trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities and changes in experience-rated contractholder liabilities due to asset value changes, because these recorded changes in asset and liability values are expected to ultimately accrue to contractholders. Trends in the underlying profitability of our businesses can be more clearly identified without the fluctuating effects of these transactions. In addition, adjusted operating income excludes the results of divested businesses, which are not relevant to our ongoing operations. Discontinued operations, which is presented as a separate component of net income under GAAP, is also excluded from adjusted operating income.
We believe that the presentation of adjusted operating income as we measure it for management purposes enhances understanding of the results of operations of the Financial Services Businesses by highlighting the results from ongoing operations and the underlying profitability of our businesses. However, adjusted operating income is not a substitute for income determined in accordance with GAAP, and the adjustments made to derive adjusted operating income are important to an understanding of our overall results of operations. The schedules accompanying this release provide a reconciliation of adjusted operating income for the Financial Services Businesses to income from continuing operations in accordance with GAAP.
The information referred to above, as well as the risks of our businesses described in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2009 and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008, should be considered by readers when reviewing forward-looking statements contained in this release.

Realized investment gains (losses) representing profit or loss of certain of our businesses which primarily originate investments for sale or syndication to unrelated investors, and those associated with terminating hedges of foreign currency earnings and current period yield adjustments are included in adjusted operating income. Realized investment gains and losses from products that are free standing derivatives or contain embedded derivatives, and from associated derivative portfolios that are part of an economic hedging program related to the risk of those products, are included in adjusted operating income.

Adjusted operating income does not equate to "Income from continuing operations" as determined in accordance with GAAP but is the measure of profit or loss we use to evaluate segment performance. Adjusted operating income is not a substitute for income determined in accordance with GAAP, and our definition of adjusted operating income may differ from that used by other companies. The items above are important to an understanding of our overall results of operations.

KEY DEFINITIONS AND FORMULAS
1. Adjusted operating income before income taxes:
Adjusted operating income is a non-GAAP measure of performance of our Financial Services Businesses that excludes "Realized investment gains (losses), net", as adjusted, and related charges and adjustments; net investment gains and losses on trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities; change in experience-rated contractholder liabilities due to asset value changes; results of divested businesses and discontinued operations; earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests; and the related tax effects thereof. Adjusted operating income includes equity in earnings of operating joint ventures and the related tax effects thereof. Revenues and benefits and expenses shown as components of adjusted operating income, are presented on the same basis as pre-tax adjusted operating income and are adjusted for the items above as well.
Realized investment gains (losses) representing profit or loss of certain of our businesses which primarily originate investments for sale or syndication to unrelated investors, and those associated with terminating hedges of foreign currency earnings and current period yield adjustments are included in adjusted operating income. Realized investment gains and losses from products that are free standing derivatives or contain embedded derivatives, and from associated derivative portfolios that are part of an economic hedging program related to the risk of those products, are included in adjusted operating income. Adjusted operating income excludes gains and losses from changes in value of certain assets and liabilities relating to foreign currency exchange movements that have been economically hedged, as well as gains and losses on certain investments that are classified as other trading account assets and debt that is carried at fair value.
Adjusted operating income does not equate to "Income from continuing operations" as determined in accordance with GAAP but is the measure of profit or loss we use to evaluate segment performance. Adjusted operating income is not a substitute for income determined in accordance with GAAP, and our definition of adjusted operating income may differ from that used by other companies. The items above are important to an understanding of our overall results of operations. However, we believe that the presentation of adjusted operating income as we measure it for management purposes enhances the understanding of our results of operations by highlighting the results from ongoing operations and the underlying profitability factors of our businesses.
2. After-tax adjusted operating income:
Adjusted operating income before taxes, as defined above, less the income tax effect applicable to adjusted operating income before taxes.
3. Annualized New Business Premiums:
Premiums from new sales that are expected to be collected over a one year period. Group insurance annualized new business premiums exclude new premiums resulting from rate changes on existing policies, from additional coverage issued under our Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance contract, and from excess premiums on group universal life insurance that build cash value but do not purchase face amounts. Group insurance annualized new business premiums include premiums from the takeover of claim liabilities. Group disability amounts include long-term care products.

5. Attributed Equity:
Amount of capital assigned to each of the Company's segments for purposes of measuring segment adjusted operating income before income taxes, established at a level which management considers necessary to support the segment's risks.

KEY DEFINITIONS AND FORMULAS
11. Client Assets:
Fair market value of assets in client accounts of International brokerage operations, Prudential Bank and mortgage loan servicing business, that are not included in Assets Under Management. Prudential does not receive a management or administrative fee on these assets, but may receive a fee for executing trades, custody or recordkeeping services.
12. Earned Premiums:
The portion of a premium, net of any amount ceded, that represents coverage already provided or that belongs to the insurer based on the part of the policy period that has passed.
13. Earnings Per Share of Common Stock:
Net income (loss) for the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business is determined in accordance with GAAP and includes general and administrative expenses charged to each of the businesses based on the Company's methodology for the allocation of such expenses. Cash flows between the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business related to administrative expenses are determined by a policy servicing fee arrangement that is based upon insurance and policies in force and statutory cash premiums. To the extent reported administrative expenses vary from these cash flow amounts, the differences are recorded, on an after-tax basis, as direct equity adjustments to the equity balances of each business. The direct equity adjustments modify earnings available to holders of Common Stock and Class B Stock for earnings per share purposes. Earnings per share of Common Stock based on adjusted operating income (loss) of the Financial Services Businesses reflects these adjustments as well.

The Full Service line of business provides retirement plan products and services to public, private and not-for-profit organizations. This business provides recordkeeping, plan administration, actuarial advisory services, participant education and communication services, trustee services and institutional and retail investment funds.

For clients with both defined contribution and defined benefit plans, integrated recordkeeping services are available.

15. Full Service Stable Value:
Our Full Service Stable Value products represent fixed rate options on investment funds offered to customers. These products contain an obligation to pay interest at a specified rate for a specific period of time. Upon termination these products repay account balances at market value immediately or may be liquidated at book value over time. Substantially all of these products are either fully or partially participating, with annual or semi-annual resets giving effect to previous investment experience. These products are issued through the general account, separate accounts or client-owned trusts. Profits from partially participating general account products result from the spread between the rate of return on investment assets and the interest rates credited to the customer, less expenses. For fully participating products, generally subject to a minimum interest rate guarantee, we earn fee income.
