This document contains the principal terms and conditions applicable to Awards granted to employees under the Prudential Financial, Inc. Omnibus Incentive Plan (the ) for 2011. Specific provisions applicable to any employees selected to participate in any particular country or in the European Union are set out in Schedule 2.
Plan
PART A: General terms and conditions
 
Prudential's 2011 Mid-Term Incentive Program (the ) and 2011 Long-Term Incentive Program (the ) are made available to employees subject to the terms of the Plan and are designed to strengthen the links between leadership, motivation and consistent performance. Employees selected to participate in the Mid-Term Program will be granted Performance Units valued by reference to the book value of the Common Stock (the ). Employees selected to participate in the Long-Term Program may be granted Awards of Restricted Stock Units, Options, Performance Shares, Performance Units, or a combination thereof, and will be advised of the Awards made to them in their own personalized compensation statement or a communication from their manager.
Mid-Term Program
Long-Term Program
Book Value Units
The grant of Awards under either of these programs is subject to the terms and conditions contained in the Plan document. This document describes the principal terms and conditions of Awards granted to employees under the Plan (the ). The Schedule to these Terms contains the definitions used in these Terms. If there is any discrepancy between these Terms and the Plan document, or if there is a discrepancy between any information given by anyone acting on behalf of any member of the Company Group and the Plan document, the Plan document, as interpreted by the Compensation Committee, will always govern.
Terms
 
Grants of Awards under the Plan are entirely at the sole discretion of Prudential.
A grant of an Award under the Plan on one occasion does not give an employee the right to any further grant at any time in the future.
 
An employee granted an Award may accept the Award in any manner specified by the Compensation Committee (or the Company Group) and may be deemed to have accepted an Award if the employee has not declined the grant of that Award (in whole or in part) within any period of time specified by the Compensation Committee (or the Company Group) and notified to the employee.
By accepting an Award, a Participant will be responsible for complying with any Applicable Laws relating to:
 
 
 
The Applicable Laws may change and Participants should seek their own professional legal, financial and taxation advice in relation to their participation in the Plan.
 
Prudential or any member of the Company Group, as appropriate, has the right to deduct, report and account for any taxes or other obligations required to be withheld by law in connection with an Award. Prudential (or, as appropriate, any other member of the Company Group) may require a Participant to pay to Prudential (or, if appropriate, any other member of the Company Group) the amount necessary to satisfy any such taxes or other obligations and may defer delivery of shares of Common Stock under the Plan to a Participant until such withholding is satisfied. On the exercise of an Option or the Vesting of Restricted Stock Units or Performance Shares, Prudential or, if appropriate, any other member of the Company Group, will have the right to withhold, either through payroll, through the withholding of sufficient shares of Common Stock or otherwise, in order to satisfy any applicable withholding requirements on the exercise of an Option or the Vesting of Restricted Stock Units or Performance Shares. Participants will be responsible for ensuring that their own tax affairs in connection with the Plan are in order.
 
Prudential makes no representation as to the future value of any Award under the Plan or whether any profit will be realized with respect to any Award. Past performance may not be a reliable guide to future performance. Investments may fall as well as rise in value. By accepting the grant of an Award, a Participant agrees that Prudential and the other members of the Company Group are not responsible for foreign exchange fluctuations between the Participant's local currency and the U.S. dollar and are not liable for any decrease in the value of shares of Common Stock. Changes in exchange rates may have an adverse effect on the value, price or income of the securities.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Awards granted under the Plan and Prudential's obligation to deliver shares of Common Stock or make payment of cash, as applicable, under these Terms will be subject in all respects to (a) all Applicable Laws, and (b) any registration, qualification, approvals or other requirements imposed by any government or regulatory agency or body which the Compensation Committee determines to be necessary or applicable. Shares of Common Stock or cash, as applicable, may not be delivered or paid to a Participant if their receipt would be contrary to any Applicable Laws or the rules of any applicable stock exchange.
 
If at the time of delivery of any shares of Common Stock under the Plan, the Common Stock is not registered under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the ), or there is no current prospectus in effect under the Securities Act with respect to the Common Stock, a Participant will, if requested by the Compensation Committee, execute, before the delivery of any shares of Common Stock, an agreement (in the form the Compensation Committee specifies) in which the Participant represents and warrants that the Participant is acquiring the shares for the Participant's own account, for investment only and not with a view to the resale or distribution of the shares, and agrees that any subsequent offer for sale or distribution of any kind of such shares will be made only pursuant to either (a) a registration statement on an appropriate form under the Securities Act, which registration statement has become effective and is current with regard to the shares being offered or sold; or (b) a specific exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, but in claiming that exemption, the Participant will, before any offer for sale of the shares, obtain a prior favorable written opinion, in form and substance satisfactory to the Compensation Committee, from counsel for or approved by the Compensation Committee, as to the applicability of the exemption.
Securities Act
 
A Participant acknowledges that Prudential is organized under the laws of the State of New Jersey and maintains its headquarters in Newark, New Jersey. The Participant further acknowledges that Prudential has an interest in ensuring the uniform interpretation and application of these Terms to all Participants. Accordingly, Prudential and the Participant agree that the Plan and these Terms will be governed by the laws of the State of New Jersey, without giving effect to its conflict of law provisions.
 
By accepting an Award under the Plan, a Participant agrees, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Laws, in lieu of receiving documents in paper format to accept electronic delivery of any documents that any member of the Company Group may be required to deliver in connection with the Plan. Electronic delivery of a document may be via e-mail or by reference to a location on a member of the Company Group's intranet site or a designated third-party vendor's internet site.
 
A Participant does not have any rights as a shareholder in Prudential by virtue of the grant of an Award under the Plan, but only with respect to shares of Common Stock, if any, delivered to the Participant in accordance with the Plan and these Terms.
 
Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, no acceleration of the time or schedule of any delivery of shares or other payment related to an Award will be permitted to the extent necessary to comply with Code Section 409A and the final regulations issued under Section 409A. The Compensation Committee may amend, modify, adjust or supplement any provision of the Plan without a Participant's consent if the Compensation Committee determines that the amendment, modification, adjustment or supplementation is required or advisable for an Award or Prudential to comply with, or not violate, any Applicable Laws, regulation or rule, including, without limitation, Code Section 409A.
 
Participation in the Plan does not entitle an employee of the Company Group to any benefit other than that granted under the Plan. Any benefits granted under the Plan will not be deemed to be compensation under any pension plan or other retirement plan, welfare plan or any compensation plan or program maintained by any member of the Company Group, and will not be considered as part of compensation for the purposes of calculating pension, profit-sharing, bonuses, service awards, or in the event of severance, redundancy or resignation.
Prudential may modify, amend, suspend or terminate the Plan or any and all of the policies, programs and terms of the Plan in whole or in part, at any time, without notice to or with the consent of Participants.
If shares of Common Stock are, or are to be, delivered in a manner not specifically authorized by the Plan, (i.e., in "Error"), Prudential will be entitled to correct the Error, including reversing the transaction and recouping any Common Stock or gain that might be delivered as a result of the Error.
The English language version of any documents provided in connection with the Plan will prevail in the case of any ambiguities or divergences as a result of the translation of the document into any other language.
Participation in the Plan is not intended to constitute or create a contract of employment nor does it constitute or create the right to remain associated with or in the employ of any member of the Company Group for any particular period of time. Participation in the Plan does not affect in any way a member of the Company Group's right to terminate an employee's Employment at any time, with or without cause, and does not form part of an employee's employment contract, if any.
 
 
The restricted period (the ) with respect to the Restricted Stock Units will begin on the Grant Date and will end on the RSU Payment Date.
Restricted Period
 
Subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan, a Participant in active Employment on the RSU Payment Date will receive as soon as administratively practicable after the RSU Payment Date (but not later than the end of the calendar year in which the RSU Payment Date occurs) the number of shares of Common Stock equal to the number of Restricted Stock Units vested in accordance with these Terms, less any taxes or other deductions required by Applicable Law.
 
A Participant's outstanding Restricted Stock Units will automatically be forfeited and cancelled on the termination of the Participant's Employment and no shares of Common Stock may thereafter be issued with respect to the Restricted Stock Units, except in the specific circumstances set out in the table below:
 
 
 
 
 
Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Plan to the contrary, to the extent necessary to comply with the requirements of Code Section 409A and the final regulations issued under Section 409A with respect to any individual who is a "specified employee" within the meaning of Section 409A and the final regulations, on termination of the Participant's employment with any member of the Company Group, delivery of shares of Common Stock may not be made before the date that is six (6) months after the date of such termination of Employment (or, if earlier, the date of the Participant's death). In addition, to the extent necessary to comply with the requirements of Code Section 409A and the final regulations issued under Code Section 409A, if an award of Restricted Stock Units is treated as deferred compensation subject to such Code Section 409A, no distribution will be made (although vesting will accelerate to the extent otherwise provided above) in respect of such award upon the occurrence of a Change of Control unless such event qualifies as a change in the ownership of a corporation, change in the effective control of a corporation or a change in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of a corporation within the meaning of such Code Section 409A and the final regulations issued thereunder.
 
A Participant granted Restricted Stock Units will be eligible to receive Dividend Equivalents on the Restricted Stock Units based on any regular cash dividends declared on Common Stock from the Grant Date until the RSU Payment Date (or until the date of forfeiture, if sooner). Any Dividend Equivalents will be paid in cash as soon as administratively practicable (but not more than 74 days) after the related cash
 
dividends are paid to Common Stock holders, unless determined otherwise by the Compensation Committee. Any Dividend Equivalents payable under the Plan will be treated as separate payments from the underlying Restricted Stock Units for purposes of Section 409A of the Code. There will be no reinvestment option or earned interest credits on any Dividend Equivalent.
 
 
An Option will normally vest and become exercisable in three equal annual installments on each anniversary of the Grant Date provided the Participant holding that Option remains in Employment throughout that period.
 
An Option may be exercised by the Participant:
 
 
 
One or more of the exercise methods may not be available (or may be unavailable during a specified period) if Prudential determines that its availability will or could violate the terms of any Applicable Laws. An Option cannot be exercised when the Market Value of a share of Common Stock does not exceed the Grant Price. Please refer to Schedule 2 for country specific restrictions regarding the exercise of Options.
 
Once an Option vests, it may be exercised until its Expiration Date unless the Participant's employment ends before the Expiration Date or a Change of Control occurs.
 
A Participant's Options, whether vested or unvested, will automatically be forfeited and cancelled on the termination of the Participant's Employment, and no shares of Common Stock may thereafter be purchased under the Options, except in the specified circumstances set out in the table below:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Performance Cycle (the ) with respect to Performance Shares and Performance Units will begin on January 1, 2011 and will end on December 31, 2013.
Performance Cycle
 
Subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan and following approval by the Compensation Committee, any (i) shares of Common Stock to which a Participant is entitled in respect of Performance Shares and (ii) amount of cash to which a Participant is entitled in respect of Performance Units will be delivered or paid to such Participant as soon as administratively practicable (but not later than 74 days) after the PS/PU Payment Date, less any taxes or other deductions required by Applicable Law.
 
A Participant's Performance Shares and Performance Units are conditioned on achievement of specified annual ROE and EPS goals, as established by the Compensation Committee with respect to each year during the Performance Cycle.
ROE is defined as Prudential's "Operating return on average equity (based on after-tax adjusted operating income)" as publicly disclosed in Prudential's Quarterly Financial Supplement ("QFS"). ROE for each year in the Performance Cycle is defined as the average of the quarterly ROE figures for such year published in the QFS.
EPS is defined as the "Earnings Per Share of Common Stock (diluted): Financial Services Businesses after-tax adjusted operating income" as publicly disclosed in the QFS, normalized for significant one-time charges or benefits that do not accurately reflect the operating performance of Prudential's businesses as and to the extent determined by the Compensation Committee.
The number of shares of Common Stock and the amount of cash that a Participant may become entitled to receive will be determined based on actual performance against annual ROE and EPS Goals for each year in the Performance Cycle. At the end of each calendar year during the Performance Cycle, a Participant will be deemed to have earned a number of shares of Common Stock and an amount of cash equal to one-third (1/3) the target number of Performance Shares and Performance Units, respectively, multiplied by the average of the sum of the Earned Payout Factor determined based on the actual achievement of the ROE Goals and EPS Goals for that year, as determined by the Compensation Committee. Any resulting number of shares of Common Stock shall be rounded to the nearest whole number. The number of shares of Common Stock deemed earned and the amount of cash deemed payable in respect of each year in the Performance Cycle will be called the "Yearly Payout Amount." Subject to the terms, conditions and restrictions set out in these Terms and in the Plan, including the requirement that the Participant remain actively employed with the Company Group as of the PS/PU Payment Date, shortly following the end of the Performance Cycle, the Participant will be paid the number of shares of Common Stock and the amount of cash equal to the sum of the Yearly Payout Amounts for the three years in the Performance Cycle. Such aggregate amount of shares of Common Stock and cash is referred to as the "Final Payout Amount." The Compensation Committee will determine, in its sole discretion, the Yearly Payout Amount for each year in the Performance Cycle and the Final Payout Amount.
The 2011 ROE Goals are as follows:
 
 
The 2011 EPS Goals are as follows:
 
The Compensation Committee will, in its sole discretion, set the ROE and EPS Goals for each subsequent year in the Performance Cycle.
If the actual ROE or EPS is between any two data points, the corresponding Earned Payout Factor will bear a linear relationship with the actual achievement between such data points.
In the event of a significant acquisition (as determined by the Compensation Committee in its sole discretion) involving Common Stock or a divestiture or other transaction involving Prudential or any other member of the Company Group during the Performance Cycle, the Compensation Committee may, in its sole discretion, assess the impact of any such event on the average ROE and EPS Goals and adjust such goals and related payout scales as the Compensation Committee, in its sole discretion, deems appropriate.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Compensation Committee, in its sole discretion, may (i) under normal circumstances, adjust the Final Payout Amount, by up to plus or minus 15% within the 0% to 150% of the target number of Performance Shares and Performance Units, to take into account critical performance factors and other events, as the Compensation Committee deems desirable, and (ii) in the event of
 
circumstances deemed to be extraordinary by the Compensation Committee, make additional adjustments to the Final Payout Amount.
 
A Participant's outstanding Performance Shares and Performance Units will automatically be forfeited and cancelled on the termination of the Participant's Employment and no shares of Common Stock and no amount of cash may thereafter be issued or paid with respect to the Performance Shares and Performance Units, respectively, except in the specific circumstances set out in the table below:
 
 
 
 
 
Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Plan to the contrary, to the extent necessary to comply with the requirements of Code Section 409A and the final regulations issued under Section 409A with respect to any individual who is a "specified employee" within the meaning of Section 409A and the final regulations, on termination of the Participant's employment with any member of the Company Group, delivery of shares of Common Stock may not be made before the date that is six (6) months after the date of such termination of Employment (or, if earlier, the date of the Participant's death). In addition, to the extent necessary to comply with the requirements of Code Section 409A and the final regulations issued under Code Section 409A, if an award of Performance Shares or Performance Units is treated as deferred compensation subject to such Code Section 409A, no distribution will be made (although vesting will accelerate to the extent otherwise provided above) in respect of such award upon the occurrence of a Change of Control unless such event qualifies as a change in the ownership of a corporation, change in the effective control of a corporation or a change in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of a corporation within the meaning of such Code Section 409A and the final regulations issued thereunder.
 
A Participant granted Performance Shares and Performance Units will be eligible to receive Dividend Equivalents on the lesser of (a) the Final Payout Amount; or (b) the respective target amount of Performance Shares and Performance Units, based on any regular cash dividends declared on Common Stock from the Grant Date until the PS/PU Payment Date (or until the date of forfeiture, if sooner). Any Dividend Equivalents will be paid in cash as soon as administratively practicable after shares of common stock are delivered in respect of the corresponding Performance Shares and cash is payable with respect to the Performance Units. There will be no reinvestment option or earned interest credits on any Dividend Equivalent.
 
 
Each Participant in the Mid-Term Program will be granted a number of Book Value Units determined by dividing (I) the sum of (a) 20% of the initial compensation value of the Participant's 2011 long-term incentive award (as determined before the allocation to the Mid-Term Program) and (b) 10% of the Participant's 2010 annual incentive award (which is payable in 2011), by (II) the Book Value Per Share of Common Stock. For the purpose of determining the number of Book Value Units to be granted to a Participant, the relevant period will be the fiscal quarter ended on or immediately before the Grant Date.
 
One-third of each Participant's Book Value Units will vest on each of the first three anniversaries of the Grant Date.
 
Subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan and subject to the Participant's continued Employment through the applicable BVU Payment Date, as soon as administratively practicable after the date any Book Value Units vest (but not later than the end of the calendar year in which the Book Value Units vest), a Participant will be paid an amount in cash equal to the product of (a) the number of Book Value Units that have become vested and (b) the Book Value Per Share as of the fiscal quarter ended on or immediately before the applicable BVU Payment Date, less any taxes or other deductions required by Applicable Law.
 
A Participant's outstanding Book Value Units will automatically be forfeited and cancelled on the termination of the Participant's Employment and no amount may thereafter be payable with respect to the Book Value Units, except in the specific circumstances set out in the table below:
 
 
 
 
 
The Compensation Committee, in its sole discretion, shall determine the Book Value Units, the Book Value Per Share, and any amount of payments thereof.
 
Notwithstanding any provisions in these Terms to the contrary, the Compensation Committee may, in its sole discretion, reduce (but not below zero) the account balance of any Participant under the Mid-Term Program if, in the opinion of the Compensation Committee, the Participant has engaged in conduct, or omitted taking appropriate action, which is a contributing factor in the material restatement of any annual Prudential consolidated income statement, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and as discussed with Prudential's Audit Committee, with such restatement being filed primarily to correct an error in the consolidated income statement. Any determination by the Compensation Committee regarding such a reduction shall be final, conclusive and binding on all parties.
 
Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Plan to the contrary, to the extent necessary to comply with the requirements of Code Section 409A and the final regulations issued under Section 409A with respect to any individual who is a "specified employee" within the meaning of Section 409A and the final regulations, on termination of the Participant's employment with any member of the Company Group, payment of any cash amount due may not be made before the date that is six (6) months after the date of such termination of Employment (or, if earlier, the date of the Participant's death). In addition, to the extent necessary to comply with the requirements of Code Section 409A and the final regulations issued under Section 409A, if an award of Book Value Units is treated as deferred compensation subject to such Code Section 409A, no distribution will be made (although vesting will accelerate to extent otherwise provided above) in respect of such award upon the occurrence of a Change of Control unless such event qualifies as a change in the ownership of a corporation, change in the effective control of a corporation or a change in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of a corporation within the meaning of such Code Section 409A and the final regulations issued thereunder.
 
A Participant granted Book Value Units will not be eligible to receive Dividend Equivalents on the Book Value Units.
