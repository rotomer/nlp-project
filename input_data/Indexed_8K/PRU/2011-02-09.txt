NEWARK, N.J. 
For the fourth quarter of 2010, net income for the Financial Services Businesses attributable to Prudential Financial, Inc. amounted to $213 million (45 cents per Common share) compared to
 
 
Page 3.
 
$1.788 billion ($3.78 per Common share) for the fourth quarter of 2009. After-tax adjusted operating income for the fourth quarter of 2010 for the Financial Services Businesses amounted to $861 million ($1.78 per Common share), compared to $557 million ($1.20 per Common share) for the fourth quarter of 2009.
"Our solid operating results for the fourth quarter and the year reflect sustained organic growth in our key U.S. retirement and international insurance businesses. Our commitment to these markets, coupled with solid value propositions and expanding distribution, has fueled our progress. We are pleased to have surpassed significant milestones in the past year including individual annuity account values over $100 billion and retirement account values over $200 billion, and we see continued growth opportunities in serving clients focused on financial security. Our acquisition of AIG Star Life and AIG Edison Life enhances our position as a leading foreign life insurer in Japan, and we look forward to building on our success in serving life insurance protection and retirement needs in the Japanese insurance market as we welcome over three million new clients to Prudential," said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John Strangfeld.
Adjusted operating income is not calculated under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Information regarding adjusted operating income, a non-GAAP measure, is discussed later in this press release under "Forward-Looking Statements and Non-GAAP Measures," and a reconciliation of adjusted operating income to the most comparable GAAP measure is provided in the tables that accompany this release.
Financial Services Businesses
Prudential Financial's Common Stock (NYSE:PRU) reflects the performance of its Financial Services Businesses, which consist of its U.S. Retirement Solutions and Investment Management, U.S. Individual Life and Group Insurance, and International Insurance and Investments divisions and its Corporate and Other operations.
In the following business-level discussion, adjusted operating income refers to pre-tax results.
The reported adjusted operating income of $624 million for the fourth quarter of 2010, compared to $323 million in the year-ago quarter.
U.S. Retirement Solutions and Investment Management division
 
 
Page 4.
 
The Individual Annuities segment reported adjusted operating income of $345 million in the current quarter, compared to $197 million in the year-ago quarter. Current quarter results benefited $46 million from a net reduction in amortization of deferred policy acquisition and other costs, and $100 million from net reductions in reserves for guaranteed minimum death and income benefits, reflecting an updated estimate of profitability for this business. Results for the year-ago quarter included a net benefit of $79 million from adjustment of these items to reflect an update of estimated profitability. These benefits to results for both the current quarter and the year-ago quarter were largely driven by increases in customer account values during the respective periods. Excluding the effect of the foregoing items, adjusted operating income for the Individual Annuities segment increased $81 million from the year-ago quarter, primarily reflecting higher asset-based fees due to growth in variable annuity account values.
The Retirement segment reported adjusted operating income of $147 million for the current quarter, compared to $132 million in the year-ago quarter. The increase resulted primarily from higher fees associated with growth in retirement account values.
The Asset Management segment reported adjusted operating income of $132 million for the current quarter, compared to a loss of $6 million in the year-ago quarter. The improvement came primarily from more favorable results from commercial mortgage activities. Current quarter results for the segment's commercial mortgage activities include net credit and valuation charges of approximately $10 million, compared to approximately $110 million for the year-ago quarter. The remainder of the improvement in results came mainly from higher asset management fees reflecting growth in assets under management.
The reported adjusted operating income of $200 million for the fourth quarter of 2010, compared to $210 million in the year-ago quarter.
U.S. Individual Life and Group Insurance division
The Individual Life segment reported adjusted operating income of $131 million for the current quarter, compared to $141 million in the year-ago quarter. Current quarter results reflected a smaller benefit from favorable mortality experience than that of the year-ago quarter. A greater contribution from investment results in the current quarter partially offset the impact of mortality experience on the comparison of results.
 
 
Page 5.
 
The Group Insurance segment reported adjusted operating income of $69 million in the current quarter, unchanged from the year-ago quarter. More favorable group life underwriting results in the current quarter were essentially offset by less favorable group disability underwriting results.
The reported adjusted operating income of $598 million for the fourth quarter of 2010, compared to $455 million in the year-ago quarter.
International Insurance and Investments division
The International Insurance segment reported adjusted operating income of $584 million for the current quarter, compared to $453 million in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted operating income of the segment's Life Planner insurance operations was $328 million for the current quarter, compared to $302 million in the year-ago quarter. The $26 million increase in adjusted operating income reflected continued business growth, accompanied by more favorable mortality experience in the current quarter. The segment's Gibraltar Life operations reported adjusted operating income of $256 million for the current quarter, compared to $151 million in the year-ago quarter. Gibraltar Life's current quarter results include a benefit of $66 million from the partial sale of an investment, through a consortium, in China Pacific Group. Excluding this item, adjusted operating income from Gibraltar Life increased $39 million. This increase came primarily from a greater contribution from investment results reflecting growth in fixed annuity balances, and from business growth reflecting expanding bank channel sales of protection life insurance products. Foreign currency exchange rates, including the impact of the Company's currency hedging programs, had a favorable impact of $5 million on results for the segment's international insurance businesses in comparison to the year-ago quarter, including $4 million within Gibraltar Life.
The International Investments segment reported adjusted operating income of $14 million for the current quarter, compared to $2 million in the year-ago quarter, reflecting more favorable results from the segment's global commodities operations.
resulted in a loss, on an adjusted operating income basis, of $231 million in the fourth quarter of 2010, compared to a loss of $220 million in the year-ago quarter. The increased loss reflected a higher level of expenses in the current quarter than the year ago quarter. The Company's real estate and relocation business reported losses of $2 million in the current quarter and $6 million in the year-ago quarter.
Corporate and Other operations
amounted to $784 billion at December 31, 2010, compared to $667 billion a year earlier.
Assets under management

of the Financial Services Businesses attributable to Prudential Financial, Inc. amounted to $213 million for the fourth quarter of 2010, compared to $1.788 billion in the year-ago quarter.
Net income
Current quarter net income includes $912 million of pre-tax net realized investment losses and related charges and adjustments. Net realized investment losses for the current quarter include net decreases in market value of derivatives primarily related to the Company's investment duration management and foreign currency hedging programs driven by changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, and other changes in value related to foreign currency exchange rates, amounting to $581 million. The foregoing net realized investment losses in the current quarter also include $211 million from products that contain embedded derivatives and associated derivative portfolios that are part of a hedging program related to the risks of these products, as well as mark-to-market of derivatives under a capital hedge program. Losses from impairments and sales of credit-impaired investments amounted to $161 million. The foregoing items were partially offset by net gains from general portfolio activities.
At December 31, 2010, gross unrealized losses on general account fixed maturity investments of the Financial Services Businesses amounted to $3.100 billion, including $2.256 billion on high and highest quality securities based on NAIC or equivalent ratings. Gross unrealized losses include $882 million related to asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages. Gross unrealized losses on general account fixed maturity investments of the Financial Services Businesses at December 31, 2010 include $1.548 billion of declines in value of 20% or more of amortized cost. Gross unrealized losses on general account fixed maturity investments of the Financial Services Businesses amounted to $4.389 billion at December 31, 2009. Net unrealized gains on general account fixed maturity investments of the Financial Services Businesses amounted to $5.726 billion at December 31, 2010, compared to $998 million at December 31, 2009.
Net income for the current quarter also reflects pre-tax decreases of $218 million in recorded asset values and $200 million in recorded liabilities representing changes in value which are expected to ultimately accrue to contractholders. These changes primarily represent interest rate related mark-to-market adjustments. Net income for the current quarter also includes $9 million of pre-tax losses from divested businesses.
 
 
Page 7.
 
Net income of the Financial Services Businesses for the year-ago quarter included pre-tax income of $2.162 billion from divested businesses, $49 million of pre-tax net realized investment losses and related charges and adjustments, and increases of $76 million in recorded assets and $49 million in recorded liabilities for which changes in value are expected to ultimately accrue to contractholders, in each case before income taxes. The income from divested businesses primarily reflected a pre-tax gain of $2.143 billion from the sale of the Company's interest in a retail securities joint venture with Wachovia, to Wells Fargo on December 31, 2009.
Closed Block Business
Prudential's Class B Stock, which is not traded on any exchange, reflects the performance of its Closed Block Business.
The Closed Block Business includes our in-force participating life insurance and annuity policies, and assets that are being used for the payment of benefits and policyholder dividends on these policies, as well as other assets and equity that support these policies. We have ceased offering these participating policies.
The Closed Block Business reported a loss from continuing operations before income taxes of $52 million for the fourth quarter of 2010, compared to income from continuing operations before income taxes of $92 million for the year-ago quarter.
The Closed Block Business reported a net loss attributable to Prudential Financial, Inc. of $36 million for the fourth quarter of 2010, compared to net income of $77 million for the year-ago quarter.
For the year ended December 31, 2010, the Closed Block Business reported income from continuing operations before income taxes of $725 million, compared to a loss from continuing operations before income taxes of $480 million for 2009. The Closed Block Business reported net income attributable to Prudential Financial, Inc. of $481 million for 2010, compared to a net loss of $287 million for 2009.

Prudential Financial, Inc. does not intend, and is under no obligation, to update any particular forward-looking statement included in this document.
Adjusted operating income is a non-GAAP measure of performance of our Financial Services Businesses. Adjusted operating income excludes "Realized investment gains (losses), net," as adjusted, and related charges and adjustments. A significant element of realized investment gains and losses are impairments and credit-related and interest rate-related gains and losses. Impairments and losses from sales of credit-impaired securities, the timing of which depends largely on market credit
 
 
Page 10.
 
cycles, can vary considerably across periods. The timing of other sales that would result in gains or losses, such as interest rate-related gains or losses, is largely subject to our discretion and influenced by market opportunities as well as our tax and capital profile.
Realized investment gains (losses) within certain of our businesses for which such gains (losses) are a principal source of earnings, and those associated with terminating hedges of foreign currency earnings and current period yield adjustments are included in adjusted operating income. Adjusted operating income excludes realized investment gains and losses from products that contain embedded derivatives, and from associated derivative portfolios that are part of a hedging program related to the risk of those products. Adjusted operating income also excludes gains and losses from changes in value of certain assets and liabilities related to foreign currency exchange movements that have been economically hedged, as well as gains and losses on certain investments that are classified as other trading account assets and debt that is carried at fair value.
Adjusted operating income also excludes investment gains and losses on trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities and changes in experience-rated contractholder liabilities due to asset value changes, because these recorded changes in asset and liability values are expected to ultimately accrue to contractholders. Trends in the underlying profitability of our businesses can be more clearly identified without the fluctuating effects of these transactions. In addition, adjusted operating income excludes the results of divested businesses, which are not relevant to our ongoing operations. Discontinued operations, which is presented as a separate component of net income under GAAP, is also excluded from adjusted operating income.
We believe that the presentation of adjusted operating income as we measure it for management purposes enhances understanding of the results of operations of the Financial Services Businesses by highlighting the results from ongoing operations and the underlying profitability of our businesses. However, adjusted operating income is not a substitute for income determined in accordance with GAAP, and the adjustments made to derive adjusted operating income are important to an understanding of our overall results of operations. The schedules accompanying this release provide a reconciliation of adjusted operating income for the Financial Services Businesses to income from continuing operations in accordance with GAAP.
The information referred to above, as well as the risks of our businesses described in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2010 and our Annual Report on

Realized investment gains (losses) within certain of our businesses for which such gains (losses) are a principal source of earnings, and those associated with terminating hedges of foreign currency earnings and current period yield adjustments are included in adjusted operating income. Adjusted operating income excludes realized investment gains and losses from products that contain embedded derivatives, and from associated derivative portfolios that are part of a hedging program related to the risk of those products.

The items above are important to an understanding of our overall results of operations.

KEY DEFINITIONS AND FORMULAS
1. Adjusted operating income before income taxes:
Adjusted operating income is a non-GAAP measure of performance of our Financial Services Businesses that excludes "Realized investment gains (losses), net", as adjusted, and related charges and adjustments; net investment gains and losses on trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities; change in experience-rated contractholder liabilities due to asset value changes; results of divested businesses and discontinued operations; earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests; and the related tax effects thereof. Adjusted operating income includes equity in earnings of operating joint ventures and the related tax effects thereof. Revenues and benefits and expenses shown as components of adjusted operating income, are presented on the same basis as pre-tax adjusted operating income and are adjusted for the items above as well.
Realized investment gains (losses) within certain of our businesses for which such gains (losses) are a principal source of earnings, and those associated with terminating hedges of foreign currency earnings and current period yield adjustments are included in adjusted operating income. Adjusted operating income excludes realized investment gains and losses from products that contain embedded derivatives, and from associated derivative portfolios that are part of a hedging program related to the risk of those products. Adjusted operating income also excludes gains and losses from changes in value of certain assets and liabilities relating to foreign currency exchange movements that have been economically hedged, as well as gains and losses on certain investments that are classified as other trading account assets and debt that is carried at fair value.
Adjusted operating income does not equate to "Income from continuing operations" as determined in accordance with GAAP but is the measure of profit or loss we use to evaluate segment performance. Adjusted operating income is not a substitute for income determined in accordance with GAAP, and our definition of adjusted operating income may differ from that used by other companies. The items above are important to an understanding of our overall results of operations. However, we believe that the presentation of adjusted operating income as we measure it for management purposes enhances the understanding of our results of operations by highlighting the results from ongoing operations and the underlying profitability factors of our businesses.
2. After-tax adjusted operating income:
Adjusted operating income before taxes, as defined above, less the income tax effect applicable to adjusted operating income before taxes.
3. Annualized New Business Premiums:
Premiums from new sales that are expected to be collected over a one year period. Group insurance annualized new business premiums exclude new premiums resulting from rate changes on existing policies, from additional coverage issued under our Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance contract, and from excess premiums on group universal life insurance that build cash value but do not purchase face amounts. Group insurance annualized new business premiums include premiums from the takeover of claim liabilities. Group disability amounts include long-term care products and dental products. Excess (unscheduled) and single premium business for the company's domestic individual life and international insurance operations are included in annualized new business premiums based on a 10% credit.
4. Assets Under Management:
Fair market value or account value of assets which Prudential manages directly in proprietary products, such as mutual funds and variable annuities, in separate accounts, wrap-fee products and the general account, and assets invested in investment options included in the Company's products that are managed by third party sub-managers (i.e., the non-proprietary investment options in the Company's products).
5. Attributed Equity:
Amount of capital assigned to each of the Company's segments for purposes of measuring segment adjusted operating income before income taxes, established at a level which management considers necessary to support the segment's risks.

KEY DEFINITIONS AND FORMULAS
11. Client Assets:
Fair market value of assets in client accounts of International brokerage operations, Prudential Bank and mortgage loan servicing business, that are not included in Assets Under Management. Prudential does not receive a management or administrative fee on these assets, but may receive a fee for executing trades, custody or recordkeeping services.
12. Earned Premiums:
The portion of a premium, net of any amount ceded, that represents coverage already provided or that belongs to the insurer based on the part of the policy period that has passed.
13. Earnings Per Share of Common Stock:
Net income (loss) for the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business is determined in accordance with GAAP and includes general and administrative expenses charged to each of the businesses based on the Company's methodology for the allocation of such expenses. Cash flows between the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business related to administrative expenses are determined by a policy servicing fee arrangement that is based upon insurance and policies in force and statutory cash premiums. To the extent reported administrative expenses vary from these cash flow amounts, the differences are recorded, on an after-tax basis, as direct equity adjustments to the equity balances of each business. The direct equity adjustments modify earnings available to holders of Common Stock and Class B Stock for earnings per share purposes. Earnings per share of Common Stock based on adjusted operating income (loss) of the Financial Services Businesses reflects these adjustments as well.
14. Full Service:
The Full Service line of business provides retirement plan products and services to public, private and not- for- profit organizations. This business provides recordkeeping, plan administration, actuarial advisory services, participant education and communication services, trustee services and institutional and retail investment funds. This business mainly services defined contribution and defined benefit plans; non-qualified plans are also serviced. For clients with both defined contribution and defined benefit plans, integrated recordkeeping services are available. For participants leaving these plans, a range of rollover products are provided through a broker-dealer bank.
15. Full Service Stable Value:
Our Full Service Stable Value products represent fixed rate options on investment funds offered to customers. These products contain an obligation to pay interest at a specified rate for a specific period of time. Upon termination these products repay account balances at market value immediately or may be liquidated at book value over time. Substantially all of these products are either fully or partially participating, with annual or semi-annual resets giving effect to previous investment experience. These products are issued through the general account, separate accounts or client-owned trusts. Profits from partially participating general account products result from the spread between the rate of return on investment assets and the interest rates credited to the customer, less expenses. For fully participating products, generally subject to a minimum interest rate guarantee, we earn fee income.
16. General Account:
Invested assets and policyholder liabilities and reserves for which the Company bears the investment risk. Excludes assets recognized for statutory purposes that are specifically allocated to a separate account. General account assets also include assets of the parent company, Prudential Financial, Inc.

Ratio of administrative operating expenses (excluding commissions) to gross premiums, policy charges and fee income.
19. Group Life Insurance and Group Disability Insurance Benefits Ratios:
Ratio of policyholder benefits to earned premiums, policy charges and fee income.
20. Individual Annuity Account Values in General Account and Separate Account:
Amounts represent the breakdown of invested customer funds in annuities either written or reinsured by the Company.
