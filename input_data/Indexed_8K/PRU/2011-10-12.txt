On October 11, 2011, the Board of Directors of Prudential Financial, Inc. (the "Company"), on the recommendation of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, approved certain adjustments in the compensation arrangements relating to the Company's named executive officers. These actions follow a review of the Company's executive compensation arrangements in relation to market and peer company practices. These actions are intended to better align the mix of compensation, including the balance between fixed and variable compensation elements, to market and competitive practices and to tie more of the compensation of the named executive officers to longer-term performance and risk outcomes.
As described below, these actions include (a) an increase in the salaries of the named executive officers, (b) a reduction in the annual incentive award opportunity of the named executive officers in respect of 2011 (before consideration of 2011 performance) to reflect, on a risk adjusted basis, such salary increases, and (c) an increase in the mandatory deferral rate on annual incentive awards into the Company's Mid-Term Incentive Program in respect of 2011 and subsequent years. The net effect of these actions is a slight reduction in the total direct compensation opportunity (.., salary plus annual incentive plus long-term grant) of the named executive officers in respect of 2011 (before consideration of 2011 performance).

The adjustments referred to above with respect to each of the Company's named executive officers are as follows:
 
John R. Strangfeld, Chief Executive Officer (from $1,000,000 to $1,400,000);
Mark B. Grier, Vice Chairman (from $850,000 to $1,190,000);
Richard J. Carbone, Chief Financial Officer (from $500,000 to $700,000);
Edward P. Baird, Chief Operating Officer, International Businesses (from $550,000 to $770,000); and
Charles F. Lowrey, Chief Operating Officer, U.S. Businesses (from $550,000 to $770,000).
 
 
As noted above, the net effect of these actions is a slight reduction in the total direct compensation opportunity of the named executive officers in respect of 2011 (before consideration of 2011 performance). In addition, as a result of the increase in the mandatory deferral rate on annual incentive awards, there is also a reduction in the current direct cash compensation opportunity (.., salary plus the non-deferred portion of the annual incentive) of the named executive officers in respect of 2011 and 2012 (before consideration of performance for such years).
