accounting firm that there is more than an insubstantial risk that the failure to eliminate such securities as a security or securities covered by clause (a) of Section 2 would result in a reduction of the Corporation's fully diluted EPS; (ii) the sole effect of such amendment or supplement is either (A) to impose additional restrictions on the ability of (1) the Corporation to redeem or purchase the Notes or (2) any Subsidiary to purchase the Notes, or (B) to impose additional restrictions on, or to eliminate certain of, the types of securities qualifying as a security or securities covered by clauses (a), (b) and (c) of Section 2 (other than securities which are covered by clause (i) above) and in each case an officer of the Corporation has delivered to the Holders of the then-effective series of Covered Debt in the manner provided for in the indenture, fiscal agency agreement or other instrument under which such Covered Debt was issued a written certificate to that effect; (iii) such amendment or supplement extends the date specified in Section 4(a)(i); or (iv) such amendment or supplement is not adverse to the Holders of the then-effective series of Covered Debt and an officer of the Corporation has delivered to the Holders of the then-effective series of Covered Debt in the manner provided for in the indenture, fiscal agency agreement or other instrument with respect to such Covered Debt a written certificate stating that, in his or her determination, such amendment or supplement is not adverse to the Holders of the then-effective series of Covered Debt. For this purpose, an amendment or supplement that adds new types of securities qualifying as a security or securities covered by clause (a), (b) or (c) of Section 2, or modifies the requirements of such securities, will not be deemed adverse to the Holders of the then-effective series of Covered Debt if, following such amendment or supplement, the Replacement Capital Covenant would satisfy the definition of Qualifying Replacement Capital Covenant.
(c) For purposes of Sections 4(a) and 4(b), the Holders whose consent or agreement is required to terminate, amend or supplement this Replacement Capital Covenant or the obligations of the Corporation under this Replacement Capital Covenant shall be the Holders of the then-effective series of Covered Debt as of a record date established by the Corporation that is not more than 30 days prior to the date on which the Corporation proposes that such termination, amendment or supplement becomes effective.
