Significant items included in current quarter adjusted operating income:
 
 
 
 
 
Prudential Financial, Inc. (NYSE:PRU) today reported a net loss for its Financial Services Businesses attributable to Prudential Financial, Inc. of $988 million ($2.09 per Common share) for the first quarter of 2012, compared to net income of $539 million ($1.10 per Common share) for the year-ago quarter. After-tax adjusted operating income for the Financial Services Businesses was $741 million ($1.56 per Common share) for the first quarter of 2012, compared to $800 million ($1.62 per Common share) for the year-ago quarter. Information regarding adjusted operating income, a non-GAAP measure, is provided below.
NEWARK, N.J. 
The Company acquired AIG Star Life Insurance Co., Ltd. and AIG Edison Life Insurance Company on February 1, 2011. Results of the Financial Services Businesses include the results of these businesses from the date of acquisition.

"While our results for the first quarter reflect fluctuations in claims experience, expense levels, and market-driven items, our business fundamentals remain solid and we are continuing to grow quality business and build our franchises in attractive markets. In our U.S. businesses, we reached record-high levels of annuity and retirement account values, driven by our solid value propositions and demonstrated commitment to clients, their advisors and our distribution partners. Assets under management in our Asset Management business also reached a record high, reflecting strong institutional and retail flows. Our International Insurance business continues to perform well, registering record-high sales for the quarter as we are benefiting from expanding distribution across multiple channels serving the protection and retirement markets. We are beginning to realize significant cost synergies, consistent with our targets, as the integration of the Star and Edison businesses remains on track," said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John Strangfeld.
Reported results for the first quarter of 2012 and earlier periods presented reflect the implementation of new accounting guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board relating to deferred policy acquisition costs as discussed under "New Accounting Guidance" later in this release.
Adjusted operating income is not calculated under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Information regarding adjusted operating income, a non-GAAP measure, is discussed later in this press release under "Forward-Looking Statements and Non-GAAP Measures," and a reconciliation of adjusted operating income to the most comparable GAAP measure is provided in the tables that accompany this release.
Financial Services Businesses
Prudential Financial's Common Stock (NYSE:PRU) reflects the performance of its Financial Services Businesses, which consist of its U.S. Retirement Solutions and Investment Management, U.S. Individual Life and Group Insurance, and International Insurance divisions and its Corporate and Other operations.
In the following business-level discussion, adjusted operating income refers to pre-tax results.
The reported adjusted operating income of $698 million for the first quarter of 2012, compared to $600 million in the year-ago quarter.
U.S. Retirement Solutions and Investment Management division

The Individual Annuities segment reported adjusted operating income of $421 million in the current quarter, compared to $274 million in the year-ago quarter. Current quarter results benefited $136 million from net reductions in reserves for guaranteed minimum death and income benefits, and $60 million from a net reduction in amortization of deferred policy acquisition and other costs, reflecting an updated estimate of profitability for this business. Results for the year-ago quarter included a net benefit of $58 million from adjustment of these items to reflect an update of estimated profitability. These benefits to results for both the current quarter and the year-ago quarter were largely driven by increases in market value of customer accounts during the respective periods. Excluding the effect of the foregoing items, adjusted operating income for the Individual Annuities segment increased $9 million from the year-ago quarter. This increase reflected higher asset-based fees due to growth in variable annuity account values, net of an increased level of related amortization of deferred policy acquisition and other costs in the current quarter. The net benefit from higher asset-based fees was partly offset by higher expenses in the current quarter.
The Retirement segment reported adjusted operating income of $156 million for the current quarter, compared to $172 million in the year-ago quarter. The decrease reflected a lower contribution from investment results. The net benefit to current quarter results from higher fees associated with growth in account values was offset by less favorable case experience on traditional retirement business.
The Asset Management segment reported adjusted operating income of $121 million for the current quarter, compared to $154 million in the year-ago quarter. The decrease reflected an approximately $35 million lower contribution from the segment's incentive, transaction, strategic investing and commercial mortgage activities, which benefited in the year-ago quarter from net gains on sales of foreclosed properties and more favorable strategic investing results. The lower contribution from these segment activities, together with higher expenses in the current quarter, more than offset the benefit from higher asset management fees reflecting growth in assets under management.
The reported adjusted operating income of $74 million for the first quarter of 2012, compared to $137 million in the year-ago quarter.
U.S. Individual Life and Group Insurance division
 
Page 5 ..
 
The Individual Life segment reported adjusted operating income of $112 million for the current quarter, compared to $98 million in the year-ago quarter. The increase reflected improved mortality experience in comparison to the year-ago quarter.
The Group Insurance segment reported a loss, on an adjusted operating income basis, of $38 million in the current quarter, compared to adjusted operating income of $39 million in the year-ago quarter. The decrease reflected an adverse fluctuation in group life claims experience, less favorable group disability claims experience than that of the year-ago quarter, and higher expenses in the current quarter.
The reported adjusted operating income of $606 million for the first quarter of 2012, compared to $628 million in the year-ago quarter.
International Insurance segment
Adjusted operating income of the segment's Life Planner insurance operations was $382 million for the current quarter, compared to $300 million in the year-ago quarter. Results for the year-ago quarter included a $19 million charge for the estimated impact of claims associated with the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami disaster in Japan. Excluding this charge, adjusted operating income increased $63 million from the year-ago quarter. This increase reflected continued business growth, a more favorable level of policy benefits in the current quarter, and a favorable impact of $12 million in comparison to the year-ago quarter from foreign currency exchange rates including the impact of the Company's currency hedging programs.
The segment's Gibraltar Life and Other operations reported adjusted operating income of $224 million for the current quarter, compared to $328 million in the year-ago quarter. Results for the current quarter reflect absorption of $57 million of integration costs related to the Star and Edison businesses acquired on February 1, 2011. Results for the year-ago quarter include charges of $47 million for transaction and integration costs related to the acquisition, and a benefit of $153 million from the partial sale of an investment, through a consortium, in China Pacific Group. Excluding these items, adjusted operating income increased $59 million from the year-ago quarter. This increase reflected business growth across all channels, including a full quarter contribution from the acquired businesses which were merged into Gibraltar effective January 1, 2012, and approximately $30 million of cost savings resulting from business integration synergies. The year-ago quarter reflected the initial month of operations of the acquired businesses. A less favorable level of policy benefits in the current quarter partly offset the impact of business growth and cost

savings. Current quarter results also benefited $10 million in comparison to the year-ago quarter from foreign currency exchange rates including the impact of the Company's currency hedging programs.
resulted in a loss, on an adjusted operating income basis, of $363 million in the first quarter of 2012, compared to a loss of $269 million in the year-ago quarter. The increased loss was primarily driven by interest expense, net of investment income, reflecting a greater level of capital debt in the current quarter, and by higher expenses.
Corporate and Other operations
amounted to $943 billion at March 31, 2012, compared to $901 billion at December 31, 2011, and $859 billion at March 31, 2011.
Assets under management
Theof the Financial Services Businesses attributable to Prudential Financial, Inc. amounted to $988 million for the first quarter of 2012, compared to net income of $539 million in the year-ago quarter.
net loss
The current quarter net loss includes $1.838 billion of pre-tax net realized investment losses and related charges and adjustments. The foregoing net loss includes pre-tax charges of $1.491 billion representing net changes in value relating to foreign currency exchange rates and changes in market value of derivatives primarily resulting from weakening of the Japanese yen in relation to the U.S. dollar and other currencies. These currency-driven value changes were largely offset by corresponding adjustments to accumulated other comprehensive income which are not reflected in net income or loss. Net realized investment losses for the current quarter include net losses of $291 million from products that contain embedded derivatives and associated derivative portfolios that are part of a hedging program related to the risks of these products as well as mark-to-market of derivatives under a capital hedge program. Net realized investment losses also include losses from impairments and sales of credit-impaired investments amounting to $128 million.
At March 31, 2012, gross unrealized losses on general account fixed maturity investments of the Financial Services Businesses amounted to $2.664 billion, including $1.827 billion on high and highest quality securities based on NAIC or equivalent ratings. Gross unrealized losses include $794 million related to asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages. Gross unrealized losses on general account fixed maturity investments of the Financial Services Businesses at March 31, 2012 include $1.607 billion of declines in value of 20% or more of amortized cost. Gross unrealized losses on general account fixed maturity investments of the
 
Page 7 ..
 
Financial Services Businesses amounted to $4.256 billion at December 31, 2011. Net unrealized gains on general account fixed maturity investments of the Financial Services Businesses amounted to $12.960 billion at March 31, 2012, compared to $10.493 billion at December 31, 2011.
The net loss for the current quarter also reflects pre-tax increases of $234 million in recorded asset values and $246 million in recorded liabilities representing changes in value which are expected to ultimately accrue to contractholders. These changes primarily represent interest rate related mark-to-market adjustments.
Net income of the Financial Services Businesses for the year-ago quarter included $375 million of pre-tax net realized investment losses and related charges and adjustments, decreases of $17 million in recorded assets and $34 million in recorded liabilities for which changes in value are expected to ultimately accrue to contractholders, and pre-tax losses of $9 million from divested businesses, in each case before income taxes.
Closed Block Business
Prudential's Class B Stock, which is not traded on any exchange, reflects the performance of its Closed Block Business.
The Closed Block Business includes our in-force participating life insurance and annuity policies, and assets that are being used for the payment of benefits and policyholder dividends on these policies, as well as other assets and equity that support these policies. We have ceased offering these participating policies.
The Closed Block Business reported income from continuing operations before income taxes of $30 million for the first quarter of 2012, compared to $32 million for the year-ago quarter.
The Closed Block Business reported net income attributable to Prudential Financial, Inc. of $21 million for the first quarter of 2012 and $22 million for the year-ago quarter.
Consolidated Results
There is no legal separation of the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business, and holders of the Common Stock and the Class B Stock are both common stockholders of Prudential Financial, Inc.
 
Page 8 ..
 
On a consolidated basis, which includes the results of both the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business, Prudential Financial, Inc. reported a net loss attributable to Prudential Financial, Inc. of $967 million for the first quarter of 2012 compared to net income of $561 million for the year-ago quarter.
New Accounting Guidance
In October 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued authoritative guidance regarding the interpretation of which costs relating to the acquisition of new or renewal insurance contracts qualify for deferral. Under the amended guidance, acquisition costs are to include only those costs that are directly related to the acquisition or renewal of insurance contracts by applying a model similar to the accounting for loan origination costs. An entity may defer incremental direct costs of contract acquisition with independent third parties or employees that are essential to the contract transaction, as well as the portion of employee compensation, including payroll fringe benefits, and certain other costs directly related to successfully negotiated contracts. The Company adopted this guidance effective January 1, 2012 and applied the retrospective method of adoption. The retrospective adoption of this guidance resulted, for the first quarter of 2011, in decreases of $66 million and $50 million to pretax adjusted operating income and net income of the Financial Services Businesses attributable to Prudential Financial, Inc., respectively; increases of $5 million and $3 million to income from continuing operations before income taxes and net income of the Closed Block Business, respectively; and a decrease of $47 million to net income attributable to Prudential Financial, Inc. on a consolidated basis. As a result of the retrospective adoption of this guidance, attributed equity as of December 31, 2011 was reduced by $2.8 billion, or $5.97 per Common share, for the Financial Services Businesses and by $0.2 billion, or $68.50 per share of Class B Stock, for the Closed Block Business.
Share Repurchases
During the first quarter of 2012, the Company acquired 4.0 million shares of its Common Stock at a total cost of $250 million, for an average price of $62.17 per share. From the commencement of repurchases in July 2011, through March 31, 2012, the Company acquired 23.8 million shares of its Common Stock at a total cost of $1.25 billion, for an average price of $52.50
 
Page 9 ..
 
per share. These repurchases were under an authorization by Prudential's Board of Directors in June 2011 to repurchase at management's discretion up to $1.5 billion of the Company's outstanding Common Stock through June 2012.

Prudential Financial, Inc. does not intend, and is under no obligation, to update any particular forward-looking statement included in this document.
Adjusted operating income is a non-GAAP measure of performance of our Financial Services Businesses. Adjusted operating income excludes "Realized investment gains (losses), net," as adjusted, and related charges and adjustments. A significant element of realized investment gains and losses are impairments and credit-related and interest rate-related gains and losses. Impairments and losses from sales of credit-impaired securities, the timing of which depends largely on market credit cycles, can vary considerably across periods. The timing of other sales that would result in gains or losses, such as interest rate-related gains or losses, is largely subject to our discretion and influenced by market opportunities as well as our tax and capital profile.
 
Page 11 ..
 
Realized investment gains (losses) within certain of our businesses for which such gains (losses) are a principal source of earnings, and those associated with terminating hedges of foreign currency earnings and current period yield adjustments are included in adjusted operating income. Adjusted operating income excludes realized investment gains and losses from products that contain embedded derivatives, and from associated derivative portfolios that are part of a hedging program related to the risk of those products. Adjusted operating income also excludes gains and losses from changes in value of certain assets and liabilities relating to foreign currency exchange movements that have been economically hedged or considered part of our capital funding strategies for our international subsidiaries, as well as gains and losses on certain investments that are classified as other trading account assets.
Adjusted operating income also excludes investment gains and losses on trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities and changes in experience-rated contractholder liabilities due to asset value changes, because these recorded changes in asset and liability values are expected to ultimately accrue to contractholders. Trends in the underlying profitability of our businesses can be more clearly identified without the fluctuating effects of these transactions. In addition, adjusted operating income excludes the results of divested businesses, which are not relevant to our ongoing operations. Discontinued operations, which is presented as a separate component of net income under GAAP, is also excluded from adjusted operating income.
We believe that the presentation of adjusted operating income as we measure it for management purposes enhances understanding of the results of operations of the Financial Services Businesses by highlighting the results from ongoing operations and the underlying profitability of our businesses. However, adjusted operating income is not a substitute for income determined in accordance with GAAP, and the adjustments made to derive adjusted operating income are important to an understanding of our overall results of operations. The schedules accompanying this release provide a reconciliation of adjusted operating income for the Financial Services Businesses to income from continuing operations in accordance with GAAP.
The information referred to above, as well as the risks of our businesses described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011, should be considered by

Realized investment gains (losses) within certain of our businesses for which such gains (losses) are a principal source of earnings, and those associated with terminating hedges of foreign currency earnings and current period yield adjustments are included in adjusted operating income. Adjusted operating income excludes realized investment gains and losses from products that contain embedded derivatives, and from associated derivative portfolios that are part of a hedging program related to the risk of those products.

Adjusted operating income does not equate to "Income from continuing operations" as determined in accordance with GAAP but is the measure of profit or loss we use to evaluate segment performance. Adjusted operating income is not a substitute for income determined in accordance with GAAP, and our definition of adjusted operating income may differ from that used by other companies. The items above are important to an understanding of our overall results of operations. However, we believe that the presentation of adjusted operating income as we measure it for management purposes enhances the understanding of our results of operations by highlighting the results from ongoing operations and the underlying profitability factors of our businesses.

1. Adjusted operating income before income taxes:
Adjusted operating income is a non-GAAP measure of performance of our Financial Services Businesses that excludes "Realized investment gains (losses), net", as adjusted, and related charges and adjustments; net investment gains and losses on trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities; change in experience-rated contractholder liabilities due to asset value changes; results of divested businesses and discontinued operations; earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests; and the related tax effects thereof. Adjusted operating income includes equity in earnings of operating joint ventures and the related tax effects thereof. Revenues and benefits and expenses shown as components of adjusted operating income, are presented on the same basis as pre-tax adjusted operating income and are adjusted for the items above as well.
Realized investment gains (losses) within certain of our businesses for which such gains (losses) are a principal source of earnings, and those associated with terminating hedges of foreign currency earnings and current period yield adjustments are included in adjusted operating income. Adjusted operating income excludes realized investment gains and losses from products that contain embedded derivatives, and from associated derivative portfolios that are part of a hedging program related to the risk of those products. Adjusted operating income also excludes gains and losses from changes in value of certain assets and liabilities relating to foreign currency exchange movements that have been economically hedged or considered part of our capital funding strategies for our international subsidiaries, as well as gains and losses on certain investments that are classified as other trading account assets.
Adjusted operating income does not equate to "Income from continuing operations" as determined in accordance with GAAP but is the measure of profit or loss we use to evaluate segment performance. Adjusted operating income is not a substitute for income determined in accordance with GAAP, and our definition of adjusted operating income may differ from that used by other companies. The items above are important to an understanding of our overall results of operations. However, we believe that the presentation of adjusted operating income as we measure it for management purposes enhances the understanding of our results of operations by highlighting the results from ongoing operations and the underlying profitability factors of our businesses.
2. After-tax adjusted operating income:
Adjusted operating income before taxes, as defined above, less the income tax effect applicable to adjusted operating income before taxes.
3. Annualized New Business Premiums:
Premiums from new sales that are expected to be collected over a one year period. Group insurance annualized new business premiums exclude new premiums resulting from rate changes on existing policies, from additional coverage issued under our Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance contract, and from excess premiums on group universal life insurance that build cash value but do not purchase face amounts. Group insurance annualized new business premiums include premiums from the takeover of claim liabilities. Group disability amounts include long-term care products and dental products. Excess (unscheduled) and single premium business for the company's domestic individual life and international insurance operations are included in annualized new business premiums based on a 10% credit.
4. Assets Under Management:
Fair market value or account value of assets which Prudential manages directly in proprietary products, such as mutual funds and variable annuities, in separate accounts, wrap-fee products and the general account, and assets invested in investment options included in the Company's products that are managed by third party sub-managers (i.e., the non-proprietary investment options in the Company's products).
5. Attributed Equity:
Amount of capital assigned to each of the Company's segments for purposes of measuring segment adjusted operating income before income taxes, established at a level which management considers necessary to support the segment's risks. Attributed equity for the Financial Services Businesses represents all of the Company's equity that is not included in the Closed Block Business or attributable to noncontrolling interests.
6. Book value per share of Common Stock:
Equity attributed to Financial Services Businesses divided by the number of Common shares outstanding at end of period, on a diluted basis.
7. Borrowings - Capital Debt:

10. Borrowings - Specified Other Businesses:

11. Client Assets:
Fair market value of assets in client accounts of International brokerage operations, Prudential Bank and mortgage loan servicing business, that are not included in Assets Under Management. Prudential does not receive a management or administrative fee on these assets, but may receive a fee for executing trades, custody or recordkeeping services.
12. Earned Premiums:
The portion of a premium, net of any amount ceded, that represents coverage already provided or that belongs to the insurer based on the part of the policy period that has passed.
13. Earnings Per Share of Common Stock:
Net income (loss) for the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business is determined in accordance with GAAP and includes general and administrative expenses charged to each of the businesses based on the Company's methodology for the allocation of such expenses. Cash flows between the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business related to administrative expenses are determined by a policy servicing fee arrangement that is based upon insurance and policies in force and statutory cash premiums. To the extent reported administrative expenses vary from these cash flow amounts, the differences are recorded, on an after-tax basis, as direct equity adjustments to the equity balances of each business. The direct equity adjustments modify earnings available to holders of Common Stock and Class B Stock for earnings per share purposes. Earnings per share of Common Stock based on adjusted operating income (loss) of the Financial Services Businesses reflects these adjustments as well.
14. Full Service:

15. Full Service Stable Value:
Our Full Service Stable Value products represent fixed rate options on investment funds offered to customers. These products contain an obligation to pay interest at a specified rate for a specific period of time. Upon termination these products repay account balances at market value immediately or may be liquidated at book value over time. Substantially all of these products are either fully or partially participating, with annual or semi-annual resets giving effect to previous investment experience. These products are issued through the general account, separate accounts or client-owned trusts. Profits from partially participating general account products result from the spread between the rate of return on investment assets and the interest rates credited to the customer, less expenses. For fully participating products, generally subject to a minimum interest rate guarantee, we earn fee income.
