For the first half of 2012, net income for the Financial Services Businesses attributed to Prudential Financial, Inc. amounted to $1.215 billion ($2.58 per Common share) compared to $1.318 billion ($2.68 per Common share) for the first half of 2011. First half 2012 after-tax adjusted operating income for the Financial Services Businesses amounted to $1.368 billion ($2.90 per Common share) compared to $1.573 billion ($3.19 per Common share) for the first half of 2011.
The Company acquired AIG Star Life Insurance Co., Ltd. and AIG Edison Life Insurance Company on February 1, 2011. Results of the Financial Services Businesses include the results of these businesses from the date of acquisition.
"While challenging market conditions and unfavorable claims fluctuations affected second quarter results, underlying performance remains solid in each of our divisions. In our U.S. businesses, our attractive value propositions and commitment to our clients and distribution partners continue to drive strong sales and flows, especially in our retirement businesses where our leadership position was enhanced by our recent announcement of a major ground breaking pension risk transfer transaction. Our international businesses continue to perform well, with exceptional sales and earnings in the second quarter. We are continuing to grow our franchise through protection and retirement products with strong appeal to our clients and through expanding distribution. Our balanced mix of businesses and risks mitigates our exposure to market developments, and we remain confident in our ability to achieve our long term objectives," said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John Strangfeld.
Adjusted operating income is not calculated under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Information regarding adjusted operating income, a non-GAAP measure, is discussed later in this press release under "Forward-Looking Statements and Non-GAAP Measures," and a reconciliation of adjusted operating income to the most comparable GAAP measure is provided in the tables that accompany this release.

Financial Services Businesses
Prudential Financial's Common Stock (NYSE:PRU) reflects the performance of its Financial Services Businesses, which consist of its U.S. Retirement Solutions and Investment Management, U.S. Individual Life and Group Insurance, and International Insurance divisions and its Corporate and Other operations.
In the following business-level discussion, adjusted operating income refers to pre-tax results.
The reported adjusted operating income of $302 million for the second quarter of 2012, compared to $605 million in the year-ago quarter.
U.S. Retirement Solutions and Investment Management division
The Individual Annuities segment reported adjusted operating income of $107 million in the current quarter, compared to $207 million in the year-ago quarter. Current quarter results include charges of $90 million to strengthen reserves for guaranteed minimum death and income benefits, and $34 million representing a net increase in amortization of deferred policy acquisition and other costs, reflecting an updated estimate of profitability for this business. Results for the year-ago quarter included a net charge of $35 million from adjustment of these items to reflect an update of estimated profitability. These charges, for both the current quarter and the year-ago quarter, were largely driven by the impact of market performance on customer account values relative to our assumptions. Excluding the effect of the foregoing items, adjusted operating income for the Individual Annuities segment decreased $11 million from the year-ago quarter. The benefit of higher asset-based fees compared to the year-ago quarter due to growth in variable annuity account values, net of an increased level of related amortization of deferred policy acquisition and other costs, was more than offset by higher expenses in the current quarter.
The Retirement segment reported adjusted operating income of $147 million for the current quarter, compared to $171 million in the year-ago quarter. The decrease reflected a lower contribution from investment results and higher expenses in the current quarter, including costs of $9 million associated with the decision to restructure the Company's savings and loan association to a trust-only organization.
 
Page 5 ..
 
The Asset Management segment reported adjusted operating income of $48 million for the current quarter, compared to $227 million in the year-ago quarter. The decrease reflected a decline of approximately $175 million from results of the segment's incentive, transaction, strategic investing and commercial mortgage activities, which included a $75 million charge in the current quarter for an impairment related to our investment in a real estate fund and benefited in the year-ago quarter from a $61 million gain from the sale of a portion of a real estate seed investment. The lower contribution from these segment activities, together with higher expenses in the current quarter, more than offset the benefit from higher asset management fees reflecting growth in assets under management.
The reported adjusted operating income of $107 million for the second quarter of 2012, compared to $184 million in the year-ago quarter.
U.S. Individual Life and Group Insurance division
The Individual Life segment reported adjusted operating income of $61 million for the current quarter, compared to $135 million in the year-ago quarter. The decrease reflected an adverse fluctuation in mortality experience driven by several large current quarter claims from seasoned vintages of business.
The Group Insurance segment reported adjusted operating income of $46 million in the current quarter, compared to $49 million in the year-ago quarter. Higher current quarter expenses, including updates of premium tax estimates, more than offset the benefit from more favorable group life claims experience than that of the year-ago quarter.
The reported adjusted operating income of $681 million for the second quarter of 2012, compared to $500 million in the year-ago quarter.
International Insurance segment
Adjusted operating income of the segment's Life Planner insurance operations was $374 million for the current quarter, compared to $315 million in the year-ago quarter. The increase reflected continued business growth and a favorable impact of $15 million in comparison to the year-ago quarter from foreign currency exchange rates including the impact of the Company's currency hedging programs.
The segment's Gibraltar Life and Other operations reported adjusted operating income of $307 million for the current quarter, compared to $185 million in the year-ago quarter. Results for
 
Page 6 ..
 
the current quarter reflect absorption of $38 million of integration costs related to the Star and Edison businesses acquired on February 1, 2011. Results for the year-ago quarter include charges of $29 million for integration costs related to the acquisition, and a charge of $56 million for the estimated impact of claims and expenses associated with the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami disaster in Japan which was included in second quarter results because Gibraltar Life is included in the Company's reported results on a one month lag basis. Excluding these items, adjusted operating income increased $75 million from the year-ago quarter. This increase reflected business growth across all channels, and approximately $40 million of cost savings resulting from business integration synergies compared to approximately $5 million in the year-ago quarter. Current quarter results also benefited $12 million in comparison to the year-ago quarter from foreign currency exchange rates including the impact of the Company's currency hedging programs.
resulted in a loss, on an adjusted operating income basis, of $261 million in the second quarter of 2012, compared to a loss of $237 million in the year-ago quarter. The increased loss was primarily driven by greater interest expense, net of investment income.
Corporate and Other operations
amounted to $961 billion at June 30, 2012, compared to $901 billion at December 31, 2011, and $883 billion at June 30, 2011.
Assets under management
of the Financial Services Businesses attributable to Prudential Financial, Inc. amounted to $2.203 billion for the second quarter of 2012, compared to $779 million in the year-ago quarter.
Net income
Current quarter net income includes $2.030 billion of pre-tax net realized investment gains and related charges and adjustments. The foregoing net income includes pre-tax gains of $1.864 billion representing net changes in value relating to foreign currency exchange rates and changes in market value of derivatives primarily resulting from strengthening of the Japanese yen in relation to the U.S. dollar and other currencies. These currency-driven value changes were largely offset by corresponding adjustments to accumulated other comprehensive income which are not reflected in net income or loss. Net realized investment gains for the current quarter include net gains of $259 million from products that contain embedded derivatives and associated derivative
 
Page 7 ..
 
portfolios that are part of a hedging program related to the risks of these products as well as mark-to-market of derivatives under a capital hedge program. Net realized investment gains also reflect losses from impairments and sales of credit-impaired investments amounting to $117 million.
At June 30, 2012, gross unrealized losses on general account fixed maturity investments of the Financial Services Businesses amounted to $3.061 billion, including $2.232 billion on high and highest quality securities based on NAIC or equivalent ratings. Gross unrealized losses include $735 million related to asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages. Gross unrealized losses on general account fixed maturity investments of the Financial Services Businesses at June 30, 2012 include $1.751 billion of declines in value of 20% or more of amortized cost. Gross unrealized losses on general account fixed maturity investments of the Financial Services Businesses amounted to $4.256 billion at December 31, 2011. Net unrealized gains on general account fixed maturity investments of the Financial Services Businesses amounted to $14.764 billion at June 30, 2012, compared to $10.493 billion at December 31, 2011.
Net income for the current quarter also reflects pre-tax increases of $4 million in recorded asset values and pre-tax decreases of $54 million in recorded liabilities representing changes in value which are expected to ultimately accrue to contractholders. These changes primarily represent interest rate related mark-to-market adjustments. Net income for the current quarter also includes $9 million of pre-tax income from divested businesses.
Net income of the Financial Services Businesses for the year-ago quarter included $1 million of pre-tax net realized investment gains and related charges and adjustments, and increases of $177 million in recorded assets and $178 million in recorded liabilities for which changes in value are expected to ultimately accrue to contractholders, in each case before income taxes.
Closed Block Business
Prudential's Class B Stock, which is not traded on any exchange, reflects the performance of its Closed Block Business.
The Closed Block Business includes our in-force participating life insurance and annuity policies, and assets that are being used for the payment of benefits and policyholder dividends on these policies, as well as other assets and equity that support these policies. We have ceased offering these participating policies.
 
Page 8 ..
 
The Closed Block Business reported a loss from continuing operations before income taxes of $2 million for the second quarter of 2012, compared to pre-tax income from continuing operations of $13 million for the year-ago quarter.
The Closed Block Business reported a net loss attributable to Prudential Financial, Inc. of $5 million for the second quarter of 2012, compared to net income of $10 million for the year-ago quarter.
For the first half of 2012, the Closed Block Business reported income from continuing operations before income taxes of $28 million, compared to $45 million for the first half of 2011. The Closed Block Business reported net income attributable to Prudential Financial, Inc. of $16 million for the first half of 2012, compared to $32 million for the first half of 2011.
Consolidated Results
There is no legal separation of the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business, and holders of the Common Stock and the Class B Stock are both common stockholders of Prudential Financial, Inc.
On a consolidated basis, which includes the results of both the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business, Prudential Financial, Inc. reported net income attributable to Prudential Financial, Inc. of $2.198 billion for the second quarter of 2012 compared to $789 million for the year-ago quarter, and reported net income attributable to Prudential Financial, Inc. of $1.231 billion for the first half of 2012 and $1.350 billion for the first half of 2011.

Prudential Financial, Inc. does not intend, and is under no obligation, to update any particular forward-looking statement included in this document.
Adjusted operating income is a non-GAAP measure of performance of our Financial Services Businesses. Adjusted operating income excludes "Realized investment gains (losses), net," as adjusted, and related charges and adjustments. A significant element of realized investment gains and losses are impairments and credit-related and interest rate-related gains and losses.
 
Page 11 ..
 
Impairments and losses from sales of credit-impaired securities, the timing of which depends largely on market credit cycles, can vary considerably across periods. The timing of other sales that would result in gains or losses, such as interest rate-related gains or losses, is largely subject to our discretion and influenced by market opportunities as well as our tax and capital profile.
Realized investment gains (losses) within certain of our businesses for which such gains (losses) are a principal source of earnings, and those associated with terminating hedges of foreign currency earnings and current period yield adjustments are included in adjusted operating income. Adjusted operating income excludes realized investment gains and losses from products that contain embedded derivatives, and from associated derivative portfolios that are part of a hedging program related to the risk of those products. Adjusted operating income also excludes gains and losses from changes in value of certain assets and liabilities relating to foreign currency exchange movements that have been economically hedged or considered part of our capital funding strategies for our international subsidiaries, as well as gains and losses on certain investments that are classified as other trading account assets.
Adjusted operating income also excludes investment gains and losses on trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities and changes in experience-rated contractholder liabilities due to asset value changes, because these recorded changes in asset and liability values are expected to ultimately accrue to contractholders. Trends in the underlying profitability of our businesses can be more clearly identified without the fluctuating effects of these transactions. In addition, adjusted operating income excludes the results of divested businesses, which are not relevant to our ongoing operations. Discontinued operations, which is presented as a separate component of net income under GAAP, is also excluded from adjusted operating income.
We believe that the presentation of adjusted operating income as we measure it for management purposes enhances understanding of the results of operations of the Financial Services Businesses by highlighting the results from ongoing operations and the underlying profitability of our businesses. However, adjusted operating income is not a substitute for income determined in accordance with GAAP, and the adjustments made to derive adjusted operating income are important to an understanding of our overall results of operations. The schedules accompanying this release provide a reconciliation of adjusted operating income for the Financial Services Businesses to income from continuing operations in accordance with GAAP.

KEY DEFINITIONS AND FORMULAS
1. Adjusted operating income before income taxes:
Adjusted operating income is a non-GAAP measure of performance of our Financial Services Businesses that excludes "Realized investment gains (losses), net", as adjusted, and related charges and adjustments; net investment gains and losses on trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities; change in experience-rated contractholder liabilities due to asset value changes; results of divested businesses and discontinued operations; earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests; and the related tax effects thereof. Adjusted operating income includes equity in earnings of operating joint ventures and the related tax effects thereof. Revenues and benefits and expenses shown as components of adjusted operating income, are presented on the same basis as pre-tax adjusted operating income and are adjusted for the items above as well.
Realized investment gains (losses) within certain of our businesses for which such gains (losses) are a principal source of earnings, and those associated with terminating hedges of foreign currency earnings and current period yield adjustments are included in adjusted operating income. Adjusted operating income excludes realized investment gains and losses from products that contain embedded derivatives, and from associated derivative portfolios that are part of a hedging program related to the risk of those products. Adjusted operating income also excludes gains and losses from changes in value of certain assets and liabilities relating to foreign currency exchange movements that have been economically hedged or considered part of our capital funding strategies for our international subsidiaries, as well as gains and losses on certain investments that are classified as other trading account assets.
Adjusted operating income does not equate to "Income from continuing operations" as determined in accordance with GAAP but is the measure of profit or loss we use to evaluate segment performance. Adjusted operating income is not a substitute for income determined in accordance with GAAP, and our definition of adjusted operating income may differ from that used by other companies. The items above are important to an understanding of our overall results of operations. However, we believe that the presentation of adjusted operating income as we measure it for management purposes enhances the understanding of our results of operations by highlighting the results from ongoing operations and the underlying profitability factors of our businesses.
2. After-tax adjusted operating income:
Adjusted operating income before taxes, as defined above, less the income tax effect applicable to adjusted operating income before taxes.
3. Annualized New Business Premiums:
Premiums from new sales that are expected to be collected over a one year period. Group insurance annualized new business premiums exclude new premiums resulting from rate changes on existing policies, from additional coverage issued under our Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance contract, and from excess premiums on group universal life insurance that build cash value but do not purchase face amounts. Group insurance annualized new business premiums include premiums from the takeover of claim liabilities. Group disability amounts include long-term care products and dental products. Excess (unscheduled) and single premium business for the company's domestic individual life and international insurance operations are included in annualized new business premiums based on a 10% credit.
4. Assets Under Management:
Fair market value or account value of assets which Prudential manages directly in proprietary products, such as mutual funds and variable annuities, in separate accounts, wrap-fee products and the general account, and assets invested in investment options included in the Company's products that are managed by third party sub-managers (i.e., the non-proprietary investment options in the Company's products).
5. Attributed Equity:
Amount of capital assigned to each of the Company's segments for purposes of measuring segment adjusted operating income before income taxes, established at a level which management considers necessary to support the segment's risks. Attributed equity for the Financial Services Businesses represents all of the Company's equity that is not included in the Closed Block Business or attributable to noncontrolling interests.

KEY DEFINITIONS AND FORMULAS
11. Client Assets:
Fair market value of assets in client accounts of International brokerage operations, Prudential Bank and mortgage loan servicing business, that are not included in Assets Under Management. Prudential does not receive a management or administrative fee on these assets, but may receive a fee for executing trades, custody or recordkeeping services.
12. Earned Premiums:
The portion of a premium, net of any amount ceded, that represents coverage already provided or that belongs to the insurer based on the part of the policy period that has passed.
13. Earnings Per Share of Common Stock:
Net income (loss) for the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business is determined in accordance with GAAP and includes general and administrative expenses charged to each of the businesses based on the Company's methodology for the allocation of such expenses. Cash flows between the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business related to administrative expenses are determined by a policy servicing fee arrangement that is based upon insurance and policies in force and statutory cash premiums. To the extent reported administrative expenses vary from these cash flow amounts, the differences are recorded, on an after-tax basis, as direct equity adjustments to the equity balances of each business. The direct equity adjustments modify earnings available to holders of Common Stock and Class B Stock for earnings per share purposes. Earnings per share of Common Stock based on adjusted operating income (loss) of the Financial Services Businesses reflects these adjustments as well.
14. Full Service:
The Full Service line of business provides retirement plan products and services to public, private and not-for-profit organizations. This business provides recordkeeping, plan administration, actuarial advisory services, participant education and communication services, trustee services and institutional and retail investment funds. This business mainly services defined contribution and defined benefit plans; non-qualified plans are also serviced. For clients with both defined contribution and defined benefit plans, integrated recordkeeping services are available. For participants leaving these plans, a range of rollover products are provided through a broker-dealer bank.
15. Full Service Stable Value:
Our Full Service Stable Value products represent fixed rate options on investment funds offered to customers. These products contain an obligation to pay interest at a specified rate for a specific period of time. Upon termination these products repay account balances at market value immediately or may be liquidated at book value over time. Substantially all of these products are either fully or partially participating, with annual or semi-annual resets giving effect to previous investment experience. These products are issued through the general account, separate accounts or client-owned trusts. Profits from partially participating general account products result from the spread between the rate of return on investment assets and the interest rates credited to the customer, less expenses.
