News Release Public Storage 701 Western Avenue Glendale, CA 91201-2349 www.publicstorage.com For Release: Immediately Date: August 2, 2007 Contact: Clemente Teng (818) 244-8080 Public Storage Reports Results for the Second Quarter Ended June 30, 2007 GLENDALE, California - Public Storage (NYSE:PSA) announced today operating results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2007. OPERATING RESULTS FOR THE SECOND QUARTER ENDED JUNE 30, 2007: - ------------------------------------------------------------- Net income for the three months ended June 30, 2007 was $77,104,000 compared to net income of $128,862,000 for the same period in 2006, representing a decrease of $51,758,000. This decrease is primarily due to increased amortization expense totaling $70.9 million due to the amortization of certain intangible assets acquired in our merger with Shurgard Storage Centers, Inc. ("Shurgard"), which closed on August 22, 2006, combined with an increase of $35.7 million in depreciation expense related to facilities acquired in the merger. In addition, during the three months ended June 30, 2007, our general and administrative expense increased significantly as we incurred $9.6 million in expenses related to our proposed offering of shares in our European business and $2.0 million of expenses related to our reorganization as a Maryland real estate investment trust (a "Maryland REIT"). The negative impacts to our net income from the above mentioned items were partially offset by improved operations from our Same Store group of facilities, continued growth in operations from our newly developed and recently expanded facilities, as well as continued growth in our recently acquired self-storage facilities including the facilities acquired in the merger with Shurgard. Our Same Store net operating income, before depreciation expense, increased by approximately $2,224,000 to $151,927,000, or 1.5%, as a result of a 1.7% improvement in revenues partially offset by a 2.1% increase in cost of operations. Aggregate net operating income for our newly developed and recently expanded and acquired facilities (other than the Shurgard facilities) increased by approximately $2,968,000 to $26,102,000 compared to the same period in 2006. This increase was largely due to the impact of facilities acquired in 2005, 2006 and 2007, combined with continued fill-up of our newly developed and expansion facilities. For those facilities that were acquired in the Shurgard merger, net operating income was approximately $83,821,000 for the quarter ended June 30, 2007. Our expanded media advertising, along with our aggressive pricing and promotional discount programs, increased our entire domestic portfolio's (including the Shurgard portfolio for all periods presented) average occupancy to 89.7% for the second quarter 2007 compared to 88.6% last year and 87.5% in the first quarter 2007. The overall occupancy at the end of June 2007 was 90.6% compared to 89.3% last year. For the three months ended June 30, 2007, we had a net income allocable to our common shareholders (after allocating net income to our preferred and equity shareholders) of $14,433,000 or $0.08 per common share on a diluted basis compared to income of $71,130,000 or $0.55 per common share on a diluted basis for the same period in 2006, representing a decrease of $56,697,000 or $0.47 per diluted common share, or 84.6%. The decreases in net income allocable to common shareholders on an aggregate and per-share basis are due primarily to the impact of the factors described above, combined with an increase in income allocated to preferred shareholders, as described below. For the three months ended June 30, 2007 and 2006, we allocated $57,315,000 and $52,376,000 of our net income, respectively, to our preferred shareholders based on distributions paid. The year-over-year increase is due to the issuance of additional preferred securities, partially offset by the redemption of preferred securities that had higher dividend rates than the newly issued preferred securities. Weighted average diluted shares increased to 170,213,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2007 from 129,062,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2006. The increase in weighted average diluted shares is due primarily to the issuance of approximately 38.9 million shares in the merger with Shurgard, as well as the exercise of employee stock options assumed in the merger with Shurgard. 1
OPERATING RESULTS FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2007: - --------------------------------------------------------- Net income for the six months ended June 30, 2007 was $136,882,000 compared to $243,078,000 for the same period in 2006, representing a decrease of $106,196,000. This decrease is primarily due to increased amortization expense totaling $156.7 million due to the amortization of certain intangible assets acquired in our merger with Shurgard combined with an increase of $71.4 million in depreciation expense related to facilities acquired in the merger. In addition, during the six months ended June 30, 2007, our general and administrative expense increased significantly as we incurred $9.6 million in expenses related to our proposed offering of shares in our European business, $2.0 million of expenses related to our reorganization as a Maryland REIT, and $5.3 million in integration expenses related to the merger. These items were partially offset by improved operations from our Same Store group of facilities, continued growth in operations from our newly developed and recently expanded facilities along with continued growth in our recently acquired self-storage facilities (including the facilities acquired from Shurgard). Same Store net operating income, before depreciation expense, increased by $6,578,000 to $299,776,000, or 2.2%, as a result of a 2.3% improvement in revenues partially offset by a 2.4% increase in cost of operations. Aggregate net operating income for our newly developed, acquired and expansion self-storage facilities (excluding the Shurgard facilities) increased by approximately $7,722,000 to $51,005,000. We earned an aggregate of $160,930,000 in net operating income with respect to the facilities acquired from Shurgard. Net income allocable to our common shareholders (after allocating net income to our preferred and equity shareholders) was $10,079,000 or $0.06 per common share on a diluted basis for the six months ended June 30, 2007 compared to $133,375,000 or $1.03 per common share on a diluted basis for the same period in 2006, representing a decrease of $0.97 per common share, or 94.2%. The decrease in net income allocable to common shareholders and earnings per common diluted share are due primarily to the impact of the factors described above, combined with an increase in income allocated to preferred shareholders, as described below. For the six months ended June 30, 2007 and 2006, we allocated $116,091,000 and $98,991,000 of our net income, respectively, to our preferred shareholders based on distributions paid. The year-over-year increase is due to the issuance of additional preferred securities, partially offset by the redemption of preferred securities that had higher dividend rates than the newly preferred securities issued. Weighted average diluted shares increased to 170,275,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2007 from 129,037,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2006. The increase in weighted average diluted shares is due primarily to the issuance of approximately 38.9 million shares in the merger with Shurgard, as well as the exercise of employee stock options assumed in the merger with Shurgard. FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS: - ---------------------- For the three months ended June 30, 2007, funds from operations ("FFO") increased to $1.10 per common share on a diluted basis as compared to $0.99 per common share for the same period in 2006, representing an increase of $0.11 per common share, or 11.1%. For the six months ended June 30, 2007, FFO increased to $2.15 per common share on a diluted basis as compared to $1.93 per common share for same period in 2006, representing an increase of $0.22 per common share, or 11.4%. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2007 and 2006, FFO has been impacted as a result of (i) additional expenses incurred in connection with the merger with Shurgard included in general and administrative expense totaling approximately $1.3 million and $5.3 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2007, respectively, as compared to $1.1 million and $2.2 million, respectively, for the same periods in 2006, (ii) net foreign currency exchange gains of approximately $5.6 million and $10.6 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2007, respectively, (iii) expenses related to our proposed offering of shares in our European business totaling $9.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2007, (iv) additional expenses related to our reorganization as a Maryland REIT totaling approximately $2.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2007, (v) an increase in estimated insurance proceeds with respect to damage caused by Hurricane Katrina of $2.7 million, and (vi) our pro rata share of PS Business Parks, Inc.'s application of EITF Topic D-42 in connection with the redemption of preferred securities totaling $729,000 in the three and six months ended June 30, 2006 and included in equity in earnings of real estate entities. 2
The following table provides a summary of the impact of these items that have occurred during the three and six months ended June 30, 2007 and 2006: FFO is a term defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT"). It is generally defined as net income before depreciation with respect to real estate assets and gains and losses on real estate assets. FFO is presented because management and many analysts consider FFO to be one measure of the performance of real estate companies. In addition, we believe that FFO is helpful to investors as an additional measure of the performance of a REIT, because net income includes the impact of depreciation, which assumes that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time, while we believe that the value of real estate fluctuates due to market conditions and in response to inflation. FFO computations do not consider scheduled principal payments on debt, capital improvements, distribution and other obligations of the Company. FFO is not a substitute for our cash flow or net income as a measure of our liquidity or operating performance or our ability to pay dividends. Other REITs may not compute FFO in the same manner; accordingly, FFO may not be comparable among REITs. See the attached reconciliation of net income to funds from operations included in the selected financial data attached to this press release. PROPERTY OPERATIONS-SAME STORE FACILITIES: - ------------------------------------------ We derive substantially all of our revenues from the ownership and management of self-storage facilities. In order to evaluate the performance of our overall self-storage portfolio, we analyze the operating performance of our stabilized self-storage facilities. As of June 30, 2007, our "Same Store" portfolio consists of 1,316 facilities, which represents the facilities that we have consolidated in our financial statements and have been operating at a stabilized basis throughout 2005, 2006 and first six months of 2007. The Same Store facilities contain approximately 77.8 million net rentable square feet, representing approximately 63% of the aggregate net rentable square feet in the United States of our consolidated self-storage portfolio at June 30, 2007. The following table summarizes the historical operating results of the Same Store facilities: 3
a) See attached reconciliation of these amounts to our consolidated self-storage revenues and operating expenses. Revenues and cost of operations do not include ancillary revenues and expenses generated at the facilities with respect to tenant reinsurance, retail sales and truck rentals. "Other costs of management" included in cost of operations principally represents all the indirect costs incurred in the operations of the facilities. Indirect costs principally include supervisory costs and corporate overhead cost incurred to support the operating activities of the facilities. b) Net operating income (before depreciation) or "NOI" is a non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) financial measure that excludes the impact of depreciation expense. Although depreciation is an operating expense, we believe that NOI is a meaningful measure of operating performance, because we utilize NOI in making decisions with respect to capital allocations, in determining current property values, segment performance and comparing period-to-period and market-to-market property operating results. NOI is not a substitute for net operating income after depreciation in evaluating our operating results. c) Square foot occupancies represent weighted average occupancy levels over the entire period. d) Realized annual rent per occupied square foot is computed by annualizing the result of dividing rental income by the weighted average occupied square footage for the period. Realized annual rent per occupied square foot takes into consideration promotional discounts, credit card fees and other costs that reduce rental income from the contractual amounts due. e) Annualized rental income per available square foot ("REVPAF") represents annualized rental income divided by total available net rentable square feet. f) Late charges and administrative fees are excluded from the computation of realized annual rent per occupied square foot and REVPAF because exclusion of these amounts provides a better measure of our ongoing level of revenue, by excluding the volatility of late charges, which are dependent principally upon the level of tenant delinquency, and administrative fees, which are dependent principally upon the absolute level of move-ins for a period. g) In place annual rent per occupied square foot represents annualized contractual rents per occupied square foot without reductions for promotional discounts, and excludes late charges and administrative fees. 4
The following table summarizes additional selected financial data with respect to our Same Store facilities: MERGER WITH SHURGARD: - --------------------- On August 22, 2006, we completed the merger with Shurgard Storage Centers, Inc. Included in general and administrative expense are costs related to completing the integration of the two companies of approximately $1.3 million and $5.3 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2007, respectively. Similar costs relating to pursuing the merger totaling $1.1 million and $2.2 million were incurred in the three and six months ended June 30, 2006, respectively. We do not expect there will be further merger integration costs. SHURGARD EUROPE: - ---------------- We own and operate 103 wholly-owned European facilitates with 5.6 million net rentable square feet along with a 20% interest in two joint ventures which collectively own 65 European properties with 3.2 million net rentable square feet. The two joint ventures collectively had approximately $327 million of outstanding debt at June 30, 2007, which is included in our condensed consolidated financial statements. At June 30, 2007, one of the joint ventures had seven facilities under construction (358,000 net rentable square feet), with total estimated costs of approximately $75 million, of which approximately $45 million had been incurred as of June 30, 2007. We also have seven facilities, and one redevelopment project of an existing facility, in development with an aggregate of 407,000 net rentable square feet. Total estimated costs for these projects, aggregating approximately $64 million (approximately $4 million incurred as of June 30, 2007), will be funded by us. The development of these facilities is subject to various risks and contingencies. During the second quarter of 2007, we completed the development of one facility in Denmark at a total cost of $8 million, adding 50,000 net rentable square feet to the portfolio. 5
During the second quarter of 2007, a share offering of Shurgard Europe was initiated to be listed on Eurolist of EuronextTM Brussels. Due to adverse market conditions, this offering was withdrawn on June 21, 2007. There is no estimate as to when or if a future offering may occur. We incurred $9.6 million in expenses related to our proposed offering of shares which is included in general and administrative expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2007. As previously disclosed in January 2007, we filed an arbitration action with our joint venture partner related to our intention to terminate the joint ventures early. As part of our efforts to resolve this dispute, we had entered into an agreement to exchange their interest in the joint ventures for shares in the proposed public company; however, because the offering has been withdrawn, Shurgard Europe will continue to pursue its arbitration action. DEVELOPMENT AND ASSET ACQUISITION ACTIVITIES IN THE UNITED STATES: - ------------------------------------------------------------------ During the quarter, we acquired a self-storage facility in California containing 53,000 net rentable square feet, for approximately $6.3 million and have entered into agreements to acquire five additional facilities in California and Georgia with net rentable square feet of 395,000, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $44 million. These transactions are expected to close in the third quarter. At June 30, 2007, we had 41 projects (1,786,000 net additional rentable square feet) that were either under construction or were expected to begin construction generally within the next year, which expand existing self-storage facilities and enhance their visual appeal for a total estimated cost of $140 million. These projects will be fully funded by us. Opening dates for these facilities are estimated through the next 24 months. The development of these facilities is subject to various risks and contingencies. ISSUANCE AND REDEMPTION OF PREFERRED SECURITIES: - ------------------------------------------------ On July 2, 2007, we issued 6,900,000 depositary shares, with each depositary share representing 1/1,000 of a 7.0% Cumulative Preferred Share of Beneficial Interest, Series N, for aggregate gross proceeds of $172.5 million. A portion of the net proceeds from this offering were used to repay a portion of borrowings under our revolving credit facility and the remainder will be used to make additional investments in self-storage facilities and for other general corporate purposes. During September 2007, we have the opportunity to redeem our 7.50% Series V preferred stock ($172.5 million). The potential redemption of this security would result in EITF Topic D-42 allocations of approximately $6 million in the third quarter of 2007. No decision has been made to redeem these securities. SHARE REPURCHASES: - ------------------ Our Board of Trustees has authorized the repurchase from time to time of up to 25,000,000 shares of our common stock on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. From the inception of the repurchase program through August 2, 2007, we have repurchased a total of 22,201,720 shares (none from January 1, 2006 through August 2, 2007) of common stock at an aggregate cost of approximately $567.2 million. DISTRIBUTIONS DECLARED: - ----------------------- On August 2, 2007 the Board of Trustees declared a quarterly distribution of $0.50 per regular common share and $0.6125 per share on the depositary shares each representing 1/1,000 of a share of Equity Stock, Series A. Distributions were also declared with respect to the Company's various series of preferred stock. All the distributions are payable on September 27, 2007 to shareholders of record as of September 12, 2007. SECOND QUARTER CONFERENCE CALL: - ------------------------------- A conference call is scheduled for Friday, August 3, 2007 at 10:00 a.m. (PDT) to discuss the second quarter ended June 30, 2007 earnings results.

Public Storage disclaims any obligation to update publicly or otherwise revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, new estimates, or other factors, events or circumstances after the date of this press release, except where expressly required by law. 7
PUBLIC STORAGE SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA (Unaudited) (a) Depreciation and amortization increased substantially, principally due to $70,928,000 and $156,712,000 in amortization of intangibles acquired in the merger with Shurgard for the three and six months ended June 30, 2007, respectively, as well as $35,700,000 and $71,400,000 in depreciation of the buildings acquired in the merger with Shurgard for the same periods. Amortization of the intangible assets acquired in the merger with Shurgard is expected to be approximately $51,994,000 in the third quarter of 2007 and $36,938,000 in the fourth quarter of 2007. 8
(b) Included in general and administrative expense are merger related costs totaling $1.3 million and $1.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and $5.3 million and $2.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Also included in general and administrative expense for the three months ended June 30, 2007 are $9.6 million in expenses associated with our proposed offering of shares in our European business, and $2.0 million in expenses related to our reorganization as a Maryland REIT. (c) During 2005, several of our self-storage facilities were significantly damaged by Hurricane Katrina. As a result, a loss was recorded in 2005 based on the excess of the net book value of the damaged facilities over the estimated insurance proceeds that we would receive. 9
PUBLIC STORAGE SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA (Unaudited) 10
Shurgard Domestic Same Store Selected Operating Data - ---------------------------------------------------- The Shurgard Domestic Same Store pool of 344 facilities are all stabilized since January 1, 2005 and will therefore provide meaningful comparative data for 2005, 2006 and first six months of 2007. Previously, the Shurgard Domestic Same Store Pool included 355 facilities, which has now been reduced for 11 facilities which, effective May 24, 2007, were no longer consolidated in our operating results. After May 24, 2007, our pro rata share of the net operating results of these 11 facilities is presented as a component of Equity in Earnings of Real Estate Entities, and our net investment in these properties is reflected on our balance sheet as Investment in Real Estate Entities. The operating data presented in the table below reflects the historical data from January 1, 2006 through June 30, 2006, the period for which the 344 facilities were operated under Shurgard combined with the historical data from January 1, 2007 through June 30, 2007, the period operated under Public Storage. SELECTED OPERATING DATA FOR THE 344 FACILITIES - ---------------------------------------------- OPERATED BY SHURGARD ON A STABILIZED BASIS SINCE - ------------------------------------------------ JANUARY 1, 2005 ("SHURGARD DOMESTIC SAME STORE - ---------------------------------------------- FACILITIES"): (a) - ------------- (a) Operating data reflects the operations of these facilities without regard to the time period in which Public Storage owned the facilities; only the amounts for the period January 1, 2007 through June 30, 2007 are included in our consolidated operating results. (b) Revenues and cost of operations do not include ancillary revenues and expenses generated at the facilities with respect to tenant reinsurance, retail sales and truck rentals. "Other costs of management" included in cost of operations principally represents all the indirect costs incurred in the operations of the facilities. Indirect costs principally include supervisory costs and corporate overhead cost incurred to support the operating activities of the facilities. These amounts presented herein will not necessarily compare to amounts previously presented by Shurgard in its public reporting due to differences in classification of revenues and expenses, including tenant reinsurance, retail sales and truck rental activities which are included on our income statement under "ancillary operations" but were previously presented by Shurgard as self-storage revenue and operating expenses. 11
(c) Net operating income (before depreciation) or "NOI" is a non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) financial measure that excludes the impact of depreciation expense. Although depreciation is an operating expense, we believe that NOI is a meaningful measure of operating performance, because we utilize NOI in making decisions with respect to capital allocations, in determining current property values, segment performance, and comparing period-to-period and market-to-market property operating results. NOI is not a substitute for net operating income after depreciation in evaluating our operating results. Depreciation is not presented herein because it is not comparable during the period owned by us and during the period owned by Shurgard, due to differing historical costs and depreciable lives. (d) Square foot occupancies represent weighted average occupancy levels over the entire period. (e) Realized annual rent per occupied square foot is computed by annualizing the result of dividing rental income by the weighted average occupied square footage for the period. Realized annual rent per occupied square foot takes into consideration promotional discounts, credit card fees and other costs that reduce rental income from the contractual amounts due. (f) Annualized rental income per available square foot ("REVPAF") represents annualized rental income divided by total available net rentable square feet. (g) Late charges and administrative fees are excluded from the computation of realized annual rent per occupied square foot and REVPAF because exclusion of these amounts provides a better measure of our ongoing level of revenue, by excluding the volatility of late charges, which are dependent principally upon the level of tenant delinquency, and administrative fees, which are dependent principally upon the absolute level of move-ins for a period. 12
Shurgard European Same Store Selected Operating Data - ---------------------------------------------------- In the merger with Shurgard, we acquired 103 wholly-owned facilities and an interest in 57 facilities owned by affiliated joint ventures located in seven European countries. The operating data presented in the table below reflects the historical data for the Same Store portfolio in Europe from January 1, 2006 through June 30, 2006, the period for which the facilities were operated under Shurgard combined with the historical data from January 1, 2007 through June 30, 2007, the period operated under Public Storage. Selected Operating Data for the 96 facilities operated by Shurgard Europe on a stabilized basis since January 1, 2005 ("Europe Same Store Facilities"): (a) (a) Operating data reflects the operations of these facilities without regard to the time period in which Public Storage owned the facilities; only the amounts for the period January 1, 2007 through June 30, 2007 are included in our consolidated operating results. (b) Amounts for the quarter and six months, respectively, ended June 30, 2006 are translated based upon the average exchange rates for the quarter and six months, respectively, ended June 30, 2007. Amounts for the quarter and six months, respectively, ended June 30, 2007 are translated based upon the average exchange rates in effect for each period as denoted more fully in Note 2 to our financial statements, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies." The majority of our operations are denominated in Euros and British Pounds. The Euro was translated at an average exchange rate of approximately 1.348 and 1.329, respectively, in US Dollars per Euro for the three and six months ended June 30, 2007, respectively. The British Pound was translated at an average exchange rate of approximately 1.985 and 1.969, respectively, in US Dollars per British Pound for the three and six months ended June 30, 2007, respectively. 13
(c) Revenues and cost of operations do not include ancillary revenues and expenses generated at the facilities with respect to tenant reinsurance and retail sales. "Other costs of management" included in cost of operations principally represents all the indirect costs incurred in the operations of the facilities. Indirect costs principally include supervisory costs and corporate overhead cost incurred to support the operating activities of the facilities. These amounts presented herein will not necessarily compare to amounts previously presented by Shurgard in its public reporting due to differences in classification of revenues and expenses, including tenant reinsurance and retail sales which are included on our income statement under "ancillary operations" but were previously presented by Shurgard as self-storage revenue and operating expenses. (d) Net operating income (before depreciation) or "NOI" is a non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) financial measure that excludes the impact of depreciation expense. Although depreciation is an operating expense, we believe that NOI is a meaningful measure of operating performance, because we utilize NOI in making decisions with respect to capital allocations, in determining current property values, segment performance, and comparing period-to-period and market-to-market property operating results. NOI is not a substitute for net operating income after depreciation in evaluating our operating results. Depreciation is not presented herein because it is not comparable during the period owned by us and during the period owned by Shurgard, due to differing historical costs and depreciable lives. (e) Square foot occupancies represent weighted average occupancy levels over the entire period. (f) Realized annual rent per occupied square foot is computed by annualizing the result of dividing rental income by the weighted average occupied square footage for the period. Realized annual rent per occupied square foot takes into consideration promotional discounts, credit card fees and other costs that reduce rental income from the contractual amounts due. (g) Annualized rental income per available square foot ("REVPAF") represents annualized rental income divided by total available net rentable square feet. (h) Late charges and administrative fees are excluded from the computation of realized annual rent per occupied square foot and REVPAF because exclusion of these amounts provides a better measure of our ongoing level of revenue, by excluding the volatility of late charges, which are dependent principally upon the level of tenant delinquency, and administrative fees, which are dependent principally upon the absolute level of move-ins for a period. (i) In place annual rent per occupied square foot represents annualized contractual rents per occupied square foot without reductions for promotional discounts, and excludes late charges and administrative fees. 14
PUBLIC STORAGE SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA Computation of Funds From Operations (a) (Unaudited) (a) Funds from operations ("FFO") is a term defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT"). FFO is a non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) financial measure. FFO is generally defined as net income before depreciation with respect to real estate assets and gains and losses on real estate assets. FFO is presented because management and many analysts consider FFO to be one measure of the performance of real estate companies. In addition, we believe that FFO is helpful to investors as an additional measure of the performance of a REIT, because net income includes the impact of depreciation, which assumes that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time, while we believe that the value of real estate fluctuates due to market conditions and in response to inflation. FFO computations do not consider scheduled principal payments on debt, capital improvements, distributions, and other obligations of the Company. FFO is not a substitute for our cash flow or net income as a measure of our liquidity or operating performance or our ability to pay dividends. Other REITs may not compute FFO in the same manner; accordingly, FFO may not be comparable among REITs. 15
PUBLIC STORAGE SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA Computation of Funds Available for Distribution (c) (Unaudited) (a) Funds from operations ("FFO") is a term defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT").

FFO computations do not consider scheduled principal payments on debt, capital improvements, distributions, and other obligations of the Company. FFO is not a substitute for our cash flow or net income as a measure of our liquidity or operating performance or our ability to pay dividends. Other REITs may not compute FFO in the same manner; accordingly, FFO may not be comparable among REITs. (b) Capital expenditures excludes approximately $3,600,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2007, of costs incurred to re-brand the U.S. Shurgard facilities to the "Public Storage" name, which principally consists of permanent signage. (c) Funds available for distribution ("FAD") represents FFO, plus 1) impairment charges with respect to real estate assets, 2) the non-cash portion of stock-based compensation expense, 3) income allocation to preferred equity holders in accordance with EITF Topic D-42, less capital expenditures and any gain or loss on foreign exchange or from derivatives. The distribution payout ratio is computed by dividing the distribution paid by FAD. FAD is presented because many analysts consider it to be a measure of the performance and liquidity of real estate companies and because we believe that FAD is helpful to investors as an additional measure of the performance of a REIT. FAD is not a substitute for our cash flow or net income as a measure of our liquidity, operating performance, or our ability to pay dividends. Other REITs may not compute FAD in the same manner; accordingly, FAD may not be comparable among REITs. 16
PUBLIC STORAGE SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA Reconciliation of Same Store Revenues and Cost of Operations To Consolidated Self-Storage Rental Income and Cost of Operations (Unaudited) 17
(a) We consolidate the operating results of additional self-storage facilities that are not Same Store facilities. Such facilities are not included in the Same Store pool either because they were not stabilized for the entire period from January 1, 2005 through June 30, 2007, or because we acquired these facilities from third parties after December 31, 2004. (b) Represents the operations of the facilities acquired in the merger with Shurgard, which remain consolidated at June 30, 2007, for the period from January 1, 2007 through June 30, 2007. (c) Represents the operations of the 11 facilities acquired from Shurgard that we discontinued consolidation with the Company effective May 24, 2007, for the period their operating results were consolidated. (d) Self-storage revenues and cost of operations do not include revenues and expenses generated at the facilities with respect to tenant reinsurance, retail sales and truck rentals. 18
