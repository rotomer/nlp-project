News Release Public Storage 701 Western Avenue Glendale, CA 91201-2349 www.publicstorage.com - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- For Release: Immediately Date: February 27, 2008 Contact: Clemente Teng (818) 244-8080 PUBLIC STORAGE REPORTS RESULTS FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER AND YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007 AND INCREASES CASH DIVIDEND 10% GLENDALE, California - Public Storage (NYSE:PSA) announced today operating results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2007. The Company also announced that it had increased its cash dividend per regular common share from $0.50 to $0.55, an increase of 10%. OPERATING RESULTS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007: - --------------------------------------------------------------- Net income for the three months ended December 31, 2007 was $167.9 million compared to a net loss of $10.2 million for the same period in 2006, representing an improvement of $178.1 million. This improvement is primarily due to reduced depreciation and amortization expense, reduced general and administrative expense, improved operations from our real estate facilities and an increased foreign currency exchange gain. Depreciation and amortization expense for the quarter ended December 31, 2007 decreased by $94.8 million, as compared to the same period in 2006. This decrease is primarily due to a reduction in amortization expense related to customer intangible assets that we obtained in the August 22, 2006 acquisition of Shurgard Storage Centers, Inc. (the "Shurgard Merger"). For the three months ended December 31, 2007, intangible amortization expense primarily related to the intangibles acquired in the Shurgard Merger totaled $36.8 million as compared to $125.3 million for the same period in 2006. General and administrative expense declined $24.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2007 as compared to the same period in 2006. This decline was primarily due to integration expenses associated with the Shurgard Merger totaling $23.5 million during the three months ended December 31, 2006. Net operating income, before depreciation, for our self-storage operations totaled $285.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2007 as compared to $254.6 million for the same period in 2006, representing an increase of $31.3 million. For those facilities that were acquired in the Shurgard Merger, net operating income was approximately $93.9 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2007 as compared to $74.7 million for the same period in 2006. During the quarter ended December 31, 2007, we recognized a foreign currency exchange gain of $16.6 million relating to intercompany loans between our U.S. and European subsidiaries. The gain was the result of the continued weakening of the US Dollar relative to the Euro during the quarter. See "Shurgard Europe" below for further information. For the three months ended December 31, 2007, net income allocable to our common shareholders (after allocating net income to our preferred and equity shareholders) was $102.2 million or $0.60 per common share on a diluted basis compared to a net loss of $80.4 million or $0.48 per common share on a diluted basis for the same period in 2006, representing an increase of $182.6 million or $1.08 per common share on a diluted basis. These improvements are due primarily to the impact of the factors described above with respect to net income, as well as a decrease in income allocated to our preferred shareholders, as described below. For the three months ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, we allocated $60.3 million and $55.0 million of our net income, respectively, to our preferred shareholders based on distributions paid. The year-over-year increase is due to the issuance of additional preferred securities, partially offset by the redemption of preferred securities that had higher dividend rates than the newly issued preferred securities. In the three months ended December 31, 2006, we also recorded allocations of income to our preferred shareholders with respect to the application of EITF Topic D-42 totaling $9.9 million in connection with the redemption of preferred securities. 1
Weighted average diluted shares increased to 170,089,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2007 from 169,063,000 for the same period in 2006. OPERATING RESULTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007: Net income for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $457.5 million compared to $314.0 million for the same period in 2006, representing an increase of $143.5 million. This increase is primarily due to improved operations from our real estate facilities combined with an increased foreign currency exchange gain and a reduction in general and administrative expense. These items were partially offset by increases in depreciation and amortization expense and interest expense. Comparisons of our revenues, expenses, and weighted average shares outstanding are significantly impacted by the Shurgard Merger, which closed on August 22, 2006. The results with respect to the assets and liabilities acquired in the Shurgard Merger are included in our operating results from August 23, 2006 through December 31, 2006 during the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to the entire year ended December 31, 2007. Net operating income, before depreciation, for our self-storage operations totaled $1,082.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to $810.8 million for the same period in 2006, representing an increase of $271.4 million. The increase is primarily due to the addition of 647 facilities that we acquired in the Shurgard Merger. Net operating income of the former Shurgard properties was approximately $347.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to $110.1 million for the same period in 2006, which reflects the operations of these facilities from August 23, 2006 through December 31, 2006. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we recognized a foreign currency exchange gain aggregating $57.6 million relating to intercompany loans between our U.S. and European subsidiaries. The gain was the result of the continued weakening of the US Dollar relative to the Euro during the year ended December 31, 2007. See "Shurgard Europe" below for further information. General and administrative expense declined $24.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to the same period in 2006. This decline was primarily due to the reduction in integration expenses associated with the Shurgard Merger, contract termination costs, and development costs that were expensed with respect to terminated projects; offset partially by costs incurred in 2007 with respect to our reorganization as a Maryland REIT, and the costs associated with a proposed offering of shares in our European business. These expenses aggregated $56.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to $19.0 million for the same period in 2007. Depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased by $184.8 million, as compared to the same period in 2006. This increase is primarily due to increased depreciation and amortization expense with respect to the buildings and intangible assets acquired in the Shurgard Merger. Net income allocable to our common shareholders (after allocating net income to our preferred and equity shareholders) was $199.4 million or $1.17 per common share on a diluted basis for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to $46.9 million or $0.33 per common share on a diluted basis for the same period in 2006, representing an increase of $152.5 million or $0.84 per common share on a diluted basis. The increase in net income allocable to common shareholders and earnings per common share on a diluted basis are due primarily to the impact of the factors described above with respect to net income, as well as a decrease in income allocated to preferred shareholders, as described below. For the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, we allocated $236.8 million and $214.2 million of our net income, respectively, to our preferred shareholders based on distributions paid. The year-over-year increase is due to the issuance of additional preferred securities, partially offset by the redemption of preferred securities that had higher dividend rates than the newly preferred securities issued. In 2006, we also recorded allocations of income to our preferred shareholders with respect to the application of EITF Topic D-42 totaling $31.5 million (or $0.22 per common share on a diluted basis) in connection with the redemption of preferred securities. Weighted average diluted shares increased to 170,147,000 for the year ended December 31, 2007 from 143,715,000 for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in weighted average diluted shares is due primarily to the impact of the issuance of 38.9 million shares in connection with the Shurgard Merger. FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS: - ---------------------- For the three months ended December 31, 2007, funds from operations ("FFO") increased to $1.40 per common share on a diluted basis as compared to $0.89 per common share for the same period in 2006, representing an increase of $0.51 per common share, or 57.3%. 2
For the three months ended December 31, 2007, FFO has been impacted as a result of (i) net foreign currency exchange and derivative gains totaling $16.3 million ($4.4 million for the same period in 2006), and (ii) development costs that are included in general and administrative expense with respect to canceled projects totaling $0.5 million ($0.9 million for the same period in 2006). For the same period in 2006, FFO was impacted by (i) a $1.0 million impairment charge on a discontinued self-storage facility, (ii) costs and expenses incurred in connection with the Shurgard Merger totaling $23.5 million, and (iii) our pro rata share of PS Business Parks, Inc.'s application of EITF Topic D-42 included in equity in earnings, and our application of EITF Topic D-42, in connection with the redemption of preferred securities totaling $10.6 million. For the year ended December 31, 2007, FFO increased to $4.97 per common share on a diluted basis as compared to $3.57 per common share for the same period in 2006, representing an increase of $1.40 per common share, or 39.2%. For the year ended December 31, 2007, FFO has been impacted as a result of (i) net foreign currency exchange and derivatives gains of approximately $58.4 million ($4.3 million for the same period in 2006), (ii) development costs that are included in general and administrative expense with respect to terminated projects totaling $2.1 million ($10.2 million for the same period in 2006), (iii) an impairment charge included in discontinued operations with respect to the closure of a containerized storage facility totaling $0.9 million, (iv) additional expenses incurred in connection with the Shurgard Merger included in general and administrative expense totaling approximately $5.3 million ($44.0 million for the same period in 2006), (v) $9.6 million in general and administrative expenses related to our proposed offering of shares in our European business, (vi) $2.0 million in general and administrative expense associated with our reorganization as a Maryland REIT, and (vii) an increase in insurance proceeds with respect to damage caused by Hurricane Katrina of $2.7 million. In addition, for the year ended December 31, 2006, FFO has been impacted as a result of (i) contract termination costs included in general and administrative expense totaling $2.2 million, (ii) a $1.0 million impairment charge on a discontinued self-storage facility and (iii) our pro rata share of PS Business Parks, Inc.'s application of EITF Topic D-42 included in equity in earnings, and our application of EITF Topic D-42, in connection with the redemption of preferred securities totaling $33.6 million. The following table provides a summary of the impact of these items that have occurred during the three months and year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006: FFO is a term defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT"). It is generally defined as net income before depreciation with respect to real estate assets and gains and losses on real estate assets. FFO is presented because management and many analysts consider FFO to be one measure of the performance of real estate companies. In addition, we believe that FFO is helpful to investors as an additional measure of the performance of 3
a REIT, because net income includes the impact of depreciation, which assumes that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time, while we believe that the value of real estate fluctuates due to market conditions and in response to inflation. FFO computations do not consider scheduled principal payments on debt, capital improvements, distributions and other obligations of the Company. FFO is not a substitute for our cash flow or net income as a measure of our liquidity or operating performance or our ability to pay dividends. Other REITs may not compute FFO in the same manner; accordingly, FFO may not be comparable among REITs. See the attached reconciliation of net income to funds from operations included in the selected financial data attached to this press release. PROPERTY OPERATIONS-SAME STORE FACILITIES: - ------------------------------------------ We derive substantially all of our revenues from the ownership and management of self-storage facilities. In order to evaluate the performance of our overall self-storage portfolio, we analyze the operating performance of our stabilized self-storage facilities. As of December 31, 2007, our "Same Store" portfolio consists of 1,316 facilities, which represents the facilities that we have consolidated in our financial statements and have been operating at a stabilized basis throughout 2005, 2006 and 2007. The Same Store facilities contain approximately 77.8 million net rentable square feet, representing approximately 62% of the aggregate net rentable square feet in the U.S. of our consolidated self-storage portfolio at December 31, 2007. The following table summarizes the historical operating results of the Same Store facilities: a) Seeattached reconciliation of these amounts to our consolidated self-storage revenues and operating expenses. Revenues and cost of operations do not include ancillary revenues and expenses generated at the facilities with respect to tenant reinsurance, retail sales and truck rentals. "Other costs of management" included in cost of operations principally represents all the indirect costs incurred in the operations of the facilities. Indirect costs principally include supervisory costs and corporate overhead cost incurred to support the operating activities of the facilities. 4
b) Net operating income (before depreciation) or "NOI" is a non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) financial measure that excludes the impact of depreciation expense. Although depreciation is an operating expense, we believe that NOI is a meaningful measure of operating performance, because we utilize NOI in making decisions with respect to capital allocations, in determining current property values, segment performance and comparing period-to-period and market-to-market property operating results. NOI is not a substitute for net operating income after depreciation in evaluating our operating results. c) Square foot occupancies represent weighted average occupancy levels over the entire period. d) Realized annual rent per occupied square foot is computed by annualizing the result of dividing rental income by the weighted average occupied square footage for the period. Realized annual rent per occupied square foot takes into consideration promotional discounts, credit card fees and other costs that reduce rental income from the contractual amounts due. e) Annualized rental income per available square foot ("REVPAF") represents annualized rental income divided by total available net rentable square feet. f) Late charges and administrative fees are excluded from the computation of realized annual rent per occupied square foot and REVPAF because exclusion of these amounts provides a better measure of our ongoing level of revenue, by excluding the volatility of late charges, which are dependent principally upon the level of tenant delinquency, and administrative fees, which are dependent principally upon the absolute level of move-ins for a period. g) In place annual rent per occupied square foot represents annualized contractual rents per occupied square foot without reductions for promotional discounts and excludes late charges and administrative fees. The following table summarizes additional selected financial data with respect to our Same Store facilities (unaudited): SHURGARD EUROPE: - ---------------- We own and operate 104 wholly-owned European facilities with 5.7 million net rentable square feet along with a 20% interest in two joint ventures which collectively own 70 European facilities with 3.5 million net rentable square feet. The two joint ventures collectively had approximately $376.7 million of outstanding debt payable to third parties at December 31, 2007, which is included in our condensed consolidated financial statements. 5
At December 31, 2007, one of the joint ventures had two facilities under construction (115,000 net rentable square feet), with total estimated costs of approximately $21.0 million, of which approximately $14.0 million had been incurred as of December 31, 2007. We also have 11 facilities and one redevelopment project under construction, which will be funded by us (621,000 net rentable square feet). Total estimated costs for these projects are approximately $102.9 million of which approximately $18.0 million was incurred as of December 31, 2007. The development of these facilities is subject to various risks and contingencies. During the fourth quarter of 2007, we completed the development of one facility in the Netherlands at a total cost of $9.0 million, adding 89,000 net rentable square feet to the portfolio. Also during the fourth quarter of 2007, one of the joint ventures completed the development of four facilities located in France, Denmark, and the United Kingdom at a total cost of $44.0 million, adding 194,000 net rentable square feet to the portfolio. At December 31, 2007, our European subsidiaries owed approximately (euro)377.7 million ($555.9 million as of December 31, 2007) to our domestic subsidiaries. The loans are eliminated in consolidation for financial reporting purposes. We expect our European subsidiaries to obtain external financing in the next 12 to 24 months, which will fund the repayment of the loans. The loans, which are denominated in Euros, have not been hedged. The amount of US Dollars that will be received on repayment will depend upon the exchange rates at the time. Based upon the change in estimated US Dollars to be received caused by fluctuation in currency rates during each respective period, foreign currency translation gains of $16.6 million and $57.6 million, respectively, were recorded in the three months and year ended December 31, 2007. The US Dollar exchange rate relative to the Euro was approximately 1.319, 1.426, and 1.472, and at December 31, 2006, September 30, 2007, and December 31, 2007, respectively. As previously disclosed in January of 2008, we reached an agreement in principle for a prospective investor to acquire a 51% interest in Shurgard Europe in a private transaction. The price is generally consistent with the previously disclosed proceeds Public Storage expected to receive for its equity interest in last year's terminated European share offer. No binding agreement has been signed with the prospective investor and there is no assurance that a binding agreement will be signed or that the transaction will be completed. It is estimated that the completion of the transaction will take place at the end of the first quarter of 2008, assuming a binding agreement is signed and the conditions related to the transaction are satisfied. DEVELOPMENT AND ASSET ACQUISITION ACTIVITIES IN THE UNITED STATES: During the fourth quarter of 2007, we completed the development of a facility and five expansion projects at a total cost of $22.0 million, adding 231,000 net rentable square feet. We have entered into agreements to acquire two self-storage facilities in California with net rentable square feet of 248,000 for an aggregate purchase price of $31 million which includes approximately $10 million of assumed debt. While the acquisitions are subject to contingencies, these transactions are expected to close in the second quarter of 2008. At December 31, 2007, we had 29 projects that were either under construction or were expected to begin construction generally within the next year, comprised of 27 projects (1,105,000 net additional rentable square feet) which expand existing self-storage facilities and enhance their visual appeal for a total estimated cost of $106.9 million, and two newly developed self-storage facilities (113,000 net rentable square feet) for a total estimated cost of $14.7 million. These projects will be fully funded by us. Opening dates for these facilities are estimated through the next 24 months. The development of these facilities is subject to various risks and contingencies. SHARE REPURCHASES: - ------------------ Our Board of Trustees has authorized the repurchase from time to time of up to 25,000,000 of our common shares on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. No common shares were repurchased during 2007. From January 1, 2008 through February 27, 2008, we repurchased a total of 1,520,196 common shares for an aggregate of approximately $111.9 million. From the inception of the repurchase program through February 21, 2008, we have repurchased a total of 23,721,916 common shares at an aggregate cost of approximately $679.1 million. DISTRIBUTIONS DECLARED: - ----------------------- On February 27, 2008 the Board of Trustees declared a quarterly distribution of $0.55 per regular common share, representing a 10% increase from $0.50 per share, and $0.6125 per share on the depositary shares each representing 1/1,000 of a share of Equity Shares, Series A. Distributions were also declared with respect to the Company's various series of preferred shares. All the distributions are payable on March 31, 2008 to shareholders of record as of March 14, 2008. 6

PUBLIC STORAGE SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA (a) Depreciation and amortization increased due to $36.8 million and $247.8 million in amortization of intangible assets primarily acquired in the Shurgard Merger for the three months and year ended December 31, 2007, 8
respectively, compared to $125.3 million and $175.9 million for the three months and year ended December 31, 2006, respectively. In addition, we recorded $35.7 million and $142.8 million in depreciation of the buildings acquired in the Shurgard Merger for the three months and year ended December 31, 2007, respectively, compared to $49.3 million and $61.7 million for the same periods in 2006. (b) For the three months ended December 31, 2007, general and administrative expense includes (i) development costs that were expensed with respect to terminated projects totaling $0.5 million ($0.9 million for the same period in 2006), (ii) ongoing general and administrative expense related to our European operations for the entire quarter ended December 31, 2007 (includes amounts only from August 23, 2006 with respect to the same period in 2006), and (iii) $1.9 million in additional incentive compensation. In addition, for the three months ended December 31, 2006, general and administrative expense includes integration expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition of Shurgard totaling approximately $23.5 million. For the year ended December 31, 2007, general and administrative expense includes (i) development costs that were expensed with respect to terminated projects totaling $2.1 million ($10.2 million for the same period in 2006), (ii) additional expenses incurred in connection with the Shurgard Merger totaling approximately $5.3 million ($44.0 million for the same period in 2006), (iii) the aforementioned additional incentive compensation totaling $1.9 million, (iv) $9.6 million related to our proposed offering of shares in our European business, (v) $2.0 million associated with our reorganization as a Maryland REIT and (vi) ongoing general and administrative expense related to our European operations for the entire year ended December 31, 2007 (includes amounts only from August 23, 2006 with respect to the same period in 2006). In addition, for the year ended December 31, 2006, we incurred contract termination costs of $2.2 million. (c) We recorded foreign exchange gains aggregating approximately $16.6 million and $57.6 million in the three months and year ended December 31, 2007, respectively, related to our intercompany loans to our European subsidiary, representing the impact of the fluctuation of the exchange rate in US Dollars to the Euro. 9
PUBLIC STORAGE SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA (a) The increase at December 31, 2007 as compared to the balance at December 31, 2006 principally reflects the increase in our net investment (comprised of our equity investment and intercompany loans) in our European subsidiaries associated with changes in exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar, to the extent that these increases are not already recognized in our net income (we recognized a total of $57.6 million of such gains in the year ended December 31, 2007). The exchange rates of the Euro relative to the U.S. dollar increased from 1.319 at December 31, 2006 to 1.472 at December 31, 2007. 10
Shurgard Domestic Same Store Selected Operating Data The Shurgard Domestic Same Store pool of 343 facilities are all stabilized since January 1, 2005 and will therefore provide meaningful comparative data for 2005, 2006 and 2007. The operating data presented in the table below reflects the historical data from January 1, 2006 through August 23, 2006, the period for which the 343 facilities were operated under Shurgard, combined with the historical data from August 23, 2006 through December 31, 2007, the period operated under Public Storage. Selected Operating Data for the 343 facilities operated on a stabilized basis since January 1, 2005 ("Shurgard Domestic Same Store Facilities"): (unaudited)(a) (a) Operating data reflects the operations of these facilities without regard to the time period in which Public Storage owned the facilities; only the amounts for the period August 23, 2006 through December 31, 2007 are included in our consolidated operating results for each respective period. (b) Revenues and cost of operations do not include ancillary revenues and expenses generated at the facilities with respect to tenant reinsurance, retail sales and truck rentals. "Other costs of management" included in cost of operations principally represents all the indirect costs incurred in the operations of the facilities. Indirect costs principally include supervisory costs and corporate overhead cost incurred to support the operating activities of the facilities. These amounts presented herein will not necessarily compare to amounts previously presented by Shurgard in its public reporting due to differences in classification of revenues and expenses, including tenant reinsurance, retail sales and truck rental activities which are included on our income statement under "ancillary operations" but were previously presented by Shurgard as self-storage revenue and operating expenses. 11
(c) Net operating income (before depreciation) or "NOI" is a non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) financial measure that excludes the impact of depreciation expense. Although depreciation is an operating expense, we believe that NOI is a meaningful measure of operating performance, because we utilize NOI in making decisions with respect to capital allocations, in determining current property values, segment performance, and comparing period-to-period and market-to-market property operating results. NOI is not a substitute for net operating income after depreciation in evaluating our operating results. Depreciation is not presented herein because it is not comparable during the period owned by us and during the period owned by Shurgard, due to differing historical costs and depreciable lives. (d) Square foot occupancies represent weighted average occupancy levels over the entire period. (e) Realized annual rent per occupied square foot is computed by annualizing the result of dividing rental income by the weighted average occupied square footage for the period. Realized annual rent per occupied square foot takes into consideration promotional discounts, credit card fees and other costs that reduce rental income from the contractual amounts due. (f) Annualized rental income per available square foot ("REVPAF") represents annualized rental income divided by total available net rentable square feet. (g) Late charges and administrative fees are excluded from the computation of realized annual rent per occupied square foot and REVPAF because exclusion of these amounts provides a better measure of our ongoing level of revenue, by excluding the volatility of late charges, which are dependent principally upon the level of tenant delinquency, and administrative fees, which are dependent principally upon the absolute level of move-ins for a period. (h) In place annual rent per occupied square foot represents annualized contractual rents per occupied square foot without reductions for promotional discounts and excludes late charges and administrative fees. 12
Shurgard European Same Store Selected Operating Data - ---------------------------------------------------- In the Shurgard Merger, we acquired 103 wholly-owned facilities and an interest in 57 facilities owned by affiliated joint ventures located in seven European countries. The operating data presented in the table below for each period reflects the historical data for the European Same Store Portfolio from January 1, 2006 through August 22, 2006, the period for which the facilities were operated under Shurgard combined with the historical data from August 23, 2006 through December 31, 2007, the period operated under Public Storage. Selected Operating Data for the 96 facilities - --------------------------------------------------- operated by Shurgard Europe on a stabilized basis - ---------------------------------------------------- since January 1, 2005 ("Europe Same Store - --------------------------------------------------- Facilities"): (unaudited) - -------------------------- (a) Operating data reflects the operations of these facilities without regard to the time period in which Public Storage owned the facilities; only the amounts for the period August 23, 2006 through December 31, 2007 are included in our consolidated operating results. For comparative purposes, these amounts are presented on a constant exchange rate basis. The amounts for the three months and year ended December 31, 2006 have been restated using the actual respective exchange rates for the same periods in 2007. The exchange rates for the Euro relative to the U.S. dollar were 1.448 and 1.370, respectively, for the three months and year ended December 31, 2007. (b) Revenues and cost of operations do not include ancillary revenues and expenses generated at the facilities with respect to tenant reinsurance and retail sales.

PUBLIC STORAGE SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA Computation of Funds From Operations (a) (unaudited) (a) Funds from operations ("FFO") is a term defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT"). FFO is a non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) financial measure. FFO is generally defined as net income before depreciation with respect to real estate assets and gains and losses on real estate assets. FFO is presented because management and many analysts consider FFO to be one measure of the performance of real estate companies. In addition, we believe that FFO is helpful to investors as an additional measure of the performance of a REIT, because net income includes the impact of depreciation, which assumes that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time, while we believe that the value of real estate fluctuates due to market conditions and in response to inflation. FFO computations do not consider scheduled principal payments on debt, capital improvements, distributions, and other obligations of the Company. FFO is not a substitute for our cash flow or net income as a measure of our liquidity or operating performance or our ability to pay dividends. Other REITs may not compute FFO in the same manner; accordingly, FFO may not be comparable among REITs. 15

Other REITs may not compute FFO in the same manner; accordingly, FFO may not be comparable among REITs. (b) Funds available for distribution ("FAD") represents FFO, plus (i) impairment charges with respect to real estate assets, (ii) the non-cash portion of stock-based compensation expense, (iii) income allocation to preferred equity holders in accordance with EITF Topic D-42, less capital expenditures and any gain or loss on foreign exchange or from derivatives. The distribution payout ratio is computed by dividing the distribution paid by FAD. FAD is presented because many analysts consider it to be a measure of the performance and liquidity of real estate companies and because we believe that FAD is helpful to investors as an additional measure of the performance of a REIT. FAD is not a substitute for our cash flow or net income as a measure of our liquidity, operating performance, or our ability to pay dividends. FAD does not take into consideration required principal payments on debt. Other REITs may not compute FAD in the same manner; accordingly, FAD may not be comparable among REITs. 16
PUBLIC STORAGE SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA Reconciliation of Same Store Revenues and Cost of Operations To Consolidated Self-Storage Revenues and Cost of Operations (Unaudited) (a) We consolidate the operating results of additional self-storage facilities that are not Same Store facilities. Such facilities are not included in the Same Store pool either because they were not stabilized for the entire period from January 1, 2005 through December 31, 2007, or because we acquired these facilities from third parties after December 31, 2004. 17
(b) Represents the operations of the facilities acquired in the Shurgard Merger, which remain consolidated at December 31, 2007, for the period from January 1, 2007 through December 31, 2007. (c) Represents the operations of 11 facilities acquired in the Shurgard Merger which we discontinued consolidation in our financial statements effective May 24, 2007. On November 15, 2007, we acquired a controlling ownership position in five of these previously deconsolidated facilities, and recommenced consolidation of these properties effective November 15, 2007. The operations for these 11 facilities from August 23, 2006 through May 24, 2007, combined with the operations of the five facilities that we recommenced consolidation after November 15, 2007, are included in this table. (d) Self-storage revenues and cost of operations do not include revenues and expenses generated at the facilities with respect to tenant reinsurance, retail sales and truck rentals. 18
