ITEM 2.01. COMPLETION OF ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION OF ASSETS. On March 31, 2008, Public Storage ("Public Storage") and the New York Common Retirement Fund (the "NYCRF") completed the acquisition by NYCRF of 51% of the limited liability company interests of Shurgard European Holdings LLC ("Shurgard Holdings"), a newly-formed Delaware limited liability company and the holding company for Public Storage's European operations. Public Storage owns the remaining 49% interest and will continue as the managing member of Shurgard Holdings. The acquisition was consummated pursuant to a Subscription Agreement (the "Subscription Agreement"), dated March 31, 2008, between Shurgard Self Storage Europe Limited, Shurgard Self Storage SCA, Shurgard Holdings, Public Storage, and Thomas P. DiNapoli, Comptroller of the State of New York, as Trustee of the NYCRF. In exchange for the 51% interest in Shurgard Holdings, the NYCRF paid Shurgard Holdings approximately (euro)383.2 million ($605.6 million), to be adjusted for operating results of Shurgard Europe between December 31, 2007 and March 31, 2008. The description of the Subscription Agreement included in the foregoing does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Subscription Agreement, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 2.1 hereto and is incorporated herein by reference. Shurgard Holdings holds an interest in 173 self-storage facilities (of which 103 are wholly-owned) in seven European countries. Commencing March 31, 2008, the operations and balance sheet accounts of Shurgard Europe are no longer consolidated with Public Storage. As a result, Public Storage's investment in Shurgard Europe will be accounted for under the equity method. On March 31, 2008, Public Storage issued a press release announcing the completion of the transaction. A copy of the press release was included as Exhibit 99.1 to a Current Report on Form 8-K filed by Public Storage with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 1, 2008.

C. 18-101 et. seq.; WHEREAS, the Company, SSS SCA, Shurgard Guernsey and their Subsidiaries intend to engage in a reorganization whereby the Company will become the holding company for their collective operations in Europe, Shurgard Guernsey will become a direct subsidiary of the Company and SSS SCA will become an indirect subsidiary of the Company; WHEREAS, following the Investor's payment of the Subscription Price (as defined below and in the manner set forth below) to the Company and the subsequent acquisition of SSS SCA at the Closing (as defined below), the Investor will then hold as an investment in the Company 51% of the limited liability company interests of the Company ("Shares"); and WHEREAS, the Investor, with the assistance of professional advisers, has had access to a data room containing extensive information on the Company, SSS SCA, Shurgard Guernsey and their Subsidiaries and has performed a due diligence investigation on the basis of such information; NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, and of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, the parties agree as follows. In this Agreement, the term "Transaction Documents" refers collectively to this Agreement and the Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of the Company, dated March 31, 2008, by and between the Investor, Shurgard Storage Centers, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and Public Storage (the "LLC Agreement"). ARTICLE I SUBSCRIPTION AND SALE OF SHARES 1.1 SUBSCRIPTION AND SALE OF SHARES. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, the Investor will purchase from the Company, and the Company will issue and sell to the Investor, at the Closing immediately upon the receipt of and in return for the Subscription Price that number of Shares as will equal 51% of the outstanding Shares immediately following the Closing (the "Subscription"). 1.2 SUBSCRIPTION PRICE; SUBSCRIPTION PRICE ADJUSTMENTS. (a) At the Closing, the Investor agrees to pay to the Company (euro)382,288,500, payable in U.S. Dollars, in an amount calculated based on the exchange rate of Euros to 1
Dollars for the Business Day immediately preceding the Closing Date, as published in The Wall Street Journal (as adjusted pursuant to Section 1.2(b) and, after the Closing, Section 1.2(e), the "Subscription Price"). (b) The payment at Closing will be increased by a working capital adjustment equal to (euro)923,000, representing 51% of the Company's pro rata share of the consolidated working capital as of December 31, 2007, and as summarized on Annex C. (c) Not later than forty-five (45) days after the Closing Date, the Company shall prepare a consolidated statement of operations for the period from December 31, 2007 through March 31, 2008 (the "Operating Statement") and deliver such Operating Statement to the Investor. The Operating Statement shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis. The Investor and the Investor's accountants may make reasonable inquiries of the Company and its accountants, at reasonable times, upon reasonable advance notice, and without unreasonable interference to the Company's operations, regarding questions concerning or disagreements with the Operating Statement arising in the course of such review. As used in this Agreement, "Adjusted Net Income" means an amount equal to the consolidated net income (loss) of SSS SCA as reflected in the Operating Statement plus (1) the Company's pro rata share of depreciation and amortization expense from December 31, 2007 to the Closing, plus (2) non-cash employee share-base compensation expense and any other non-cash expense, plus (3) the amount of expenses incurred by SSS SCA, and Public Storage and its affiliates in connection with the arbitration proceeding relating to the joint venture entities First Shurgard Sprl and Second Shurgard Sprl from December 31, 2007 to the Closing, plus (4) the amount of expenses incurred by SSS SCA, Shurgard Guernsey and the Company, and Public Storage and its affiliates in connection with the Reorganization to the extent expensed from December 31, 2007 to the Closing, plus (5) the amount of expenses incurred by SSS SCA, Shurgard Guernsey and the Company, and Public Storage and its affiliates in connection with the negotiation and execution of the Loan Agreements to the extent expensed from December 31, 2007 to the Closing, up to $50,000, minus (6) any distributions paid to the PSA Member between December 31, 2007 and the Investor purchase of shares, minus (7) the Company's pro rata share of maintenance capital expenditures from December 31, 2007 to the Closing. For the avoidance of doubt, the Company shall reimburse Public Storage and its affiliates for all fees and expenses of the Reorganization and the Loan Agreement. (d) If the Investor disagrees with the Company's calculation of Adjusted Net Income, the Investor may, within thirty (30) days after delivery of the Operating Statement, deliver a notice to the Company disagreeing with the Company's calculation of the Adjusted Net Income amount and setting forth the basis of such dispute. Unless the Investor delivers a notice disagreeing with the Company's calculation of the Adjusted Net Income amount within such thirty (30) day period, the Operating Statement as delivered by the Company shall bind the parties. Any such notice of disagreement shall specify those items or amounts as to which the Investor disagrees and the basis for such disagreement. Following delivery of such a notice so disagreeing, the Investor and the Company shall in good faith attempt promptly to resolve any disagreement as to the computation of any item in the Operating Statement, and any items as to which 2
there is no disagreement shall be deemed agreed. If a resolution of such disagreement has not been effected within fifteen (15) days (or longer, as mutually agreed by the parties) after delivery of such letter, then either the Investor or the Company may submit any disagreement regarding the Operating Statement (a "Disputed Item") to Ernst & Young or other mutually acceptable party (the "Accountant") for determination. The Accountant shall be instructed to, in accordance with this Agreement, determine the amount of each Disputed Item and requested to complete such determination within thirty (30) days after the appointment of the Accountant. The Accountant shall not serve as an arbitrator. With respect to each Disputed Item, the Accountant shall adopt a position that is either equal to the Company's proposed position, equal to the Investor's proposed position, or between the positions proposed by the Company and the Investor. The determination of the Accountant shall be final and binding upon the Investor and the Company. Adjusted Net Income as finally determined or deemed to be determined in accordance herewith shall be referred to as "Closing Date Adjusted Net Income." The Investor and Public Storage shall enter into a customary engagement letter with the Accountant, which shall provide, inter alia, that all fees, costs and expenses of the Accountant shall be shared equally by the Investor and Public Storage and for customary indemnification of the Accountant by the Investor and Public Storage. (e) Upon final determination or deemed final determination of the Operating Statement, (a) if the Closing Date Adjusted Net Income is less than zero, then Public Storage shall pay, or cause to be paid, to the Investor, or its designee, the amount of (i) any such deficiency multiplied by (ii) 51% within two (2) Business Days after the determination of the Closing Date Adjusted Net Income, and (b) if the Closing Date Adjusted Net Income exceeds zero, then the Investor shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Public Storage, or its designee, (i) the amount of any such excess multiplied by (ii) 51% within five (5) Business Days after the determination of the Closing Date Adjusted Net Income.

Within 30 days of the Closing, the parties hereto and their advisors will together assess the advisability of applying to the relevant French tax authority for a favorable ruling confirming that (i) the real properties located in France and held either directly or indirectly by the Company's French subsidiaries are used by certain or all of them for the purposes of a non-real estate business within the meaning of Section 990 E 2(degree) (a) of the French General Tax Code (the "FTC") and therefore that (ii) any entity holding either directly or indirectly said real properties located in France shall not be liable for the French 3% tax set forth in Section 990 D et seq. of the FTC (the "3% Tax"). Unless the Investor decides in its sole discretion not to apply for such a ruling, or a favorable ruling has been received by December 1, 2008, the Company will, at its expense, prior to the end of 2008, restructure its ownership or operations in a manner designed to avoid the application of the 3% Tax, with that restructuring to be implemented so as to minimize adverse effects to the Company, its Subsidiaries and the other parties hereto. 3.11 LEGAL OPINION. At the Closing, the Investor shall receive the opinion of John S. Baumann, chief legal officer of Public Storage, and David Goldberg, special counsel to Public Storage, addressed to the Investor, dated as of the Closing Date, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A. 22
ARTICLE IV [RESERVED] ARTICLE V INDEMNIFICATION 5.1 SURVIVAL PERIODS. All representations and warranties of the parties hereto contained in this Agreement shall survive the Closing for a period of one (1) year following the date of the Closing; provided, that the representations and warranties contained in Sections 2.2(c), (e), (f) and (s) and Sections 2.3(a) and (b) shall survive the Closing until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations underlying any such claim. In the event that an Indemnified Party (as defined below) provides written notice in accordance with Section 5.3 to the Indemnifying Party (as defined below) within the applicable period of time set forth in the first sentence of this Section 5.1, and such claim shall not have been finally resolved before the expiration of the applicable period referred to in the first sentence of this Section 5.1, any representation or warranty that is the basis for such claim shall continue to survive and shall remain a basis for indemnity only as to such specific claim (but as to no other claim) until such claim is finally resolved. This Section 5.1 shall not limit any covenant or agreement of the parties contained in this Agreement which by its terms contemplates performance after the Closing, and shall not extend the applicability of any covenant or agreement of the parties contained in this Agreement which by its terms solely relates to the period between the date hereof and the Closing. 5.2 INDEMNIFICATION. (a) Subject to the other provisions of this Article V and the accuracy of the representation in Section 2.1(b), from and after the Closing, Public Storage shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Investor and its officers, directors, members, employees, agents, successors and assigns (the "Investor Group") from and against any and all costs and expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees), suits, proceedings, judgments, settlements, fines, losses, claims, liabilities, interest, awards, penalties, demands, assessments and damages (including actual losses to the Company but excluding punitive, special, exemplary, consequential, incidental or indirect damages regardless of legal theory other than to the extent such amounts are required to be paid to a third party) (collectively, "Damages") to the extent relating to or arising out of (i) any breach of any representation or warranty made by Public Storage, the Company, Shurgard Guernsey or SSS SCA in this Agreement; provided that the matters disclosed in Section 2.2(j)(2)(b) - (f), 2.2(j)(3), 2.2(j)(4), 2.2(n)(5)(a), 2.2(o) or 2.2(s) of the Company Disclosure Letter shall not constitute exceptions to the representations and warranties to the extent that, and Public Storage shall, pursuant to this Section 5.2, indemnify the Investor Group for the amount by which, (x) the aggregate Damages (excluding attorneys' fees solely for purposes of determining whether the following threshold has been met) from any breaches of any representations or warranties made by Public Storage, the Company, Shurgard Guernsey or SSS SCA in this Agreement relating to or arising out of such matters (A) actually incurred on or prior to March 15, 2009 or (B) expected to be incurred as of March 15, 2009 such that the Company would be required in accordance with applicable international accounting standards to increase the reserve for such matter (provided that, in the case of this clause (B), Public Storage shall only be required to indemnify the Indemnified Parties for Damages if and when such Damages are actually incurred) exceeds (y) the aggregate amount of the reserves 23
for the matters described in clauses (A) and (B) above reserved for in the December 31, 2007 financial statements, and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Investor's Knowledge of such matter shall not preclude any claim for Damages hereunder, or (ii) breach of or the failure to perform any covenant, agreement or undertaking, made by or on behalf of the Company, Shurgard Guernsey, SSS SCA or Public Storage under this Agreement, required to be taken prior to the Closing. For purposes of this Agreement, Damages incurred by the Company or its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be Damages to the Investor in proportion to its then-current ownership percentage of the Company. (b) The Investor shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, Shurgard Guernsey, SSS SCA and their officers, directors, members, employees, agents, successors and assigns (the "Seller Group") from any Damages to the extent caused by (i) any breach of any representation or warranty made by the Investor in this Agreement, or (ii) breach of or the failure to perform any covenant, agreement or undertaking, made by or on behalf of the Investor under this Agreement, required to be taken prior to the Closing. (c) For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Indemnified Party" shall mean the Investor Group or Seller Group, as applicable, that is entitled to indemnification under Section 5.2 which shall incur or suffer any Damages in respect of which indemnification may be sought pursuant to the terms of this Article V. For purposes of this Agreement, Damages shall be calculated after giving effect to any amounts actually recovered from third parties, including amounts actually recovered under insurance policies with respect to such Damages (net of any costs of such recovery, out-of pocket prosecution costs and similar costs). Any Indemnified Party having a claim under these indemnification provisions shall make a good faith effort to recover all losses, costs, Damages and expenses from insurers of such Indemnified Party under applicable insurance policies so as to reduce the amount of any Damages hereunder. 5.3 CLAIMS. If an Indemnified Party intends to seek indemnification pursuant to this Article V with respect to third party claims, such Indemnified Party shall promptly provide written notice to the party from whom indemnification is being sought (the "Indemnifying Party"), in writing in accordance with Section 6.5 hereof of such claim describing such claim in reasonable detail including the sections of this Agreement which form the basis for such claim; copies of all material written evidence thereof and the estimated amount of the Damages that have been or may be sustained by an Indemnified Party; provided that the failure to provide such notice shall not affect the obligations of the Indemnifying Party unless it is actually materially prejudiced thereby, subject, however, to the time periods specified in Section 5.1 hereof. The Indemnifying Party may assume the defense and control of any third party claim if it provides notice to the Indemnified Party within ten (10) Business Days from the date on which the Indemnifying Party received notice of the third party claim, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and if it so elects the Indemnifying Party will not be liable to the Indemnified Party for legal expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof, but the Indemnifying Party shall 24
allow the Indemnified Party a reasonable opportunity to participate in the defense of such third party claim with its own counsel and at its own expense; provided that if the Indemnified Party is advised in writing by counsel chosen by it that a conflict of interest would exist if the same counsel were to represent such Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party, then the applicable Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to participate in any such defense with one separate counsel for all Indemnified Parties at the reasonable expense of the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnifying Party will not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement except with the written consent of the Indemnified Party; provided, however, that the consent of the Indemnified Party shall not be required if all of the following conditions are met: (i) the terms of the judgment or proposed settlement include as an unconditional term thereof the giving to the Indemnified Party by the third party of a release of the Indemnified Party from all liability in respect of such third party claim, (ii) there is no finding or admission of (A) any violation of Law by the Indemnified Party (or any Affiliate thereof), and (B) no material effect on any other Action or claims of a similar nature that may be made against the Indemnified Party (or any Affiliate thereof), and (iii) the sole form of relief is monetary damages that are paid in full by the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnified Party will provide reasonable cooperation in the defense of the Third Party Claim. 5.4 Limitation of Liability. ------------------------ (a) In no event shall Public Storage be liable for indemnification pursuant to Section 5.2 unless and until the amount of an individual claim exceeds (euro)50,000 (each claim so in excess of (euro)50,000, a "Qualifying Claim") and the aggregate of all such Qualifying Claims result in total Damages which are incurred or suffered by the Investor Group that exceed 0.5% of the Subscription Price (the "Threshold"), in which case the Investor shall be entitled to indemnification for the entirety of the aggregate of all such Qualifying Claims; and provided, however, that the aggregate liability of Public Storage pursuant to Section 5.2 shall not be in excess of an aggregate amount of 5% of the Subscription Price (the "Cap"). Neither the Threshold nor the Cap shall be applicable to Public Storage's liability for indemnification with respect to Damages relating to or arising out of (i) acts of fraud or willful misrepresentation or (ii) any breach of the representations of the Company, Shurgard Guernsey or SSS SCA contained in Sections 2.2(c), (e) and (f). (b) In no event shall the Investor be liable for indemnification pursuant to Section 5.2(c) for any claim unless and until the aggregate of all Qualifying Claims result in total Damages which are incurred or suffered by the Seller Group exceed the Threshold, in which case the Seller Group shall be entitled to indemnification for the entirety of the aggregate of all such Qualifying Claims; and provided, however, that the aggregate liability of the Investor pursuant to Section 5.2(c) shall not be in excess of the Cap. Neither the Threshold nor the Cap shall be applicable to the Investor's liability for indemnification with respect to Damages relating to or arising out of (i) acts of fraud or willful misrepresentation or (ii) any breach of the representations of the Investor contained in Sections 2.3(a) and (b); provided, however, that the aggregate liability of the Investor for indemnification with respect to Damages relating to or arising out of any breach of the representations of the Investor contained in Sections 2.3(a) and (b) shall not be in excess of the Subscription Price. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Investor's aggregate liability under this Article V shall not exceed the Subscription Price. (c) No Indemnified Party shall be entitled to any recovery under this Article V in respect of any Damages to the extent that such recovery would constitute a duplicative payment of amounts recovered as a purchase price adjustment pursuant to Section 1.2. 25
5.5 SOLE REMEDY/WAIVER. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that, in the event that the Closing occurs, the remedies provided for in this Agreement shall be the parties' sole and exclusive monetary remedy for any breach of the representations and warranties and covenants, undertakings and agreements contained in this Agreement other than for a claim of fraud and except that nothing in this Section 5.5 shall prevent a party from seeking specific performance in accordance with Section 6.12. ARTICLE VI MISCELLANEOUS 6.1 AMENDMENT. No amendment or waiver of any provision of this Agreement will be effective with respect to any party unless made in writing and signed by an officer of a duly authorized representative of such party. 6.2 WAIVER. The conditions to each party's obligation to consummate the Subscription are for the sole benefit of such party and may be waived by such party in whole or in part to the extent permitted by applicable Law. No waiver will be effective unless it is in a writing signed by a duly authorized officer of the waiving party that makes express reference to the provision or provisions subject to such waiver. 6.3 COUNTERPARTS AND FACSIMILE. For the convenience of the parties hereto, this Agreement may be executed in any number of separate counterparts, each such counterpart being deemed to be an original instrument, and all such counterparts will together constitute the same agreement. Executed signature pages to this Agreement may be delivered by facsimile and such facsimiles will be deemed as sufficient as if actual signature pages had been delivered. 6.4 GOVERNING LAW; JURISDICTION. This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of New York applicable to contracts made and to be performed entirely within such State. The parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consent to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in the State of New York for any actions, suits or proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. 6.5 NOTICES.

Exhibit 99.1 UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION On March 31, 2008, Public Storage entered into an agreement with the New York Common Retirement Fund ("NYCRF") whereby NYCRF acquired a 51% interest in Public Storage's Shurgard Europe operations for approximately (euro)383.2 million ($605.6 million), plus an adjustment for operating results of Shurgard Europe between December 31, 2007 and March 31, 2008. NYCRF's acquisition, referred to hereinafter as the "Transaction," was completed on March 31, 2008. Shurgard Europe held substantially all of Public Storage's operations in Europe, except for a single property located in the United Kingdom which Public Storage continues to wholly own. Public Storage will own the remaining 49% interest and is the managing member of Shurgard European Holdings LLC, a joint venture formed to own Shurgard Europe's operations ("the Joint Venture"). The Joint Venture includes Shurgard Europe's 20% equity interest in two existing ventures which are the subject of a previously disclosed arbitration. If the remaining interests in those ventures can be acquired, they may be incorporated into the newly-formed joint venture. In connection with the Transaction, the intercompany debt owed by Shurgard Europe to Public Storage was modified to (i) fix the interest rate at 7.5% per year, (ii) adjust the outstanding balance to (euro)391 million (approximately $620 million) as of March 31, 2008, and (iii) modify the term of the debt to one year with an additional one year extension. In addition, Public Storage is committed to provide additional loans to Shurgard Europe, under the same terms and conditions, up to an additional (euro)305 million to fund Shurgard Europe's obligations to repay existing third-party indebtedness owed by the two previously mentioned ventures and the possible acquisition of the remaining interest in those two ventures. Shurgard Europe intends to repay all of its related-party debt to Public Storage through the issuance of third-party debt as soon as market conditions permit, but no later than March 31, 2010. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2007 has been prepared as if the Transaction occurred on December 31, 2007. As a result of the Transaction, Public Storage will begin to account for its investment in Shurgard Europe under the equity method, accordingly, Shurgard Europe's accounts will no longer be consolidated with Public Storage's. Pro forma adjustments have been made to the historical condensed consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2007 to reflect the de-consolidation of Shurgard Europe's accounts, the gain to be recorded upon consumation of the Transaction, and the use of the equity method to account for Public Storage's remaining 49% interest in Shurgard Europe. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2007 has been prepared as if the Transaction occurred on January 1, 2007. Pro forma adjustments have been made to the historical condensed consolidated income statement for the year ended December 31, 2007 to reflect the de-consolidation of Shurgard Europe's accounts, the Transaction and the use of the equity method to account for Public Storage's remaining 49% interest in Shurgard Europe. In addition, pro forma adjustments have been made to reflect interest income related to the intercompany loans due from Shurgard Europe to Public Storage and license fees payable by Shurgard Europe to Public Storage pursuant to a contract. 1
The pro forma adjustments do not reflect the impact of changes in exchange rates, principally of the U.S. Dollar relative to the Euro, through the transaction date of March 31, 2008. The income statement reflects the average exchange rate of the U.S. Dollar relative to the Euro of 1.370 in the year ended December 31, 2007, while the December 31, 2007 balance sheet reflects the exchange rate of 1.472 at December 31, 2007. The estimated gain on sale of approximately $307,704,000, and the $25,533,000 realized exchange gain reflected in the December 31, 2007 pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheet does not include the impact of activities and other items, including changes in exchange rates, recognized in the period from December 31, 2007 through the date of consummation of the Transaction of March 31, 2008 (including the aforementioned contractual adjustment, which has not been determined, to the proceeds for the operating results of Shurgard Europe between December 31, 2007 and March 31, 2008). The gain to actually be recorded at March 31, 2008 has not yet been determined, and could be substantially different. The pro forma adjustments are based on currently available information and on certain assumptions as set forth in the accompanying notes to the pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements that we believe are reasonable in the circumstances. The actual amounts could differ materially from these amounts. In addition, the pro forma condensed consolidated financial information does not reflect changes that may occur as a result of activities subsequent to the Transaction. The pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with the historical financial statements of Public Storage, which are included in Pubic Storage's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. You can find this report at the Securities and Exchange Commission's website at http//www.sec.gov. The following pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements are presented for illustrative purposes only and do not purport to represent what Public Storage's results of operations would actually have been if the Transaction had in fact occurred as of January 1, 2007 or to project Public Storage's results of operations for any future date or period. We cannot assure you that the assumptions used in the preparation of the pro forma financial information will prove to be correct. 2

PUBLIC STORAGE NOTES TO PRO FORMA CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET December 31, 2007 (Unaudited) 1. RECEIPT OF PROCEEDS FROM SALE OF SHURGARD EUROPE In connection with the Transaction, we received gross proceeds of (euro)383.2 million ($605,627,000). In addition, we incurred estimated related costs including accounting, tax, legal, and other advisory and consulting services of approximately $3,500,000. As a result, our net proceeds were approximately $602,127,000. The following adjustments were made to reflect the receipt of $602,127,000 in net proceeds: Amounts in thousands ------------------ Increase to cash ($605,627,000 in gross proceeds, less $3,500,000 in estimated transaction costs).............. $ 602,127 Unallocated disposition proceeds............................. $ (602,127) 2. DE-CONSOLIDATION OF SHURGARD EUROPE Prior to the Transaction, the accounts of Shurgard Europe were consolidated with Public Storage's for financial reporting purposes. Concurrent with the Transaction, Shurgard Europe began to be operated in the Joint Venture, in which we hold a 49% interest and the institutional investor holds 51% of the equity interest. We have determined that the Joint Venture is not a Variable Interest Entity under the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board's Interpretation 46(R), "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities." Based upon the governing documents under which the Joint Venture operates, effective March 31, 2008, we are the managing member. However, NYCRF substantially participates in the decision-making and operations of the Joint Venture, and as a result, we do not control the Joint Venture. Accordingly, we will de-consolidate Shurgard Europe effective March 31, 2008. The following adjustments reflect the deconsolidation of Shurgard Europe: Adjustments have been recorded to eliminate the historical assets of Shurgard Europe at December 31, 2007: Amounts in thousands --------------------- o Cash and cash equivalents....................... $ (31,602) o Operating real estate facilities................ (1,573,527) o Construction in process......................... (30,360) o Intangible assets............................... (85,580) o Other assets.................................... (56,612) Adjustment have been recorded to eliminate the historical liabilities and minority interest of Shurgard Europe at December 31, 2007: o Notes payable................................... $ (384,045) o Accrued and other liabilities................... (100,443) o Minority interest - other....................... (140,385) The equity interest acquired by NYCRF was subject to notes payable to our wholly-owned U.S. subsidiaries of approximately (euro)391 million ($575,508,000 based upon the exchange rate of the U.S. Dollar relative to the Euro of 1.472 at December 31, 2007). The historical amounts of such intercompany balances were eliminated in consolidation on our historical December 31, 2007 balance sheet. The following adjustments reflect the recording of this intercompany note: 4
PUBLIC STORAGE NOTES TO PRO FORMA CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET December 31, 2007 (Unaudited) 3. ALLOCATION OF PROCEEDS AND RECORDING OF GAIN ON SALE We expect to record a gain on sale, representing the difference between the estimated net proceeds of $602,127,000 and 51% of our existing $577,300,000 net equity investment in Shurgard Europe. The gain is estimated, based upon the December 31, 2007 balances, to be approximately $307,704,000. In addition, at December 31, 2007, we had approximately $50,065,000 in accumulated other comprehensive income related to cumulative exchange gains with respect to our investment in Shurgard Europe, of which 51% has become realized as a result of our disposition, resulting in an additional $25,533,000 of realized exchange gain. The actual gain to be recorded at March 31, 2008, and the actual realized cumulative exchange gain, will be based upon the book values of the assets and liabilities of Shurgard Europe at March 31, 2008, which will include the impact of activity, including changes in exchange rates, between December 31, 2007 and March 31, 2008 (including the aforementioned contractual adjustment, which has not been determined, to the disposition proceeds for the operating results of Shurgard Europe between December 31, 2007 and March 31, 2008). The actual gain at March 31, 2008 has not yet been determined, and could be substantially different from the amount disclosed herein. The following adjustments have been recorded to reflect the impact of the estimated gain on our balance sheet as if the Transaction had occurred on December 31, 2007. 5

PUBLIC STORAGE NOTES TO PRO FORMA CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME For the Year Ended December 31, 2007 (Unaudited) 1. ELIMINATION OF HISTORICAL AMOUNTS OF SHURGARD EUROPE INCLUDED IN PUBLIC STORAGE'S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Prior to the Transaction, the accounts of Shurgard Europe were consolidated with Public Storage's for financial reporting purposes. Concurrent with the Transaction, Shurgard Europe began to be operated in the Joint Venture, in which we hold a 49% interest and NYCRF holds 51% of the equity interest. We have determined that the Joint Venture is not a Variable Interest Entity under the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board's Interpretation 46(R), "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities." Based upon the governing documents under which the Joint Venture operates, effective March 31, 2008, we are the managing member. However, NYCRF substantially participates in the decision-making and operations of the Joint Venture, and as a result, we do not control the Joint Venture. Accordingly, we will de-consolidate Shurgard Europe effective March 31, 2008. The following adjustments reflect the elimination of the amounts included in our historical financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2007 with respect to Shurgard Europe. The amounts reflected in our financial statements are based upon the average exchange rate of the US Dollar relative to the Euro of approximately 1.370. 8
