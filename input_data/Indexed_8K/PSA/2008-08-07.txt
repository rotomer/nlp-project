News Release Public Storage 701 Western Avenue Glendale, CA 91201-2349 www.publicstorage.com - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- For Release: Immediately Date: August 7, 2008 Contact: Clemente Teng (818) 244-8080 PUBLIC STORAGE REPORTS RESULTS FOR THE SECOND QUARTER ENDED JUNE 30, 2008 GLENDALE, California - Public Storage (NYSE:PSA) announced today operating results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2008. OPERATING RESULTS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2008: - ----------------------------------------------------------- Net income for the three months ended June 30, 2008 was $133.8 million compared to $77.1 million for the same period in 2007, representing an increase of $56.7 million. This improvement is primarily due to improvements in operating income with respect to our domestic self-storage facilities and reduced amortization expense, offset in part by a reduction in foreign exchange gains and increased general and administrative expense due to $25.4 million in incentive compensation incurred in the quarter ended June 30, 2008 (see "Shurgard Europe" below). Net operating income (before depreciation and amortization) with respect to our domestic operations increased $14.1 million in the three months ended June 30, 2008 as compared to the same period in 2007 due to an increase of $8.6 million with respect to our domestic same-store operations combined with an increase of $5.5 million with respect to our other domestic facilities, primarily our facilities acquired in 2007 and 2008 and the continued fill-up of our newly developed and expanded facilities. Amortization expense for the quarter ended June 30, 2008, with respect to domestic assets, decreased by $33.8 million as compared to the same period in 2007, primarily due to a reduction in domestic amortization expense related to intangible assets that we obtained in the August 22, 2006 acquisition of Shurgard Storage Centers, Inc. (the "Shurgard Merger"). During the quarter ended June 30, 2008, we recognized a negligible foreign currency exchange loss totaling $2,000, as compared to a $5.6 million gain for the same period in 2007, relating primarily to intercompany loans due from Shurgard Europe. The foreign currency gains and losses were due to changes in the U.S. Dollar relative to the Euro during each period when converting these Euro denominated loans to U.S. Dollars for financial reporting purposes. See "Shurgard Europe" below for further information. For the three months ended June 30, 2008, net income allocable to our common shareholders (after allocating net income to our preferred and equity shareholders) was $68.1 million or $0.40 per common share on a diluted basis compared to $14.4 million or $0.08 per common share on a diluted basis for the same period in 2007, representing an improvement of $53.7 million or $0.32 per common share on a diluted basis. These improvements are due primarily to the impact of the factors described above with respect to the improvement in our net income. For the three months ended June 30, 2008 and 2007, we allocated $60.3 million and $57.3 million of our net income, respectively, to our preferred shareholders based on distributions paid during each period. The year-over-year increase is due primarily to the issuance of additional preferred securities in 2007. Weighted average diluted common shares were 168,814,000 and 170,213,000, respectively, for the three months ended June 30, 2008 and 2007. The decline is due to share repurchases in the first quarter of 2008. OPERATING RESULTS FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2008: - --------------------------------------------------------- Net income for the six months ended June 30, 2008 was $646.2 million compared to $136.9 million for the same period in 2007, representing an improvement of $509.3 million. This improvement is primarily due to a gain of $341.9 million recognized on the disposition of a 51% interest in Shurgard Europe on March 31, 2008 (see "Shurgard Europe" below for further information), improvements in operating income with respect to our domestic self-storage facilities and 1
reduced amortization expense, offset in part by a reduction in foreign exchange gains and increased general and administrative expense due to $27.9 million in incentive compensation incurred during the six months ended June 30, 2008 (see "Shurgard Europe" below). Net operating income (before depreciation and amortization) with respect to our domestic operations increased $22.7 million in the six months ended June 30, 2008 as compared to the same period in 2007 due to an increase of $13.4 million with respect to our domestic same-store operations combined with an increase of $9.3 million with respect to our other domestic facilities, primarily our facilities acquired in 2007 and 2008 and the continued fill-up of our newly developed and expanded facilities. Amortization expense for the six months ended June 30, 2008, with respect to domestic assets, decreased by $76.5 million as compared to the same period in 2007, primarily due to a reduction in domestic amortization expense related to intangible assets that we obtained in the Shurgard Merger. During the six months ended June 30, 2008, we recognized a foreign currency exchange gain totaling $41.0 million, as compared to a $10.6 million gain for the same period in 2007, relating primarily to intercompany loans due from Shurgard Europe. The gains in each period were due to changes in the U.S. Dollar relative to the Euro during each period when converting these Euro denominated loans to U.S. Dollars for financial reporting purposes. See "Shurgard Europe" below for further information. For the six months ended June 30, 2008, net income allocable to our common shareholders (after allocating net income to our preferred and equity shareholders) was $514.8 million or $3.05 per common share on a diluted basis compared to $10.1 million or $0.06 per common share on a diluted basis for the same period in 2007, representing an improvement of $504.7 million or $2.99 per common share on a diluted basis. These improvements are due primarily to the impact of the factors described above with respect to the improvement in our net income. For the six months ended June 30, 2008 and 2007, we allocated $120.7 million and $116.1 million of our net income, respectively, to our preferred shareholders based on distributions paid each period. The year-over-year increase is due primarily to the issuance of additional preferred securities in 2007. Weighted average diluted common shares were 169,022,000 and 170,275,000, respectively, for the six months ended June 30, 2008 and 2007. The decline is due primarily to share repurchases in the first quarter of 2008. FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS: - ---------------------- For each of the three month periods ended June 30, 2008 and 2007, funds from operations ("FFO") was $1.10 per common share on a diluted basis. For the three months ended June 30, 2008, FFO has been impacted as a result of incentive compensation with respect to our disposition of an interest in Shurgard Europe included in general and administrative expense totaling $25.4 million. FFO for the three months ended June 30, 2007 was impacted by (i) foreign currency exchange and derivative gains totaling $7.3 million, (ii) expenses related to our proposed offering of shares in our European business totaling $9.6 million, (iii) expenses incurred in connection with the Shurgard Merger totaling approximately $1.3 million, and (iv) expenses related to our reorganization as a Maryland REIT totaling approximately $2.0 million. For the six months ended June 30, 2008, FFO increased to $2.49 per common share on a diluted basis as compared to $2.15 per common share for the same period in 2007, representing an increase of $0.34 per common share, or 15.8%. For the six months ended June 30, 2008, FFO has been impacted by (i) incentive compensation with respect to our disposition of an interest in Shurgard Europe included in general and administrative expense totaling $27.9 million and (ii) foreign currency exchange and derivatives gain totaling $41.0 million ($11.6 million for the same period in 2007). FFO for the six months ended June 30, 2007 was also impacted by (i) expenses related to our proposed offering of shares in our European business totaling $9.6 million, (ii) expenses incurred in connection with the Shurgard Merger totaling approximately $5.3 million, (iii) expenses related to our reorganization as a Maryland REIT totaling approximately $2.0 million, and (iv) an increase in insurance proceeds with respect to damage caused by Hurricane Katrina of $2.7 million. The following table provides a summary of the impact of these items that have occurred during the three and six months ended June 30, 2008 and 2007: 2
FFO is a term defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT"). It is generally defined as net income before depreciation with respect to real estate assets and gains and losses on real estate assets. FFO is presented because management and many analysts consider FFO to be one measure of the performance of real estate companies. In addition, we believe that FFO is helpful to investors as an additional measure of the performance of a REIT, because net income includes the impact of depreciation, which assumes that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time, while we believe that the value of real estate fluctuates due to market conditions and in response to inflation. FFO computations do not consider scheduled principal payments on debt, capital improvements, distributions and other obligations of the Company. FFO is not a substitute for our cash flow or net income as a measure of our liquidity or operating performance or our ability to pay dividends. Other REITs may not compute FFO in the same manner; accordingly, FFO may not be comparable among REITs. See the attached reconciliation of net income to funds from operations included in the selected financial data attached to this press release. As previously noted, we have received net proceeds totaling approximately $609.1 million in connection with our March 31, 2008 disposition of a 51% interest in Shurgard Europe. These funds were invested in short-term liquid investments earning interest at interest rates averaging approximately 2.2% during the three months ended June 30, 2008. PROPERTY OPERATIONS -SAME STORE FACILITIES: - ------------------------------------------- The following table summarizes the historical operating results of 1,789 facilities that were all stabilized as of January 1, 2006 and contain approximately 109.4 million net rentable square feet, representing approximately 87% of the aggregate net rentable square feet of our U.S. consolidated self-storage portfolio at June 30, 2008. These facilities include 416 facilities acquired in August 2006 in connection with the Shurgard Merger. 3
Selected Operating Data for the Same Store - ------------------------------------------ Facilities (1,789 Facilities): - ------------------------------ a) See attached reconciliation of these amounts to our consolidated self-storage revenues and operating expenses. Revenues and cost of operations do not include ancillary revenues and expenses generated at the facilities with respect to tenant reinsurance, retail sales and truck rentals. "Other costs of management" included in cost of operations principally represents all the indirect costs incurred in the operations of the facilities. Indirect costs principally include supervisory costs and corporate overhead cost incurred to support the operating activities of the facilities. b) Net operating income (before depreciation and amortization) or "NOI" is a non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) financial measure that excludes the impact of depreciation expense. Although depreciation is an operating expense, we believe that NOI is a meaningful measure of operating performance, because we utilize NOI in making decisions with respect to capital allocations, in determining current property values, segment performance and comparing period-to-period and market-to-market property operating results. NOI is not a substitute for net operating income after depreciation in evaluating our operating results. c) Depreciation and amortization expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2008 decreased primarily due to a reduction in amortization expense related to intangible assets that we obtained in the Shurgard Merger. d) Square foot occupancies represent weighted average occupancy levels over the entire period. e) Realized annual rent per occupied square foot is computed by annualizing the result of dividing rental income by the weighted average occupied square footage for the period. Realized annual rent per occupied square foot takes into consideration promotional discounts and other items that reduce rental income from the contractual amounts due. 4
f) Annualized rental income per available square foot ("REVPAF") represents annualized rental income which excludes late charges and administrative fees divided by total available net rentable square feet. Rental income is also net of promotional discounts and collection costs, including bad debt expense. g) Late charges and administrative fees are excluded from the computation of realized annual rent per occupied square foot and REVPAF because exclusion of these amounts provides a better measure of our ongoing level of revenue, by excluding the volatility of late charges, which are dependent principally upon the level of tenant delinquency, and administrative fees, which are dependent principally upon the absolute level of move-ins for a period. h) In place annual rent per occupied square foot represents annualized contractual rents per occupied square foot without reductions for promotional discounts and excludes late charges and administrative fees. The following table summarizes additional selected financial data with respect to the Same Store Facilities (unaudited): SHURGARD EUROPE: - ---------------- As previously announced, on March 31, 2008, an institutional investor acquired a 51% interest in Shurgard Europe's operations. Public Storage owns the remaining 49% interest and is the managing member of the newly formed joint venture that now owns Shurgard Europe's operations. The intercompany loans to Shurgard Europe are denominated in Euros. At June 30, 2008, the loans totaled (euro)391.9 million ($618.7 million). No additional loans were made during the quarter ended June 30, 2008. The loans currently are not hedged for future currency exchange fluctuations; accordingly, the amount of U.S. Dollars that will be received on repayment will depend upon the currency exchange rates at the time. Based primarily upon the change in estimated U.S. Dollars to be received caused by fluctuation in currency exchange rates, a foreign currency translation loss of $2,000 and a gain of $41,012,000 were recorded in the three and six months ended June 30, 2008, respectively (gains of $5,553,000 and $10,593,000, respectively, during the same periods in 2007). 5
During the three and six months ended June 30, 2008, respectively, we incurred $25.4 million and $27.9 million, respectively, of incentive compensation expense with respect to the March 31, 2008 Shurgard Europe transaction. These amounts were included in our general and administrative expense. As a result of our disposition of a 51% interest, we began accounting for our investment in Shurgard Europe under the equity method; accordingly, Shurgard Europe's accounts are no longer consolidated with those of Public Storage effective March 31, 2008. Shurgard Europe has an interest in 178 facilities (9.3 million net rentable square feet) located in seven Western European countries. Included in this total are 74 facilities (3.7 million net rentable square feet) that are owned in two joint ventures in which Shurgard Europe has a 20% interest. The two joint ventures collectively had approximately $408 million of outstanding debt payable to third parties at June 30, 2008. A facility located in London, England was not included in the Shurgard Europe transaction discussed above. This facility is wholly owned by Public Storage, but continues to be managed by Shurgard Europe for a fee. At June 30, 2008, Shurgard Europe had five newly developed facilities under construction (273,000 net rentable square feet), with total estimated costs of approximately $44.8 million, and three expansion projects (110,000 net rentable square feet) with $28.9 million in estimated development costs. They also have nine projects in development (318,000 net rentable square feet) with a total estimated cost of $61.8 million. The development of these facilities is subject to various risks and contingencies. During the second quarter of 2008, Shurgard Europe completed the development of two wholly-owned facilities located in the Netherlands at a total cost of $10.9 million, adding 96,000 net rentable square feet to the portfolio. DEVELOPMENT AND ASSET ACQUISITION ACTIVITIES: - --------------------------------------------- During the second quarter of 2008, we acquired two self-storage facilities in California with net rentable square feet of 211,000 for an aggregate purchase price of $31.2 million, which includes the assumption of approximately $10.3 million of debt. We also completed a newly developed facility with 49,000 net rentable square feet at a total cost of $5.6 million and an expansion project at a total cost of $7.8 million with 84,000 net rentable square feet. At June 30, 2008, we had 25 projects that were either under construction or were expected to begin construction generally within the next year, comprised of two newly developed self-storage facilities (119,000 net rentable square feet) in the United States for a total estimated cost of $17.6 million, 22 projects (926,000 net additional rentable square feet) in the United States, which expand existing self-storage facilities and enhance their visual appeal for a total estimated cost of $85.5 million and expansion of one European facility located in London, England (21,000 net rentable square feet and total estimated costs of $6.6 million). These projects will be fully funded by us. Opening dates for these facilities are estimated through the next 24 months. The development of these facilities is subject to various risks and contingencies. ACQUISITION OF INTEREST IN ACQUISITION JOINT VENTURE: - ----------------------------------------------------- On July 21, 2008, we acquired the remaining interest that we did not own in an affiliated partnership (the "Acquisition Joint Venture") from an institutional investor for an aggregate purchase price of $45.8 million. The Acquisition Joint Venture owned 12 self-storage facilities. The purchase price included the repayment of approximately $38.4 million of debt due to the investor (bearing interest at 8.5% per annum) and the acquisition of their equity for approximately $7.4 million. SHARE REPURCHASES: - ------------------ As disclosed previously, our Board of Trustees has authorized the repurchase from time to time of up to 35,000,000 of our common shares on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. From January 1, 2008 through June 30, 2008, we repurchased a total of 1,520,196 common shares for an aggregate of approximately $111.9 million (none were repurchased from July 1, 2008 through August 7, 2008). We have 11,278,084 shares remaining on our repurchase authorization at August 7, 2008. DISTRIBUTIONS DECLARED: - ----------------------- On August 7, 2008 the Board of Trustees declared a quarterly distribution of $0.55 per regular common share and $0.6125 per share on the depositary shares each representing 1/1,000 of a share of Equity Shares, Series A. Distributions were also declared with respect to the Company's various series of preferred shares. All the distributions are payable on September 30, 2008 to shareholders of record as of September 15, 2008. 6

PUBLIC STORAGE SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA (Unaudited) Comparisons of our revenues and expenses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2008 to the same periods in 2007 are significantly impacted by the acquisition by an institutional investor of a 51% interest in Shurgard Europe on March 31, 2008, which resulted in the deconsolidation of Shurgard Europe. Shurgard Europe's revenues and expenses after March 31, 2008 are excluded from our statement of operations and, instead, our 49% equity share of Shurgard Europe's operating results are included in the line item "equity in earnings of real estate entities" and we also record interest and other income with respect to (i) the interest received on our intercompany notes from Shurgard Europe and (ii) license fee income. 8
(a) Commencing March 31, 2008, we account for our investment in Shurgard Europe using the equity method of accounting. Accordingly, we no longer present Shurgard Europe's revenues, expenses and other operating items with respect to periods after March 31, 2008, and we instead reflect our pro-rata share of Shurgard Europe's operations as "equity in earnings of real estate entities" along with interest and other income related to the note receivable from Shurgard Europe. For the quarter ended June 30, 2008, included in equity in earnings of real estate entities is $1,547,000 related to our investment in Shurgard Europe. These earnings are comprised of our 49% equity share of Shurgard Europe's net loss, combined with $6,276,000, representing 49% of the aggregate interest and trademark license income received from Shurgard Europe. Included in interest and other income for the quarter ended June 30, 2008, is an aggregate of $6,532,000 with respect to the note receivable from Shurgard Europe and trademark license fees, representing 51% of the aggregate interest and trademark license income received from Shurgard Europe. (b) Depreciation and amortization expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2008 decreased by $72.1 million and $126.0 million, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2007. This decrease is primarily due to a reduction in amortization expense related to domestic intangible assets that we obtained in the Shurgard Merger, combined with the impact of the deconsolidation of Shurgard Europe. (c) For the three and six months ended June 30, 2008, general and administrative expense includes additional incentive compensation totaling $25.4 million and $27.9 million, respectively, associated with the disposition of an interest in Shurgard Europe. In addition, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2007, we incurred additional expenses in connection with the proposed offering of shares of Shurgard Europe totaling approximately $9.6 million. (d) Gain on disposition of real estate investments includes a $341.9 million gain on our disposition of a 51% interest in Shurgard Europe on March 31, 2008. (e) Our foreign exchange gains and losses are primarily related to our intercompany loan to Shurgard Europe, representing the impact of the fluctuation in the exchange rate between U.S. Dollars and the Euro. 9
PUBLIC STORAGE SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA (a) On March 31, 2008, an institutional investor acquired a 51% interest in our European operations. As a result of the transaction, effective March 31, 2008 we no longer consolidate the accounts of Shurgard Europe and account for our investment on the equity method of accounting. 10
Shurgard European Same Store Selected Operating Data - ---------------------------------------------------- The operating data presented in the table below for each period reflects the historical data for the European Same Store Portfolio of 96 facilities that have been operated on a stabilized basis since January 1, 2006. As described more fully in "Shurgard Europe" above, we deconsolidated Shurgard Europe effective March 31, 2008 and, accordingly, the revenues and cost of operations for the quarter ended June 30, 2008 are not included in our income statements. Selected Operating Data for the 96 facilities - --------------------------------------------- operated by Shurgard Europe on a stabilized basis - ------------------------------------------------- since January 1, 2006 ("Europe Same Store - -------------------------------------------- Facilities"): (unaudited) - ------------------------- (a) For comparative purposes, these amounts are presented on a constant exchange rate basis. The amounts for the three and six months ended June 30, 2007 have been restated using the actual exchange rate for the same periods in 2008. The exchange rate for the Euro relative to the U.S. Dollar averaged 1.563 and 1.530 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2008, respectively. (b) Revenues and cost of operations do not include ancillary revenues and expenses generated at the facilities with respect to tenant reinsurance and retail sales. "Other costs of management" included in cost of operations principally represents all the indirect costs incurred in the operations of the facilities. Indirect costs principally include supervisory costs and corporate overhead cost incurred to support the operating activities of the facilities. 11
(c) Net operating income (before depreciation and amortization) or "NOI" is a non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) financial measure that excludes the impact of depreciation expense. Although depreciation is an operating expense, we believe that NOI is a meaningful measure of operating performance, because we utilize NOI in making decisions with respect to capital allocations, in determining current property values, segment performance, and comparing period-to-period and market-to-market property operating results. NOI is not a substitute for net operating income after depreciation in evaluating our operating results. (d) Square foot occupancies represent weighted average occupancy levels over the entire period. (e) Realized annual rent per occupied square foot is computed by annualizing the result of dividing rental income by the weighted average occupied square footage for the period. Realized annual rent per occupied square foot takes into consideration promotional discounts and other items that reduce rental income from the contractual amounts due. (f) Annualized rental income per available square foot ("REVPAF") represents annualized rental income which excludes late charges and administrative fees divided by total available net rentable square feet. Rental income is also net of promotional discounts and collection costs, including bad debt expense. (g) Late charges and administrative fees are excluded from the computation of realized annual rent per occupied square foot and REVPAF because exclusion of these amounts provides a better measure of our ongoing level of revenue, by excluding the volatility of late charges, which are dependent principally upon the level of tenant delinquency, and administrative fees, which are dependent principally upon the absolute level of move-ins for a period. (h) In place annual rent per occupied square foot represents annualized contractual rents per occupied square foot without reductions for promotional discounts and excludes late charges and administrative fees. 12
PUBLIC STORAGE SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA Computation of Funds from Operations (a) (Unaudited) (a) Funds from operations ("FFO") is a term defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT"). FFO is a non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) financial measure. FFO is generally defined as net income before depreciation with respect to real estate assets and gains and losses on real estate assets. FFO is presented because management and many analysts consider FFO to be one measure of the performance of real estate companies. In addition, we believe that FFO is helpful to investors as an additional measure of the performance of a REIT, because net income includes the impact of depreciation, which assumes that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time, while we believe that the value of real estate fluctuates due to market conditions and in response to inflation. FFO computations do not consider scheduled principal payments on debt, capital improvements, distributions, and other obligations of the Company. FFO is not a substitute for our cash flow or net income as a measure of our liquidity or operating performance or our ability to pay dividends. Other REITs may not compute FFO in the same manner; accordingly, FFO may not be comparable among REITs. 13

Other REITs may not compute FFO in the same manner; accordingly, FFO may not be comparable among REITs. (b) Funds available for distribution ("FAD") represents FFO, plus (i) impairment charges with respect to real estate assets, (ii) the non-cash portion of stock-based compensation expense, (iii) income allocation to preferred equity holders in accordance with EITF Topic D-42, less capital expenditures to maintain our facilities and elimination of any gain or loss on foreign exchange or from derivatives. The distribution payout ratio is computed by dividing the distribution paid by FAD. FAD is presented because many analysts consider it to be a measure of the performance and liquidity of real estate companies and because we believe that FAD is helpful to investors as an additional measure of the performance of a REIT. FAD is not a substitute for our cash flow or net income as a measure of our liquidity, operating performance, or our ability to pay dividends. FAD does not take into consideration required principal payments on debt. Other REITs may not compute FAD in the same manner; accordingly, FAD may not be comparable among REITs. 14
