Exhibit 99.1 News Release Public Storage 701 Western Avenue Glendale, CA 91201-2349 www.publicstorage.com - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- For Release: Immediately Date: August 6, 2009 Contact: Clemente Teng (818) 244-8080 Public Storage Reports Results for the Second Quarter Ended June 30, 2009 GLENDALE, California - Public Storage (NYSE:PSA) announced today operating results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2009. OPERATING RESULTS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2009 - ---------------------------------------------------------- Net income to our shareholders for the three months ended June 30, 2009 was $199.2 million compared to $133.8 million for the same period in 2008, representing an increase of $65.4 million. This increase is primarily due to (i) a $33.2 million foreign exchange gain during the quarter ended June 30, 2009, (ii) a $25.4 million reduction in general and administrative expenses due to incentive compensation incurred in the quarter ended June 30, 2008 related to our disposition of an interest in Shurgard Europe, and (iii) an $11.0 million reduction in depreciation and amortization, primarily due to reduced intangible amortization, offset by (iv) a reduction in Same Store facility operations and (v) an impairment charge included in discontinued operations with respect to intangible assets totaling $8.2 million in the quarter ended June 30, 2009. Revenues for the Same Store Facilities decreased 3.5% or $12.6 million in the quarter ended June 30, 2009 as compared to the same period in 2008, due to a 2.9% reduction in realized rent per occupied square foot, combined with a 1.1% reduction in average occupancies. Cost of operations for the Same Store Facilities declined 3.4% or $4.1 million in the quarter ended June 30, 2009 as compared to the same period in 2008, due primarily to a $2.6 million reduction in media advertising and a $1.5 million reduction in repairs and maintenance, offset by a 4.3% ($1.5 million) increase in property tax expense. For the three months ended June 30, 2009, net income allocable to our common shareholders (after allocating net income to our preferred and equity shareholders) was $135.5 million or $0.80 per common share on a diluted basis compared to $68.0 million or $0.40 per common share on a diluted basis for the same period in 2008, representing an increase of $67.5 million or $0.40 per common share on a diluted basis. These increases are primarily due to the impact of the factors described above. Weighted average diluted common shares were 168,528,000 and 168,479,000, respectively, for the three months ended June 30, 2009 and 2008. OPERATING RESULTS FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2009 - -------------------------------------------------------- Net income to our shareholders for the six months ended June 30, 2009 was $416.2 million compared to $646.2 million for the same period in 2008, representing a decrease of $230.0 million. This decrease is primarily due to (i) a gain of $341.8 million in the six months ended June 30, 2008 related to our disposition of an interest in Shurgard Europe and (ii) an impairment charge included in discontinued operations with respect to intangible assets totaling $8.2 million in the six months ended June 30, 2009, (iii) a foreign exchange gain of $41.0 million during the same period in 2008, and (iv) a reduction in Same Store operations, partially offset by (v) a $72.0 million reduction in earnings allocated to our preferred partnership unitholders in the first quarter of 2009 associated with the redemption of securities, (vi) a reduction in general and administrative expenses due to $27.9 million in incentive compensation incurred in the six months ended June 30, 2008 related to our disposition of an interest in Shurgard Europe, and (vii) a $26.5 million reduction in depreciation and amortization related to our domestic assets, primarily representing reduced intangible amortization. Revenues for the Same Store Facilities decreased 2.2% or $15.4 million in the six months ended June 30, 2009 as compared to the same period in 2008, due to a 1.5% reduction in realized rent per occupied square foot, combined with a 1.1% reduction in average occupancies. Cost of operations for the Same Store Facilities declined 1.2% or $2.9 million in the six months ended June 30, 2009 as compared to the same period in 2008, due primarily to a $1.4 million reduction in media advertising and a $2.2 million reduction in repairs and maintenance, offset by a 4.1% ($2.9 million) increase in property tax expense. For the six months ended June 30, 2009, net income allocable to our common shareholders (after allocating net income to our preferred and equity 1
shareholders) was $295.0 million or $1.75 per common share on a diluted basis compared to $512.8 million or $3.04 per common share on a diluted basis for the same period in 2008, representing a decrease of $217.8 million or $1.29 per common share on a diluted basis. These decreases are primarily due to the impact of the factors described above. Weighted average diluted common shares were 168,501,000 and 168,731,000, respectively, for the six months ended June 30, 2009 and 2008. FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS - --------------------- For the three months ended June 30, 2009, funds from operations ("FFO") increased to $1.40 per common share on a diluted basis as compared to $1.10 per common share for the same period in 2008, representing an increase of $0.30 per common share, or 27.3%. For the three months ended June 30, 2009, FFO was impacted by (i) a foreign currency exchange gain totaling $33.2 million (compared to an exchange loss of $2,000 for the same period in 2008) and (ii) an impairment charge with respect to an intangible asset resulting from an eminent domain proceeding totaling $8.2 million. For the three months ended June 30, 2008, FFO was impacted as a result of incentive compensation with respect to our disposition of an interest in Shurgard Europe included in general and administrative expense totaling $25.4 million. For the six months ended June 30, 2009, FFO increased to $2.91 per common share on a diluted basis as compared to $2.49 per common share for the same period in 2008, representing an increase of $0.42 per share, or 16.9%. For the six months ended June 30, 2009, FFO has been impacted by (i) a foreign currency exchange loss totaling $1.5 million (compared to a gain of $41.0 million for the same period in 2008), (ii) an impairment charge with respect to an intangible asset resulting from an eminent domain proceeding totaling $8.2 million, (iii) costs incurred to terminate and wind down our truck rental operations of $3.5 million, (iv) a $78.2 million reduction in the allocation of net income to our preferred shareholders and unitholders pursuant to the redemption of our preferred securities, combined with our pro-rata share ($16.3 million) of PS Business Park's ("PSB") earnings representing the benefit from its preferred securities repurchases which is included in equity in earnings, and (v) a gain on the early redemption of debt totaling $4.1 million. FFO for the six months ended June 30, 2008 was also impacted by incentive compensation with respect to our disposition of an interest in Shurgard Europe included in general and administrative expense totaling $27.9 million. The following table provides a summary of the impact of these items that occurred during the three and six months ended June 30, 2009 and 2008: PROPERTY OPERATIONS - SAME STORE FACILITIES - ------------------------------------------- The Same Store group of facilities represents those 1,899 facilities that we have owned, and have been operated on a stabilized basis, since January 1, 2007 and therefore provide meaningful comparisons for 2007, 2008, and 2009. The following table summarizes the historical operating results of these 1,899 facilities (117.5 million net rentable square feet) that represent approximately 93% of the aggregate net rentable square feet of our U.S. consolidated self-storage portfolio at June 30, 2009. 2
a) Seeattached reconciliation of these amounts to our consolidated self-storage revenues and operating expenses. Revenues and cost of operations do not include ancillary revenues and expenses generated at the facilities with respect to tenant reinsurance, retail sales and truck rentals. "Other costs of management" included in cost of operations principally represents all the indirect costs incurred in the operations of the facilities. Indirect costs principally include supervisory costs and corporate overhead cost incurred to support the operating activities of the facilities. b) Square foot occupancies represent weighted average occupancy levels over the entire period. c) Realized annual rent per occupied square foot is computed by annualizing the result of dividing rental income (which excludes late charges and administrative fees) by the weighted average occupied square feet for the period. Realized annual rent per occupied square foot takes into consideration promotional discounts and other items that reduce rental income from the contractual amounts due. d) Late charges and administrative fees are excluded from the computation of realized annual rent per occupied square foot and REVPAF. Exclusion of these amounts provides a better measure of our ongoing level of revenue, by excluding the volatility of late charges, which are dependent principally upon the level of tenant delinquency, and administrative fees, which are dependent principally upon the absolute level of move-ins for a period. e) Realized annual rent per available foot or "REVPAF" is computed by dividing rental income (which excludes late charges and administrative fees) by the total available net rentable square feet for the period. f) In place annual rent per occupied square foot represents annualized contractual rents per occupied square foot without reductions for promotional discounts and excludes late charges and administrative fees. 3
The following table summarizes additional selected financial data with respect to the Same Store Facilities (unaudited): SHURGARD EUROPE - --------------- As previously announced, on March 31, 2008, an institutional investor acquired a 51% interest in Shurgard Europe's operations. We own the remaining 49% interest and we are the managing member of the newly formed joint venture that now owns Shurgard Europe's operations. As a result of this transaction, we began accounting for our investment in Shurgard Europe under the equity method effective March 31, 2008. Shurgard Europe has an interest in 184 facilities (9.8 million net rentable square feet) located in seven Western European countries. Included in this total are 72 facilities (3.6 million net rentable square feet) that are owned by two joint ventures in which Shurgard Europe has a 20% interest. The two joint ventures collectively had approximately (euro)233 million ($328 million) of outstanding debt at June 30, 2009. The loans are payable to various banks and are non-recourse to Shurgard Europe. The maturity dates of each of the JV loans were recently extended. One of the JV loans, totaling (euro)112 million ($158 million), is now due May 2012 and the other JV loan, totaling (euro)121 million ($170 million), is due July 2010. Our existing (euro)391.9 million ($550.5 million at June 30, 2009) loan to Shurgard Europe was extended for an additional year to March 31, 2010 and will continue to accrue interest at 7.5% per annum. The loan currently is not hedged for future currency exchange fluctuations; accordingly, the amount of U.S. Dollars that will be received on repayment will depend upon the currency exchange rates at the time. In addition, Shurgard Europe exercised its option and extended our commitment through March 31, 2010 to provide up to (euro)305 million of additional loans to Shurgard Europe which has since been reduced to (euro)185 million due to the refinancing of one of the JV loans. Borrowings are to be used to either fund the acquisition of Shurgard Europe's partner's interest in the joint ventures and/or repay Shurgard Europe's pro rata share of the joint ventures' debt. The acquisitions of the joint venture partner's interests are subject to our approval and Shurgard Europe's pro rata share of the aggregate joint venture debt is approximately (euro)50 million. In March 2009, Shurgard Europe's joint venture partner gave us its exit notice indicating its intent to sell its interest in one of the joint ventures. In June 2009, the joint venture partner withdrew its exit notice. 4
LIQUIDITY POSITION - ------------------ At June 30, 2009, we had approximately $585 million of unrestricted cash on hand and have access to an additional $300 million line of credit. The line of credit does not expire until March 27, 2012. We have no significant capital commitments at June 30, 2009, other than outstanding debt maturities. At June 30, 2009, outstanding debt totaled $524 million. We have no significant debt maturities until 2011 ($131 million of maturities) and 2013 ($251 million of maturities). Our retained operating cash flow continues to provide a significant source of capital to fund our activities. During the six months ended June 30, 2009, our funds from operations available to distribute to common shareholders ("FAD") exceeded our regular common distributions by approximately $193 million. Our ability to continue to retain operating cash flow in the future will be contingent upon a number of factors including, but not limited to, the growth in our operations and our distribution requirements to maintain our REIT status. DISTRIBUTIONS DECLARED - ---------------------- On August 6, 2009, our Board of Trustees declared a regular common dividend of $0.55 per common share, a dividend of $0.6125 per share on the Equity Shares, Series A and dividends with respect to our various series of preferred shares. All the dividends are payable on September 30, 2009 to shareholders of record as of September 15, 2009.

PUBLIC STORAGE SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA (Unaudited) Comparisons of our revenues and expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2009 to the same period in 2008 are significantly impacted by the acquisition by an institutional investor of a 51% interest in Shurgard Europe on March 31, 2008, which resulted in the deconsolidation of Shurgard Europe as of that date. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 160, "Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements - an amendment of ARB No. 51", EITF 03-6-1, "Participating Securities and the Two-Class Method under FASB Statement No. 128", and certain other associated standards became effective January 1, 2009. As a result, adjustments have been made from the amounts previously presented for the three and six months ended June 30, 2008. The nature of these adjustments are described more fully in Note 2 to our March 31, 2009 Financial Statements included in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2009. 7
(a) Commencing March 31, 2008, we account for our investment in Shurgard Europe using the equity method of accounting. Our equity in earnings of Shurgard Europe for the three and six months ended June 30, 2009 and the six months ended June 30, 2008 totaling $1,709,000, $3,608,000 and $1,457,000, respectively, are comprised of (i) losses of $4,049,000, $7,300,000 and $4,819,000, respectively, representing our 49% pro-rata share of Shurgard Europe's net loss for the respective periods and (ii) income of $5,758,000, $10,908,000, and $6,276,000, respectively, representing our 49% pro-rata share of the interest income and trademark license fees received from Shurgard Europe for the respective periods (such amounts are presented as equity in earnings of real estate entities rather than interest and other income). Equity in earnings for the six months ended June 30, 2009 includes $16.3 million in income related to PS Business Parks' repurchases of its preferred securities. (b) During the first quarter of 2009, we discontinued the containerized storage and truck rental operations and, accordingly, the historical operations from these activities have been reclassified for all periods presented from ancillary operations to discontinued operations. During the second quarter of 2009, we reclassified the historical operations of a self-storage facility that is expected to be disposed of pursuant to a condemnation proceeding within the next year. In addition to the historical revenues and expenses of this self-storage facility, discontinued operations includes an impairment charge totaling $8.2 million related to the intangible assets of this facility recorded in the quarter ended June 30, 2009. Discontinued operations for the six months ended June 30, 2009 includes $3.5 million in costs associated with the disposal of trucks, as well as a gain on disposition of a discontinued self-storage facility of approximately $4.2 million. (c) Depreciation and amortization expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2009 decreased when compared to the same periods in 2008 primarily due to reductions in amortization expense related to domestic intangible assets, primarily those obtained in the Shurgard Merger. In addition, depreciation and amortization expense for the six months ended June 30, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008, was impacted by the deconsolidation of Shurgard Europe. (d) For the three and six months ended June 30, 2008, general and administrative expense includes additional incentive compensation totaling $25.4 million and $27.9 million, respectively, associated with the disposition of an interest in Shurgard Europe. (e) Our foreign currency exchange gains and losses are primarily related to our loan to Shurgard Europe which is denominated in Euros. When converting the Euro denominated loan to U.S. Dollars, exchange gains or losses may arise due to fluctuation in the exchange rates between the value of the U.S. Dollar and the Euro. (f) During the six months ended June 30, 2009, we repurchased various series of our preferred shares and units for an aggregate of $170.5 million. This amount was approximately $78.2 million lower than the original issue proceeds of the preferred equity acquired and, accordingly, we recorded an allocation of income from the preferred shareholders and unitholders to the common shareholders of $78.2 million. These repurchases are expected to reduce ongoing distributions to the preferred shareholders and unitholders by $16.1 million per year. 8
PUBLIC STORAGE SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA 9
SHURGARD EUROPE SAME STORE SELECTED OPERATING DATA - -------------------------------------------------- The Shurgard Europe Same Store represents those 94 facilities that they have owned and have been operated on a stabilized basis since January 1, 2007 and therefore provide meaningful comparisons for 2007, 2008, and 2009. The following table reflects the operating results of these 94 facilities. As described more fully in "Shurgard Europe" above, we deconsolidated Shurgard Europe as of March 31, 2008. (a) For comparative purposes, these amounts are presented on a constant exchange rate basis. The amounts for the three and six months ended June 30, 2008 have been restated using the actual exchange rate for the same periods in 2009. The exchange rate for the Euro relative to the U.S. Dollar averaged 1.361 and 1.334 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2009, respectively, as compared to 1.563 and 1.530, respectively, for the same periods in 2008. (b) Square foot occupancies represent weighted average occupancy levels over the entire period. (c) Realized annual rent per occupied square foot is computed by annualizing the result of dividing rental income before late charges and administrative fees by the weighted average occupied square feet for the period. Realized annual rent per occupied square foot takes into consideration promotional discounts and other items that reduce rental income from the contractual amounts due. (d) Late charges and administrative fees are excluded from the computation of realized annual rent per occupied square foot and REVPAF. Exclusion of these amounts provides a better measure of our ongoing level of revenue, by excluding the volatility of late charges, which are dependent principally upon the level of tenant delinquency, and administrative fees, which are dependent principally upon the absolute level of move-ins for a period. (e) Realized annual rent per available foot or "REVPAF" is computed by dividing rental income before late charges and admin fees by the total available net rentable square feet for the period. (f) In place annual rent per occupied square foot represents annualized contractual rents per occupied square foot without reductions for promotional discounts and excludes late charges and administrative fees. 10
PUBLIC STORAGE SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA Computation of Funds from Operations (Unaudited) Funds from operations ("FFO") is a term defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT"). FFO is a non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) financial measure. FFO is generally defined as net income before depreciation with respect to real estate assets and gains and losses on real estate assets. FFO is presented because management and many analysts consider FFO to be one measure of the performance of real estate companies. In addition, we believe that FFO is helpful to investors as an additional measure of the performance of a REIT, because net income includes the impact of depreciation, which assumes that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time, while we believe that the value of real estate fluctuates due to market conditions and in response to inflation. FFO computations do not consider scheduled principal payments on debt, capital improvements, distributions, and other obligations of the Company. FFO is not a substitute for our cash flow or net income as a measure of our liquidity or operating performance or our ability to pay dividends. Other REITs may not compute FFO in the same manner; accordingly, FFO may not be comparable among REITs. The following table reconciles from net income to Funds from Operations, and sets forth the computation of Funds from Operations per share: 11
PUBLIC STORAGE SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA Computation of Funds Available for Distribution (Unaudited) Funds available for distribution ("FAD") represents FFO, plus (i) impairment charges with respect to real estate assets, (ii) the non-cash portion of share-based compensation expense, (iii) non-cash allocations to or from preferred equity holders, less (iv) capital expenditures to maintain our facilities and (v) elimination of any gain or loss on foreign exchange. The distribution payout ratio is computed by dividing the distribution paid by FAD. FAD is presented because many analysts consider it to be a measure of the performance and liquidity of real estate companies and because we believe that FAD is helpful to investors as an additional measure of the performance of a REIT. FAD is not a substitute for our cash flow or net income as a measure of our liquidity, operating performance, or our ability to pay dividends. FAD does not take into consideration required principal payments on debt. Other REITs may not compute FAD in the same manner; accordingly, FAD may not be comparable among REITs. The following table reconciles from FFO to FAD, and sets forth the computation of our distribution payout ratio: 12
PUBLIC STORAGE SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA Reconciliation of Same Store revenues, cost of operations, and net operating income to Total Self-Storage revenues, Self-Storage cost of operations, and net income of the Company (Unaudited) (a) We consolidate the operating results of additional self-storage facilities that are not Same Store Facilities. (b) Self-storage revenues and cost of operations do not include revenues and expenses generated at the facilities with respect to tenant reinsurance, retail sales and truck rentals. (c) We present net operating income "NOI", which is a non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) financial measure that excludes the impact of depreciation and amortization expense. Although depreciation and amortization is a component of GAAP net income, we believe that NOI is a meaningful measure of operating performance, because we utilize NOI in making decisions with respect to capital allocations, segment performance, and comparing period-to-period and market-to-market property operating results. In addition, the investment community utilizes NOI in determining real estate values, and does not consider depreciation expense as it is based upon historical cost. NOI is not a substitute for net operating income after depreciation and amortization in evaluating our operating results. 13
