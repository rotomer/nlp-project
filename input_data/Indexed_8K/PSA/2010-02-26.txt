,  Public Storage (NYSE:PSA) announced today operating results for the fourth quarter ended
GLENDALE
California
December 31, 2009.
 
Operating Results for the Three Months Ended December 31, 2009
 
Net income for the three months ended December 31, 2009 was $187.7 million compared to $162.0 million for the same period in 2008, representing an increase of $25.7 million.  This increase is primarily due to a $25.6 million aggregate reduction in depreciation and amortization and our equity share of depreciation expense, primarily due to reduced amortization of tenant intangible assets that were acquired in connection with the Shurgard Merger in 2006, offset partially by a $9.3 million reduction in net operating income with respect to our Same Store Facilities described below.
 
Revenues for the Same Store Facilities decreased 3.9% or $13.8 million in the quarter ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the same period in 2008, due to a 3.8% reduction in realized rent per occupied square foot, combined with a 0.5% reduction in average occupancies.  Cost of operations for the Same Store Facilities declined 4.4% or $4.5 million in the quarter ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the same period in 2008.  Net operating income for our Same Store Facilities decreased 3.7% or $9.3 million in the quarter ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the same period in 2008.
 
For the three months ended December 31, 2009, net income allocable to our common shareholders was $117.5 million or $0.70 per common share on a diluted basis compared to $121.5 million or $0.72 per common share for the same period in 2008, representing a decrease of $4.0 million or $0.02 per common share on a diluted basis.  This decrease is primarily due to a $33.9 million reduction in earnings allocated to our preferred shareholders in the quarter ended December 31, 2008 associated with the repurchase of preferred securities, offset partially by the net impact of the factors described above.
 
Operating Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2009
 
Net income for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $790.5 million compared to $973.9 million for the same period in 2008, representing a decrease of $183.4 million.  This decrease is primarily due to (i) a gain of $344.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2008 related to our disposition of an interest in Shurgard Europe, (ii) a $37.9 million reduction in net operating income with respect to our Same Store Facilities described below, and (iii) an impairment charge included in discontinued operations with respect to intangible assets totaling $8.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2009, partially offset by (iv) a $49.9 million reduction in depreciation and amortization related to our domestic assets, primarily representing reduced intangible amortization, (v) a foreign exchange gain of $9.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to a loss of $25.4 million during the same period in 2008, (vi) a gain on disposition of $30.3 million related to an equity offering by PSB described below, and (vii) a reduction in general and administrative expenses due to $27.9 million in incentive compensation incurred in the year ended December 31, 2008 related to our disposition of an interest in Shurgard Europe.
 
Revenues for the Same Store Facilities decreased 3.2% or $46.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the same period in 2008, due to a 2.8% reduction in realized rent per occupied square foot, combined with a 0.9% reduction in average occupancies.  Cost of operations for the Same Store Facilities decreased 1.8% or $8.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the same period in 2008.  Net operating income for our Same Store Facilities decreased 3.9% or $37.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the same period in 2008.
 
For the year ended December 31, 2009, net income allocable to our common shareholders was $586.0 million or $3.47 per common share on a diluted basis compared to $705.8 million or $4.18 per common share for the same period in 2008, representing a decrease of $119.8 million or $0.71 per common share on a diluted basis.  These decreases are primarily due to the net impact of the factors described above, offset by a $44.4 million reduction in earnings allocated to our preferred unitholders and preferred shareholders in the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the same period in 2008 associated with the redemption of preferred securities occurring in both periods.

The following table provides a summary of the impact of these items that occurred during the three months and years ended
 
December 31, 2009 and 2008:
 
 
Property Operations  Same Store Facilities
 
The Same Store group of facilities represents those 1,899 facilities that we have owned, and have been operated on a stabilized basis, since January 1, 2007 and therefore provide meaningful comparisons for 2007, 2008, and 2009.  The following table summarizes the historical operating results of these 1,899 facilities (117.5 million net rentable square feet) that represent approximately 93% of the aggregate net rentable square feet of our U.S. consolidated self-storage portfolio at December 31, 2009.

The following table summarizes additional selected financial data with respect to the Same Store Facilities (unaudited):
 
Shurgard Europe
 
As previously announced, on March 31, 2008, an institutional investor acquired a 51% interest in Shurgard Europes operations.  We own the remaining 49% interest and we are the managing member of the joint venture that owns Shurgard Europes operations.  As a result of this transaction, we began accounting for our investment in Shurgard Europe under the equity method effective March 31, 2008.
 
At December 31, 2009 Shurgard Europe has an interest in 187 facilities (10 million net rentable square feet) located in seven Western European countries.  Included in this total are 72 facilities (3.6 million net rentable square feet) that are owned by two joint ventures in which Shurgard Europe has a 20% interest.
 
The two joint ventures collectively had approximately 224 million ($321 million) of outstanding debt at December 31, 2009.  The loans are payable to various banks and are non-recourse to Shurgard Europe.  One of the JV loans, totaling 107 million ($153 million), is due May 2011 and the other JV loan, totaling 117 million ($168 million), is due July 2010.
 
Effective October 31, 2009, we extended the maturity date to March 31, 2013 for our existing 391.9 million ($561.7 million at December 31, 2009) loan to Shurgard Europe.  Under the terms of the extension, the existing 7.5% rate of interest increased to 9.0% per annum (effective November 1, 2009).  All other material terms and covenants remain the same.  The loan currently is not hedged for future currency exchange fluctuations; accordingly, the amount of U.S. Dollars that will be received on repayment will depend upon the currency exchange rates at the time.
 
Our existing commitment to provide up to 185 million to fund the acquisition of Shurgard Europes partners interest in the joint ventures, and/or repay Shurgard Europes pro rata share of the joint ventures debt, remains in place until March 31, 2010.  Acquisitions of the joint venture partners interests are subject to our approval, and Shurgard Europes pro rata share of the aggregate joint venture debt is approximately 45 million.
 
In December 2009, Shurgard Europe acquired a property in Central London with 15,445 net rentable square feet for approximately $5.0 million and assumed liabilities.

Liquidity Position
 
At December 31, 2009, we had approximately $764 million of unrestricted cash and have access to an additional
 
$300 million through our line of credit.  The line of credit expires March 27, 2012.  We have no significant capital commitments at December 31, 2009, other than outstanding debt maturities and the aggregate redemption amount for our Equity Shares, Series A, discussed below.
 
At December 31, 2009, outstanding debt totaled $519 million.  We have no significant debt maturities until 2011 ($131 million of maturities) and 2013 ($251 million of maturities).
 
Our retained operating cash flow continues to provide a significant source of capital to fund our activities.  During the year ended December 31, 2009, our funds from operations available to distribute to common shareholders (FAD) exceeded our regular common distributions by approximately $430 million.  Our ability to continue to retain operating cash flow in the future will be contingent upon a number of factors including, but not limited to, the growth in our operations and our distribution requirements to maintain our REIT status.
 
Distributions Declared
 
On February 26, 2010, our Board of Trustees declared a regular common dividend of $0.65 per common share, representing an increase of $0.10 per share (an 18% increase) from the previous quarters distribution. Our consistent, long-term dividend policy has been to distribute only our taxable income.  Taxable income attributable to our common shareholders has increased due to recent purchases of preferred securities and equity stock, as well as reduced property depreciation, offset in part by declines in operating income.  Future changes in our dividend will be impacted by these same factors, as well as property acquisitions.
 
The Board also declared a dividend of $0.6125 per share on the Equity Shares, Series A and dividends with respect to our various series of preferred shares.  All the dividends are payable on March 31, 2010 to shareholders of record as of March 15, 2010.
 
Redemption of Equity Shares, Series A
 
We are calling for redemption all outstanding depositary shares, each representing 1/1,000 of an Equity Share, Series A
(NYSE:PSA.A) on April 15, 2010 at $24.50 per share. The aggregate redemption amount to be paid to all holders of the depositary shares is approximately $205 million.

All statements in this press release, other than statements of historical fact, are forward-looking statements which may be identified by the use of the words expects, believes, anticipates, should, estimates and similar expressions.  These forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, which may cause Public Storages actual results and performance to be materially different from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements.  Factors and risks that may impact future results and performance are described from time to time in Public Storages filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including in Item 1A, Risk Factors in Public Storages Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009, to be filed on or before March 1, 2010, our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K.

Comparisons of our revenues and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2009 to the same period in 2008 are significantly impacted by the acquisition by an institutional investor of a 51% interest in Shurgard Europe on March 31, 2008, which resulted in the deconsolidation of Shurgard Europe as of that date.
 
On January 1, 2009, accounting standards promulgated by the FASB became effective which affected the classification of ownership interests other than those of the Company, such as limited partnership interests in entities that are consolidated in the financial statements of the Company.  As a result, we have reclassified these equity interests previously referred to as minority interests on our balance sheet at December 31, 2008 to permanent noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries or redeemable noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries.The nature of these adjustments is described more fully in Note 2 to our December 31, 2009 Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009, to be filed on or before March 1, 2010.
