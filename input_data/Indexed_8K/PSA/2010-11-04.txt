Operating Results for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2010
 
For the three months ended September 30, 2010, net income allocable to our common shareholders was $182.2 million or $1.07 per diluted common share, compared to $173.5 million or $1.03 per diluted common share, for the same period in 2009, representing an increase of $8.7 million or $0.04 per diluted common share.  This increase is due to improved operations of our Same Store Facilities (discussed below), a foreign currency exchange gain of $55.5 million during the quarter ended September 30, 2010 as compared to $21.4 million for the same period in 2009, partially offset by a gain on disposition of $30.3 million related to an equity offering by PS Business Parks, Inc. (PSB) recorded in the quarter ended September 30, 2009.
 
Revenues for the Same Store Facilities (see table below) increased 1.2% or $4.3 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009, primarily due to a 1.6% increase in average occupancy offset partially by a 0.5% reduction in realized rent per occupied square foot.  Cost of operations for the Same Store Facilities increased 3.2% or
 
$3.7 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009.  Net operating income for our Same Store Facilities increased 0.2% or $0.6 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009.
 
Operating Results for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2010
 
For the nine months ended September 30, 2010, net income allocable to our common shareholders was $277.8 million or $1.64 per diluted common share, compared to $468.5 million or $2.78 per diluted common share, for the same period in 2009, representing a decrease of $190.7 million or $1.14 per diluted common share.  This decrease is primarily due to (i) a foreign currency exchange loss of $28.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2010 compared to a $19.9 million gain during the same period in 2009, (ii) an aggregate $31.1 million reduction in income allocated to our common shareholders, and an increase in income allocated to the shareholders of redeemed securities, (including our equity share of PSBs redemptions) in applying EITF D-42 to the redemption of securities in the nine months ended September 30, 2010, as compared to a $94.5 million increase in income allocated to our common shareholders from the shareholders of redeemed securities (including our equity share of PSBs redemptions), in applying EITF D-42 to the redemption of securities in the same period in 2009 and (iii) a gain on disposition of $30.3 million related to an equity offering by PSB recorded in the nine months ended September 30, 2009.
 
Revenues for the Same Store Facilities decreased 0.4% or $4.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009, primarily due to a 1.7% reduction in realized rent per occupied square foot, partially offset by a 1.0% increase in average occupancy.  Cost of operations for the Same Store Facilities increased 1.5% or $5.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009.  Net operating income for our Same Store Facilities decreased 1.4% or $9.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009.
 
Funds from Operations
 
For the three months ended September 30, 2010, funds from operations (FFO) was $1.69 per common share on a diluted basis as compared to $1.44 per diluted common share for the same period in 2009, representing an increase of $0.25 per diluted common share or 17.4%.
 
For the three months ended September 30, 2010, FFO was impacted by (i) a foreign currency exchange gain totaling $55.5 million (compared to a gain of $21.4 million for the same period in 2009) and (ii) changes in accounting estimates with respect to our tenant insurance operations reflected as a reduction in ancillary cost of operations totaling $1.7 million ($2.0 million for the same period in 2009).

For the nine months ended September 30, 2010, FFO was $3.39 per common share on a diluted basis as compared to $4.35 per diluted common share for the same period in 2009, representing a decrease of $0.96 per diluted common share or 22.1%.
 
For the nine months ended September 30, 2010, FFO was impacted by (i) a $31.1 million reduction in applying EITF D-42 to the redemption of preferred shares and our Equity Shares, Series A, including our equity share of PSBs redemptions (compared to an aggregate $94.5 million increase recorded for our redemption, and our equity share of PSBs redemption, of preferred equity in the same period in 2009), (ii) a foreign currency exchange loss totaling $28.6 million (compared to a gain of $19.9 million for the same period in 2009), (iii) changes in accounting estimates with respect to our tenant insurance operations reflected as a reduction in ancillary cost of operations totaling $1.7 million ($2.0 million for the same period in 2009), (iv) incremental general and administrative expense associated with the acquisition of real estate facilities totaling $2.4 million and (v) a $2.5 million impairment of long-lived assets (as compared to $8.2 million during the same period in 2009).
 
For the nine months ended September 30, 2009, FFO was further impacted by (i) a $4.1 million gain on the early retirement of debt, and (ii) costs incurred to terminate and wind down our truck rental operations of $3.5 million.
 
The following table provides a summary of the per-share impact of the items noted above:
 
 
 
FFO is a term defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT).  It is generally defined as net income before depreciation with respect to real estate assets and gains and losses on real estate assets.  FFO is presented because management and many analysts consider FFO to be one measure of the performance of real estate companies.  In addition, we believe that FFO is helpful to investors as an additional measure of the performance of a REIT, because net income includes the impact of depreciation, which assumes that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time, while we believe that the value of real estate fluctuates due to market conditions and in response to inflation.  FFO computations do not consider scheduled principal payments on deb t, capital improvements, distributions and other obligations of the Company.  FFO is not a substitute for our cash flow or net income as a measure of our liquidity or operating performance or our ability to pay dividends.  Other REITs may not compute FFO in the same manner; accordingly, FFO may not be comparable among REITs. See the attached reconciliation of net income to funds from operations included in the selectedfinancial data attached to this press release.

Property Operations  Same Store Facilities
 
The Same Store Facilities represents those 1,925 facilities that are stabilized and owned since January 1, 2008 and therefore provide meaningful comparisons for 2008, 2009, and 2010.  The following table summarizes the historical operating results of these 1,925 facilities (120.3 million net rentable square feet) that represent approximately 94% of the aggregate net rentable square feet of our U.S. consolidated self-storage portfolio at September 30, 2010.

The following table summarizes additional selected financial data with respect to the Same Store Facilities (unaudited):
 
Shurgard Europe
 
We own a 49% equity interest in Shurgard Europe, with the remaining 51% equity interest owned by an institutional investor.  We account for our investment in Shurgard Europe under the equity method.
 
At September 30, 2010, Shurgard Europe had an interest in 188 facilities (10 million net rentable square feet) located in seven Western European countries.  Included in this total are 72 facilities (3.6 million net rentable square feet) that are owned by two joint ventures in which Shurgard Europe has a 20% interest.
 
The two joint ventures collectively had approximately 213 million ($290 million) of outstanding debt at September 30, 2010.  The loans are payable to various banks and do not have recourse to Shurgard Europe.  One of the JV loans, totaling 99 million ($135 million), is due May 2011.  In July 2010, the other JV loan, totaling 114 million ($155 million) was refinanced with interest rates and terms that were similar to the previous loan, and matures in July 2013.
 
Our existing 378.7 million loan ($515.4 million at September 30, 2010) to Shurgard Europe matures on March 31, 2013, and accrues interest at 9.0% per annum.  We received principal payments on this loan totaling 12.1 million ($17.4 million) in the three months ended September 30, 2010.  The loan currently is not hedged for future currency exchange fluctuations; accordingly, the amount of U.S. Dollars that will be received on repayment will depend upon the currency exchange rates at the time.  The timing of future early principal payments will depend on Shurgard Europes available cash flow from operations or financing and its alternative uses for that cash flow.

Acquisition of Self-Storage Facilities
 
During the three months ended September 30, 2010, we acquired seven self-storage facilities (390,000 square feet) for approximately $27 million. Four of these facilities are located in California, with the remainder of the facilities located in Hawaii, Illinois and Louisiana. We incurred approximately $0.7 million in transaction-related expenses which are included in general and administrative expense in the three months ended September 30, 2010.
 
We are currently under contract to acquire four properties for approximately $14.4 million, located in Florida, New Jersey and Ohio.  We expect the acquisition of these properties to occur during the fourth quarter of 2010.  The contracts to acquire these facilities are subject to customary closing conditions, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to complete these acquisitions.
 
Capital Activities
 
As previously announced, on October 7, 2010, we issued 5,000,000 depositary shares (including the subsequent exercise, in part, of the underwriters over-allotment option) at $25.00 per depositary share, with each depositary share representing 1/1,000 of a 6.5% Cumulative Preferred Share of Beneficial Interest, Series P. The offering resulted in gross proceeds of $125 million.
 
During the quarter ended September 30, 2010, we repurchased 400,000 shares of our 6.85% Cumulative Preferred Shares, Series Y for an amount that was $800,000 lower than the original issuance proceeds for these preferred shares and, accordingly, we recorded an allocation of income from the preferred shareholders to the common shareholders of $800,000 in the quarter ended September 30, 2010.
 
On October 25, 2010, we repurchased our 7.25% Series J Preferred Partnership Units for an aggregate of $100.4 million ($100 million par value) plus accrued and unpaid dividends.  In the quarter ending December 31, 2010, we expect to record an allocation of income pursuant to EITF D-42 to the holders of these units of $400,000, representing the excess paid to redeem these units over the original issuance proceeds.  These preferred units were otherwise redeemable at par on May 9, 2011.
 
As previously announced, on November 5, 2010 we will redeem all outstanding depositary shares representing interests of our 7.125% Cumulative Preferred Shares, Series B, for an aggregate redemption amount, before payment of accrued dividends, of approximately $109 million.  In applying EITF D-42 to this redemption, we will allocate approximately $3.6 million of income from our common shareholders to the holders of our Preferred Shares, representing the excess of the amount paid over the initial issuance proceeds, in the quarter ending December 31, 2010.
 
Liquidity Position
 
At September 30, 2010, we had approximately $513.5 million of cash and $102.1 million of short-term investments in high-grade corporate securities.  We also have access to our $300 million line of credit which does not expire until March 27, 2012.  On October 7, 2010, we raised net proceeds of $121.2 million from the issuance of the Series P Cumulative Preferred Shares.  Our capital commitments after September 30, 2010, for the next year of approximately $364.7 million include (i) $100.4 million paid to redeem our Series J Preferred Partnership Units, (ii) $108.8 million to redeem our Series B Cumulative Preferred Shares, (iii) $141.1 million in principal payments on debt and (iv) $14.4 million for the aforementioned acquisition of four facilities.  We have no further significant commitments unti l 2013, when $265.6 million of existing debt comes due.
 
Our retained operating cash flow continues to provide a significant source of capital to fund our activities. During the quarter ended September 30, 2010, our funds from operations available to distribute to common shareholders (FAD) exceeded our regular common distributions by approximately $67 million.  Our ability to continue to retain operating cash flow in the future will be contingent upon a number of factors including, but not limited to, the growth in our operations and our distribution requirements to maintain our REIT status.
 
Distributions Declared
 
On November 4, 2010, our Board of Trustees declared a regular common dividend of $0.80 per common share. The Board also declared dividends with respect to our various series of preferred shares. All the dividends are payable on December 30, 2010, to shareholders of record as of December 15, 2010.

Shurgard Europe Same Store Selected Operating Data
 
Shurgard Europe has an ownership interest in 188 facilities located in Europe.  Since January 1, 2008, 91 of Shurgard Europes 116 wholly-owned facilities (the Europe Same Store Facilities) have been operating on a stabilized basis.  During the quarter ended September 30, 2010, we removed two facilities from the Europe Same Store Facilities because they were no longer stabilized, and as a result the number of such facilities declined from 93 to 91. The following table reflects the operating results of these 91 facilities.  Comparisons should not be made between this group of 91 facilities and amounts presented for the former group of 93 facilities. We account for our investment in Shurgard Europe on the equity method of accounting; accordingly, our pro-rata share of the operating result s for these facilities is included in equity in earnings of real estate entities on our income statement.
