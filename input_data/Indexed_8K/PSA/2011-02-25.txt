Operating Results for the Three Months Ended December 31, 2010
 
For the three months ended December 31, 2010, net income allocable to our common shareholders was $121.4 million or $0.71 per diluted common share, compared to $117.5 million or $0.70 per diluted common share for the same period in 2009, representing an increase of $3.9 million or $0.01 per diluted common share.  This increase is due to (i) improved operations of our Same Store Facilities (discussed below), (ii) the operating results of facilities acquired during 2010, partially offset by (iii) increased depreciation and amortization expense and (iv) a foreign currency exchange loss of $13.7 million during the quarter ended December 31, 2010 as compared to a loss of $10.2 million for the same period in 2009.
 
Revenues for the Same Store Facilities (see table below) increased 2.4% or $8.5 million in the quarter ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009, primarily due to a 1.7% increase in average occupancy and a 0.3% increase in realized rent per occupied square foot.  Cost of operations for the Same Store Facilities decreased 2.1% or $2.1 million in the quarter ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009.  Net operating income for our Same Store Facilities increased 4.2% or $10.6 million in the quarter ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009.
 
Operating Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2010
 
For the year ended December 31, 2010, net income allocable to our common shareholders was $399.2 million or $2.35 per diluted common share, compared to $586.0 million or $3.47 per diluted common share for the same period in 2009, representing a decrease of $186.8 million or $1.12 per diluted common share.  This decrease is primarily due to (i) a foreign currency exchange loss of $42.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to a $9.7 million gain during the same period in 2009, (ii) an aggregate $35.8 million increase in income allocated to the shareholders of redeemed securities, (including our equity share of PS Business Parks (PSB) redemptions) in applying EITF D-42 to the redemption of securities in the year ended December 31, 2010, as compared to a $94.5 million decrease in income al located to shareholders of redeemed securities (including our equity share of PSBs redemptions), in applying EITF D-42 to the redemption of securities in the same period in 2009 and (iii) a gain on disposition of real estate assets of $30.3 million related to an equity offering by PSB recorded in the year ended December 31, 2009.
 
Revenues for the Same Store Facilities increased 0.3% or $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009.  Cost of operations for the Same Store Facilities increased 0.7% or $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009.  Net operating income for our Same Store Facilities increased 0.1% or $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009.
 
Funds from Operations
 
For the three months ended December 31, 2010, funds from operations (FFO) was $1.33 per common share on a diluted basis as compared to $1.27 per diluted common share for the same period in 2009, representing an increase of $0.06 per diluted common share or 4.7%.
 
For the three months ended December 31, 2010, FFO was impacted by (i) a foreign currency exchange loss totaling $13.7 million (compared to a loss of $10.2 million for the same period in 2009), (ii) application of EITF D-42 to the redemption of securities for the three months ended December 31, 2010 of $4.7 million, including our equity share of PSBs redemptions and (iii) changes in accounting estimates with respect to our tenant insurance operations reflected as an increase in ancillary cost of operations totaling $1.9 million.

For the year ended December 31, 2010, FFO was $4.72 per common share on a diluted basis as compared to $5.61 per diluted common share for the same period in 2009, representing a decrease of $0.89 per diluted common share or 15.9%.
 
For the year ended December 31, 2010, FFO was impacted by (i) a $35.8 million reduction in applying EITF D-42 to the redemption of preferred shares and our Equity Shares, Series A, including our equity share of PSBs redemptions (compared to an aggregate $94.5 million increase recorded for our redemptions, and our equity share of PSBs redemptions, of preferred equity in the same period in 2009), (ii) a foreign currency exchange loss totaling $42.3 million (compared to a gain of $9.7 million for the same period in 2009), (iii) incremental general and administrative expense associated with the acquisition of real estate facilities totaling $2.6 million and (iv) a $2.9 million impairment of long-lived assets (as compared to $8.2 million during the same period in 2009).
 
For the year ended December 31, 2009, FFO was further impacted by (i) a $4.1 million gain on the early retirement of debt,
 
(ii) costs incurred to terminate and wind down our truck rental operations of $3.5 million, and (iii) changes in accounting estimates with respect to our tenant insurance operations reflected as a reduction in ancillary cost of operations totaling
 
$2.0 million.
 
The following table provides a summary of the per-share impact of the items noted above (unaudited):
 
 
 
 
FFO is a term defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT).  It is generally defined as net income before depreciation with respect to real estate assets and gains and losses on real estate assets.  FFO is presented because management and many analysts consider FFO to be one measure of the performance of real estate companies.  In addition, we believe that FFO is helpful to investors as an additional measure of the performance of a REIT, because net income includes the impact of depreciation, which assumes that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time, while we believe that the value of real estate fluctuates due to market conditions and in response to inflation.  FFO computations do not consider scheduled principal payments on deb t, capital improvements, distributions and other obligations of the Company.  FFO is not a substitute for our cash flow or net income as a measure of our liquidity or operating performance or our ability to pay dividends.  Other REITs may not compute FFO in the same manner; accordingly, FFO may not be comparable among REITs. See the attached reconciliation of net income to funds from operations included in the selectedfinancial data attached to this press release.

Property Operations  Same Store Facilities
 
The Same Store Facilities represent those 1,925 facilities that are stabilized and owned since January 1, 2008 and therefore provide meaningful comparisons for 2009 and 2010.  The following table summarizes the historical operating results of these 1,925 facilities (120.3 million net rentable square feet) that represent approximately 94% of the aggregate net rentable square feet of our U.S. consolidated self-storage portfolio at December 31, 2010.

The following table summarizes additional selected financial data with respect to the Same Store Facilities (unaudited):
 
Shurgard Europe
 
We own a 49% equity interest in Shurgard Europe, with the remaining 51% equity interest owned by an institutional investor.  We account for our investment in Shurgard Europe under the equity method.
 
At December 31, 2010, Shurgard Europe had an interest in 188 facilities (10 million net rentable square feet) located in seven Western European countries.  Included in this total are 72 facilities (3.6 million net rentable square feet) that are owned by two joint ventures in which Shurgard Europe has a 20% interest.
 
The two joint ventures collectively had approximately 205.8 million ($272.7 million) of outstanding debt at December 31, 2010.  The loans are payable to various banks and do not have recourse to Shurgard Europe or Public Storage.  One of the JV loans, totaling 94.5 million ($125.2 million), is due May 2011 with an option to extend one additional year. The other JV loan, totaling 111.3 million ($147.5 million) matures in July 2013.
 
Our existing 373.7 million loan ($495.2 million at December 31, 2010) to Shurgard Europe matures on March 31, 2013, and accrues interest at 9.0% per annum.  We received principal payments on this loan totaling 5.0 million ($6.8 million) in the three months ended December 31, 2010.  The loan currently is not hedged for future currency exchange fluctuations; accordingly, the amount of U.S. Dollars that will be received on repayment will depend upon the currency exchange rates at the time.  The timing of future early principal payments will depend on Shurgard Europes available cash flow from operations or financing and its alternative uses for that cash flow.

Acquisition of Self-Storage Facilities
 
During the three months ended December 31, 2010, we acquired four self-storage facilities (302,000 net rentable square feet) for approximately $14.3 million located in Florida, New Jersey and Ohio.  In addition, in January 2011, we acquired five facilities (386,000 net rentable square feet) in Nevada for approximately $19.5 million and in February 2011, we acquired the leasehold interest in the land at one of our existing self-storage facilities for approximately $6.6 million.  We are also under contract to acquire another facility (138,000 net rentable square feet) in New York for approximately $17.0 million.
 
Capital and Other Investing Activities
 
On October 7, 2010, we issued 5,000,000 depositary shares (including the subsequent exercise, in part, of the underwriters over-allotment option) at $25.00 per depositary share, with each depositary share representing 1/1,000 of a 6.5% Cumulative Preferred Share of Beneficial Interest, Series P.  The offering resulted in gross proceeds of $125 million.
 
On October 25, 2010, we repurchased our 7.25% Series J Preferred Partnership Units for an aggregate of $100.4 million ($100 million par value) plus accrued and unpaid dividends.  In the quarter ended December 31, 2010, we recorded an allocation of income pursuant to EITF D-42 to the holders of these units of $400,000, representing the excess paid to redeem these units over the original issuance proceeds.  These preferred units were otherwise redeemable at par on May 9, 2011.
 
On November 5, 2010, we redeemed all outstanding depositary shares representing interests of our 7.125% Cumulative Preferred Shares, Series B, for an aggregate redemption amount, before payment of accrued dividends, of approximately $108.8 million.  In applying EITF D-42 to this redemption, we allocated approximately $3.6 million of income from our common shareholders to the holders of our Preferred Shares, representing the excess of the amount paid over the initial issuance proceeds, in the quarter ended December 31, 2010.
 
On February 9, 2011, we loaned PSB $121 million which PSB used to re-pay borrowings against its credit facility and repurchase preferred units.  The loan has a six-month term, no prepayment penalties, and bears interest at a rate of three-month LIBOR plus 0.85%, which is favorable in comparison to our existing rate of return on cash balances. In addition, we repaid our $103 million 7.75% unsecured note that matured on February 22, 2011.
 
Liquidity Position
 
At December 31, 2010, we had approximately $456 million of cash and $102 million of short-term investments in high-grade corporate securities that matured in mid-February 2011.  We also have access to our $300 million line of credit which does not expire until March 27, 2012.  Our cash on hand is sufficient to fund debt payment requirements and other current payment commitments. As noted above, we loaned $121 million to PSB for a six-month term.  In addition, our retained operating cash flow continues to provide a significant source of capital to fund our activities. During the quarter ended December 31, 2010, our funds from operations available to distribute to common shareholders (FAD) exceeded our regular common distributions by approximately $104 million.  Our ability to continu e to retain operating cash flow in the future will be contingent upon a number of factors including, but not limited to, the growth in our operations and our distribution requirements to maintain our REIT status.
 
Distributions Declared
 
On February 25, 2011, our Board of Trustees declared a regular common dividend of $0.80 per common share. The Board also declared dividends with respect to our various series of preferred shares. All the dividends are payable on March 31, 2011, to shareholders of record as of March 15, 2011.
