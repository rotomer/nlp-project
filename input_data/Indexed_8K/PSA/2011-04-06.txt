  Incorporated
 
 
Ladies and Gentlemen:
Public Storage (the "Company"), a Maryland real estate investment trust ("REIT"), proposes to issue and sell an aggregate of 13,000,000 shares (the "Firm Shares") of its Depositary Shares (the "Depositary Shares"), each representing 1/1,000 of a 6.5% Cumulative Preferred Share of Beneficial Interest, Series Q, stated value $25,000 per share (the "Preferred Shares"), to you and the other underwriters named in Schedule I hereto (collectively, the
"Underwriters") for whom you are acting as Representatives (the "Representatives"). The Company also proposes to sell to the Underwriters, upon the terms and conditions set forth in Section 1(b) hereof, up to an additional 1,950,000 Depositary Shares (the "Additional Shares"). The Firm Shares and the Additional Shares are hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Shares."
The shares of Preferred Shares represented by the Shares will, when issued, be deposited by the Company against delivery of Depositary Receipts ("Depositary Receipts") to be issued by Computershare Trust Company, N.A., as Depositary (the "Depositary"), under a Deposit Agreement (the "Deposit Agreement") among the Company, the Depositary, and the holders from time to time of the Depositary Receipts issued thereunder. Each Depositary Receipt will represent one or more Depositary Shares.
The Company wishes to confirm as follows its agreement with you and the other several Underwriters on whose behalf you are acting, in connection with the several purchases of the Shares by the Underwriters.
1. .
Agreements to Sell and Purchase
(a) On the basis of the representations, warranties and agreements of the Company herein contained and subject to all the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company agrees to sell to the Underwriters and each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to purchase from the Company, at a purchase price of $24.2125 per Share, except for Shares sold by the Underwriters to institutional investors as agreed by the Company and the Underwriters, for which the purchase price shall be $24.50 per Share (the "purchase price per share"), the number of Firm Shares set forth opposite the name of such Underwriter in Schedule I hereto (or such number of Firm Shares increased as set forth in Section 9 hereof).
(b) The Company also agrees, subject to all the terms and conditions set forth herein, to sell to the Underwriters, and, upon the basis of the representations, warranties and agreements of the Company herein contained and subject to all the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Underwriters shall have the right to purchase from the Company, at the purchase price per share, plus accumulated dividends, if any, on an Additional Share to the date of purchase, pursuant to an option (the "over-allotment option") which may be exercised at any time and from time to time prior to 9:00 P.M., New York City time, on the 30th day after the date of the Prospectus (as defined in Section 4) (or, if such 30th day shall be a Saturday or Sunday or a holiday, on the next business day thereafter when the New York Stock Exchange is open for trading), up to an aggregate of 1,950,000 Additional Shares. Additional Shares may be purchased only for the purpose of covering over-allotments made in connection with the offering of the Firm Shares. Upon any exercise of the over-allotment option, each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, agrees to purchase from the Company the number of Additional Shares (subject to such adjustments as you may determine in order to avoid fractional shares) which bears the same proportion to the number of Additional Shares to be purchased by the Underwriters as the number of Firm Shares set forth opposite the name of such Underwriter in Schedule I hereto (or

5. . The Company agrees with the Underwriters as follows:
Agreements of the Company
(a) The Company will not, either prior to the Effective Date or thereafter during such period as the Prospectus is required by law to be delivered in connection with sales of the Shares by any Underwriter or any dealer (including in circumstances where such requirement may be satisfied pursuant to Rule 172), file any amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, unless a copy thereof shall first have been submitted to the Representatives within a reasonable period of time prior to the filing thereof and the Representatives shall not have objected thereto in good faith.
(b) The Company will notify the Representatives promptly, and will confirm such advice in writing, (1) when any post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement becomes effective, (2) of the receipt of any comments from or any request by the Commission for amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus or for additional information, (3) of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement, any notice objecting to its use or the initiation of any proceedings for that purpose or the threat thereof, (4) of the happening of any event during the period mentioned in the second sentence of Section 5(e) that in the judgment of the Company makes any statement made in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary
Prospectus or the Prospectus untrue or that requires the making of any changes in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they are made, not misleading, and (5) of receipt by the Company or any representative or attorney of the Company of any other communication from the Commission relating to the Company, the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus. If at any time the Commission shall issue any order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement, the Company will make every reasonable effort to obtain the withdrawal of such order at the earliest possible moment.
(c) The Company will furnish to the Representatives, without charge, four copies of the signed copies of the Registration Statement and of any post-effective amendment thereto, including financial statements and schedules, and all exhibits thereto (including any document filed under the Exchange Act and deemed to be incorporated by reference into the Prospectus) and will furnish to the Representatives, without charge, for transmittal to each of the other Underwriters, copies of the Registration Statement and any post-effective amendment thereto, including financial statements and schedules but without exhibits.
(d) The Company will comply with all the provisions of any undertakings contained in the Registration Statement.
(e) The Company will deliver to each of the Underwriters, without charge, as many copies of the Prospectus, each Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto as the Representatives may reasonably request. The Company consents to the use of the Prospectus, each Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto by the several Underwriters and by all dealers to whom the Shares may be sold, both in connection with the offering or sale of the Shares and for any period of time thereafter during which the Prospectus is required by law to be delivered in connection therewith (including in circumstances where such requirement may be satisfied pursuant to Rule 172 of the Act). If during such period of time any event shall occur which in the judgment of the Company or counsel to the Underwriters should be set forth in the Prospectus in order to make any statement therein, in the light of the circumstances under which it was made, not misleading, or if it is necessary to supplement or amend the Prospectus to comply with law, subject to the provisions of Section 5(a) hereof, the Company will forthwith prepare and duly file with the Commission an appropriate supplement or amendment thereto, and will deliver to the Underwriters, without charge, such number of copies thereof as the Representatives may reasonably request. The Company shall not file any document under the Exchange Act before the termination of the offering of the Shares by the Underwriters if such document would be deemed to be incorporated by reference into the Prospectus which is not approved by the Representatives after reasonable notice thereof. If there occurs an event or development as a result of which the General Disclosure Package would include an untrue statement of a material fact or would omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances then prevailing, not misleading, the Company will notify promptly the Representatives so that any use of the General Disclosure Package may cease until it is amended or supplemented. The Company will prepare a final term sheet (the "Final Term Sheet") reflecting the final terms of the Shares, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives, and shall file such Final Term
Sheet as an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus pursuant to Rule 433 prior to the close of business two business days after the date hereof; provided that the Company shall provide the Representatives with copies of any such Final Term Sheet a reasonable amount of time prior to such proposed filing and will not use or file any such document to which the Representatives or counsel to the Underwriters shall reasonably object.
(f) The Company will cooperate with the Representatives and counsel to the Underwriters in connection with the registration or qualification of the Shares and the Preferred Shares for offer and sale under the securities or Blue Sky laws of such jurisdictions as the Representatives may reasonably request; provided, that in no event shall the Company be obligated to qualify to do business in any jurisdiction where it is not now so qualified or to take any action which would subject it to general service of process in any jurisdiction where it is not now so subject.
(g) During the period of five years commencing on the date hereof, the Company will furnish to each of the Representatives and each other Underwriter who may so request copies of such financial statements and other periodic and special reports as the Company may from time to time distribute generally to the holders of any class of its capital stock, and will furnish to each of the Representatives and each other Underwriter who may so request a copy of each annual or other report it shall be required to file with the Commission.
(h) The Company will make generally available to holders of its securities as soon as may be practicable but in no event later than the last day of the fifteenth full calendar month following the calendar quarter in which the Effective Date falls, an earnings statement (which need not be audited but shall be in reasonable detail), with respect to the Company, the Subsidiaries and the Partnerships, for a period of 12 months commencing after the Effective Date of the Registration Statement, and satisfying the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Act (including Rule 158 thereunder) and will file such earnings statement as an exhibit to the next periodic report required by Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act covering the period when the earnings statement is released.
(i) If this Agreement shall terminate or shall be terminated after execution pursuant to any provisions hereof (otherwise than pursuant to the second paragraph of Section 9 hereof or by notice given by you terminating this Agreement pursuant to Section 9 or Section 10 hereof) or if this Agreement shall be terminated by the Underwriters because of any failure or refusal on the part of the Company to comply with the terms or fulfill any of the conditions of this Agreement, the Company agrees to reimburse the Representatives for all out-of-pocket expenses (including fees and expenses of counsel for the Underwriters) reasonably incurred by you in connection herewith.
(j) The Company will not at any time, directly or indirectly, take any action intended, or which might reasonably be expected, to cause or result in, or which will constitute, stabilization of the price of the Shares to facilitate the sale or resale of any of the Shares in violation of the Act.
(k) The Company will apply the net proceeds from the offering and sale of the Shares in the manner set forth in the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus under "Use of Proceeds."
(l) The Company will use its best efforts to have the Shares listed, subject to notice of issuance, on the New York Stock Exchange.
(m) The Company represents and agrees that, unless it obtains the prior written consent of the Representatives, and each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, represents and agrees with the Company that, unless it has obtained or will obtain, as the case may be, the prior written consent of the Company and the Representatives, it has not made and will not make any offer relating to the Shares that would constitute an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or that would otherwise constitute a "free writing prospectus" (as defined in Rule 405 of the Act) required to be filed by the Company with the Commission or retained by the Company under Rule 433 of the Act. Any such free writing prospectus consented to by the Representatives or the Company is hereinafter referred to as a "Permitted Free Writing Prospectus." The Company agrees that (x) it has treated and will treat, as the case may be, each Permitted Free Writing Prospectus as an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and (y) it has complied and will comply, as the case may be, with the requirements of Rules 164 and 433 of the Act applicable to any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, including in respect of timely filing with the Commission, legending and record keeping. The Company consents to the use by any Underwriter of a free writing prospectus that (a) is not an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus as defined in Rule 433, and (b) contains only (i) information describing the preliminary terms of the Shares or their offering or (ii) information that describes the final terms of the Shares or their offering and that is included in the Final Term Sheet of the Company contemplated in Section 5(e).

On the Closing Date, the Underwriters shall have received a certificate dated the Closing Date, signed by each of the President and Chief Financial Officer of the Company confirming the matters set forth in Sections 6(a), (b) and (c).

(iii) The forms of certificates for the Shares are in valid and sufficient form in compliance with New York Stock Exchange requirements.
(iv) To the best of my knowledge, after due inquiry, there is no pending or threatened action, suit or proceeding before any court or governmental agency, authority or body or arbitrator involving the Company, any of the Subsidiaries or any of the Partnerships of a character required to be disclosed in the Registration Statement which is not adequately disclosed in the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus, and there is no franchise, contract or other document of a character required to be described in the Registration Statement or the General Disclosure Package and Prospectus, or to be

(ix) The Company is not in violation of its Declaration of Trust or bylaws and each of the Subsidiaries are not in violation of its articles of incorporation or by-laws, and each of the Partnerships is not in violation of its respective partnership agreement, and to the best of my knowledge, after due inquiry, neither the Company, the Subsidiaries nor any Partnership is in default in the performance of any obligation, agreement or condition contained in any loan, note or other evidence of indebtedness or in any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust or any other material agreement by which it or its properties are bound, except for such defaults as could not, individually or the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, such Subsidiary or such Partnership, as the case may be.
(x) Neither the issue and sale of the Shares nor the consummation of any of the other transactions contemplated by the Agreement (including without limitation the execution, delivery and performance of the Deposit Agreement, the issuance and deposit of the Preferred Shares in accordance with the Deposit Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated therein) nor the fulfillment of the terms hereof or thereof will conflict with, result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under any law or the articles of incorporation or by-laws of the Subsidiaries or the partnership agreement of any of the Partnerships or the terms of any indenture or other agreement or instrument known to me and to which the Company, any of the Subsidiaries or any of the Partnerships is a party or is bound or any judgment, order or decree known to me to be applicable to the Company, any of the Subsidiaries or any of the Partnerships of any court, regulatory body, administrative agency, governmental body or arbitrator having jurisdiction over the Company, any of the Subsidiaries or any of the Partnerships.
(xi) No holders of securities of the Company have rights to the registration of such securities under the Registration Statement, except as provided therein.

(xvi) Except as described in the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus and in Section 4(t) of the Agreement, to the best of such counsel's knowledge, after reasonable inquiry, there are no outstanding options, warrants or other rights calling for the issuance of, and there are no commitments, plans or arrangements to issue, any shares of capital stock of the Company or any security convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for capital stock of the Company.

In addition, such counsel shall state that she has participated in conferences with Representatives of the Underwriters, and with officers and other representatives of the Company and representatives of the independent certified public accountants of the Company, at which conferences the contents of the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus and related matters were discussed and, although such counsel does not pass upon and does not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, on the basis of the foregoing (relying as to certain factual matters on the information provided to such counsel by the Company and not on an independent investigation, but in the absence of information to the contrary), no facts have come to such counsel's attention which leads such counsel to believe that any part of the Registration Statement, when such part became effective or was deemed to have become effective, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or that the Prospectus, as of its date and as of the Closing Date, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; provided that such counsel need not express any comment with respect to the financial statements and other financial data included in the Registration Statement or Prospectus. In addition, such counsel shall state that no facts have come to such counsel's attention which leads such counsel to believe that the documents included in the General Disclosure Package, all considered together, as of the Applicable Time, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; provided that such counsel need not express any comment with respect to the financial statements and other financial data included in the General Disclosure Package.
(e) The Underwriters shall have received an opinion, dated the Closing Date and satisfactory in form and substance to counsel for the Underwriters, from Hogan Lovells US LLP, counsel for the Company, to the effect that:

The Company has the trust power to own, lease and occupy its current properties and to conduct its business as described in the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus.
(ii) The statements in the Prospectus under the heading "Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations" and the statements in the Prospectus Supplements under the heading "Additional Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences" and "Risk Factors  We may pay some taxes, reducing cash available for shareholders," to the extent that they describe matters of federal income tax law or federal income tax legal conclusions, are correct in all material respects.
(iii) Based upon current law, including relevant statutes, regulations and judicial and administrative precedent (which law is subject to change on a retroactive basis), and subject to the limitations and qualifications set forth in such counsel's tax opinion, the Company is organized and currently operates in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a real estate investment trust ("REIT") under the Code, and the Company's proposed method of operation (as described in the Prospectus, Prospectus Supplements and the Management Representation Letter) will enable the Company to continue to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT for the taxable year ending December 31, 2011, and for subsequent taxable years.
(iv) The Company's authorized equity capitalization is as set forth in the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus.

(viii) The information in the Prospectus Supplement under the caption "Description of Preferred Shares and Depositary Shares" and in the Prospectus under the caption "Description of Preferred Shares," to the extent that such information constitutes matters of law or legal conclusions, has been reviewed by us and is accurate in all material respects. The Company's shares of beneficial interest conform as to legal
matters in all material respects to the descriptions thereof set forth in the Prospectus and the General Disclosure Package.

Indemnification and Contribution
(a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each of you and each other Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses (including reasonable costs of investigation) arising out of or based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto, or arising out of or based upon any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission which has been made therein or omitted therefrom in reliance upon and in conformity with the information relating to such Underwriter furnished in writing to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter through you expressly for use in connection therewith. The foregoing indemnity agreement shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have.
(b) If any action, suit or proceeding shall be brought against any Underwriter or any person controlling any Underwriter in respect of which indemnity may be sought against the Company, such Underwriter or such controlling person shall promptly notify the Company (but failure to so notify the Company shall not relieve the Company from any liability hereunder to the extent it is not materially prejudiced as a result thereof and in any event shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement) and
the Company shall assume the defense thereof, including the employment of counsel and payment of all fees and expenses; provided, however, that if the defendants in any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be one or more legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, the indemnifying party shall not have the right to direct the defense of such action on behalf of such indemnified party or parties and such indemnified party or parties shall have the right to select separate counsel to defend such action on behalf of such indemnified party or parties. Such Underwriter or any such controlling person shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such action, suit or proceeding and to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Underwriter or such controlling person unless (i) the Company has agreed in writing to pay such fees and expenses, (ii) the Company has failed promptly to assume the defense and employ counsel, or (iii) the named parties to any such action, suit or proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both such Underwriter or such controlling person and the Company and such Underwriter or such controlling person shall have been advised by its counsel that representation of such indemnified party and the Company by the same counsel would be inappropriate under applicable standards of professional conduct (whether or not such representation by the same counsel has been proposed) due to actual or potential differing interests between them (in which case the Company shall not have the right to assume the defense of such action, suit or proceeding on behalf of such Underwriter or such controlling person). It is understood, however, that the Company shall, in connection with any one such action, suit or proceeding or separate but substantially similar or related actions, suits or proceedings in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of only one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to any local counsel) at any time for all such Underwriters and controlling persons not having actual or potential differing interests with you or among themselves, which firm shall be designated in writing by the Representatives, and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. The Company shall not be liable for any settlement of any such action, suit or proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such written consent, or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff in any such action, suit or proceeding, the Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless any Underwriter, to the extent provided in the preceding paragraph, and any such controlling person from and against any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense by reason of such settlement or judgment.
(c) Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers who sign the Registration Statement, and any person who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, but only with respect to information relating to such Underwriter furnished in writing by or on behalf of such Underwriter through you expressly for use in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto. If any action, suit or proceeding shall be brought against the Company, any of its directors, any such officer, or any such controlling person based on the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, and in respect of which indemnity may be
sought against any Underwriter pursuant to this paragraph (c), such Underwriter shall have the rights and duties given to the Company by paragraph (b) above (except that if the Company shall have assumed the defense thereof such Underwriter shall not be required to do so, but may employ separate counsel therein and participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at such Underwriter's expense), and the Company, its directors, any such officer, and any such controlling person shall have the rights and duties given to the Underwriters by paragraph (b) above. The foregoing indemnity agreement shall be in addition to any liability which the Underwriters may otherwise have.
(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 7 is unavailable to an indemnified party under paragraph (a) or (c) hereof in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to therein, then an indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Shares, or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or by the Underwriters on the other hand and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
(e) The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by a pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in paragraph (d) above. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses referred to in paragraph (d) above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating any claim or defending any such action, suit or proceeding. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price of the Shares underwritten by it and distributed to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person
who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to the respective numbers of Firm Shares set forth opposite their names in Schedule I hereto (or such numbers of Firm Shares increased as set forth in Section 9 hereof) and not joint.
(f) No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened action, suit or proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such action, suit or proceeding and does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
(g) If at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel, such indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of the nature contemplated by Section 7(b) effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 45 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request, (ii) such indemnifying party shall have received notice of the terms of such settlement at least 30 days prior to such settlement being entered into and (iii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed such indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel, an indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of the nature contemplated by Section 7(b) effected without its consent if such indemnifying party (i) reimburses such indemnified party in accordance with such request to the extent such indemnifying party considers such request to be reasonable and (ii) provides written notice to the indemnified party substantiating the unpaid balance as unreasonable, in each case prior to the date of such settlement.
(h) Any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses for which an indemnified party is entitled to indemnification or contribution under this Section 7 shall be paid by the indemnifying party to the indemnified party as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses are incurred. The indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this Section 7 and the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of (i) any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any person controlling any Underwriter, the Company, its directors or officers, or any person controlling the Company, (ii) acceptance of any Shares and payment therefor hereunder, and (iii) any termination of this Agreement. A successor to any Underwriter or any person controlling any Underwriter, or to the Company, its directors or officers, or any person controlling the Company, shall be entitled to the benefits of the indemnity, contribution and reimbursement agreements contained in this Section 7.
8. .

The Company agrees to pay the following costs and expenses and all other costs and expenses incident to the performance by it of its obligations hereunder: (i) the preparation, printing or reproduction, and filing with the Commission of the Registration Statement (including financial statements and exhibits thereto), the Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus, any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus and each amendment or supplement to any of them; (ii) the printing (or reproduction) and delivery (including postage, air freight charges and charges for counting and packaging and any costs associated with electronic delivery) of such copies of the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus, any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, the Incorporated Documents, and all amendments or supplements to any of them, as may be reasonably requested for use in connection with the offering and sale of the Shares; (iii) the preparation, printing, authentication, issuance and delivery of certificates for the Shares and the Preferred Shares, including any stamp taxes in connection with the original issuance and sale of the Shares and the Preferred Shares; (iv) the printing (or reproduction) and delivery of this Agreement, the preliminary and supplemental Blue Sky Memoranda, the Deposit Agreement and all other agreements or documents printed (or reproduced) and delivered in connection with the offering of the Shares and the Preferred Shares; (v) the fees and expenses of the Depositary, including the fees and disbursements of counsel for the Depositary, if any; (vi) the registration of the Shares under the Exchange Act and the listing of the Shares on the New York Stock Exchange; (vii) the registration or qualification of the Shares and the Preferred Shares for offer and sale under the securities or Blue Sky laws of the several states as provided in Section 5(f) hereof (including the reasonable fees, expenses and disbursements of counsel for the Underwriters relating to the preparation, printing or reproduction, and delivery of the preliminary and supplemental Blue Sky Memoranda and such registration and qualification); (viii) the filing fees and the fees and expenses of counsel for the Underwriters in connection with any filings required to be made with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc.; (ix) the transportation and other expenses incurred by or on behalf of Company representatives in connection with presentations to prospective purchasers of the Shares; (x) the fees and expenses of the Company's accountants and the fees and expenses of counsel (including local and special counsel) for the Company; and (xi) the costs and expenses (including without limitation any damages or other amounts payable in connection with legal or contractual liability) associated with the reforming of any contracts for sale of the Shares made by the Underwriters caused by a breach of the representation in Section 4(c).
9.
Effective Date of Agreement.
This Agreement shall become effective: (i) upon the execution and delivery hereof by the parties hereto; or (ii) if, at the time this Agreement is executed and delivered, it is necessary for a post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement to be declared or become effective before the offering of the Shares may commence, when notification of the effectiveness of such post-effective amendment has been released by the Commission. Until such time as this Agreement shall have become effective, it may be terminated by the Company, by notifying you, or by you, as Representatives of the several Underwriters, by notifying the Company.
If any one or more of the Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Shares which it or they are obligated to purchase hereunder on the Closing Date, and the aggregate number of Shares which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters are obligated but fail or refuse to purchase is not more than one-tenth of the aggregate number of Shares which the Underwriters are obligated to purchase on the Closing Date, each non-defaulting Underwriter shall be obligated, severally, in the proportion which the number of Firm Shares set forth opposite its name in Schedule I hereto bears to the aggregate number of Firm Shares set forth opposite the names of all non-defaulting Underwriters or in such other proportion as you may specify in accordance with Section XI of the Master Agreement Among Underwriters of Salomon Smith Barney, dated July 1, 1999, to purchase the Shares which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters are obligated, but fail or refuse, to purchase. If any one or more of the Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Shares which it or they are obligated to purchase on the Closing Date and the aggregate number of Shares with respect to which such default occurs is more than one-tenth of the aggregate number of Shares which the Underwriters are obligated to purchase on the Closing Date and arrangements satisfactory to you and the Company for the purchase of such Shares by one or more non-defaulting Underwriters or other party or parties approved by you and the Company are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement will terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company. In any such case which does not result in termination of this Agreement, either you or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date, but in no event for longer than seven days, in order that the required changes, if any, in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus or any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Any action taken under this paragraph shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any such default of any such Underwriter under this Agreement. The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement includes, for all purposes of this Agreement, any party not listed in Schedule I hereto who, with your approval and the approval of the Company, purchases Shares which a defaulting Underwriter is obligated, but fails or refuses, to purchase.
Any notice under this Section 9 may be given by telegram, telecopy or telephone but shall be subsequently confirmed by letter.
10. .

This Agreement shall be subject to termination in your absolute discretion, without liability on the part of any Underwriter to the Company by notice to the Company, if prior to the Closing Date or any Option Closing Date (if different from the Closing Date and then only as to the Additional Shares, as the case may be, (i) there has been, since the time of execution of this Agreement or since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Prospectus or the General Disclosure Package, any material adverse change, or any development involving a prospective material adverse change, in the condition, financial or otherwise, or in the business, properties, net worth or results of operations of the Company, the Subsidiaries or the Partnerships, whether or not arising in the ordinary course of business, (ii) trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq National Market shall have been suspended or materially limited, (iii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities in New York or California shall have been
declared by either federal or state authorities, or (iv) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities or other international or domestic calamity, crisis or change in political, financial or economic conditions, the effect of which on the financial markets of the United States is such as to make it, in your judgment, impracticable or inadvisable to commence or continue the offering of the Shares at the offering price to the public set forth on the cover page of the Prospectus or to enforce contracts for the resale of the Shares by the Underwriters. Notice of such termination may be given to the Company by telegram, telecopy or telephone and shall be subsequently confirmed by letter.

14. .
No Advisory or Fiduciary Relationships
The Company hereby acknowledges that (a) the purchase and sale of the Shares pursuant to this Agreement is an arm's-length commercial transaction between the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters and any affiliate through which it may be acting, on the other, (b) the Underwriters are acting as principal and not as an agent or fiduciary of the Company and (c) the Company's engagement of the Underwriters in connection with the offering and the process leading up to the offering is as independent contractors and not in any other capacity. Furthermore, the Company agrees that it is solely responsible for making its own judgments in connection with the offering of the Shares (irrespective of whether any of the Underwriters has advised or is currently advising the Company on related or other matters). The Company agrees that it will not claim that the Underwriters have rendered advisory services of any nature or respect, or owe an agency, fiduciary or similar duty to the Company, in connection with the offering of the Shares or the process leading thereto.
Please confirm that the foregoing correctly sets forth the agreement between the Company and the several Underwriters.

If, upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Trust, the amounts payable with respect to the shares of this Series and any other shares of the Trust ranking as to any such distribution on a parity with the shares of this Series are not paid in full, the holders of shares of this Series and of such other shares (including the Parity Preferred Shares) will share ratably in any such distribution of assets of the Trust in proportion to the full respective preferential amounts to which they are entitled. After payment of the full amount of the liquidating distribution to which they are entitled, the holders of shares of this Series will not be entitled to any further participation in any distribution of assets by the Trust.
(1) Written notice of any such liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Trust, stating the payment date or dates when, and the place or places where the amounts distributable in such circumstances shall be payable, shall be given by first class mail, postage pre-paid, not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the payment date stated therein, to each record holder of the shares of this Series at the respective addresses of such holders as the same shall appear on the share transfer records of the Trust.
(2) For purposes of liquidation rights, a reorganization, consolidation or merger of the Trust with or into any other entity or entities or a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Trust shall be deemed not to be a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Trust.
(c) .
Redemption
(1) Except as provided in clause (9) below, the shares of this Series are not redeemable prior to April 14, 2016. On and after such date, the shares of this Series are redeemable at the option of the Trust, by resolution of the Board of Trustees, in whole or in part, from time to time upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice, at a cash redemption price of $25,000 per share plus all accumulated and unpaid distributions (whether or not earned or declared) to the date of redemption.
(2) If fewer than all the outstanding shares of this Series are to be redeemed, the number of
shares to be redeemed will be determined by the Board of Trustees, and such shares shall be redeemed pro rata from the holders of record of such shares in proportion to the number of such shares held by such holders (with adjustments to avoid redemption of fractional shares) or by lot in a manner determined by the Board of Trustees.
(3) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any distributions, including any accumulation, on the shares of this Series are in arrears, no shares of this Series shall be redeemed unless all outstanding shares of this Series are simultaneously redeemed, and the Trust shall not purchase or otherwise acquire, directly or indirectly, any shares of this Series; , , that the foregoing shall not prevent the purchase or acquisition of shares of this Series pursuant to a purchase or exchange offer provided such offer is made on the same terms to all holders of shares of this Series.
provided
however
(4) Immediately prior to any redemption of shares of this Series, the Trust shall pay, in cash, any accumulated and unpaid distributions through the redemption date, unless a redemption date falls after a distribution payment record date and prior to the corresponding distribution payment date, in which case each holder of shares of this Series at the close of business on such distribution payment record date shall be entitled to the distribution payable on such shares on the corresponding distribution payment date notwithstanding the redemption of such shares before such distribution payment date. Except as expressly provided herein above, the Trust shall make no payment or allowance for unpaid distributions, whether or not in arrears, on shares of this Series called for redemption.
(5) Notice of redemption shall be given by publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the County of Los Angeles and the City of New York, such publication to be made once a week for two successive weeks, commencing not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption thereof. A similar notice will be mailed by the Trust by first class mail, postage pre-paid, to each record holder of the shares of this Series to be redeemed, not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to such redemption date, to the respective addresses of such holders as the same shall appear on the share transfer records of the Trust. Each notice shall state: (i) the redemption date; (ii) the number of shares of this Series to be redeemed; (iii) the redemption price; (iv) the place or places where certificates for such shares are to be surrendered for payment of the redemption price; and (v) that distributions on the shares to be redeemed will cease to accumulate on such redemption date. If fewer than all the shares of this Series held by any holder are to be redeemed, the notice mailed to such holder shall also specify the number of shares of this Series to be redeemed from such holder.
(6) In order to facilitate the redemption of shares of this Series, the Board of Trustees may fix a record date for the determination of the shares to be redeemed, such record date to be not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for such redemption.
(7) Notice having been given as provided above, from and after the date fixed for the redemption of shares of this Series by the Trust (unless the Trust shall fail to make available the money necessary to effect such redemption), the holders of shares selected for redemption shall cease to be shareholders with respect to such shares and shall have no interest in or claim against the Trust by virtue thereof and shall have no voting or other rights with respect to such shares,
except the right to receive the moneys payable upon such redemption from the Trust, less any required tax withholding amount, without interest thereon, upon surrender (and endorsement or assignment of transfer, if required by the Trust and so stated in the notice) of their certificates, and the shares represented thereby shall no longer be deemed to be outstanding. If fewer than all the shares represented by a certificate are redeemed, a new certificate shall be issued, without cost to the holder thereof, representing the unredeemed shares. The Trust may, at its option, at any time after a notice of redemption has been given, deposit the redemption price for the shares of this Series designated for redemption and not yet redeemed, plus any accumulated and unpaid distributions thereon to the date fixed for redemption, with the transfer agent or agents for this Series, as a trust fund for the benefit of the holders of the shares of this Series designated for redemption, together with irrevocable instructions and authority to such transfer agent or agents that such funds be delivered upon redemption of such shares and to pay, on and after the date fixed for redemption or prior thereto, the redemption price of the shares to their respective holders upon the surrender of their share certificates. From and after the making of such deposit, the holders of the shares designated for redemption shall cease to be shareholders with respect to such shares and shall have no interest in or claim against the Trust by virtue thereof and shall have no voting or other rights with respect to such shares, except the right to receive from such trust fund the moneys payable upon such redemption, without interest thereon, upon surrender (and endorsement or assignment of transfer, if required by the Trust and so stated in the notice) of their certificates, and the shares represented thereby shall no longer be deemed to be outstanding. Any balance of such moneys remaining unclaimed at the end of the five-year period commencing on the date fixed for redemption shall be repaid to the Trust upon its request expressed in a resolution of its Board of Trustees.
(8) Any shares of this Series that shall at any time have been redeemed shall, after such redemption, have the status of authorized but unissued Preferred Shares, without designation as to series until such shares are once more designated as part of a particular series by the Board of Trustees.
(9) If the Board of Trustees shall, at any time and in good faith, be of the opinion that ownership of securities of the Trust has or may become concentrated to an extent that may prevent the Trust from qualifying as a real estate investment trust under the REIT Provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, then the Board of Trustees shall have the power, by lot or other means deemed equitable by them to prevent the transfer of and/or to call for redemption a number of shares of this Series sufficient, in the opinion of the Board of Trustees, to maintain or bring the direct or indirect ownership thereof into conformity with the requirements of such a real estate investment trust under the REIT Provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. The redemption price to be paid for shares of this Series so called for redemption, on the date fixed for redemption, shall be (i) the closing sale price on any national securities exchange or trading market on which the shares of this Series are listed, or (ii) the last quoted price as reported by any United States automated inter-dealer quotation system, on the last business day prior to the redemption date, or if the shares of this Series so called for redemption are not listed on any such exchange, trading market or quotation system, at $25,000 per share of this Series (subject to adjustment in the case of share splits, combinations, share distributions and similar transactions); provided that if interests in shares of this Series are represented by depositary shares, then the redemption price shall be determined in accordance with the foregoing, but with respect to one
depositary share, multiplied by the number of depositary shares that together represent an interest in one share of this Series. From and after the date fixed for redemption by the Board of Trustees, the holder of any shares of this Series so called for redemption shall cease to be entitled to any distributions, voting rights and other benefits with respect to such shares of this Series, other than the right to payment of the redemption price determined as aforesaid. "REIT Provisions of the Internal Revenue Code" shall mean Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. In order to exercise the redemption option set forth in this clause (9), with respect to the shares of this Series, the Trust shall give notice of redemption by publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the County of Los Angeles and the City of New York, such publication to be made once a week for two successive weeks, commencing not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption. A similar notice will be mailed by the Trust by first class mail, postage pre-paid, to each record holder of the shares of this Series to be redeemed, not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to such redemption date, to the respective addresses of such holders as the same shall appear on the share transfer records of the Trust. Each notice shall state: (i) the redemption date; (ii) the number of shares of this Series to be redeemed; (iii) the redemption price; (iv) the place or places where certificates for such shares are to be surrendered for payment of the redemption price; and (v) that distributions on the shares to be redeemed will cease to accumulate on such redemption date. If fewer than all the shares of this Series held by any holder are to be redeemed, the notice mailed to such holder shall also specify the number of shares of this Series to be redeemed from such holder.
(d) . The shares of this Series shall not have any voting powers either general or special, except as required by law and except that:
Voting Rights
(1) If the Trust shall fail to pay full cumulative distributions on the shares of this Series or any other of its Preferred Shares for six quarterly distribution payment periods, whether or not consecutive (a ""), the holders of all outstanding Preferred Shares, voting as a single class without regard to series, will be entitled to elect two Trustees until full cumulative distributions for all past distribution payment periods on all Preferred Shares have been paid or declared and funds therefor set apart for payment. Such right to vote separately as a class to elect Trustees shall, when vested, be subject, always, to the same provisions for the vesting of such right to elect Trustees separately as a class in the case of future Distribution Defaults. At any time when such right to elect Trustees separately as a class shall have so vested, the Trust may, and upon the written request of the holders of record of not less than 10% of the total number of Preferred Shares of the Trust then outstanding shall, call a special meeting of shareholders for the election of Trustees. In the case of such a written request, such special meeting shall be held within 90 days after the delivery of such request and, in either case, at the place and upon the notice provided by law and in the Bylaws of the Trust, provided that the Trust shall not be required to call such a special meeting if such request is received less than 120 days before the date fixed for the next ensuing Annual Meeting of Shareholders of the Trust and the holders of all classes of outstanding Preferred Shares are afforded the opportunity to elect such Trustees (or fill any vacancy) at such Annual Meeting of Shareholders. Trustees elected as aforesaid shall serve until the next Annual Meeting of Shareholders of the Trust or until their respective successors shall be elected and qualified. If, prior to the end of the term of any Trustee elected as aforesaid, a vacancy in the office of such Trustee shall occur during the continuance of a Distribution Default by reason of death, resignation, or disability, such vacancy
Distribution Default
shall be filled for the unexpired term by the appointment of a new Trustee for the unexpired term of such former Trustee, such appointment to be made by the remaining Trustee elected as aforesaid.
(2) The affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least 66
2/3
% of the outstanding shares of this Series, voting separately as a class, will be required for any amendment to the Declaration of Trust that will materially and adversely alter or change the powers, preferences, privileges or rights of the shares of this Series, except as set forth below. The affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least 66
2/3
% of the outstanding shares of this Series and any other Series of Preferred Shares ranking on a parity with this Series as to distributions and upon liquidation (including the Parity Preferred Shares), voting as a single class without regard to series, will be required to issue, authorize or increase the authorized amount of any class or Series of shares ranking prior to this Series as to distributions or upon liquidation or to issue or authorize any obligation or security convertible into or evidencing a right to purchase any such security, but the Declaration of Trust may be amended to increase the number of authorized Preferred Shares ranking on a parity with or junior to this Series or to create another class of Preferred Shares ranking on a parity with or junior to this Series without the vote of the holders of outstanding shares of this Series.
(e) . The shares of this Series are not convertible into shares of any other class or Series of the shares of beneficial interest of this Trust.
