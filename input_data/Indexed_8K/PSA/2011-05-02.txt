Agreements of the Company
The Company agrees with the Underwriter as follows:
(a) The Company will not, either prior to the Effective Date or thereafter during such period as the Prospectus is required by law to be delivered in connection with sales of the Shares by the Underwriter or any dealer (including in circumstances where such requirement may be satisfied pursuant to Rule 172), file any amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, unless a copy thereof shall first have been submitted to the Underwriter within a reasonable period of time prior to the filing thereof and the Underwriter shall not have objected thereto in good faith.
(b) The Company will notify the Underwriter promptly, and will confirm such advice in writing, (1) when any post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement becomes effective, (2) of the receipt of any comments from or any request by the Commission for amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus or for additional information, (3) of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement, any notice objecting to its use or the initiation of any proceedings for that purpose or the threat thereof, (4) of the happening of any event during the period mentioned in the second sentence of Section 5(e) that in the judgment of the Company makes any statement made in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus untrue or that requires the making of any changes in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they are made, not misleading, and (5) of receipt by the Company or any representative or attorney of the Company of any other communication from the Commission relating to the Company, the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus. If at any time the Commission shall issue any order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement, the Company will make every reasonable effort to obtain the withdrawal of such order at the earliest possible moment.
(c) The Company will furnish to the Underwriter, without charge, four copies of the signed copies of the Registration Statement and of any post-effective amendment thereto, including financial statements and schedules, and all exhibits thereto (including any document filed under the Exchange Act and deemed to be incorporated by reference into the Prospectus) and will furnish to the Underwriter, without charge copies of the Registration Statement and any post-effective amendment thereto, including financial statements and schedules but without exhibits.
(d) The Company will comply with all the provisions of any undertakings contained in the Registration Statement.
(e) The Company will deliver to the Underwriter, without charge, as many copies of the Prospectus, each Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto as the Underwriter may reasonably request. The Company consents to the use of the Prospectus, each Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto by the several Underwriter and by all dealers to whom the Shares may be sold, both in connection with
the offering or sale of the Shares and for any period of time thereafter during which the Prospectus is required by law to be delivered in connection therewith (including in circumstances where such requirement may be satisfied pursuant to Rule 172 of the Act). If during such period of time any event shall occur which in the judgment of the Company or counsel to the Underwriter should be set forth in the Prospectus in order to make any statement therein, in the light of the circumstances under which it was made, not misleading, or if it is necessary to supplement or amend the Prospectus to comply with law, subject to the provisions of Section 5(a) hereof, the Company will forthwith prepare and duly file with the Commission an appropriate supplement or amendment thereto, and will deliver to the Underwriter, without charge, such number of copies thereof as the Underwriter may reasonably request. The Company shall not file any document under the Exchange Act before the termination of the offering of the Shares by the Underwriter if such document would be deemed to be incorporated by reference into the Prospectus which is not approved by the Underwriter after reasonable notice thereof. If there occurs an event or development as a result of which the General Disclosure Package would include an untrue statement of a material fact or would omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances then prevailing, not misleading, the Company will notify promptly the Underwriter so that any use of the General Disclosure Package may cease until it is amended or supplemented. The Company will prepare a final term sheet (the "Final Term Sheet") reflecting the final terms of the Shares, in form and substance satisfactory to the Underwriter, and shall file such Final Term Sheet as an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus pursuant to Rule 433 prior to the close of business two business days after the date hereof; provided that the Company shall provide the Underwriter with copies of any such Final Term Sheet a reasonable amount of time prior to such proposed filing and will not use or file any such document to which the Underwriter or counsel to the Underwriter shall reasonably object.
(f) The Company will cooperate with the Underwriter and counsel to the Underwriter in connection with the registration or qualification of the Shares and the Preferred Shares for offer and sale under the securities or Blue Sky laws of such jurisdictions as the Underwriter may reasonably request; provided, that in no event shall the Company be obligated to qualify to do business in any jurisdiction where it is not now so qualified or to take any action which would subject it to general service of process in any jurisdiction where it is not now so subject.
(g) During the period of five years commencing on the date hereof, the Company will furnish to the Underwriter who may so request copies of such financial statements and other periodic and special reports as the Company may from time to time distribute generally to the holders of any class of its capital stock, and will furnish to the Underwriter who may so request a copy of each annual or other report it shall be required to file with the Commission.
(h) The Company will make generally available to holders of its securities as soon as may be practicable but in no event later than the last day of the fifteenth full calendar month following the calendar quarter in which the Effective Date falls, an earnings statement (which need not be audited but shall be in reasonable detail), with respect to the Company, the Subsidiaries and the Partnerships, for a period of 12 months commencing after the Effective Date of the Registration Statement, and satisfying the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Act (including Rule 158 thereunder) and will file such earnings statement as an exhibit to the next periodic
report required by Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act covering the period when the earnings statement is released.
(i) If this Agreement shall terminate or shall be terminated after execution pursuant to any provisions hereof (otherwise than by notice given by you terminating this Agreement pursuant to Section 9 or Section 10 hereof) or if this Agreement shall be terminated by the Underwriter because of any failure or refusal on the part of the Company to comply with the terms or fulfill any of the conditions of this Agreement, the Company agrees to reimburse the Underwriter for all out-of-pocket expenses (including fees and expenses of counsel for the Underwriter) reasonably incurred by you in connection herewith.
(j) The Company will not at any time, directly or indirectly, take any action intended, or which might reasonably be expected, to cause or result in, or which will constitute, stabilization of the price of the Shares to facilitate the sale or resale of any of the Shares in violation of the Act.
(k) The Company will apply the net proceeds from the offering and sale of the Shares in the manner set forth in the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus under "Use of Proceeds."
(l) The Company will use its best efforts to have the Shares listed, subject to notice of issuance, on the New York Stock Exchange.
(m) The Company represents and agrees that, unless it obtains the prior written consent of the Underwriter, and the Underwriter represents and agrees with the Company that, unless it has obtained or will obtain, as the case may be, the prior written consent of the Company, it has not made and will not make any offer relating to the Shares that would constitute an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or that would otherwise constitute a "free writing prospectus" (as defined in Rule 405 of the Act) required to be filed by the Company with the Commission or retained by the Company under Rule 433 of the Act. Any such free writing prospectus consented to by the Underwriter or the Company is hereinafter referred to as a "Permitted Free Writing Prospectus." The Company agrees that (x) it has treated and will treat, as the case may be, each Permitted Free Writing Prospectus as an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and (y) it has complied and will comply, as the case may be, with the requirements of Rules 164 and 433 of the Act applicable to any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, including in respect of timely filing with the Commission, legending and record keeping. The Company consents to the use by the Underwriter of a free writing prospectus that (a) is not an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus as defined in Rule 433, and (b) contains only (i) information describing the preliminary terms of the Shares or their offering or (ii) information that describes the final terms of the Shares or their offering and that is included in the Final Term Sheet of the Company contemplated in Section 5(e).

(iii) The forms of certificates for the Shares are in valid and sufficient form in compliance with New York Stock Exchange requirements.
(iv) To the best of my knowledge, after due inquiry, there is no pending or threatened action, suit or proceeding before any court or governmental agency, authority or body or arbitrator involving the Company, any of the Subsidiaries or any of the Partnerships of a character required to be disclosed in the Registration Statement which is not adequately disclosed in the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus, and there is no franchise, contract or other document of a character required to be described in the Registration Statement or the General Disclosure Package and Prospectus, or to be filed as an exhibit, which is not described or filed as required; and, to the best of my knowledge, after due inquiry, the statements in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010 under Part II, Item 7 - "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Requirement to Pay Distributions" and under Part III, Item 13 - "Certain Relationships and Related Transactions and Director Independence" fairly summarize the matters therein described in all material respects.

being conducted and as described in the Prospectus; and, to the best of my knowledge, after due inquiry, all such authorizations, approvals, licenses, certificates and permits are in full force and effect, except where the failure to be in full force and effect would not have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, such Subsidiary or such Partnership, and the Company, each Subsidiary and each Partnership are complying with all applicable laws, the violation of which could have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, such Subsidiary or such Partnership, as the case may be.
(ix) The Company is not in violation of its Declaration of Trust or bylaws and each of the Subsidiaries are not in violation of its articles of incorporation or by-laws, and each of the Partnerships is not in violation of its respective partnership agreement, and to the best of my knowledge, after due inquiry, neither the Company, the Subsidiaries nor any Partnership is in default in the performance of any obligation, agreement or condition contained in any loan, note or other evidence of indebtedness or in any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust or any other material agreement by which it or its properties are bound, except for such defaults as could not, individually or the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, such Subsidiary or such Partnership, as the case may be.
(x) Neither the issue and sale of the Shares nor the consummation of any of the other transactions contemplated by the Agreement (including without limitation the execution, delivery and performance of the Deposit Agreement, the issuance and deposit of the Preferred Shares in accordance with the Deposit Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated therein) nor the fulfillment of the terms hereof or thereof will conflict with, result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under any law or the articles of incorporation or by-laws of the Subsidiaries or the partnership agreement of any of the Partnerships or the terms of any indenture or other agreement or instrument known to me and to which the Company, any of the Subsidiaries or any of the Partnerships is a party or is bound or any judgment, order or decree known to me to be applicable to the Company, any of the Subsidiaries or any of the Partnerships of any court, regulatory body, administrative agency, governmental body or arbitrator having jurisdiction over the Company, any of the Subsidiaries or any of the Partnerships.

(xiii) To the best of such counsel's knowledge, after reasonable inquiry, neither the Company, any of the Subsidiaries nor any of the Partnerships is in violation of
any law, ordinance, administrative or governmental rule or regulation applicable to the Company, any of the Subsidiaries or any of the Partnerships or of any decree of any court or governmental agency or body having jurisdiction over the Company, any of the Subsidiaries or any of the Partnerships, the violation of which could have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, such Subsidiary or such Partnership, as the case may be.

(xvi) Except as described in the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus and in Section 4(t) of the Agreement, to the best of such counsel's knowledge, after reasonable inquiry, there are no outstanding options, warrants or other rights calling for the issuance of, and there are no commitments, plans or arrangements to issue, any shares of capital stock of the Company or any security convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for capital stock of the Company.

In addition, such counsel shall state that she has participated in conferences with representatives of the Underwriter, and with officers and other representatives of the Company and representatives of the independent certified public accountants of the Company, at which conferences the contents of the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus and related matters were discussed and, although such counsel does not pass upon and does not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, on the basis of the foregoing (relying as to certain factual matters on the information provided to such counsel by the Company and not on an independent investigation, but in the absence of information to the contrary), no facts have come to such counsel's attention which leads such counsel to believe that any part of the Registration Statement, when such part became effective or was deemed to have become effective, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or that the Prospectus, as of its date and as of the Closing Date, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; provided that such counsel need not express any comment with respect to the financial statements and other financial data included in the Registration Statement or Prospectus. In addition, such counsel shall state that no facts have come to such counsel's attention which leads such counsel to believe that the documents included in the General Disclosure Package, all considered together, as of the Applicable Time, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; provided that such counsel need not express any comment with respect to the financial statements and other financial data included in the General Disclosure Package.
(e) The Underwriter shall have received an opinion, dated the Closing Date and satisfactory in form and substance to counsel for the Underwriter, from Hogan Lovells US LLP, counsel for the Company, to the effect that:

(iii) Based upon current law, including relevant statutes, regulations and judicial and administrative precedent (which law is subject to change on a retroactive basis), and subject to the limitations and qualifications set forth in such counsel's tax opinion, the Company is organized and currently operates in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a real estate investment trust ("REIT") under the Code, and the Company's proposed method of operation (as described in the Prospectus, Prospectus Supplements and the Management Representation Letter) will enable the Company to continue to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT for the taxable year ending December 31, 2011, and for subsequent taxable years.

Indemnification and Contribution
(a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless you and each person, if any, who controls you within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses (including reasonable costs of investigation) arising out of or based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto, or arising out of or based upon any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission which has been made therein or omitted therefrom in reliance upon and in conformity with the information relating to you furnished in writing to the Company by or on behalf of you expressly for use in connection therewith. The foregoing indemnity agreement shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have.
(b) If any action, suit or proceeding shall be brought against you or any person controlling you in respect of which indemnity may be sought against the Company, you or such controlling person shall promptly notify the Company (but failure to so notify the Company shall not relieve the Company from any liability hereunder to the extent it is not materially prejudiced as a result thereof and in any event shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement) and the Company shall assume the defense thereof, including the employment of counsel and payment of all fees and expenses; provided, however, that if the defendants in any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be one or more legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, the indemnifying party shall not have the right to direct the defense of such action on behalf of such indemnified party or parties and such indemnified party or parties shall have the right to select separate counsel to defend such action on behalf of such indemnified party or parties. You or any such controlling person shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such action, suit or proceeding and to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of you or such controlling person unless (i) the Company has agreed in writing to pay such fees and expenses, (ii) the Company has failed promptly to assume the defense and employ counsel, or (iii) the named parties to any such action, suit or proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both you or such controlling person and the Company and you or such controlling person shall have been advised by its counsel that representation of such
indemnified party and the Company by the same counsel would be inappropriate under applicable standards of professional conduct (whether or not such representation by the same counsel has been proposed) due to actual or potential differing interests between them (in which case the Company shall not have the right to assume the defense of such action, suit or proceeding on behalf of you or such controlling person). It is understood, however, that the Company shall, in connection with any one such action, suit or proceeding or separate but substantially similar or related actions, suits or proceedings in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of only one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to any local counsel) at any time for you and such controlling persons not having actual or potential differing interests with you or among themselves, which firm shall be designated in writing by you, and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. The Company shall not be liable for any settlement of any such action, suit or proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such written consent, or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff in any such action, suit or proceeding, the Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless you, to the extent provided in the preceding paragraph, and any such controlling person from and against any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense by reason of such settlement or judgment.
(c) You agree, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers who sign the Registration Statement, and any person who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to you, but only with respect to information relating to you furnished in writing by or on behalf of you expressly for use in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto. If any action, suit or proceeding shall be brought against the Company, any of its directors, any such officer, or any such controlling person based on the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, and in respect of which indemnity may be sought against any Underwriter pursuant to this paragraph (c), you shall have the rights and duties given to the Company by paragraph (b) above (except that if the Company shall have assumed the defense thereof you shall not be required to do so, but may employ separate counsel therein and participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at your expense), and the Company, its directors, any such officer, and any such controlling person shall have the rights and duties given to you by paragraph (b) above. The foregoing indemnity agreement shall be in addition to any liability which you may otherwise have.
(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 7 is unavailable to an indemnified party under paragraph (a) or (c) hereof in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to therein, then an indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and you on the other hand from the offering of the Shares, or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and you on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable
considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and you on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by you, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and you on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or by you on the other hand and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
(e) The Company and you agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by a pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in paragraph (d) above. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses referred to in paragraph (d) above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating any claim or defending any such action, suit or proceeding. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, you shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price of the Shares underwritten by you and distributed to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which you have otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
(f) No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened action, suit or proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such action, suit or proceeding and does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
(g) If at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel, such indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of the nature contemplated by Section 7(b) effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 45 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request, (ii) such indemnifying party shall have received notice of the terms of such settlement at least 30 days prior to such settlement being entered into and (iii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed such indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel, an indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of the nature contemplated by Section 7(b) effected without its consent if such indemnifying party (i) reimburses such indemnified party in accordance with such request to the extent such
indemnifying party considers such request to be reasonable and (ii) provides written notice to the indemnified party substantiating the unpaid balance as unreasonable, in each case prior to the date of such settlement.
(h) Any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses for which an indemnified party is entitled to indemnification or contribution under this Section 7 shall be paid by the indemnifying party to the indemnified party as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses are incurred. The indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this Section 7 and the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of (i) any investigation made by or on behalf of you or any person controlling you, the Company, its directors or officers, or any person controlling the Company, (ii) acceptance of any Shares and payment therefor hereunder, and (iii) any termination of this Agreement. A successor to you or any person controlling you, or to the Company, its directors or officers, or any person controlling the Company, shall be entitled to the benefits of the indemnity, contribution and reimbursement agreements contained in this Section 7.
