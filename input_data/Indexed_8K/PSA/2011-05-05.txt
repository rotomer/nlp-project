March 31, 2011.
 
Operating Results for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2011
 
For the three months ended March 31, 2011, net income allocable to our common shareholders was $148.1 million or $0.87 per diluted common share, compared to $34.7 million or $0.21 per diluted common share for the same period in 2010, representing an increase of $113.4 million or $0.66 per diluted common share.  This increase is due to (i) a foreign currency exchange gain of $31.3 million during the quarter ended March 31, 2011 as compared to a loss of $34.8 million for the same period in 2010, (ii) an Emerging Issues Task Force D-42 (EITF D-42) charge totaling $25.7 million incurred in the three months ended March 31, 2010, in connection with the redemption of our Equity Shares, Series A, and (iii) improved operations of our Same Store Facilities (discussed below) and our non same store facilities.
 
Revenues for the Same Store Facilities (see table below) increased 3.4% or $12.0 million in the quarter ended March 31, 2011 as compared to the same period in 2010, primarily due to a 1.7% increase in average occupancy and a 1.4% increase in realized rent per occupied square foot.  Cost of operations for the Same Store Facilities remained flat in the quarter ended March 31, 2011 as compared to the same period in 2010.  Net operating income for our Same Store Facilities increased 5.4% or $12.1 million in the quarter ended March 31, 2011 as compared to the same period in 2010.
 
Funds from Operations
 
For the three months ended March 31, 2011, funds from operations (FFO) was $1.48 per common share on a diluted basis as compared to $0.78 per diluted common share for the same period in 2010, representing an increase of $0.70 per diluted common share or 89.7%.
 
For the three months ended March 31, 2011, FFO was impacted by (i) a foreign currency exchange gain of $31.3 million (compared to a loss of $34.8 million for the same period in 2010), and (ii) a $3 million gain for our equity share of PS Business Parks (PSB) redemption of preferred shares in applying EITF D-42.
 
For the three months ended March 31, 2010, FFO was impacted by, (i) a $25.7 million reduction from the application of EITF D-42 to the redemption of Equity Shares, Series A and (ii) a $1.0 million impairment of real estate and other assets.
 
The following table provides a summary of the per-share impact of the items noted above:

FFO is a term defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT).  It is generally defined as net income before depreciation with respect to real estate assets and gains and losses on real estate assets.  FFO is presented because management and many analysts consider FFO to be one measure of the performance of real estate companies.  In addition, we believe that FFO is helpful to investors as an additional measure of the performance of a REIT, because net income includes the impact of depreciation, which assumes that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time, while we believe that the value of real estate fluctuates due to market conditions and in response to inflation.  FFO computations do not consider scheduled principal payments on debt, capital improvements, distributions and other obligations of the Company.  FFO is not a substitute for our cash flow or net income as a measure of our liquidity or operating performance or our ability to pay dividends.  Other REITs may not compute FFO in the same manner; accordingly, FFO may not be comparable among REITs. See the attached reconciliation of net income to funds from operations included in the selectedfinancial data attached to this press release.

Property Operations  Same Store Facilities
 
The Same Store Facilities represent those 1,931 facilities that are stabilized and owned since January 1, 2009 and therefore provide meaningful comparisons for 2009, 2010 and 2011.  The Same Store Facilities increased from 1,925 at December 31, 2010 to 1,931 at March 31, 2011. The following table summarizes the historical operating results of these 1,931 facilities (121.6 million net rentable square feet) that represent approximately 94% of the aggregate net rentable square feet of our U.S. consolidated self-storage portfolio at March 31, 2011.

The following table summarizes additional selected financial data with respect to the Same Store Facilities (unaudited):
 
Shurgard Europe
 
We own a 49% equity interest in Shurgard Europe, with the remaining 51% equity interest owned by an institutional investor.  We account for our investment in Shurgard Europe under the equity method.
 
On March 2, 2011, Shurgard Europe acquired its JV partners 80% interest in two joint ventures for 172 million ($238 million), and as a result wholly owns the 72 properties previously held by the two joint ventures.   We loaned approximately $238 million to Shurgard Europe to finance this transaction.  This loan bears interest at a fixed rate of 7.0% per annum, matures May 31, 2011, and is denominated in U.S. Dollars.  As of March 31, 2011, this loan totaled $238 million.  We expect our joint venture partner in Shurgard Europe to acquire 51%, representing their pro-rata ownership of Shurgard Europe, of the loan by May 31, 2011.  Following our joint venture partners funding of its pro-rata share, the loan will be restructured, and we do not expect repayment of this loan in the short-term.
 
At March 31, 2011, Shurgard Europe had an interest in 188 facilities (10 million net rentable square feet) located in seven Western European countries.  Seventy-two of the properties are encumbered by two loans totaling approximately 198.8 million ($280 million) at March 31, 2011.  The loans are payable to various banks and do not have recourse to Shurgard Europes other 116 properties or to Public Storage.  One of the loans, totaling 90.8 million ($128 million), is due May 2011 with an option to extend one additional year. The other loan, totaling 108.0 million ($152 million) matures in July 2013.
 
Our existing 363.8 million loan ($512.9 million at March 31, 2011) to Shurgard Europe matures on March 31, 2013, and accrues interest at 9.0% per annum.  We received principal payments on this loan totaling 9.9 million ($13.4 million) in the three months ended March 31, 2011.  The loan is denominated in Euros, and currently is not hedged for future currency exchange fluctuations; accordingly, the amount of U.S. Dollars that will be received on repayment will depend upon the currency exchange rates at the time.  The timing of future early principal payments will depend on Shurgard Europes available cash flow from operations or financing and its alternative uses for that cash flow.

Acquisition of Self-Storage Facilities
 
During the three months ended March 31, 2011, we completed the acquisition of five facilities (386,000 net rentable square feet) in Nevada for approximately $19.6 million and in February 2011, we acquired the leasehold interest in the land at one of our existing self-storage facilities for approximately $6.6 million.  We are also under contract to acquire two facilities (227,000 net rentable square feet), one of which is in New York and another in Los Angeles, for an aggregate of approximately $28 million.
 
Capital and Other Investing Activities
 
In addition to the loan provided to Shurgard Europe described above, on February 9, 2011, we loaned PSB $121 million which PSB used to re-pay borrowings against its credit facility and repurchase preferred units.  The loan has a six-month term, no prepayment penalties, and bears interest at a rate of three-month LIBOR plus 0.85%, which is favorable in comparison to our existing rate of return on cash balances.
 
On February 22, 2011, we repaid our $103 million 7.75% unsecured note that matured.
 
On April 14, 2011, we issued 13,800,000 depositary shares (including the subsequent exercise, in part, of the underwriters over-allotment option) at $25.00 per depositary share, with each depositary share representing 1/1,000 of a 6.5% Cumulative Preferred Share of Beneficial Interest, Series Q.  The offering resulted in gross proceeds of $345 million. On May 4, 2011, we issued an additional 1,200,000 shares of Series Q at par resulting in gross proceeds of $30 million.
 
On April 6, 2011, we called for redemption $350 million of our 7.25% Cumulative Preferred Share of Beneficial Interest, Series I, representing a partial redemption of $517.5 million of this series that was outstanding.   In the quarter ending June 30, 2011, we expect to record an allocation of income pursuant to EITF D-42 to the holders of these shares of approximately $11 million, representing the excess paid to redeem these shares over the original issuance proceeds. 
 
Distributions Declared
 
On May 5, 2011, our Board of Trustees declared a regular common dividend of $0.95 per common share, representing an increase of $0.15 per share, or an 18.75% increase, from the previous quarters distribution. The Board also declared dividends with respect to our various series of preferred shares. All the dividends are payable on June 30, 2011, to shareholders of record as of June 15, 2011.

Shurgard Europe Same Store Selected Operating Data
 
The Shurgard Europe Same Store Pool represents those 151 facilities that are wholly-owned and have been operated by Shurgard Europe at a stabilized occupancy level since January 1, 2009 and therefore provide meaningful comparisons for 2009, 2010 and 2011. Due to acquiring Shurgards JV partners 80% interest in two JVs that owned 72 properties on March 2, 2011, the Shurgard Europe Same Store Pool increased from 91 at December 31, 2010 to 151 at March 31, 2011 (61 facilities were moved from the JV Pool to the Same Store Pool and one facility was deleted from the Same Store Pool since it is under redevelopment). The following table reflects the operating results of these 151 facilities.  We account for our investment in Shurgard Europe on the equity method of accounting; accordingly, our pro-rata share of the operating results for these facilities is included in equity in earnings of real estate entities on our income statement.
