GLENDALE
California
June 30, 2011.
 
Operating Results for the Three Months Ended June 30, 2011
 
For the three months ended June 30, 2011, net income allocable to our common shareholders was $131.5 million or $0.77 per diluted common share, compared to $60.8 million or $0.36 per diluted common share for the same period in 2010, representing an increase of $70.7 million or $0.41 per diluted common share.  This increase is due to (i) a foreign currency exchange gain of $10.5 million during the quarter ended June 30, 2011 as compared to a loss of $49.2 million for the same period in 2010, (ii) improved operations of our Same Store Facilities (discussed below) and our non same store facilities and (iii) increased equity in earnings and interest and other income from Shurgard Europe, due primarily to Shurgard Europes acquisition of its joint venture partners interests on March 2, 2011 (discussed below), partially offset by a $9.8 million increase in Emerging Issues Task Force D-42 (EITF D-42) charges related to the redemption of our preferred securities, including our equity share from PS Business Parks, Inc. (PSB).
 
Revenues for the Same Store Facilities (see table below) increased 4.0% or $14.2 million in the quarter ended June 30, 2011 as compared to the same period in 2010, primarily due to a 1.4% increase in average occupancy and a 2.2% increase in realized rent per occupied square foot.  Cost of operations for the Same Store Facilities remained flat in the quarter ended June 30, 2011 as compared to the same period in 2010.  Net operating income for our Same Store Facilities increased 6.2% or $14.5 million in the quarter ended June 30, 2011 as compared to the same period in 2010.
 
Operating Results for the Six Months Ended June 30, 2011
 
For the six months ended June 30, 2011, net income allocable to our common shareholders was $279.6 million or $1.64 per diluted common share, compared to $95.6 million or $0.56 per diluted common share for the same period in 2010, representing an increase of $184.0 million or $1.08 per diluted common share.  This increase is due to (i) a foreign currency exchange gain of $41.7 million during the six months ended June 30, 2011 as compared to a loss of $84.0 million for the same period in 2010, (ii) improved operations of our Same Store Facilities (discussed below) and our non same store facilities, (iii) increased equity in earnings and interest and other income from Shurgard Europe, due primarily to Shurgard Europes acquisition of its joint venture partners interests on March 2, 2011 (discussed below) and (iv) a $19.0 million reduction in EITF D-42 charges related to the redemption of our equity securities, including our equity share from PSB.
 
Revenues for the Same Store Facilities (see table below) increased 3.7% or $26.2 million in the six months ended June 30, 2011 as compared to the same period in 2010, primarily due to a 1.7% increase in average occupancy and a 1.7% increase in realized rent per occupied square foot.  Cost of operations for the Same Store Facilities remained flat in the six months ended June 30, 2011 as compared to the same period in 2010.  Net operating income for our Same Store Facilities increased 5.8% or $26.6 million in the six months ended June 30, 2011 as compared to the same period in 2010.
 
Funds from Operations
 
For the three months ended June 30, 2011, funds from operations (FFO) was $1.39 per common share on a diluted basis as compared to $0.92 per diluted common share for the same period in 2010, representing an increase of $0.47 per diluted common share or 51.1%.
 
For the three months ended June 30, 2011, FFO was impacted by (i) a foreign currency exchange gain of $10.5 million (compared to a loss of $49.2 million for the same period in 2010), (ii) a $15.9 million charge related to our redemption of preferred shares in applying EITF D-42 (compared to a $6.1 million charge for the same period in 2010, including our equity share from PSB) and (iii) incremental general and administrative expenses associated with the acquisition of real estate facilities totaling $0.9 million (compared to $1.6 million for the same period in 2010).

For the three months ended June 30, 2010, FFO was further impacted by a $1.5 million impairment of real estate and other assets.
 
For the six months ended June 30, 2011, FFO was $2.88 per common share on a diluted basis as compared to $1.69 per diluted common share for the same period in 2010, representing an increase of $1.19 per diluted common share or 70.4%.
 
For the six months ended June 30, 2011, FFO was impacted by (i) a foreign currency exchange gain of $41.7 million (compared to a loss of $84.0 million for the same period in 2010), (ii) a $12.9 million net charge related to our redemptions of preferred shares, including our equity share from PSB, in applying EITF D-42 (compared to $31.9 million due to our redemptions of preferred shares, including our equity share from PSB, and our redemption of our Equity Shares, Series A for the same period in 2010) and (iii) incremental general and administrative expense associated with the acquisition of real estate facilities totaling $1.1 million (compared to $1.6 million for the same period in 2010).
 
For the six months ended June 30, 2010, FFO was further impacted by a $2.5 million impairment of real estate and other assets.
 
The following table provides a summary of the per-share impact of the items noted above:
 
 
 
 
FFO is a term defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT).  It is generally defined as net income before depreciation with respect to real estate assets and gains and losses on real estate assets.  FFO is presented because management and many analysts consider FFO to be one measure of the performance of real estate companies.  In addition, we believe that FFO is helpful to investors as an additional measure of the performance of a REIT, because net income includes the impact of depreciation, which assumes that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time, while we believe that the value of real estate fluctuates due to market conditions and in response to inflation.  FFO computations do not consider scheduled principal payments on debt, capital improvements, distributions and other obligations of the Company.  FFO is not a substitute for our cash flow or net income as a measure of our liquidity or operating performance or our ability to pay dividends.  Other REITs may not compute FFO in the same manner; accordingly, FFO may not be comparable among REITs. See the attached reconciliation of net income to funds from operations included in the selectedfinancial data attached to this press release.

Property Operations  Same Store Facilities
 
The Same Store Facilities represent those 1,931 facilities that are stabilized and owned since January 1, 2009 and therefore provide meaningful comparisons for 2009, 2010 and 2011.  The following table summarizes the historical operating results of these 1,931 facilities (121.6 million net rentable square feet) that represent approximately 94% of the aggregate net rentable square feet of our U.S. consolidated self-storage portfolio at June 30, 2011.

The following table summarizes additional selected financial data with respect to the Same Store Facilities (unaudited):
 
Shurgard Europe
 
We own a 49% equity interest in Shurgard Europe, with the remaining 51% equity interest owned by an institutional investor.  We account for our investment in Shurgard Europe under the equity method. At June 30, 2011, Shurgard Europe had an interest in 188 facilities (10 million net rentable square feet) located in seven Western European countries.
 
As previously announced, we loaned approximately $238 million to Shurgard Europe to finance its March 2, 2011 acquisition of its JV partners 80% interest in two joint ventures.  This loan bore interest at a fixed rate of 7.0% per annum and was denominated in U.S. Dollars.  On June 15, 2011, our joint venture partner in Shurgard Europe effectively purchased 51% of the loan from us for approximately $121.3 million, and the loan was effectively exchanged for an interest in Shurgard Europe.
 
Included in our funds from operations from Shurgard Europe was approximately $6.7 million and $8.7 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2011, respectively, due to the acquisition of the 80% interest and our loan to Shurgard Europe.  On a pro forma basis, assuming our joint venture partner had funded its 51% of the loan on March 2, 2011 instead of June 15, 2011, these amounts would have been $3.3 million and $4.3 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2011, respectively.
 
Our 357.6 million loan ($514.6 million at June 30, 2011) to Shurgard Europe matures on March 31, 2013, and accrues interest at 9.0% per annum.  We received principal payments on this loan totaling 16.1 million ($22.3 million) in the six months ended June 30, 2011.  The loan is denominated in Euros, and currently is not hedged for future currency exchange fluctuations; accordingly, the amount of U.S. Dollars that will be received on repayment will depend upon the currency exchange rates at the time.  The timing of future early principal payments will depend on Shurgard Europes available cash flow from operations or financing and its alternative uses.
 
Investing Activities
 
During the three months ended June 30, 2011, we acquired a facility (133,000 net rentable square feet) located in New York for total consideration of approximately $18 million.  In connection with this acquisition, we assumed approximately $10 million of debt.  In July 2011 we acquired two facilities (145,000 net rentable square feet), one in California and another in Florida, for an aggregate of approximately $23 million.

Also during the three months ended June 30, 2011, we completed the conversion of a self-storage facility that was previously used for commercial operations at a cost of approximately $5 million.  The facility contains 132,000 net rentable square feet and is located in the Los Angeles market.
 
On June 30, 2011, we acquired the Hughes Familys interests in 18 limited partnerships for an aggregate of $13.3 million.  In addition, on June 30, 2011, we entered into merger agreements to acquire the partnership interests we do not currently own in five publicly held partnerships for an aggregate of $154.3 million ($54.6 million in cash for interests held by the Hughes Family, and $99.7 million for interests held by third parties, either in cash or stock at the option of the limited partners).   Public Storage and the Hughes Family together control the vote, and affirmatively voted for the transaction, which does not require the approval of the other limited partners.  While there can be no assurance, the transaction is expected to close in August, 2011.
 
Capital Activities
 
During the three months ended June 30, 2011, we issued 15,000,000 depositary shares at $25.00 per depositary share, with each depositary share representing 1/1,000 of a 6.5% Cumulative Preferred Share of Beneficial Interest, Series Q.  The offering resulted in net proceeds of approximately $364 million.
 
During the three months ended June 30, 2011, we redeemed all of our 7.25% Cumulative Preferred Share of Beneficial Interest, Series I, for a total of $517.5 million, excluding payment of accrued dividends, and recorded an allocation of income pursuant to EITF D-42 to the holders of these shares of approximately $15.9 million.
 
On July 22, 2011, we called for redemption all outstanding depositary shares representing interest in our 7.25% Cumulative Preferred Share of Beneficial Interest, Series K for an aggregate of $424.8 million, excluding accrued dividends.   In the quarter ending September 30, 2011, we expect to record an allocation of income pursuant to EITF D-42 to the holders of these shares of approximately $13 million. 
 
On July 26, 2011, we issued 19,500,000 depositary shares at $25.00 per depositary share, with each depositary share representing 1/1,000 of a 6.35% Cumulative Preferred Share of Beneficial Interest, Series R.  The offering resulted in net proceeds of approximately $473 million.
 
Distributions Declared
 
On August 4, 2011, our Board of Trustees declared a regular common dividend of $0.95 per common share. The Board also declared dividends with respect to our various series of preferred shares. All the dividends are payable on September 29, 2011, to shareholders of record as of September 14, 2011.

Shurgard Europe Same Store Selected Operating Data
 
A facility included in Shurgard Europes Same Store Pool for the three months ended March 31, 2011 is no longer comparable to prior periods and has been removed.  The Shurgard Europe Same Store Pool presented below represents those 150 facilities that are wholly-owned and have been operated by Shurgard Europe at a stabilized occupancy level since January 1, 2009 and therefore provide meaningful comparisons for 2009, 2010 and 2011. We account for our investment in Shurgard Europe on the equity method of accounting; accordingly, our pro-rata share of the operating results for these facilities is included in equity in earnings of real estate entities on our income statement.
