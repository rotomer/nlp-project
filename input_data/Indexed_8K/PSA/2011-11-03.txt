Operating Results for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2011
 
For the three months ended September 30, 2011, net income allocable to our common shareholders was $118.0 million or $0.69 per diluted common share, compared to $182.2 million or $1.07 per diluted common share for the same period in 2010, representing a decrease of $64.2 million or $0.38 per diluted common share.  This decrease is due to (i) a foreign currency exchange loss of $28.3 million during the quarter ended September 30, 2011 as compared to a gain of $55.5 million for the same period in 2010 and (ii) $16.2 million in Emerging Issues Task Force D-42 (EITF D-42) charges related to the redemption of our preferred securities, partially offset by (iii) improved operations of our Same Store Facilities (discussed below) and our non- same store facilities and (iv) increased equity in earnings from Shurgard Europe, due primarily to Shurgard Europes acquisition of its joint venture partners interests on March 2, 2011.
 
Revenues for the Same Store Facilities (see table below) increased 5.8% or $21.4 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2011 as compared to the same period in 2010, primarily due to a 1.3% increase in average occupancy and a 4.0% increase in realized rent per occupied square foot.  Cost of operations for the Same Store Facilities remained flat in the quarter ended September 30, 2011 as compared to the same period in 2010.  Net operating income for our Same Store Facilities increased 8.6% or $21.3 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2011 as compared to the same period in 2010.
 
Operating Results for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2011
 
For the nine months ended September 30, 2011, net income allocable to our common shareholders was $397.5 million or $2.33 per diluted common share, compared to $277.8 million or $1.64 per diluted common share for the same period in 2010, representing an increase of $119.7 million or $0.69 per diluted common share.  This increase is due to (i) improved operations of our Same Store Facilities (discussed below) and our non-same store facilities, (ii) a foreign currency exchange gain of $13.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2011 as compared to a loss of $28.6 million for the same period in 2010, (iii) increased equity in earnings and interest and other income from Shurgard Europe, due primarily to Shurgard Europes acquisition of its joint venture partners interests on March 2, 2011.
 
Revenues for the Same Store Facilities (see table below) increased 4.4% or $47.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2011 as compared to the same period in 2010, primarily due to a 1.6% increase in average occupancy and a 2.4% increase in realized rent per occupied square foot.  Cost of operations for the Same Store Facilities remained flat in the nine months ended September 30, 2011 as compared to the same period in 2010.  Net operating income for our Same Store Facilities increased 6.8% or $47.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2011 as compared to the same period in 2010.
 
Funds from Operations
 
For the three months ended September 30, 2011, funds from operations (FFO) was $1.29 per common share on a diluted basis as compared to $1.69 per diluted common share for the same period in 2010, representing a decrease of $0.40 per diluted common share.
 
For the three months ended September 30, 2011, FFO was impacted by a foreign currency exchange loss of $28.3 million (compared to a gain of $55.5 million for the same period in 2010), and a $16.2 million charge related to our redemptions of preferred shares in applying EITF D-42.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2011, FFO was $4.17 per common share on a diluted basis as compared to $3.39 per diluted common share for the same period in 2010, representing an increase of $0.78 per diluted common share.
 
For the nine months ended September 30, 2011, FFO was impacted by a foreign currency exchange gain of $13.5 million (compared to a loss of $28.6 million for the same period in 2010), and a $29.1 million net charge related to our redemptions of preferred shares, including our equity share from PSB, in applying EITF D-42 (compared to $31.1 million due to our redemptions of preferred shares, including our equity share from PSB, and our redemption of our Equity Shares, Series A for the same period in 2010).
 
Our FFO for each period was also impacted by various items such as impairment charges, acquisition due diligence costs, changes in accounting estimates, gains on early redemption of debt, as well as our equity share of PSBs lease termination benefits.  The net impact of these items was a $0.01 reduction in FFO per share for the three months ended September 30, 2011 and for each of the nine months ended September 30, 2011 and 2010, and a $0.01 increase in FFO per share for the three months ended September 30, 2010.
 
The following table provides a summary of the per-share impact of the items noted above:
 
 
 
 
 
FFO is a term defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT).  It is generally defined as net income before depreciation with respect to real estate assets and gains and losses on real estate assets.  FFO is presented because management and many analysts consider FFO to be one measure of the performance of real estate companies.  In addition, we believe that FFO is helpful to investors as an additional measure of the performance of a REIT, because net income includes the impact of depreciation, which assumes that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time, while we believe that the value of real estate fluctuates due to market conditions and in response to inflation.  FFO computations do not consider scheduled principal payments on debt, capital improvements, distributions and other obligations of the Company.  FFO is not a substitute for our cash flow or net income as a measure of our liquidity or operating performance or our ability to pay dividends.  Other REITs may not compute FFO in the same manner; accordingly, FFO may not be comparable among REITs. See the attached reconciliation of net income to funds from operations included in the selectedfinancial data attached to this press release.

Property Operations  Same Store Facilities
 
The Same Store Facilities represent those 1,931 facilities that are stabilized and owned since January 1, 2009 and therefore provide meaningful comparisons for 2010 and 2011.  The following table summarizes the historical operating results of these 1,931 facilities (121.6 million net rentable square feet) that represent approximately 94% of the aggregate net rentable square feet of our U.S. consolidated self-storage portfolio at September 30, 2011.

The following table summarizes additional selected financial data with respect to the Same Store Facilities (unaudited):
 
Shurgard Europe
 
We own a 49% equity interest in Shurgard Europe, with the remaining 51% equity interest owned by an institutional investor.  We account for our investment in Shurgard Europe under the equity method. At September 30, 2011, Shurgard Europe had an interest in 188 facilities (10 million net rentable square feet) located in seven Western European countries.
 
Our 343.0 million loan ($466.3 million at September 30, 2011) to Shurgard Europe matures on March 31, 2013, and accrues interest at 9.0% per annum.  We received principal payments on this loan totaling 30.7 million ($42.7 million) in the nine months ended September 30, 2011.  The loan is denominated in Euros, and currently is not hedged for future currency exchange fluctuations; accordingly, the amount of U.S. Dollars that will be received on repayment will depend upon the currency exchange rates at the time.  The timing of future early principal payments will depend on Shurgard Europes available cash flow from operations or financing and its alternative uses.
 
Shurgard Europe expects to obtain a new three year term loan of 215 million, and will use the proceeds to repay its existing two JV loans totaling 187 million at September 30, 2011 and make an additional principal payment on our loan to Shurgard Europe.  The new loan will have a lower interest rate than the existing JV loans and will provide Shurgard Europe the flexibility to simplify its ownership structure and eliminate various costs associated with the former joint ventures.   In connection with this financing, we expect to extend the maturity date for our loan to Shurgard Europe to the first quarter of 2015.  Completion of this financing is subject to certain contingencies.
 
Investing Activities
 
During the three months ended September 30, 2011, we acquired three properties, one each in California, Florida and Maryland for approximately $27 million and having 217,000 net rentable square feet. On October 25, 2011, we acquired an additional property in California for approximately $10.5 million with 87,000 net rentable square feet.
 
On August 23, 2011, we completed the acquisition of the remaining interests we did not already own in five partnerships for $155.4 million consisting of $98.3 million in cash and approximately 478,000 Public Storage common shares with a market value on the date of closing of $57.1 million.  In addition, in late October 2011, we acquired the remaining interests we did not own in two previously consolidated partnerships for $6.3 million in cash.

Capital Activities
 
On July 26, 2011, we issued 19,500,000 depositary shares at $25.00 per depositary share, with each depositary share representing 1/1,000 of a 6.35% Cumulative Preferred Share of Beneficial Interest, Series R.  The offering resulted in net proceeds of approximately $488 million.
 
On August 22, 2011, we redeemed all outstanding depositary shares representing interest in our 7.25% Cumulative Preferred Share of Beneficial Interest, Series K for $424.8 million, excluding accrued dividends.   In the quarter ended September 30, 2011, we recorded an allocation of income pursuant to EITF D-42 to the holders of these shares of approximately $13 million. 
 
On September 30, 2011, we redeemed all outstanding depositary shares representing interest in our 7.00% Cumulative Preferred Share of Beneficial Interest, Series G for $100 million, excluding accrued dividends.   In the quarter ended September 30, 2011, we recorded an allocation of income pursuant to EITF D-42 to the holders of these shares of approximately $3 million.
 
On October 26, 2011, we called for redemption all outstanding depositary shares representing interest in our 6.95% Cumulative Preferred Share of Beneficial Interest, Series H for an aggregate of $105 million, excluding accrued dividends. The redemption will occur on November 28, 2011.  In the quarter ending December 31, 2011, we expect to record an allocation of income pursuant to EITF D-42 to the holders of these shares of approximately $3.5 million.
 
Distributions Declared
 
On November 3, 2011, our Board of Trustees declared a regular common dividend of $0.95 per common share. The Board also declared dividends with respect to our various series of preferred shares. All the dividends are payable on December 29, 2011, to shareholders of record as of December 14, 2011.
