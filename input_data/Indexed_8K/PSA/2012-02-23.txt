Operating Results for the Three Months Ended December 31, 2011
 
For the three months ended December 31, 2011, net income allocable to our common shareholders was $164.2 million or $0.96 per diluted common share, compared to $121.4 million or $0.71 per diluted common share for the same period in 2010, representing an increase of $42.8 million or $0.25 per diluted common share.  This increase is due to (i) improved property operations, (ii) increased equity in earnings from Shurgard Europe, due primarily to Shurgard Europes acquisition of its joint venture partners interests on March 2, 2011, (iii) reduced income allocations to our preferred shareholders, partially offset by (iv) an increased foreign currency exchange loss of $20.8 million during the quarter ended December 31, 2011 as compared to $13.7 million for the same period in 2010.
 
Revenues for the Same Store Facilities (see table below) increased 5.0% or $18.2 million in the quarter ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the same period in 2010, primarily due to a 1.3% increase in average occupancy and a 3.4% increase in realized annual rent per occupied square foot.  Cost of operations for the Same Store Facilities increased by 2.1% or $2.2 million in the quarter ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the same period in 2010.  Net operating income for our Same Store Facilities increased 6.1% or $16.0 million in the quarter ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the same period in 2010.
 
Operating Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2011
 
For the year ended December 31, 2011, net income allocable to our common shareholders was $561.7 million or $3.29 per diluted common share, compared to $399.2 million or $2.35 per diluted common share for the same period in 2010, representing an increase of $162.5 million or $0.94 per diluted common share.  This increase is due to (i) improved property operations, (ii) decreased foreign currency exchange loss of $7.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to $42.3 million for the same period in 2010, (iii) increased equity in earnings and interest and other income from Shurgard Europe, due primarily to Shurgard Europes acquisition of its joint venture partners interests on March 2, 2011, and (iv) reduced income allocations to our Equity Shares, Series A.
 
Revenues for the Same Store Facilities (see table below) increased 4.6% or $65.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the same period in 2010, primarily due to a 1.4% increase in average occupancy and a 2.8% increase in realized annual rent per occupied square foot.  Cost of operations for the Same Store Facilities increased by 0.4% or $1.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the same period in 2010.  Net operating income for our Same Store Facilities increased 6.6% or $64.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the same period in 2010.
 
Funds from Operations
 
For the three months ended December 31, 2011, funds from operations (FFO) was $1.50 per common share on a diluted basis as compared to $1.33 per diluted common share for the same period in 2010, representing an increase of $0.17 per diluted common share.
 
For the three months ended December 31, 2011, FFO was impacted by a foreign currency exchange loss of $20.8 million (compared to a loss of $13.7 million for the same period in 2010) and a $3.5 million charge related to our redemptions of preferred shares in applying EITF D-42 (compared to similar charges totaling $4.7 million for the same period in 2010 for redemptions of our preferred units, preferred shares and our pro rata share from PS Business Parks, Inc. (PSB)).

For the year ended December 31, 2011, FFO was $5.67 per common share on a diluted basis as compared to $4.72 per diluted common share for the same period in 2010, representing an increase of $0.95 per diluted common share.
 
For the year ended December 31, 2011, FFO was impacted by a foreign currency exchange loss of $7.3 million (compared to a $42.3 million loss for the same period in 2010) and a $32.6 million net charge related to our redemptions of equity securities, including our equity share from PSB, in applying EITF D-42 (compared to $35.8 million for the same period in 2010).
 
Our FFO for each period was also impacted by various items such as impairment charges, acquisition due diligence costs, changes in accounting estimates, gains and losses on early redemption of debt (including our equity share from PSB and Shurgard Europe), as well as our equity share of PSBs lease termination fees received from tenants.  The net impact of these items reduced FFO by $0.02 and $0.01 per diluted share for the three months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and reduced FFO by $0.03 and $0.04 per diluted share for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
 
The following table provides a summary of the per-share impact of the items noted above (unaudited):
 
 
 
 
FFO is a term defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT).  It is generally defined as net income before depreciation with respect to real estate assets and gains and losses on real estate assets.  FFO is presented because management and many analysts consider FFO to be one measure of the performance of real estate companies.  In addition, we believe that FFO is helpful to investors as an additional measure of the performance of a REIT, because net income includes the impact of depreciation, which assumes that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time, while we believe that the value of real estate fluctuates due to market conditions and in response to inflation.  FFO computations do not consider scheduled principal payments on debt, capital improvements, distributions and other obligations of the Company.  FFO is not a substitute for our cash flow or net income as a measure of our liquidity or operating performance or our ability to pay dividends.  Other REITs may not compute FFO in the same manner; accordingly, FFO may not be comparable among REITs. See the attached reconciliation of net income to funds from operations included in the selectedfinancial data attached to this press release.

Property Operations  Same Store Facilities
 
The Same Store Facilities represent those 1,931 facilities that are stabilized and owned since January 1, 2009 and therefore provide meaningful comparisons for 2010 and 2011.  The following table summarizes the historical operating results of these 1,931 facilities (121.6 million net rentable square feet) that represent approximately 94% of the aggregate net rentable square feet of our U.S. consolidated self-storage portfolio at December 31, 2011.

The following table summarizes additional selected financial data with respect to the Same Store Facilities (unaudited):
 
 
Shurgard Europe
 
We own a 49% equity interest in Shurgard Europe, with the remaining 51% equity interest owned by an institutional investor.  We account for our investment in Shurgard Europe under the equity method. At December 31, 2011, Shurgard Europe had an interest in 188 facilities (10 million net rentable square feet) located in seven Western European countries.
 
In the fourth quarter of 2011, Shurgard Europe used the proceeds from a new 215 million term loan with Wells Fargo (the Wells Fargo Loan) to repay two existing loans totaling 183 million and repay a portion, 32 million, on our 9.0% loan to Shurgard Europe.  The Wells Fargo Loan, which matures in November 2014, has a lower interest rate than the repaid loans, and allows Shurgard Europe to simplify its ownership structure and eliminate various costs associated with the former joint ventures.   Shurgard Europe is obligated to utilize most of its available cash flow to make principal payments on the Wells Fargo Loan.
 
In connection with the Wells Fargo financing, we extended the maturity date for our 9.0% loan to Shurgard Europe to February 15, 2015, which has a balance of 311.0 million ($402.7 million) at December 31, 2011.  The loan is denominated in Euros and currently is not hedged for future currency exchange fluctuations; accordingly, the amount of U.S. Dollars that will be received on repayment will depend upon the currency exchange rates at the time.  Future prepayments on our loan will be dependent upon Shurgard Europes managements evaluation of uses for the cash flow retained from operations after making principal payments on the Wells Fargo Loan.
 
Investing Activities
 
During the three months ended December 31, 2011, we acquired two properties, one in California and another in Texas, for approximately $16.0 million that added 155,000 net rentable square feet to our portfolio.
 
In addition, during October 2011, we acquired the remaining interests we did not own in two consolidated partnerships for $6.3 million in cash.

We have also entered into a contract to acquire a portfolio of six self-storage properties, located in California, Florida (two), Massachusetts, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, for an aggregate purchase price of $42 million in cash.  The pending acquisition is subject to various conditions and contingencies and there can be no assurance that it will be completed.
 
Capital Activities
 
On November 28, 2011, we redeemed all of our outstanding 6.95% Series H Preferred Shares for an aggregate of $105 million, excluding accrued dividends.
 
On January 12, 2012, we issued 18,400,000 depositary shares of our 5.90% Series S Preferred Shares for $460 million in gross proceeds.
 
On February 9, 2012 and February 21, 2012, we redeemed all of our 6.75% Series L Preferred Shares and our 6.75% Series E Preferred Shares, respectively, for an aggregate of approximately $347.9 million, excluding accrued dividends.  In addition, we called for redemption our 6.85% Series Y Preferred Shares, which will be redeemed on March 19, 2012 for approximately $8.8 million, excluding accrued dividends.  PSB has announced the redemption of various series of preferred shares in the quarter ending March 31, 2012.  In connection with these redemptions, including our pro rata share of PSBs amounts, we expect to incur approximately $13 million of EITF D-42 charges during the quarter ending March 31, 2012.
 
Distributions Declared
 
On February 23, 2012, our Board of Trustees declared a regular common dividend of $1.10 per common share which is an increase of $0.15 per share, or 16%, over the previous quarters distribution. The Board also declared dividends with respect to our various series of preferred shares. All the dividends are payable on March 29, 2012, to shareholders of record as of March 14, 2012.
