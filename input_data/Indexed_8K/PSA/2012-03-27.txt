Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
Item 2.03 Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation Under an Off-Balance Entry Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant
On March 21, 2012, Public Storage (the Company) entered into a five year Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement) with the financial institutions party to the Credit Agreement and their permitted assignees, and each of Wells Fargo Securities, LLC and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, as the Joint Lead Arrangers and Joint Bookrunners, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association as Agent and Bank of America, N.A., as Syndication Agent. The obligations of the Company under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by certain subsidiaries of the Company on the terms set forth in the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement matures on March 21, 2017 and replaces in its entirety the revolving credit facility provided for under the Companys Credit Agreement dated March 27, 2007 (the 2007 Credit Agreement).
Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Company has the ability to borrow up to $300 million under a revolving credit facility. The facility includes borrowing capacity for letters of credit and for borrowings on same-day notice. At any time during the term of the Credit Agreement, the Company may request an increase in the facility of an additional $300 million, subject to certain conditions.
Loans under the Credit Agreement bear interest at variable rates determined at the Companys option at the time of any borrowing.  Rates may be established based on an absolute rate determined by competitive bids or, alternatively, based on LIBOR or, under some circumstances, the Federal funds rate plus, in either case, an applicable margin determined on the basis of the Company's senior debt credit ratings as published by Standard & Poors Rating Services or Moodys Investor Service, Inc.
The Credit Agreement requires that the Company comply on a quarterly basis with certain financial covenants, including a maximum leverage ratio test and minimum interest coverage ratio test and other customary affirmative, negative and financial covenants. These also include furnishing the lenders periodic financial information about the Company and copies of reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission; paying and discharging material obligations and liabilities; maintenance of corporate existence and REIT status; limitations on the ability to consolidate, merge or sell, lease or otherwise transfer all or substantially all assets; and limitations on transactions with affiliates.
The Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default (subject to certain grace periods), including nonpayment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts when due; material inaccuracies of representations or warranties; defaults in payments of other material indebtedness, the occurrence of certain bankruptcy events; material judgments; certain ERISA events; and certain changes of control. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, any outstanding loans may be accelerated and/or lender commitments terminated, except that upon the occurrence of certain insolvency or bankruptcy related events of default, all amounts payable under the Credit Agreement will automatically become immediately due and payable, and the lenders commitments will automatically terminate.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Borrowings under the Credit Agreement may be used, among other things, for property development costs, capital expenditures, repayment of indebtedness, general working capital needs and other general corporate purposes, including payment of dividends, acquisitions, and repurchases and redemptions of securities otherwise permitted under the Credit Agreement. As of March 27, 2012, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement.
In the ordinary course of their respective businesses, many of the lenders or their affiliates have in the past performed, and may in the future from time to time perform, investment banking, advisory, lending and/or commercial banking or other financial services for the Company and its subsidiaries for which they received, or may receive, customary fees and reimbursement of expenses.
The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Credit Agreement, filed as Exhibit 10.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.

Each such Lenders obligation to make such payments to the Agent under this subsection, and the Agents right to receive the same, shall be absolute, irrevocable and unconditional and shall not be affected in any way by any circumstance whatsoever, including without limitation, (i) the failure of any other Lender to make its payment under this subsection, (ii) the financial condition of the Borrower or any other Loan Party, (iii) the existence of any Default or Event of Default, including any Event of Default described in Section 11.1.(e) or 11.1.(f) or (iv) the termination of the Commitments.

Payment Obligation of Lenders
(k)           .  Promptly following any change in Letters of Credit outstanding, the Agent shall deliver to each Lender and the Borrower a notice describing the aggregate amount of all Letters of Credit outstanding at such time.  Upon the request of any Lender from time to time, the Agent shall deliver any other information reasonably requested by such Lender with respect to each Letter of Credit then outstanding.  Other than as set forth in this subsection, the Agent shall have no duty to notify the Lenders regarding the issuance or other matters regarding Letters of Credit issued hereunder.  The failure of the Agent to perform its requirements under this subsection shall not relieve any Lender from its obligations under Section 2.3.(j).
Information to Lenders

from and after the Effective Date, be deemed to be a Letter of Credit issued under this Agreement and shall be subject to and governed by the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.
 
(a)           .  Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, including without limitation, Section 2.18., if necessary to meet the various funding deadlines of the Borrower, the Swingline Lender agrees to make Swingline Loans in Dollars to the Borrower, during the period from the Effective Date to but excluding the Swingline Termination Date, in an aggregate principal amount at any one time outstanding up to, but not exceeding, the amount of the Swingline Commitment.  If at any time the aggregate principal amount of the Swingline Loans outstanding at such time exceeds the Swingline Commitment in effect at such time, the Borrower shall immediately pay the Agent for the account of the Swingline Lender the amount of such excess.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Borrower may borrow, repay and reborrow Swingline Loans hereunder.
Swingline Loans
(b)           .  The Borrower shall give the Agent and the Swingline Lender notice pursuant to a Notice of Swingline Borrowing delivered to the Swingline Lender no later than 1:00 p.m. on the proposed date of such borrowing.  Any such telephonic notice shall include all information to be specified in a written Notice of Swingline Borrowing.  Not later than 3:00 p.m. on the date of the requested Swingline Loan and subject to satisfaction of the applicable conditions set forth in Article VI. for such borrowing, the Swingline Lender will make the proceeds of such Swingline Loan available to the Borrower in Dollars, in immediately available funds, by depositing them in the applicable Designated Account.
Procedure for Borrowing Swingline Loans
(c)           .  Swingline Loans shall bear interest at the Base Rate or such other rates as the Borrower and the Swingline Lender may agree from time to time in writing.  Interest payable on Swingline Loans is solely for the account of the Swingline Lender.  All accrued and unpaid interest on Swingline Loans shall be payable on the dates and in the manner provided in Section 2.5. with respect to interest on Base Rate Loans (except as the Swingline Lender and the Borrower may otherwise agree in writing in connection with any particular Swingline Loan).
Interest
(d)           .  Each Swingline Loan shall be in the minimum amount of $500,000, or such other minimum amounts agreed to by the Swingline Lender and the Borrower.  Any voluntary prepayment of a Swingline Loan must be in the minimum amount of $100,000 or, if less, the aggregate principal amount of all outstanding Swingline Loans (or such other minimum amounts upon which the Swingline Lender and the Borrower may agree) and in connection with any such prepayment, the Borrower must give the Swingline Lender prior written notice thereof no later than 10:00 a.m. on the day prior to the date of such prepayment.  The Swingline Loans shall, in addition to this Agreement, be evidenced by the Swingline Notes.
Swingline Loan Amounts, Etc
(e)           .  The Borrower agrees to repay each Swingline Loan borrowed by it within one Business Day of demand therefor by the Swingline Lender and in any event, within 5 Business Days after the date such Swingline Loan was made.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Borrower shall repay the entire outstanding
Repayment and Participations of Swingline Loans
 
34
 
principal amount of, and all accrued but unpaid interest on, the Swingline Loans borrowed by it on the Swingline Termination Date (or such earlier date as the Swingline Lender and the Borrower may agree in writing).  In lieu of demanding repayment of any outstanding Swingline Loan from the Borrower, the Swingline Lender may, on behalf of the Borrower (which hereby irrevocably directs the Swingline Lender to act on its behalf), request a borrowing of Revolving Loans (which shall be Base Rate Loans) from the Lenders in an amount equal to the principal balance of such Swingline Loan.  The amount limitations contained in Section 3.5.(a) shall not apply to any borrowing of Base Rate Loans made pursuant to this subsection.  The Swingline Lender shall give notice to the Agent of any such borrowing of Base Rate Loans not later than 10:00 a.m. at least one Business Day prior to the proposed date of such borrowing.  Each Lender will make available to the Agent at the Principal Office for the account of Swingline Lender, in immediately available funds, the proceeds of the Base Rate Loan to be made by such Lender.  The Agent shall pay the proceeds of such Base Rate Loans to the Swingline Lender, which shall apply such proceeds to repay such Swingline Loan.  If the Lenders are prohibited from making Loans required to be made under this subsection for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation, the occurrence of any of the Defaults or Events of Default described in Sections 11.1.(e) or 11.1.(f), each Lender shall purchase from the Swingline Lender, without recourse or warranty, an undivided interest and participation to the extent of such Lenders Commitment Percentage of such Swingline Loan, by directly purchasing a participation in such Swingline Loan in such amount and paying the proceeds thereof to the Agent for the account of the Swingline Lender in Dollars and in immediately available funds.  A Lenders obligation to purchase such a participation in a Swingline Loan shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including without limitation, (i) any claim of setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender or any other Person may have or claim against the Agent, the Swingline Lender or any other Person whatsoever, (ii) the occurrence or continuation of a Default or Event of Default (including without limitation, any of the Defaults or Events of Default described in Sections 11.1.(e) or 11.1.(f)) or the termination of the Commitments of any Lender, (iii) the existence (or alleged existence) of an event of condition which has had or could have a Material Adverse Effect, (iv) any breach of any Loan Document by the Agent, any Lender, the Borrower or any other Loan Party or (v) any other circumstance, happening or event whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing.  If such amount is not in fact made available to the Swingline Lender by any Lender, the Swingline Lender shall be entitled to recover such amount on demand from such Lender, together with accrued interest thereon for each day from the date of demand thereof, at the Federal Funds Rate.  If such Lender does not pay such amount forthwith upon the Swingline Lenders demand therefor, and until such time as such Lender makes the required payment, the Swingline Lender shall be deemed to continue to have outstanding Swingline Loans in the amount of such unpaid participation obligation for all purposes of the Loan Documents (other than those provisions requiring the other Lenders to purchase a participation therein).  Further, such Lender shall be deemed to have assigned any and all payments made of principal and interest on its Loans, and any other amounts due to it hereunder, to the Swingline Lender to fund Swingline Loans in the amount of the participation in Swingline Loans that such Lender failed to purchase pursuant to this Section until such amount has been purchased (as a result of such assignment or otherwise).
 
35
 
 
(a)           .  The Borrower promises to pay to the Agent for the account of each Lender interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Loan made by such Lender for the period from and including the date of the making of such Loan to but excluding the date such Loan shall be paid in full, at the following per annum rates:
Rates
(i)           during such periods as such Loan is a Base Rate Loan, at the Base Rate (as in effect from time to time), plus the Applicable Margin for Base Rate Loans;
(ii)           during such periods as such Loan is a LIBOR Loan, at LIBOR for such Loan for the Interest Period therefor, plus the Applicable Margin for LIBOR Loans;
(iii)           if such Loan is an Absolute Rate Loan, at the Absolute Rate for such Loan for the Interest Period therefor quoted by the Lender making such Loan in accordance with Section 2.2.; and
(iv)           if such Loan is a LIBOR Margin Loan, at LIBOR for such Loan for the Interest Period therefor plus the LIBOR Margin quoted by the Lender making such Loan in accordance with Section 2.2.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, during the continuance of an Event of Default, the Borrower shall pay to the Agent for the account of each Lender interest at the Post-Default Rate on the outstanding principal amount of any Loan made by such Lender, on all Reimbursement Obligations and on any other amount payable by the Borrower hereunder or under the Notes held by such Lender to or for the account of such Lender (including without limitation, accrued but unpaid interest to the extent permitted under Applicable Law).
(b)           . All accrued and unpaid interest on the outstanding principal amount of each Loan shall be payable (i) in the case of Base Rate Loans, monthly in arrears on the first day of each month, (ii) in the case of a LIBOR Loan or a Bid Rate Loan, on the last day of each Interest Period therefor and, if such Interest Period is longer than three months, at three-month intervals following the first day of such Interest Period, and (iii) for all Loans, (A) on the Termination Date and (B) on any date on which the principal balance of such Loan is due and payable in full (whether at maturity, due to acceleration or otherwise).  Interest payable at the Post-Default Rate shall be payable from time to time on demand.  All determinations by the Agent of an interest rate hereunder shall be conclusive and binding on the Lenders and the Borrower for all purposes, absent manifest error.
Payment of Interest
 
There may be no more than 8 different Interest Periods with respect to LIBOR Loans outstanding at the same time and no more than 5 different Interest Periods with respect to Bid Rate Loans outstanding at the same time.
 
36
 
 
(a)           .  The Borrower shall repay the aggregate outstanding principal balance of all Revolving Loans in full on the Termination Date.
Revolving Loans
(b)           .  The Borrower shall repay the entire outstanding principal amount of, and all accrued interest on, each Bid Rate Loan on the last day of the Interest Period of such Bid Rate Loan.
Bid Rate Loans
Section 2.8.  Prepayments.
 
(a)           .  Subject to Section 5.4., the Borrower may prepay any Revolving Loan at any time without premium or penalty.  The Borrower shall give the Agent at least one Business Days prior written notice of the prepayment of any Revolving Loan.  A Bid Rate Loan may only be prepaid with the prior written consent of the Lender holding such Bid Rate Loan.
Optional
(b)           .
Mandatory
(i)           .  If at any time the aggregate principal amount of all outstanding Loans, together with the aggregate amount of all Letter of Credit Liabilities, exceeds the aggregate amount of the Commitments, the Borrower shall, within three calendar days after notice of the occurrence of such excess, pay to the Agent for the account of the Lenders the amount of such excess.  All payments under this subsection (i) shall be applied to pay all amounts of excess principal outstanding on the applicable Revolving Loans and any applicable Reimbursement Obligations in accordance with Section 3.2., and the remainder, if any, shall be deposited into the Letter of Credit Collateral Account for application to any Reimbursement Obligations as and when due.
Commitment Overadvance
(ii)           .  If at any time the aggregate principal amount of all outstanding Bid Rate Loans exceeds one-half of the aggregate amount of all Commitments at such time, then the Borrower shall, within three calendar days after notice of the occurrence of such excess, pay to the Agent for the accounts of the applicable Lenders the amount of such excess.  All payments under this subsection (ii) shall be applied in accordance with Section 3.2.(f).
Bid Rate Facility Overadvance
 
If the Borrower fails to pay any interest payable under this Agreement on or prior to the expiration of 10 days after such interest first becomes due and payable, the Borrower shall pay to the Agent for the benefit of the Lenders a late charge equal to four percent (4.0%) of the amount of such unpaid interest payment. The Borrower acknowledges and agrees that an accurate determination of the Lenders damages as a result of the Borrowers failure to pay interest as and when due hereunder is not reasonably practicable, and the late charge provided for herein is a reasonable estimate of the amount of additional cost and the value of the loss of use of funds that will be suffered by the Lenders if an interest payment is not paid when due.
 
37
 
 
So long as no Default or Event of Default exists, the Borrower may on any Business Day, with respect to any LIBOR Loan, elect to maintain such LIBOR Loan or any portion thereof as a LIBOR Loan by selecting a new Interest Period for such LIBOR Loan.  Each new Interest Period selected under this Section shall commence on the last day of the immediately preceding Interest Period.  Each selection of a new Interest Period shall be made by the Borrower giving to the Agent a Notice of Continuation not later than 10:00 a.m. on the third Business Day prior to the date of any such Continuation of LIBOR Loans.  Such notice by the Borrower of a Continuation shall be by telecopy, electronic mail or other form of communication in the form of a Notice of Continuation, specifying (a) the proposed date of such Continuation, (b) the LIBOR Loan and portion thereof subject to such Continuation and (c) the duration of the selected Interest Period, all of which shall be specified in such manner as is necessary to comply with all limitations on Loans outstanding hereunder.  Each Notice of Continuation shall be irrevocable by and binding on the Borrower once given.  Promptly after receipt of a Notice of Continuation, the Agent shall notify each Lender by telecopy, electronic mail or other similar form of transmission of the proposed Continuation.  If the Borrower shall fail to select in a timely manner a new Interest Period for any LIBOR Loan in accordance with this Section, such Loan will automatically, on the last day of the current Interest Period therefor, Convert into a Base Rate Loan notwithstanding the failure of the Borrower to comply with Section 2.11.
 
So long as no Default or Event of Default exists, the Borrower may on any Business Day, upon the Borrowers giving of a Notice of Conversion to the Agent, Convert all or a portion of a Revolving Loan of one Type into a Revolving Loan of another Type.  Any Conversion of a LIBOR Loan into a Base Rate Loan shall be made on, and only on, the last day of an Interest Period for such LIBOR Loan and, upon Conversion of a Base Rate Loan into a LIBOR Loan, the Borrower shall pay accrued interest to the date of Conversion on the principal amount so Converted.  Each such Notice of Conversion shall be given not later than 10:00 a.m. (i) one Business Day prior to the date of any proposed Conversion into Base Rate Loans, and (ii) three Business Days prior to the date of any proposed Conversion into LIBOR Loans.  Promptly after receipt of a Notice of Conversion, the Agent shall notify each Lender by telecopy, electronic mail or other similar form of transmission of the proposed Conversion.  Subject to the restrictions specified above, each Notice of Conversion shall be by telecopy in the form of a Notice of Conversion specifying (a) the requested date of such Conversion, (b) the Type of Revolving Loan to be Converted, (c) the portion of such Type of Loan to be Converted, (d) the Type of Revolving Loan such Loan is to be Converted into, and (e) if such Conversion is into a LIBOR Loan, the requested duration of the Interest Period of such Loan.  Each Notice of Conversion shall be irrevocable by and binding on the Borrower once given.
 
The Revolving Loans made by each Lender shall, in addition to this Agreement, also be evidenced by a promissory note of the Borrower substantially in the form of Exhibit J (each a Revolving Note), payable to the order of such Lender and duly completed.  The Bid Rate
 
38
 
Loans made by a Lender to the Borrower shall, in addition to this Agreement, also be evidenced by a Bid Rate Note payable to the order of such Lender.
 
The Borrower shall have the right to terminate or reduce the aggregate unused amount of the Commitments (for which purpose use of the Commitments shall be deemed to include the aggregate principal amount of all outstanding Swingline Loans and Bid Rate Loans and the aggregate amount of Letter of Credit Liabilities) at any time and from time to time without penalty or premium upon not less than 5 Business Days prior written notice to the Agent of each such termination or reduction, which notice shall specify the effective date thereof and the amount of any such reduction and shall be irrevocable once given and effective only upon receipt by the Agent; , , that if the Borrower seeks to reduce the aggregate amount of the Commitments below $75,000,000, then, unless the Agent and all Lenders have otherwise previously agreed in writing, the Commitments shall be reduced to zero and, except as otherwise provided herein, the provisions of this Agreement shall terminate.  The Agent will promptly transmit such notice to each Lender.  The Commitments, once terminated or reduced may not be increased or reinstated.  Any reduction in the aggregate amount of the Commitments shall result in a proportionate reduction (rounded to the next lowest integral multiple of $100,000) in each of the L/C Commitment Amount and the Swingline Commitment.
provided
however
 
 
 
If on the date the Commitments are terminated (whether voluntarily, by reason of the occurrence of an Event of Default or otherwise), there are any Letters of Credit outstanding hereunder, the Borrower shall, on such date, pay to the Agent an amount of money equal to the Stated Amount of such Letter(s) of Credit and in the applicable Designated Currencies of such Letters of Credit for deposit into the Letter of Credit Collateral Account.  If a drawing pursuant to any such Letter of Credit occurs on or prior to the expiration date of such Letter of Credit, the Borrower authorizes the Agent to use the monies deposited in the Letter of Credit Collateral Account to make payment to the beneficiary with respect to such drawing or the payee with respect to such presentment.  If no drawing occurs on or prior to the expiration date of such Letter of Credit, the Agent shall pay to the Borrower (or to whomever else may be legally entitled thereto) the monies deposited in the Letter of Credit Collateral Account with respect to such outstanding Letter of Credit on or before the date 30 days after the expiration date of such Letter of Credit.
 
At any time and from time to time beginning on the Effective Date to but excluding the Termination Date, the Borrower shall have the right to request an increase in the aggregate amount of the Commitments by providing written notice to the Agent, which notice shall be
 
39
 
irrevocable once given; , , that after giving effect to such increase the aggregate amount of the Commitments shall not exceed $600,000,000. The Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of any such request.  No Lender shall be obligated in any way whatsoever to increase its Commitment.  If a new Lender becomes a party to this Agreement, or if any existing Lender agrees to increase its Commitment, such Lender shall on the date it becomes a Lender hereunder (or in the case of an existing Lender, increases its Commitment) (and as a condition thereto) purchase from the other Lenders its Commitment Percentage (determined with respect to the Lenders relative Commitments and after giving effect to the increase of Commitments) of any outstanding Revolving Loans, by making available to the Agent for the account of such other Lenders, in immediately available funds, an amount equal to the sum of (A) the portion of the outstanding principal amount of such Revolving Loans to be purchased by such Lender plus (B) interest accrued and unpaid to and as of such date on such portion of the outstanding principal amount of such Loans.  The Borrower shall pay to the Lenders amounts payable, if any, to such Lenders under Section 5.4. as a result of the prepayment of any such Loans.  An increase of the aggregate amount of the Commitments may not be effected under this Section if either (x) a Default or Event of Default shall be in existence on the effective date of such increase or (y) any representation or warranty made or deemed made by the Borrower or any other Loan Party in any Loan Document to which such Loan Party is a party is not (or would not be) true or correct on the effective date of such increase except to the extent that such representations and warranties expressly relate solely to an earlier date (in which case such representations and warranties shall have been true and accurate on and as of such earlier date) and except for changes in factual circumstances specifically and expressly permitted hereunder.  In connection with an increase in the aggregate amount of the Commitments pursuant to this Section (a) any Lender becoming a party hereto shall execute such documents and agreements as the Agent may reasonably request, and (b) the Borrower shall make appropriate arrangements so that each new Lender, and any existing Lender increasing its Commitment, receives a new or replacement Note, as appropriate, in the amount of such Lenders Commitment at the time of the effectiveness of the increase in the aggregate amount of Commitments.
provided
however
 
Notwithstanding any other term of this Agreement, no Lender shall be required to make any Loan, no Lender shall make any Bid Rate Loan, and the Agent shall not be required to issue any Letter of Credit if, immediately after the making of such Loan or issuance of such Letter of Credit (a) the aggregate principal amount of all outstanding Loans, together with the aggregate amount of all Letter of Credit Liabilities, would exceed the aggregate amount of the Commitments, or (b) the aggregate principal amount of all outstanding Bid Rate Loans would exceed one-half of the aggregate amount of the Commitments at such time.
 
 
All payments to be made by the Borrower shall be made without condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff.  Except to the extent otherwise provided herein, all payments of principal, interest and other amounts to be made by the Borrower under this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be made in Dollars, in immediately available
 
40
 
funds.  The Borrower shall make each payment of any amount due under this Agreement not later than 11:00 a.m. on the date on which such payment shall become due (each such payment made after such time on such due date to be deemed to have been made on the next succeeding Business Day).  The Borrower shall, at the time of making each payment under this Agreement or any Note, specify to the Agent the amounts payable by the Borrower hereunder to which such payment is to be applied.  Each payment received by the Agent for the account of a Lender under this Agreement or any Note of such Lender shall be paid to such Lender, by wire transfer of immediately available funds in accordance with the wiring instructions provided by such Lender to the Agent from time to time, for the account of such Lender at the applicable Lending Office of such Lender.  If the Agent fails to pay such amount to a Lender within one Business Day of receipt thereof by the Agent, the Agent shall pay interest on such amount until paid at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect.  If the due date of any payment under this Agreement or any other Loan Document would otherwise fall on a day which is not a Business Day such date shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day and interest shall be payable for the period of such extension.
Section 3.2.  Pro Rata Treatment.
 
Except to the extent otherwise provided herein: (a) each borrowing from the Lenders under Section 2.1.(a) shall be made from the Lenders, each payment of the Fees under Section 3.6.(a) and the first sentence of Section 3.6.(b) shall be made for the account of the Lenders, and each termination or reduction of the amount of the Commitments under Section 2.13. or otherwise pursuant to this Agreement shall be applied to the respective Commitments of the Lenders, pro rata according to the amounts of their respective Commitments; (b) each payment or prepayment of principal of Revolving Loans by the Borrower shall be made for the account of the Lenders pro rata in accordance with the respective unpaid principal amounts of the Revolving Loans held by them, provided that, subject to Section  3.10.,if immediately prior to giving effect to any such payment in respect of any Revolving Loans the outstanding principal amount of the Revolving Loans shall not be held by the Lenders pro rata in accordance with their respective Commitments in effect at the time such Loans were made, then such payment shall be applied to the Revolving Loans in such manner as shall result, as nearly as is practicable, in the outstanding principal amount of the Revolving Loans being held by the Lenders pro rata in accordance with their respective Commitments; (c) each payment of interest on Revolving Loans by the Borrower shall be made for the account of the Lenders pro rata in accordance with the amounts of interest on such Loans then due and payable to the respective Lenders; (d) the making, Conversion and Continuation of Revolving Loans of a particular Type (other than Conversions provided for by Section 5.5.) shall be made pro rata among the Lenders according to the amounts of their respective Commitments (in the case of making of Loans) or their respective Revolving Loans (in the case of Conversions and Continuations of Revolving Loans) and the then current Interest Period for each Lenders portion of each Loan of such Type shall be coterminous; (e) the Lenders participation in, and payment obligations in respect of, Letters of Credit under Section 2.3. and Swingline Loans under Section 2.4., shall be pro rata in accordance with their respective Commitments.  All payments of principal, interest, fees and other amounts in respect of the Swingline Loans shall be for the account of the Swingline Lender only (except to the extent any Lender shall have acquired a participating interest in any such Swingline Loan pursuant to Section 2.4.(e)); and (f) each
 
41
 
prepayment of principal of Bid Rate Loans by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.8.(b)(ii) shall be made for account of the Lenders then owed Bid Rate Loans pro rata in accordance with the respective unpaid principal amounts of the Bid Rate Loans then owing to each such Lender.
 
If a Lender shall obtain payment of any principal of, or interest on, any Loan made by it to the Borrower under this Agreement, or shall obtain payment on any other Obligation owing by the Borrower or a Loan Party through the exercise of any right of set-off, bankers lien or counterclaim or similar right or otherwise or through voluntary prepayments directly to a Lender or other payments made by the Borrower or any other Loan Party to a Lender not in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and such payment should be distributed to the Lenders pro rata in accordance with Section 3.2. or Section 11.5., as applicable, such Lender shall promptly purchase from the other Lenders participations in (or, if and to the extent specified by such Lender, direct interests in) the Loans made by the other Lenders or other Obligations owed to such other Lenders in such amounts, pay such amounts to the other Lenders and make such other adjustments from time to time as shall be equitable, so that all the Lenders shall share the benefit of such payment (net of any reasonable expenses which may be incurred by such Lender in obtaining or preserving such benefit) pro rata in accordance with Section 3.2. or Section 11.5.  To such end, all the Lenders shall make appropriate adjustments among themselves (by the resale of participations sold or otherwise) if such payment is rescinded or must otherwise be restored.  The Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation (or direct interest) in the Loans or other Obligations owed to such other Lenders may exercise all rights of set-off, bankers lien, counterclaim or similar rights with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct holder of Loans in the amount of such participation.  Nothing contained herein shall require any Lender to exercise any such right or shall affect the right of any Lender to exercise, and retain the benefits of exercising, any such right with respect to any other indebtedness or obligation of the Borrower.
 
No Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make a Loan or to perform any other obligation to be made or performed by such other Lender hereunder, and the failure of any Lender to make a Loan or to perform any other obligation to be made or performed by it hereunder shall not relieve the obligation of any other Lender to make any Loan or to perform any other obligation to be made or performed by such other Lender.

The Agent shall be entitled to deduct from such Letter of Credit fees, and retain for its own account, a fronting fee in respect of each Letter of Credit at the rate equal to one-eighth of one percent (0.125%) per annum on the daily average Stated Amount of such Letter of Credit.  The fees provided for in the immediately preceding two sentences shall be nonrefundable and payable in arrears (i) quarterly on the last day of March, June, September and December, (ii) on the Termination Date, (iii) on the date the Commitments are terminated or reduced to zero and (iv) thereafter from time to time on demand of the Agent.

Other Fees
 
Unless otherwise expressly set forth herein, any accrued interest on any Loan, any Fees or other Obligations due hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and the actual number of days elapsed.
 
In no event shall the amount of interest due or payable on the Loans or other Obligations exceed the maximum rate of interest allowed by Applicable Law and, if any such payment is paid by the Borrower or received by any Lender, then such excess sum shall be credited as a payment of principal, unless the Borrower shall notify the respective Lender in writing that the Borrower elects to have such excess sum returned to it forthwith.  It is the express intent of the
 
43
 
parties hereto that the Borrower not pay and the Lenders not receive, directly or indirectly, in any manner whatsoever, interest in excess of that which may be lawfully paid by the Borrower under Applicable Law.  The parties hereto hereby agree and stipulate that the only charge imposed upon the Borrower for the use of money in connection with this Agreement is and shall be the interest specifically described in subsections (i) through (iv) of Section 2.5.(a) and in Section 2.4.(c).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties hereto further agree and stipulate that all agency fees, syndication fees, facility fees, letter of credit fees, underwriting fees, default charges, late charges, funding or breakage charges, increased cost charges, attorneys fees and reimbursement for costs and expenses paid by the Agent or any Lender to third parties or for damages incurred by the Agent or any Lender, are charges made to compensate the Agent or any such Lender for underwriting or administrative services and costs or losses performed or incurred, and to be performed or incurred, by the Agent and the Lenders in connection with this Agreement and shall under no circumstances be deemed to be charges for the use of money.  All charges other than charges for the use of money shall be fully earned and nonrefundable when due.
 
The Agent will account to the Borrower monthly with a statement of Loans, Letters of Credit, accrued interest and Fees, charges and payments made pursuant to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and such account rendered by the Agent shall be deemed conclusive upon the Borrower absent manifest error.  The Agent will account to the Borrower on changes in Letters of Credit in accordance with Section 2.3.(k).  The failure of the Agent to deliver such a statement of accounts shall not relieve or discharge the Borrower from any of its obligations hereunder.
 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then, until such time as such Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law:
(a)           .  Such Defaulting Lenders right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent with respect to this Agreement shall be restricted as set forth in the definition of Requisite Lenders.

Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender or to post Cash Collateral pursuant to this subsection shall be deemed paid to and redirected by such Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto.

(ii)           Each Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive the Fee payable under Section 3.6.(b) for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender only to the extent allocable to its Commitment Percentage of the stated amount of Letters of Credit for which it has provided Cash Collateral pursuant to the immediately following subsection (e).
(iii)           With respect to any Fee not required to be paid to any Defaulting Lender pursuant to the immediately preceding clauses (i) or (ii), the Borrower shall (x) pay to each non-Defaulting Lender that portion of any such Fee otherwise payable to such Defaulting Lender with respect to such Defaulting Lenders participation in Letter of

No reallocation hereunder shall constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder against a Defaulting Lender arising from that Lender having become a Defaulting Lender, including any claim of a non-Defaulting Lender as a result of such non-Defaulting Lenders increased exposure following such reallocation.

No party hereto shall have any obligation whatsoever to initiate any such replacement or to assist in finding an Eligible Assignee.  In addition, any Lender who is not a Defaulting Lender may, but shall not be obligated, in its sole discretion, to acquire the face amount of all or a portion of such Defaulting Lenders Commitment and Loans via an assignment subject to and in accordance with the provisions of Section 13.5.(d).  In connection with any such assignment, such Defaulting Lender shall promptly execute all documents reasonably requested to effect such assignment, including an appropriate Assignment and Acceptance Agreement and, notwithstanding Section 13.5.(b), shall pay to the Agent an assignment fee in the amount of $7,500.

(a)           .  All payments by the Borrower of principal of, and interest on, the Loans and all other Obligations shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any present or future excise, stamp or other taxes, fees, duties, levies, imposts, charges, deductions, withholdings or other charges of any nature whatsoever imposed by any taxing authority, but excluding (i) franchise taxes, (ii) any taxes (other than withholding taxes) that would not be imposed but for a connection between the Agent or a Lender and the jurisdiction imposing such taxes (other than a connection arising solely by virtue of the activities of the Agent or such Lender pursuant to or in respect of this Agreement or any other Loan Document), (iii)  any taxes imposed on or measured by any Lenders assets, net income, receipts or branch profits, (iv) any taxes arising after the Agreement Date solely as a result of or attributable to a Lender changing its designated Lending Office after the date such Lender becomes a party hereto and (v) any taxes imposed by Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Internal Revenue Code (including any official interpretations thereof, collectively FATCA) on any withholdable payment payable to such recipient as a result of the failure of such recipient to satisfy the applicable requirements as set forth in FATCA after December 31, 2012 (such non-excluded items being collectively called Taxes).  If any withholding or deduction from any payment to be made by the Borrower hereunder is required in respect of any Taxes pursuant to any Applicable Law, then the Borrower will:
Taxes Generally
(i)           pay directly to the relevant Governmental Authority the full amount required to be so withheld or deducted;
(ii)           promptly forward to the Agent an official receipt or other documentation satisfactory to the Agent evidencing such payment to such Governmental Authority; and
(iii)           pay to the Agent for its account or the account of the applicable Lender, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as is necessary to ensure that the net amount actually received by the Agent or such Lender will equal the full amount that the

Agent or such Lender would have received had no such withholding or deduction been required.
A Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made under any Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower and the Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding.   If reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Agent, a Lender shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements.
(b)           .  If the Borrower fails to pay any Taxes when due to the appropriate Governmental Authority or fails to remit to the Agent, for its account or the account of the respective Lender, as the case may be, the required receipts or other required documentary evidence, the Borrower shall indemnify the Agent and the Lenders for any incremental Taxes, interest or penalties that may become payable by the Agent or any Lender as a result of any such failure.  For purposes of this Section, a distribution hereunder by the Agent or any Lender to or for the account of any Lender shall be deemed a payment by the Borrower.
Tax Indemnification
(c)           .  Prior to the date that any Lender or Participant organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside the United States of America becomes a party hereto, such Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the Agent such certificates, documents or other evidence, as required by the Internal Revenue Code or Treasury Regulations issued pursuant thereto (including Internal Revenue Service Forms W-8ECI and W-8BEN, as applicable, or appropriate successor forms), properly completed, currently effective and duly executed by such Lender or Participant establishing that payments to it hereunder and under the Notes are (i) not subject to United States Federal backup withholding tax and (ii) not subject to United States Federal withholding tax under the Code.  Each Lender shall (x) deliver further copies of such forms or other appropriate certifications on or before the date that any such forms expire or become obsolete and after the occurrence of any event requiring a change in the most recent form delivered to the Borrower and (y) obtain such extensions of the time for filing, and renew such forms and certifications thereof as may be reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Agent.  The Borrower shall not be required to pay any amount pursuant to the second sentence of subsection (a) above to any Lender or Participant that is organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside of the United States of America or the Agent, if it is organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside of the United States of America, if such Lender, Participant or the Agent, as applicable, fails to comply with the requirements of this subsection.

(a)           .  The Borrower shall promptly pay to the Agent for the account of a Lender from time to time such amounts as such Lender may reasonably determine to be necessary to compensate such Lender for any costs incurred by such Lender that it determines are attributable to its making or maintaining of any LIBOR Loans or LIBOR Margin Loans or its obligation to make any LIBOR Loans or LIBOR Margin Loans hereunder, any reduction in any amount receivable by such Lender under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents in respect of any of such Loans or such obligation or the maintenance by such Lender of capital in respect of its Loans or its Commitments (such increases in costs and reductions in amounts receivable being herein called Additional Costs), resulting from any Regulatory Change that:  (i) changes the basis of taxation of any amounts payable to such Lender under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents in respect of any of such Loans or its Commitments (other than taxes imposed on or measured by the overall net income of such Lender or of its Lending Office for any of such Loans by the jurisdiction in which such Lender has its principal office or such Lending Office); or (ii) imposes or modifies any reserve, special deposit or similar requirements (excluding Regulation D of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or other similar reserve requirement applicable to any other category of liabilities or category of extensions of credit or other assets by reference to which the interest rate on LIBOR Loans or LIBOR Margin Loans is determined to the extent utilized when determining LIBOR for such Loan) relating to any extensions of credit or other assets of, or any deposits with or other liabilities of, such Lender, or any commitment of such Lender (including, without limitation, the Commitments of such Lender hereunder); or (iii) has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on capital of such Lender to a level below that which such Lender could have achieved but for such Regulatory Change (taking into consideration such Lenders policies with respect to capital adequacy).
Additional Costs
(b)           .  Without limiting the effect of the provisions of the immediately preceding subsection (a), if by reason of any Regulatory Change, any Lender either (i) incurs Additional Costs based on or measured by the excess above a specified level of the amount of a category of deposits or other liabilities of such Lender that includes deposits by reference to which the interest rate on LIBOR Loans or LIBOR Margin Loans is determined as provided in this Agreement or a category of extensions of credit or other assets of such Lender that includes LIBOR Loans or LIBOR Margin Loans or (ii) becomes subject to restrictions on the amount of such a category of liabilities or assets that it may hold, then, if such Lender so elects by notice to the Borrower (with a copy to the Agent), the obligation of such Lender to make or Continue, or to Convert any other Type of Loans into, LIBOR Loans and/or the obligation of a Lender that has outstanding a Bid Rate Quote hereunder shall be suspended until such Regulatory Change ceases to be in effect (in which case the provisions of Section 5.5. shall apply).

     (c)           .  Without limiting the obligations of the Borrower under the preceding subsections of this Section (but without duplication), if as a result of any Regulatory Change or any risk-based capital guideline or other requirement heretofore or hereafter issued by any Governmental Authority there shall be imposed, modified or deemed applicable any tax, reserve, special deposit, capital adequacy or similar requirement against or with respect to or measured by reference to Letters of Credit and the result shall be to increase the cost to the Agent of issuing (or any Lender purchasing participations in) or maintaining its obligation hereunder to issue (or purchase participations in) any Letter of Credit or reduce any amount receivable by the Agent or any Lender hereunder in respect of any Letter of Credit, then, upon demand by the Agent or such Lender, the Borrower shall pay promptly, and in any event within three Business Days of demand, to the Agent for its account or the account of such Lender, as applicable, from time to time as specified by the Agent or a Lender, such additional amounts as shall be sufficient to compensate the Agent or such Lender for such increased costs or reductions in amount.
   
Additional Costs in Respect of Letters of Credit
(d)           .  Each of the Agent and each Lender agrees to notify the Borrower of any event occurring after the Agreement Date entitling the Agent or such Lender to compensation under any of the preceding subsections of this Section as promptly as practicable; provided, however, the failure of the Agent or any Lender to give such notice shall not release the Borrower from any of its obligations hereunder; provided, further, that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender or the Agent pursuant to this Section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than six months prior to the date that such Lender or Agent, as the case may be, notifies the Borrower of the event entitling the Agent or Lender to compensation giving rise to such increased costs or reductions, and of such Lenders or Agents intention to claim compensation thereof (except that, if such event giving rise to such increased cots or reductions is retroactive, then the six-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof). The Agent or such Lender agrees to furnish to the Borrower a certificate setting forth the basis and amount of each request by the Agent or such Lender for compensation under this Section.  Absent manifest error, determinations by the Agent or any Lender of the effect of any Regulatory Change shall be conclusive, provided that such determinations are made on a reasonable basis and in good faith.
Notification and Determination of Additional Costs
 
Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, if, on or prior to the determination of LIBOR for any Interest Period:
(a)           the Agent reasonably determines (which determination shall be conclusive) that by reason of circumstances affecting the relevant market, adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining LIBOR for such Interest Period; or
(b)           the Agent reasonably determines (which determination shall be conclusive) that LIBOR will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to the Lenders of making or maintaining LIBOR Loans for such Interest Period; or
 
 
 
51
 
 
(c)           the Agent reasonably determines (which determination shall be conclusive) that deposits are not being offered to banks in the applicable offshore interbank market for such currency of the applicable amount and the Interest Period of such LIBOR Loan; or
(d)           any Lender that has outstanding a Bid Rate Quote with respect to a LIBOR Margin Loan reasonably determines (which determination shall be conclusive) that LIBOR will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining such LIBOR Margin Loan;
then the Agent shall give the Borrower and each Lender prompt notice thereof and, so long as such condition remains in effect, (x) in the case of clauses (a) and (b), the Lenders shall be under no obligation to, and shall not, make additional LIBOR Loans, Continue LIBOR Loans or Convert Loans into LIBOR Loans and the Borrower shall, on the last day of each current Interest Period for each outstanding LIBOR Loan, either repay such Loan or Convert such Loan into a Base Rate Loan, and (y) in the case of clause (c) above, no Lender that has outstanding a Bid Rate Quote with respect to a LIBOR Margin Loan shall be under any obligation to make such Loan.
 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if it becomes unlawful for any Lender to honor its obligation to make or maintain LIBOR Loans hereunder and/or if any Lender that has an outstanding Bid Rate Quote shall determine that it is unlawful for such Lender to honor its obligation to make or maintain LIBOR Margin Loans hereunder, then such Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower thereof (with a copy to the Agent) and such Lenders obligation to make or Continue, or to Convert Loans of any other Type into, LIBOR Loans shall be suspended and/or such Lenders obligation to make LIBOR Margin Loans shall be suspended, as applicable, until such time as such Lender may again make and maintain LIBOR Loans (in which case the provisions of Section 5.5. shall be applicable).
 
The Borrower shall pay to the Agent for the account of a Lender, upon the request of such Lender through the Agent, such amount or amounts as Agent shall reasonably determine in its sole discretion to be sufficient to compensate such Lender for any yield-maintenance loss, cost or expense that the Agent determines is attributable to:  (a) any payment or prepayment (whether mandatory or optional) of a LIBOR Loan or a Bid Rate Loan, or Conversion of a LIBOR Loan, made by such Lender for any reason (including, without limitation, acceleration) on a date other than the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan; or (b) any failure by the Borrower for any reason (including, without limitation, the failure of any of the applicable conditions precedent specified in Article VI. to be satisfied) to borrow a LIBOR Loan or a Bid Rate Loan from such Lender on the date for such borrowing, or to Convert a Revolving Loan into a LIBOR Loan or Continue a LIBOR Loan on the requested date of such Conversion or Continuation.  Upon the Borrowers request, the Agent shall provide the Borrower with a statement setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for requesting such compensation and the method for determining the amount thereof.  Any such statement shall be conclusive absent manifest error, provided that such determinations are made on a reasonable basis and in good faith.
 
 
 
52
 
 
 
If the obligation of any Lender to make LIBOR Loans or to Continue, or to Convert Base Rate Loans into, LIBOR Loans shall be suspended pursuant to Section 5.1.(b), 5.2. or 5.3., then such Lenders LIBOR Loans shall be automatically Converted into Base Rate Loans on the last day(s) of the then current Interest Period(s) for LIBOR Loans (or, in the case of a Conversion required by Section 5.1.(b) or 5.3., on such earlier date as such Lender may specify to the Borrower with a copy to the Agent) and, unless and until such Lender gives notice as provided below that the circumstances specified in Section 5.1., 5.2. or 5.3. that gave rise to such Conversion no longer exist:
(i)           to the extent that such Lenders LIBOR Loans have been so Converted, all payments and prepayments of principal that would otherwise be applied to such Lenders LIBOR Loans shall be applied instead to its Base Rate Loans; and
(ii)           all Loans that would otherwise be made or Continued by such Lender as LIBOR Loans shall be made or Continued instead as Base Rate Loans, and all Base Rate Loans of such Lender that would otherwise be Converted into LIBOR Loans shall remain as Base Rate Loans.
If such Lender gives notice to the Borrower (with a copy to the Agent) that the circumstances specified in Section 5.1. or 5.3. that gave rise to the Conversion of such Lenders LIBOR Loans pursuant to this Section no longer exist (which such Lender agrees to do promptly upon such circumstances ceasing to exist) at a time when LIBOR Loans made by other Lenders are outstanding, then such Lenders Base Rate Loans shall be automatically Converted, on the first day(s) of the next succeeding Interest Period(s) for such outstanding LIBOR Loans, to the extent necessary so that, after giving effect thereto, all Loans held by the Lenders holding LIBOR Loans and by such Lender are held pro rata (as to principal amounts, Types and Interest Periods) in accordance with their respective Commitments.
 
If (a) a Lender requests compensation pursuant to Section 3.11. or 5.1., and the Requisite Lenders are not also doing the same, (b) the obligation of any Lender to make LIBOR Loans or to Continue, or to Convert Base Rate Loans into, LIBOR Loans shall be suspended pursuant to Section 5.1.(b) or 5.3. but the obligation of the Requisite Lenders shall not have been suspended under such Sections or (c) a Lender does not vote in favor of any amendment, modification or waiver to this Agreement which, pursuant to Section 12.10. requires the vote of all of the Lenders, and the Requisite Lenders shall have voted in favor of such amendment, modification or waiver, then, so long as there does not then exist any Default or Event of Default, the Borrower may either (i) demand that such Lender (the Affected Lender), and upon such demand the Affected Lender shall promptly, assign its Commitments to an Eligible Assignee subject to and in accordance with the provisions of Section 13.5.(d) for a purchase price equal to the aggregate principal balance of Loans then owing to the Affected Lender plus any accrued but unpaid interest thereon and accrued but unpaid fees owing to the Affected Lender, or (ii) pay to the Affected Lender the aggregate principal balance of Loans then owing to the Affected Lender plus any accrued but unpaid interest thereon and accrued but unpaid fees owing to the Affected Lender or any other amount as may be mutually agreed upon by such Affected Lender and Eligible Assignee, whereupon the Affected Lender shall no longer be a party hereto or have any rights or
 
 
 
53
 
 
 
obligations hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents.  Each of the Agent and the Affected Lender shall reasonably cooperate in effectuating the replacement of such Affected Lender under this Section, but at no time shall the Agent, such Affected Lender nor any other Lender be obligated in any way whatsoever to initiate any such replacement or to assist in finding an Eligible Assignee.  The exercise by the Borrower of its rights under this Section shall be at the Borrowers sole cost and expenses and at no cost or expense to the Agent, the Affected Lender or any of the other Lenders; provided, however, the Borrower shall not be obligated to reimburse or otherwise pay an Affected Lenders administrative or legal costs incurred as a result of the Borrowers exercise of its rights under this Section.  The terms of this Section shall not in any way limit the Borrowers obligation to pay to any Affected Lender compensation owing to such Affected Lender pursuant to Section 3.11. or 5.1.
 
Each Lender agrees that it will use reasonable efforts (consistent with its internal policy and legal and regulatory restrictions) to designate an alternate Lending Office with respect to any of its Loans affected by the matters or circumstances described in Sections 3.11., 5.1. or 5.3. to reduce the liability of the Borrower or avoid the results provided thereunder, so long as such designation is not disadvantageous to such Lender as determined by such Lender in its sole discretion, except that such Lender shall have no obligation to designate a Lending Office located in the United States of America.
 
Calculation of all amounts payable to a Lender under this Article V. shall be made as though such Lender had actually funded LIBOR Loans through the purchase of deposits in the relevant market bearing interest at the rate applicable to such LIBOR Loans in an amount equal to the amount of the LIBOR Loans and having a maturity comparable to the relevant Interest Period; provided, however, that each Lender may fund each of its LIBOR Loans in any manner it sees fit and the foregoing assumption shall be used only for calculation of amounts payable under this Article V.
 
 
 
 
The obligation of the Lenders to effect or permit the occurrence of the first Credit Event hereunder, whether as the making of a Loan or the issuance of a Letter of Credit, is subject to the following conditions precedent:
 
 
 
54
 
 
(a)           The Agent shall have received each of the following, in form and substance satisfactory to the Agent:
(i)           counterparts of this Agreement executed by each of the parties hereto;

Neither the Agent nor any Lender shall be under any obligation to marshal any assets in favor of any Loan Party or any other party or against or in payment of any or all of the Obligations.  To the extent that any Loan Party makes a payment or payments to the Agent and/or any Lender, or the Agent and/or any Lender enforce their security interests or exercise their rights of setoff, and such payment or payments or the proceeds of such enforcement or setoff or any part thereof are subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside and/or required to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party under any bankruptcy law, state or federal law, common law or equitable cause, then to the extent of such recovery, the Obligations or part thereof originally intended to be satisfied, and all Liens, rights and remedies therefor, shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as if such payment had not been made or such enforcement or setoff had not occurred.

(d)           payment of principal on Swingline Loans;
(e)           payments of principal of all other Loans and of all Reimbursement Obligations, to be applied for the ratable benefit of the Lenders, in such order as the Lenders may determine in their sole discretion;
(f)           amounts to be deposited into the Letter of Credit collateral Account in respect of Letters of Credit;
(g)           amounts due to the Agent and the Lenders pursuant to Sections 12.7. and 13.9.;

(i)           any amount remaining after application as provided above, shall be paid to the Borrower or whomever else may be legally entitled thereto.
 
(a)           As collateral security for the prompt payment in full when due of all Letter of Credit Liabilities, the Borrower hereby pledges and grants to the Agent, for the benefit of the Agent and the Lenders as provided herein, a security interest in all of its right, title and interest in and to the Letter of Credit Collateral Account and the balances from time to time in the Letter of Credit Collateral Account (including the investments and reinvestments therein provided for below).  The balances from time to time in the Letter of Credit Collateral Account shall not constitute payment of any Letter of Credit Liabilities until applied by the Agent as provided herein.  Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, funds held in the Letter of Credit Collateral Account shall be subject to withdrawal only as provided in this Section and in Section 2.16.
(b)           Amounts on deposit in the Letter of Credit Collateral Account shall be invested and reinvested by the Agent in such Cash Equivalents as the Agent shall determine in its sole discretion.  All such investments and reinvestments shall be held in the name of and be under the sole dominion and control of the Agent, , that all earnings on such investments will be credited to and retained in the Letter of Credit Collateral Account.  The Agent
provided
 
 
80
 
 
 
shall exercise reasonable care in the custody and preservation of any funds held in the Letter of Credit Collateral Account and shall be deemed to have exercised such care if such funds are accorded treatment substantially equivalent to that which the Agent accords other funds deposited with the Agent, it being understood that the Agent shall not have any responsibility for taking any necessary steps to preserve rights against any parties with respect to any funds held in the Letter of Credit Collateral Account.
(c)           If an Event of Default exists, the Agent may (and, if instructed by the Requisite Lenders, shall) in its (or their) discretion at any time and from time to time elect to liquidate any such investments and reinvestments and credit the proceeds thereof to the Letter of Credit Collateral Account and apply or cause to be applied such proceeds and any other balances in the Letter of Credit Collateral Account to the payment of any of the Letter of Credit Liabilities due and payable.
(d)           So long as no Default or Event of Default exists, the Agent shall, from time to time, at the request of the Borrower, deliver to the Borrower, against receipt but without any recourse, warranty or representation whatsoever, such of the balances in the Letter of Credit Collateral Account as exceed the aggregate amount of Letter of Credit Liabilities at such time.  When all of the Obligations shall have been indefeasibly paid in full and no Letters of Credit remain outstanding, the Agent shall deliver to the Borrower, against receipt but without any recourse, warranty or representation whatsoever, the balances remaining in the Letter of Credit Collateral Account.
(e)           The Borrower shall pay to the Agent from time to time such fees as the Agent normally charges for similar services in connection with the Agents administration of the Letter of Credit Collateral Account and investments and reinvestments of funds therein.
 
If the Borrower shall fail to perform any covenant, duty or agreement contained in any of the Loan Documents, the Agent may perform or attempt to perform such covenant, duty or agreement on behalf of the Borrower after the expiration of any cure or grace periods set forth herein.  In such event, the Borrower shall, at the request of the Agent, promptly pay any amount reasonably expended by the Agent in such performance or attempted performance to the Agent, together with interest thereon at the applicable Post-Default Rate from the date of such expenditure until paid.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Agent nor any Lender shall have any liability or responsibility whatsoever for the performance of any obligation of the Borrower under this Agreement or any other Loan Document.
 
The rights and remedies of the Agent and the Lenders under this Agreement and each of the other Loan Documents shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies which any of them may otherwise have under Applicable Law.  In exercising their respective rights and remedies the Agent and the Lenders may be selective and no failure or delay by the Agent or any of the Lenders in exercising any right shall operate as a waiver of it, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any power or right preclude its other or further exercise or the exercise of any other power or right.
 
 
81
 
 
 
 
Each Lender hereby appoints and authorizes the Agent to take such action as contractual representative on such Lenders behalf and to exercise such powers under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as are specifically delegated to the Agent by the terms hereof and thereof, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Not in limitation of the foregoing, each Lender authorizes and directs the Agent to enter into the Loan Documents for the benefit of the Lenders.  Each Lender hereby agrees that, except as otherwise set forth herein, any action taken by the Requisite Lenders in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement or the Loan Documents, and the exercise by the Requisite Lenders of the powers set forth herein or therein, together with such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto, shall be authorized and binding upon all of the Lenders.  Nothing herein shall be construed to deem the Agent a trustee or fiduciary for any Lender nor to impose on the Agent duties or obligations other than those expressly provided for herein.  At the request of a Lender, the Agent will forward to such Lender copies or, where appropriate, originals of the documents delivered to the Agent pursuant to this Agreement or the other Loan Documents.  The Agent will also furnish to any Lender, upon the request of such Lender, a copy of any certificate or notice furnished to the Agent by the Borrower, any Loan Party or any other Affiliate of the Borrower, pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document not already delivered to such Lender pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or any such other Loan Document.  As to any matters not expressly provided for by the Loan Documents (including, without limitation, enforcement or collection of any of the Obligations), the Agent shall not be required to exercise any discretion or take any action, but shall be required to act or to refrain from acting (and shall be fully protected in so acting or refraining from acting) upon the instructions of the Requisite Lenders (or all of the Lenders if explicitly required under any other provision of this Agreement), and such instructions shall be binding upon all Lenders and all holders of any of the Obligations; provided, however, that, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Agent shall not be required to take any action which exposes the Agent to personal liability or which is contrary to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or Applicable Law.  Not in limitation of the foregoing, the Agent shall not exercise any right or remedy it or the Lenders may have under any Loan Document upon the occurrence of a Default or an Event of Default unless the Requisite Lenders have so directed the Agent to exercise such right or remedy.
 
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement or any other Loan Documents, neither the Agent nor any of its directors, officers, agents, employees or counsel shall be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it or them under or in connection with this Agreement, except for its or their own gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a nonappealable judgment.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Agent: (a) may treat the payee of any Note as the holder thereof until the Agent receives written notice of the assignment or transfer thereof signed by such payee and in form satisfactory to the Agent; (b) may consult with legal counsel (including its own counsel or counsel for the Borrower or any other Loan Party), independent public accountants and other experts selected by it and shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken in good faith by it in accordance with the advice of such counsel, accountants or experts; (c) makes no warranty or representation to any Lender or any other Person and shall not be responsible to any Lender or any other Person for any statements, warranties or representations made by any Person in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document; (d) shall not have any duty to ascertain or to inquire as to the performance or
 
 
82
 
 
 
observance of any of the terms, covenants or conditions of any of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the satisfaction of any conditions precedent under this Agreement or any Loan Document on the part of the Borrower or other Persons or inspect the property, books or records of the Borrower or any other Person; (e) shall not be responsible to any Lender for the due execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant thereto; and (f) shall incur no liability under or in respect of this Agreement or any other Loan Document by acting upon any notice, consent, certificate or other instrument or writing (which may be by telephone or telecopy) believed by it to be genuine and signed, sent or given by the proper party or parties.
 
The Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of a Default or Event of Default unless the Agent has received notice from a Lender or the Borrower referring to this Agreement, describing with reasonable specificity such Default or Event of Default and stating that such notice is a notice of default.  If any Lender (excluding the Lender which is also serving as the Agent) becomes aware of any Default or Event of Default, it shall promptly send to the Agent such a notice of default.  Further, if the Agent receives such a notice of default, the Agent shall give prompt notice thereof to the Lenders.
 
Wells Fargo, as a Lender, shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement and any other Loan Document as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Agent; and the term Lender or Lenders shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated, include Wells Fargo in each case in its individual capacity.  Wells Fargo and its affiliates may each accept deposits from, maintain deposits or credit balances for, invest in, lend money to, act as trustee under indentures of, serve as financial advisor to, and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower, any other Loan Party or any other affiliate thereof as if it were any other bank and without any duty to account therefor to the other Lenders.  Further, the Agent and any affiliate may accept fees and other consideration from the Borrower for services in connection with this Agreement and otherwise without having to account for the same to the other Lenders.
 
All communications from the Agent to any Lender requesting such Lenders determination, consent, approval or disapproval (a) shall be given in the form of a written notice to such Lender, (b) shall be accompanied by a description of the matter or issue as to which such determination, approval, consent or disapproval is requested, or shall advise such Lender where information, if any, regarding such matter or issue may be inspected, or shall otherwise describe the matter or issue to be resolved, (c) shall include, if reasonably requested by such Lender and to the extent not previously provided to such Lender, written materials and a summary of all oral information provided to the
 
 
83
 
 
Agent by the Borrower in respect of the matter or issue to be resolved, and (d) shall include the Agents recommended course of action or determination in respect thereof.  Each Lender shall reply promptly, but in any event within 10 Business Days (or such lesser or greater period as may be specifically required under the express terms of the Loan Documents) of receipt of such communication.  Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, unless a Lender shall give written notice to the Agent that it specifically objects to the recommendation or determination of the Agent (together with a written explanation of the reasons behind such objection) within the applicable time period for reply, such Lender shall be deemed to have conclusively approved of or consented to such recommendation or determination (other than in respect of any consent required under the second sentence of Section 13.6.).
 
Each Lender expressly acknowledges and agrees that neither the Agent nor any of its officers, directors, employees, agents, counsel, attorneys-in-fact or other affiliates has made any representations or warranties as to the financial condition, operations, creditworthiness, solvency or other information concerning the business or affairs of the Borrower, any other Loan Party, any Subsidiary or any other Person  to such Lender and that no act by the Agent hereafter taken, including any review of the affairs of the Borrower, shall be deemed to constitute any such representation or warranty by the Agent to any Lender.  Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Agent, any other Lender or counsel to the Agent, or any of their respective officers, directors, employees and agents, and based on the financial statements of the Borrower, the Subsidiaries or any other Affiliate thereof, and inquiries of such Persons, its independent due diligence of the business and affairs of the Borrower, the Loan Parties, the Subsidiaries and other Persons, its review of the Loan Documents, the legal opinions required to be delivered to it hereunder, the advice of its own counsel and such other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit and legal analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement and the transaction contemplated hereby.  Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Agent, any other Lender or counsel to the Agent or any of their respective officers, directors, employees and agents, and based on such review, advice, documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under the Loan Documents.  Except for notices, reports and other documents and information expressly required to be furnished to the Lenders by the Agent under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, the Agent shall have no duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other information concerning the business, operations, property, financial and other condition or creditworthiness of the Borrower, any other Loan Party or any other Affiliate thereof which may come into possession of the Agent or any of its officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or other Affiliates.  Each Lender acknowledges that the Agents legal counsel in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is only acting as counsel to the Agent and is not acting as counsel to such Lender.
 
 
84
 
 
 
 
Each Lender agrees to indemnify the Agent (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrower and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so) pro rata in accordance with such Lenders respective Commitment Percentage, from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever which may at any time be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against the Agent (in its capacity as Agent but not as a Lender) in any way relating to or arising out of the Loan Documents, any transaction contemplated hereby or thereby or any action taken or omitted by the Agent under the Loan Documents (collectively, Indemnifiable Amounts); provided, however, that no Lender shall be liable for any portion of such Indemnifiable Amounts to the extent resulting from the Agents gross negligence or willful misconduct or if the Agent fails to follow the written direction of the Requisite Lenders unless such failure is pursuant to the advice of counsel of which the Lenders have received notice.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Lender agrees to reimburse the Agent (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrower and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so) promptly upon demand for its ratable share of any out-of-pocket expenses (including counsel fees of the counsel(s) of the Agents own choosing) incurred by the Agent in connection with the preparation, negotiation, execution, administration, or enforcement of, or legal advice with respect to the rights or responsibilities of the parties under, the Loan Documents, any suit or action brought by the Agent to enforce the terms of the Loan Documents and/or collect any Obligations, any lender liability suit or claim brought against the Agent and/or the Lenders, and any claim or suit brought against the Agent and/or the Lenders arising under any Environmental Laws.  Such out-of-pocket expenses (including counsel fees) shall be advanced by the Lenders on the request of the Agent notwithstanding any claim or assertion that the Agent is not entitled to indemnification hereunder upon receipt of an undertaking by the Agent that the Agent will reimburse the Lenders if it is actually and finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that the Agent is not so entitled to indemnification.  The agreements in this Section shall survive the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder or under the other Loan Documents and the termination of this Agreement.  If the Borrower shall reimburse the Agent for any Indemnifiable Amount following payment by any Lender to the Agent in respect of such Indemnifiable Amount pursuant to this Section, the Agent shall share such reimbursement on a ratable basis with each Lender making any such payment.
 
The Agent may resign at any time as Agent under the Loan Documents by giving written notice thereof to the Lenders and the Borrower.  In the event of a material breach of its duties hereunder, the Agent may be removed as Agent under the Loan Documents at any time by all Lenders (other than the Lender then acting as Agent) and the Borrower upon 30-days prior notice.  Upon any such resignation or removal, the Requisite Lenders (which, in the case of the removal of the Agent as provided in the immediately preceding sentence, shall be determined without regard to the Commitment of the Lender then acting as Agent) shall have the right to appoint a successor Agent which appointment shall, provided no Default or Event of Default exists, be subject to the Borrowers approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed (except that the Borrower shall, in all events, be deemed to have approved each Lender as a successor Agent).  If no successor Agent shall have been so appointed in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence, and shall have accepted such appointment, within 30 days after the resigning Agents giving of notice of resignation or the Lenders removal of the resigning Agent, then the resigning or removed Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Agent, which shall be a Lender, if any Lender shall be
 
 
85
 
 
willing to serve, and otherwise shall be a commercial bank having total combined assets of at least $10,000,000,000.  Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Agent hereunder by a successor Agent, such successor Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Agent, and the retiring Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations under the Loan Documents.  After any Agents resignation or removal hereunder as Agent, the provisions of this Article XII. shall continue to inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Agent under the Loan Documents.
 
Each of the Joint Lead Arrangers, Joint Bookrunners, the Syndication Agent and any other Person awarded a similar title (each a Titled Agent) in each such respective capacity, assumes no responsibility or obligation hereunder, including, without limitation, for servicing, enforcement or collection of any of the Loans, nor any duties as an agent hereunder for the Lenders.  The titles given to the Titled Agents are solely honorific and imply no fiduciary responsibility on the part of the Titled Agents to the Agent, any Lender, the Borrower or any other Loan Party and the use of such titles does not impose on the Titled Agents any duties or obligations greater than those of any other Lender or entitle the Titled Agents to any rights other than those to which any other Lender is entitled.
 
(a)           .  Each of the following shall require the approval of, or may be taken at the request of, the Requisite Lenders:

(i)           Termination of the Commitments and acceleration of the Obligations upon the occurrence of an Event of Default as provided in Section 11.2.(a)(ii);

(iii)           Removing the Agent for good cause as provided in Section 12.8.;
(iv)           Consenting to the assignment by the Borrower to another Person of the Borrowers rights and obligations under this Agreement as provided in Section 13.5.(a); and
(v)           Any consent or approval regarding, any waiver of the performance or observance by the Borrower of and the waiver of the continuance of any Default or Event of Default in respect of, any term of this Agreement or any other Loan Document described in Section 13.6.(a) through (k).
(c)           .  To the extent any provision of this Section conflicts with any other provision of this Agreement, including without limitation, Section 13.6., or any other Loan Document, such other provision shall control.

Subject to Section 3.3. and in addition to any rights now or hereafter granted under Applicable Law and not by way of limitation of any such rights, the Agent, each Lender and each Participant is hereby authorized by the Borrower, at any time or from time to time while an Event of Default exists, without notice to the Borrower or to any other Person, any such notice being hereby expressly waived, but in the case of a Lender or a Participant subject to receipt of the prior written consent of the Agent exercised  in its sole discretion, to set off and to appropriate and to apply any and all deposits (general or special, including, but not limited to, indebtedness evidenced by certificates of deposit, whether matured or unmatured) and any other indebtedness at any time held or owing by the Agent, such Lender or any affiliate of the Agent or such Lender, to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower against and on account of any of the Obligations, irrespective of whether or not any or all of the Loans and all other Obligations have been declared to be, or have otherwise become, due and payable as permitted by Section 11.2., and although such obligations shall be contingent or unmatured.
 
(a)           [Intentionally Omitted].
(b)           EACH OF THE BORROWER, THE AGENT AND EACH LENDER HEREBY AGREES THAT THE FEDERAL DISTRICT COURTS OF THE NORTHERN AND THE SOUTHERN DISTRICTS OF CALIFORNIA AND THE STATE COURTS OF CALIFORNIA SHALL HAVE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION TO HEAR AND DETERMINE ANY CLAIMS OR DISPUTES BETWEEN OR AMONG THE BORROWER, THE AGENT OR ANY OF THE LENDERS, PERTAINING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE LOANS AND LETTERS OF CREDIT, THE NOTES OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT OR TO ANY MATTER ARISING HEREFROM OR THEREFROM.  THE BORROWER AND EACH OF THE LENDERS EXPRESSLY SUBMITS AND CONSENTS IN ADVANCE TO SUCH JURISDICTION IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING COMMENCED IN SUCH COURTS.  EACH PARTY FURTHER WAIVES ANY OBJECTION THAT IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE VENUE OF ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING IN ANY SUCH COURT OR THAT SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING WAS BROUGHT IN AN INCONVENIENT FORUM AND EACH AGREES NOT TO PLEAD OR CLAIM THE SAME.

(c)           THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED BY EACH PARTY WITH THE ADVICE OF COUNSEL AND WITH A FULL UNDERSTANDING OF THE LEGAL CONSEQUENCES THEREOF, AND SHALL SURVIVE THE PAYMENT OF THE LOANS AND ALL OTHER AMOUNTS PAYABLE HEREUNDER OR UNDER THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS, THE TERMINATION OR EXPIRATION OF ALL LETTERS OF CREDIT AND THE TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT.

(b)           Any Lender may make, carry or transfer Loans at, to or for the account of, any of its branch offices or the office of an affiliate of such Lender except to the extent such transfer would result in increased costs to the Borrower.
(c)           Any Lender may at any time grant to one or more banks or other financial institutions (each a Participant) participating interests in its Commitment or the Obligations owing to such Lender; provided, however, any such participating interest must be for a constant and not a varying percentage interest.  Except as otherwise provided in Section 13.3., no Participant shall have any rights or benefits under this Agreement or any other Loan Document.  In the event of any such grant by a Lender of a participating interest to a Participant, such Lender shall remain responsible for the performance of its obligations hereunder, and the Borrower and the Agent shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement.  Any agreement pursuant to which any Lender may grant such a participating interest shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right and responsibility to enforce the obligations of the Borrower hereunder including, without limitation, the right to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided, however, such Lender may agree with the Participant that it will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to (i) increase, or extend the term or extend the time or waive any requirement for the reduction or termination of, such Lenders Commitment, (ii) extend the date fixed for the payment of principal of or interest on the Loans or portions thereof owing to such Lender, (iii) reduce the amount of any such payment of principal, (iv) reduce the rate at which interest is payable thereon or (v) release any Guarantor from its obligations under the Guaranty.

(d)           Any Lender may with the prior written consent of the Agent and, subject to the immediately following clause (i), the Borrower assign to one or more Eligible Assignees (each an Assignee) all or a portion of its Commitment and its other rights and obligations under this Agreement and the Notes; provided, however, (i) so long as no Default or Event of Default shall exist, the Borrower shall have consented to such assignment (which consent, in each case, shall not be unreasonably withheld (it being agreed that the Borrowers withholding of consent to an assignment which would result in the Borrower having to pay amounts under Section 3.11. shall be deemed to be reasonable)); (ii) no such consent by the Borrower shall be required in the case of any assignment to another Lender or any affiliate of such Lender or another Lender; (iii) no such consent by the Agent shall be required in the case of any assignment by a Lender to any affiliate of such Lender; (iv) any partial assignment shall be in an amount at least equal to $10,000,000 and after giving effect to such assignment the assigning Lender retains a Commitment, or if the Commitments have been terminated, holds Notes having an aggregate outstanding principal balance, of at least $10,000,000; and (v) each such assignment shall be effected by means of an Assignment and Acceptance Agreement.  Upon execution and delivery of such instrument and payment by such Assignee to such transferor Lender of an amount equal to the purchase price agreed between such transferor Lender and such Assignee, such Assignee shall be deemed to be a Lender party to this Agreement as of the effective date of the Assignment and Acceptance Agreement and shall have all the rights and obligations of a Lender with a Commitment as set forth in such Assignment and Acceptance Agreement, and the transferor Lender shall be released from its obligations hereunder to a corresponding extent, and no further consent or action by any party shall be required.  Upon the consummation of any assignment pursuant to this subsection, the transferor Lender, the Agent and the Borrower shall make appropriate arrangements so that new Notes are issued to the Assignee and such transferor Lender, as appropriate.  In connection with any such assignment, the transferor Lender shall pay to the Agent an administrative fee for processing such assignment in the amount of $4,500.
(e)           The Agent shall maintain a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance Agreement delivered to and accepted by it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders and the Commitment of each Lender from time to time (the Register).  The Agent shall give each Lender and the Borrower notice of the assignment by any Lender of its rights as contemplated by this Section.  The Borrower, the Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.  The Register and copies of each Assignment and Acceptance Agreement shall be available for inspection by the Borrower or any Lender at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice to the Agent.  Upon its receipt of an Assignment and Acceptance Agreement executed by an assigning Lender, together with each Note subject to such assignment, the Agent shall, if such Assignment and Acceptance Agreement has been completed and if the Agent receives the processing and recording fee described in subsection (d) above, (i) accept such Assignment and Acceptance Agreement, (ii) record the information contained therein in the Register and (iii) give prompt notice thereof to the Borrower.
 
 
91
 
 
(f)           [Intentionally Omitted.]
(g)           In addition to the assignments and participations permitted under the foregoing provisions of this Section, any Lender may assign and pledge all or any portion of its Loans and its Notes to any Federal Reserve Bank as collateral security.  No such assignment shall release the assigning Lender from its obligations hereunder.
(h)           A Lender may furnish any information concerning the Borrower, any other Loan Party or any of their respective Subsidiaries in the possession of such Lender from time to time to Assignees and Participants (including prospective Assignees and Participants) subject to compliance with Section 13.8.
(i)           Anything in this Section to the contrary notwithstanding, no Lender may assign or participate any interest in any Loan held by it hereunder to the Borrower, any other Loan Party or any of their respective Affiliates or Subsidiaries.
(j)           Each Lender agrees that, without the prior written consent of the Borrower and the Agent, it will not make any assignment hereunder in any manner or under any circumstances that would require registration or qualification of, or filings in respect of, any Loan or Note under the Securities Act or any other securities laws of the United States of America or of any other jurisdiction.
(k)           Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any Lender (for purposes of this subsection, a Granting Lender) may grant to a special purpose funding vehicle organized under the laws of the United States of America or any state thereof and affiliated or sponsored by such Granting Lender or one of its affiliates (for the purposes of this subsection, an SPC) the option to make, on behalf of such Granting Lender, all or a portion of the Loans which such Granting Lender is obligated or permitted to make (a Funding Obligation) hereunder, such option to be exercisable in the sole discretion of the SPC, provided, however, that
 
(i)           such Granting Lenders obligations under this Agreement and the Loan Documents shall remain unchanged, including without limitation the indemnification obligations of the Granting Lender pursuant to Section 12.7. hereof;
 
(ii)           such Granting Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of all Funding Obligations;
 
(iii)           the Borrower, the Lenders and the Agent shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Granting Lender in connection with such Granting Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement, and the Agent shall continue to deal solely and directly with the Granting Lender as agent for the SPC with respect to distribution of payment of principal, interest and fees, Notices of Conversion and Continuation and all other matters;
 
 
92
 
 
(iv)           such Granting Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce the obligations of the Borrower relating to its Loans and its Notes and to approve any amendment, modification, or waiver of any provisions of this Agreement;
 
(v)           the granting of such option shall not constitute an assignment to or participation of such SPC of or in the Granting Lenders Commitment and Obligations owing thereto;
 
(vi)           such SPC shall not become a Lender nor acquire any rights hereunder as a result of the granting of such option;
 
(vii)           such SPC shall not become obligated or committed to make Loans as a result of the granting of such option;
 
(viii)           if such SPC elects not to exercise such option or otherwise fails to make all or any part of any Loan, the Granting Lender shall retain its Funding Obligation and be obligated to make the entire Loan or any portion of such Loan not made by such SPC;
 
(ix)           Loans made by an SPC hereunder shall be deemed to satisfy the Funding Obligation and utilize the Commitment of the Granting Lender as if, and to the same extent, such Loans were made by such Granting Lender;
 
(x)           Each party hereto agrees that no SPC shall be liable for any indemnity or payment under this Agreement for which a Granting Lender would otherwise be liable so long as, and to the extent, such Loans were made by such Granting Lender; and
 
(xi)           Each party hereto agrees that, prior to the date that is one year and one day after the payment in full of all outstanding commercial paper or other senior indebtedness of any SPC, it will not institute against, or join any other person in instituting against, such SPC any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceedings under the laws of the United States or any state thereof.
 
Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, any consent or approval required or permitted by this Agreement or in any Loan Document to be given by the Lenders may be given, and any term of this Agreement or of any other Loan Document (other than any fee letter solely between the Borrower and the Agent) may be amended, and the performance or observance by the Borrower, any other Loan Party or any other Subsidiary of any terms of this Agreement or such other Loan Document (other than any fee letter solely between the Borrower and the Agent) or the continuance of any Default or Event of Default may be waived (either generally or in a particular instance and either retroactively or prospectively) with, but only with, the written consent of the Requisite Lenders (and, in the case of an amendment to any Loan Document, the written consent of each Loan Party which is party thereto).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing, and signed by all of the Lenders (or the Agent at the written direction of the Lenders), do any of the following: (a) increase the Commitments of the Lenders or subject the Lenders to any additional obligations; (b) reduce the principal of, or interest rates that have accrued or that will be charged on the outstanding principal amount of, any Loans or other Obligations; (c) reduce the amount of any Fees payable to the Lenders hereunder; (d) postpone any date fixed for any payment of any principal of, interest on, or Fees with respect to, any Loans or any other Obligations; (e) change the Commitment Percentages (excluding any change as a result of an assignment of Commitments permitted under Section 13.5.(d) or an increase of Commitments effected pursuant to Section 2.17.); (f) modify the definition of the terms Termination Date or Termination Date; (g) amend this Section or amend the definitions of the terms used in this Agreement or the other Loan Documents insofar as such definitions affect the substance of this Section; (h) modify
 
 
 
93
 
 
the definition of the term Requisite Lenders or modify in any other manner the number or percentage of the Lenders required to make any determinations or waive any rights hereunder or to modify any provision hereof; (i) release any Guarantor from its obligations under the Guaranty (except for releases permitted under Sections 8.14.(d)); and (j) waive a Default or Event of Default under Section 11.1.(a).  No amendment, waiver or consent unless in writing and signed by the Agent, in addition to the Lenders required hereinabove to take such action, shall affect the rights or duties of the Agent under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents.  Any amendment, waiver or consent relating to Section 2.4. or the obligations of the Swingline Lender under this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall, in addition to the Lenders required hereinabove to take such action, require the written consent of the Swingline Lender.  No waiver shall extend to or affect any obligation not expressly waived or impair any right consequent thereon and any amendment, waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose set forth therein.  No course of dealing or delay or omission on the part of the Agent or any Lender in exercising any right shall operate as a waiver thereof or otherwise be prejudicial thereto.  Any Event of Default occurring hereunder shall continue to exist until such time as such Event of Default is waived in writing in accordance with the terms of this Section, notwithstanding any attempted cure or other action by the Borrower, any other Loan Party or any other Person subsequent to the occurrence of such Event of Default.  Except as otherwise explicitly provided for herein or in any other Loan Document, no notice to or demand upon the Borrower shall entitle the Borrower to other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 13.6. the Agent shall be authorized, on behalf of the Lenders, to waive the imposition of late fees in Section 2.9. up to a maximum of 3 times per year.
 
The relationship between the Borrower, on the one hand, and the Lenders and the Agent, on the other hand, shall be solely that of borrower and lender.  Neither the Agent nor any Lender shall have any fiduciary responsibilities to the Borrower and no provision in this Agreement or in any of the other Loan Documents, and no course of dealing between or among any of the parties hereto, shall be deemed to create any fiduciary duty owing by the Agent or any Lender to any Lender, the Borrower, any Subsidiary or any other Loan Party.  Neither the Agent nor any Lender undertakes any responsibility to the Borrower to review or inform the Borrower of any matter in connection with any phase of the Borrowers business or operations.
 
 
94
 
 
 
Except as otherwise provided by Applicable Law, the Agent and each Lender shall utilize all non-public information obtained pursuant to the requirements of this Agreement which has been identified as confidential or proprietary by the Borrower in accordance with its customary procedure for handling confidential information of this nature and in accordance with safe and sound banking practices but in any event may make disclosure: (a) to any of their respective affiliates, agents or advisors (provided any such affiliate, agent or advisor shall agree to keep such information confidential in accordance with the terms of this Section); (b) as reasonably requested by any bona fide Assignee, Participant or other transferee in connection with the contemplated transfer of any Commitment or participations therein as permitted hereunder (provided they shall agree to keep such information confidential in accordance with the terms of this Section); (c) as required or requested by any Governmental Authority or representative thereof or pursuant to legal process or in connection with any legal proceedings; (d) to the Agents or such Lenders independent auditors and other professional advisors (provided they shall be notified of the confidential nature of the information); (e) if an Event of Default exists, to any other Person, in connection with the exercise by the Agent or the Lenders of rights hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents; and (f) to the extent such information (x) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this Section or (y) becomes available to the Agent or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than the Borrower or any Affiliate.
 
(a)           The Borrower shall and hereby agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Agent, any affiliate of the Agent and each of the Lenders and their respective affiliates, parents, directors, officers, shareholders, agents, employees and counsel (each referred to herein as an Indemnified Party) from and against any and all losses, costs, claims, damages, liabilities, deficiencies, judgments or expenses of every kind and nature (including, without limitation, amounts paid in settlement, court costs and the fees and disbursements of counsel incurred in connection with any litigation, investigation, claim or proceeding or any advice rendered in connection therewith, but excluding losses, costs, claims, damages, liabilities, deficiencies, judgments or expenses indemnification in respect of which is specifically covered by Section 3.11. or 5.1. or expressly excluded from the coverage of such Sections) incurred by an Indemnified Party in connection with, arising out of, or by reason of, any suit, cause of action, claim, arbitration, investigation or settlement, consent decree or other proceeding (the foregoing referred to herein as an Indemnity Proceeding) which is in any way related directly or indirectly to: (i) this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the transactions contemplated thereby; (ii) the making of any Loans or issuance of Letters of Credit hereunder; (iii) any actual or proposed use by the Borrower of the proceeds of the Loans or Letters of Credit; (iv) the Agents or any Lenders entering into this Agreement; (v) the fact that the Agent and the Lenders have established the credit facility evidenced hereby in favor of the Borrower; (vi) the fact that the Agent and the Lenders are creditors of the Borrower and have or are alleged to have information regarding the financial condition, strategic plans or business operations of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries; (vii) the fact that the Agent and the Lenders are material creditors of the Borrower and are alleged to influence directly or indirectly the business decisions or affairs of the Borrower and
 
 
95
 
 
the Subsidiaries or their financial condition; (viii) the exercise of any right or remedy the Agent or the Lenders may have under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents; provided, however, that the Borrower shall not be obligated to indemnify any Indemnified Party for any acts or omissions of such Indemnified Party in connection with matters described in this clause (viii) that constitute gross negligence or willful misconduct; or (ix) any violation or non-compliance by the Borrower or any Subsidiary of any Applicable Law (including any Environmental Law) including, but not limited to, any Indemnity Proceeding commenced by (A) the Internal Revenue Service or state taxing authority or (B) any Governmental Authority or other Person under any Environmental Law, including any Indemnity Proceeding commenced by a Governmental Authority or other Person seeking remedial or other action to cause the Borrower or its Subsidiaries (or its respective properties) (or the Agent and/or the Lenders as successors to the Borrower) to be in compliance with such Environmental Laws.
(b)           The Borrowers indemnification obligations under this Section shall apply to all Indemnity Proceedings arising out of, or related to, the foregoing whether or not an Indemnified Party is a named party in such Indemnity Proceeding.  In this connection, this indemnification shall cover all costs and expenses of any Indemnified Party in connection with any deposition of any Indemnified Party or compliance with any subpoena (including any subpoena requesting the production of documents).  This indemnification shall, among other things, apply to any Indemnity Proceeding commenced by other creditors of the Borrower or any Subsidiary, any shareholder of the Borrower or any Subsidiary (whether such shareholder(s) are prosecuting such Indemnity Proceeding in their individual capacity or derivatively on behalf of the Borrower), any account debtor of the Borrower or any Subsidiary or by any Governmental Authority.
(c)           This indemnification shall apply to any Indemnity Proceeding arising during the pendency of any bankruptcy proceeding filed by or against the Borrower and/or any Subsidiary.
(d)           All out-of-pocket fees and expenses of, and all amounts required to be paid to third-persons by, an Indemnified Party in connection with this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents shall be advanced by the Borrower at the request of such Indemnified Party notwithstanding any claim or assertion by the Borrower that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification hereunder upon receipt of an undertaking by such Indemnified Party that such Indemnified Party will reimburse the Borrower if it is actually and finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that such Indemnified Party is not so entitled to indemnification hereunder.
(e)           An Indemnified Party may conduct its own investigation and defense of, and may formulate its own strategy with respect to, any Indemnity Proceeding covered by this Section and, as provided above, all costs and expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party shall be reimbursed by the Borrower.  No action taken by legal counsel chosen by an Indemnified Party in investigating or defending against any such Indemnity Proceeding shall vitiate or in any way impair the obligations and duties of the Borrower hereunder to indemnify and hold harmless each such Indemnified Party; provided, however, that (i) if the Borrower is required to indemnify an Indemnified Party pursuant hereto and (ii) the Borrower has provided evidence reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Party that the Borrower has the financial wherewithal to reimburse such Indemnified Party for any amount paid by such Indemnified Party with respect to such Indemnified Proceeding, such Indemnified Party shall not settle or compromise any such Indemnified Proceeding without the prior written consent of the Borrower (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).
 
 
96
 
 
(f)           If and to the extent that the obligations of the Borrower hereunder are unenforceable for any reason, the Borrower hereby agrees to make the maximum contribution to the payment and satisfaction of such obligations which is permissible under Applicable Law.
(g)           The Borrowers obligations hereunder shall survive any termination of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and the payment in full in cash of the Obligations, and are in addition to, and not in substitution of, any other of their obligations set forth in this Agreement or any other Loan Document to which it is a party.
 
At such time as (a) all of the Commitments have been terminated, (b) none of the Lenders is obligated any longer under this Agreement to make any Loans and (c) all Obligations (other than obligations which survive as provided in the following sentence) have been paid and satisfied in full, this Agreement shall terminate. The indemnities to which the Agent and the Lenders are entitled under the provisions of Sections 3.12., 5.1., 5.4., 12.7., 13.2. and 13.9. and any other provision of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and the provisions of Section 13.4., shall continue in full force and effect and shall protect the Agent and the Lenders (i) notwithstanding any termination of this Agreement, or of the other Loan Documents, against events arising after such termination as well as before and (ii) at all times after any such party ceases to be a party to this Agreement with respect to all matters and events existing on or prior to the date such party ceased to be a party to this Agreement.
 
Any provision of this Agreement which is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remainder of such provision or the remaining provisions or affecting the validity or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction.
 
THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA APPLICABLE TO CONTRACTS EXECUTED, AND TO BE FULLY PERFORMED, IN SUCH STATE.
 
This Agreement and any amendments, waivers, consents or supplements may be executed in any number of counterparts and by different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be deemed an original, but all of which counterparts together shall constitute but one and the same instrument.
 
 
97
 
 
 
The obligations of the Borrower to direct or prohibit the taking of certain actions by the other Loan Parties as specified herein shall be absolute and not subject to any defense the Borrower may have that the Borrower does not control such Loan Parties.
 
Neither the Agent nor any Lender shall be under any obligation to marshal any assets in favor of any Loan Party or any other party or against or in payment of any or all of the Obligations.  To the extent that any Loan Party makes a payment or payments to the Agent and/or any Lender, or the Agent and/or any Lender enforce their security interests or exercise their rights of setoff, and such payment or payments or the proceeds of such enforcement or setoff or any part thereof are subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside and/or required to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party under any bankruptcy law, state or federal law, common law or equitable cause, then to the extent of such recovery, the Obligations or part thereof originally intended to be satisfied, and all Liens, rights and remedies therefor, shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as if such payment had not been made or such enforcement or setoff had not occurred.
 
All covenants hereunder shall be given in any jurisdiction independent effect so that if a particular action or condition is not permitted by any of such covenants, the fact that it would be permitted by an exception to, or be otherwise within the limitations of, another covenant shall not avoid the occurrence of a Default or an Event of Default if such action is taken or condition exists.
 
Neither the Agent nor any Lender, nor any affiliate, officer, director, employee, attorney, or agent of the Agent or any Lender shall have any liability with respect to, and the Borrower hereby waives, releases, and agrees not to sue any of them upon, any claim for any special, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages suffered or incurred by the Borrower in connection with, arising out of, or in any way related to, this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents.  The Borrower hereby waives, releases, and agrees not to sue the Agent or any Lender or any of the Agents or any Lenders affiliates, officers, directors, employees, attorneys, or agents for punitive damages in respect of any claim in connection with, arising out of, or in any way related to, this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or financed hereby.
 
This Agreement, the Notes, and the other Loan Documents referred to herein embody the final, entire agreement among the parties hereto and supersede any and all prior commitments, agreements, representations, and understandings, whether written or oral, relating to the subject matter hereof and thereof and may not be contradicted or varied by evidence of prior, contemporaneous, or subsequent oral agreements or discussions of the parties hereto.  There are no oral agreements among the parties hereto.
 
 
98

The Agent or the Borrower may, in its discretion, agree to accept notices and other communications to it hereunder by electronic delivery pursuant to procedures approved by it for all or particular notices or communications.  Documents or notices delivered electronically shall be deemed to have been delivered twenty-four (24) hours after the date and time on which the Agent or Borrower posts such documents or the documents become available on a commercial website and the Agent or Borrower notifies each Lender of said posting and provides a link thereto provided if such notice or other communication is not sent or posted during the normal business hours of the recipient, said posting date and time shall be deemed to have commenced as of  9:00 a.m. on the opening of business on the next business day for the recipient.  Notwithstanding anything contained herein, in every instance the Borrower shall be required to provide paper copies of the certificate required by Section 9.3. to the Agent and shall deliver paper copies of any documents to the Agent or to any Lender that requests such paper copies until a written request to cease delivering paper copies is given by the Agent or such Lender.  Except for the certificates required by Section 9.3., the Agent shall have no obligation to request the delivery of or to maintain paper copies of the documents delivered electronically, and in any event shall have no responsibility to monitor compliance by the Borrower with any such request for delivery.  Each Lender shall be solely responsible for requesting delivery to it of paper copies and maintaining its paper or electronic documents.
(b)           The Borrower agrees that the Agent may make any material delivered by the Borrower to the Agent, as well as any amendments, waivers, consents, and other written information, documents, instruments and other materials relating to the Borrower, any of its Subsidiaries, or any other materials or matters relating to this Agreement, the Notes or any of the transactions contemplated hereby (collectively, the ) available to the Lenders by posting such notices on an electronic delivery system (which may be provided by the Agent, an affiliate of the Agent, or any Person that is not an affiliate of the Agent), such as IntraLinks, or a substantially similar electronic system (the ).
