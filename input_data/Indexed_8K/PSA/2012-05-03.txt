News Release
 
 
,  Public Storage (NYSE:PSA) announced today operating results for the first quarter ended
GLENDALE
California
March 31, 2012.
 
Operating Results for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2012
 
For the three months ended March 31, 2012, net income allocable to our common shareholders was $125.3 million or $0.73 per diluted common share, compared to $148.1 million or $0.87 per diluted common share for the same period in 2011, representing a decrease of $22.8 million or $0.14 per diluted common share.  This decrease is due to (i) a $30.1 million reduction in income allocated to common shareholders, in connection with applying EITF D-42 to our redemptions of preferred shares and our pro rata share of PS Business Parks, Inc.s (PSB) preferred equity redemptions and (ii) a $19.1 million decline in foreign currency exchange gain, offset partially by (iii) improved property operations.
 
Revenues for the Same Store Facilities (see table below) increased 4.8% or $17.4 million in the quarter ended March 31, 2012 as compared to the same period in 2011, primarily due to a 0.6% increase in average occupancy and a 4.1% increase in realized annual rent per occupied square foot.  Cost of operations for the Same Store Facilities increased by 1.9% or $2.4 million in the quarter ended March 31, 2012 as compared to the same period in 2011.  Net operating income for our Same Store Facilities increased 6.3% or $15.0 million in the quarter ended March 31, 2012 as compared to the same period in 2011.
 
Funds from Operations
 
For the three months ended March 31, 2012, funds from operations (FFO) was $1.35 per diluted common share as compared to $1.48 for the same period in 2011, representing a decrease of $0.13.
 
For the three months ended March 31, 2012, FFO was impacted by a foreign currency exchange gain of $12.2 million (compared to $31.3 million for the same period in 2011) and a $27.1 million charge in applying EITF D-42 to our and PSBs redemptions of preferred shares (compared to a $3.0 million gain for the same period in 2011).
 
The following table provides a summary of the per-share impact of the items noted above (unaudited):
 
 
 
 
FFO is a term defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts.  It is generally defined as net income before depreciation with respect to real estate assets and gains and losses on real estate assets.  FFO is presented because management and many analysts consider FFO to be one measure of the performance of real estate companies.  In addition, we believe that FFO is helpful to investors as an additional measure of the performance of a real estate investment trust (REIT), because net income includes the impact of depreciation, which assumes that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time, while we believe that the value of real estate fluctuates due to market conditions and in response to inflation.  FFO computations do not consider scheduled principal payments on debt, capital improvements, distributions and other obligations of the Company.  FFO is not a substitute for our cash flow or net income as a measure of our liquidity or operating performance or our ability to pay dividends.  Other REITs may not compute FFO in the same manner; accordingly, FFO may not be comparable among REITs. See the attached reconciliation of net income to funds from operations.

Property Operations  Same Store Facilities
 
The Same Store Facilities represent those facilities that are stabilized and owned since January 1, 2010 and therefore provide meaningful comparisons for 2011 and 2012.  The Same Store pool increased from 1,931 facilities at December 31, 2011 to 1,941 facilities at March 31, 2012. The following table summarizes the historical operating results of these 1,941 facilities (122.5 million net rentable square feet) that represent approximately 94% of the aggregate net rentable square feet of our U.S. consolidated self-storage portfolio at March 31, 2012.

Investing Activities
 
During the three months ended March 31, 2012, we completed the acquisition of six self-storage properties (532,000 net rentable square feet), located in California, Florida (two), Massachusetts, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, for approximately $42 million in cash.
 
In addition, during March 2012, we acquired the remaining interests we did not own in three consolidated partnerships for approximately $19.9 million in cash, plus the assumption of their share of existing debt totaling $4.8 million.

As of May 3, 2012, we were under contract, subject to contingencies, to acquire four additional self-storage facilities, two in California and one each in Florida and New York (316,000 aggregate net rentable square feet) for an aggregate of approximately $46 million in cash.
 
Capital Activities
 
On March 21, 2012, we entered into a new credit facility, which replaced our existing facility. This facility provides for borrowings up to $300 million and expires on March 21, 2017.  We have no borrowings against this facility at March 31, 2012 or as of May 3, 2012.
On January 12, 2012, we issued $460.0 million of our 5.90% Series S Preferred Shares and on March 13, 2012, we issued $462.5 million of our 5.75% Series T Preferred Shares. The net proceeds from these issuances were used, in part, to fund the redemptions of higher rate preferred securities, as follows:
 
 
 
 
 
In addition, we expect to redeem our 7.0% Series N Preferred Shares on July 2, 2012 for $172.5 million.  In connection with this redemption, we expect to incur approximately $5.4 million of EITF D-42 charges during the quarter ending June 30, 2012.
 
Distributions Declared
 
On May 3, 2012, our Board of Trustees declared a regular common quarterly dividend of $1.10 per common share. The Board also declared dividends with respect to our various series of preferred shares. All the dividends are payable on June 28, 2012 to shareholders of record as of June 13, 2012.
