News Release
 
 
,  Public Storage (NYSE:PSA) announced today operating results for the second quarter ended
GLENDALE
California
 
June 30, 2012.
 
Operating Results for the Three Months Ended June 30, 2012
 
For the three months ended June 30, 2012, net income allocable to our common shareholders was $132.3 million compared to $131.5 million for the same period in 2011.  Diluted earnings per common share was flat at $0.77 for each period, as improved property operations and reduced income allocations to our preferred shareholders were offset by a $34.2 million reduction in income caused by foreign currency exchange gains and losses incurred in translating the value of our Euro-denominated loan receivable from Shurgard Europe into a U.S. Dollar equivalent.
 
Revenues for the Same Store Facilities (see table below) increased 5.1% or $19.2 million in the quarter ended June 30, 2012 as compared to the same period in 2011, primarily due to higher realized annual rent per occupied square foot.  Cost of operations for the Same Store Facilities declined by 1.4% or $1.7 million in the quarter ended June 30, 2012 as compared to the same period in 2011.  Net operating income for our Same Store Facilities increased 8.3% or $20.9 million in the quarter ended June 30, 2012 as compared to the same period in 2011.  Net operating income for our non-Same Store facilities increased $4.9 million in the quarter ended June 30, 2012 as compared to the same period in 2011.
 
Operating Results for the Six Months Ended June 30, 2012
 
For the six months ended June 30, 2012, net income allocable to our common shareholders was $257.7 million or $1.50 per diluted common share, compared to $279.6 million or $1.64 per diluted common share for the same period in 2011, representing a decrease of $21.9 million or $0.14 per diluted common share.  This decrease is due to (i) a $53.2 million reduction in income caused by foreign currency exchange gains and losses incurred in translating the value of our Euro-denominated loan receivable from Shurgard Europe into a U.S. Dollar equivalent, (ii) a $31.0 million reduction in income allocated to common shareholders, in connection with applying EITF D-42 to preferred equity redemptions, offset partially by (iii) improved property operations and (iv) reduced income allocations to our preferred shareholders based upon distributions paid.
 
Revenues for the Same Store Facilities (see table below) increased 4.9% or $36.6 million in the six months ended June 30, 2012 as compared to the same period in 2011, primarily due to higher realized annual rent per occupied square foot.  Cost of operations for the Same Store Facilities increased by 0.3% or $0.7 million in the six months ended June 30, 2012 as compared to the same period in 2011.  Net operating income for our Same Store Facilities increased 7.3% or $35.9 million in the six months ended June 30, 2012 as compared to the same period in 2011.  Net operating income for our non-Same Store facilities increased $8.9 million in the six months ended June 30, 2012 as compared to the same period in 2011.
 
Funds from Operations
 
For the three months ended June 30, 2012, funds from operations (FFO) was $1.38 per diluted common share as compared to $1.39 for the same period in 2011, representing a decrease of $0.01.
 
For the three months ended June 30, 2012, FFO was impacted by a foreign currency exchange loss of $23.7 million (compared to a $10.5 million gain for the same period in 2011) and a $16.8 million charge in applying EITF D-42 due to redemptions of preferred securities (compared to a $15.9 million charge for the same period in 2011).
 
For the six months ended June 30, 2012, FFO was $2.73 per diluted common share as compared to $2.88 for the same period in 2011, representing a decrease of $0.15.

For the six months ended June 30, 2012, FFO was impacted by a foreign currency exchange loss of $11.5 million (compared to a $41.7 million gain for the same period in 2011) and a $43.9 million charge in applying EITF D-42 due to redemptions of preferred securities (compared to a $12.9 million charge for the same period in 2011).
 
 
Our FFO per share for the three and six months ended June 30, 2011 was also reduced $0.01 in each period as a result of costs associated with the acquisition of real estate facilities.
 
The following table provides a summary of the per-share impact of the items noted above (unaudited):
 
 
 
FFO is a term defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts.  It is generally defined as net income before depreciation with respect to real estate assets and gains and losses on real estate assets.  FFO is presented because management and many analysts consider FFO to be one measure of the performance of real estate companies.  In addition, we believe that FFO is helpful to investors as an additional measure of the performance of a real estate investment trust (REIT), because net income includes the impact of depreciation, which assumes that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time, while we believe that the value of real estate fluctuates due to market conditions and in response to inflation.  FFO computations do not consider scheduled principal payments on debt, capital improvements, distributions and other obligations of the Company.  FFO is not a substitute for our cash flow or net income as a measure of our liquidity or operating performance or our ability to pay dividends.  Other REITs may not compute FFO in the same manner; accordingly, FFO may not be comparable among REITs. See the attached reconciliation of net income to FFO.
