News Release
 
 
,  Public Storage (NYSE:PSA) announced today operating results for the third quarter ended
GLENDALE
California
September 30, 2012.
 
Operating Results for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2012
 
For the three months ended September 30, 2012, net income allocable to our common shareholders was $202.5 million or $1.18 per diluted common share compared to $118.0 million or $0.69 per diluted common share for the same period in 2011, representing an increase of $84.5 million or $0.49 per diluted common share.  This increase is due to (i) a $37.3 million increase resulting from foreign currency exchange gains and losses incurred in translating the value of our Euro-denominated loan receivable from Shurgard Europe into a U.S. Dollar equivalent, (ii) improved property operations (see below), and (iii) reduced allocations of income to our preferred shareholders due primarily to lower average coupon rates and lower average outstanding preferred shares.
 
Revenues for the Same Store Facilities (see table below) increased 4.8% or $18.8 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2012 as compared to the same period in 2011, primarily due to higher realized annual rent per occupied square foot.  Cost of operations for the Same Store Facilities decreased by 2.3% or $2.8 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2012 as compared to the same period in 2011 due primarily to lower repairs and maintenance and media advertising.  Net operating income for our Same Store Facilities increased 7.9% or $21.6 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2012 as compared to the same period in 2011.  Net operating income for our non-Same Store facilities increased $5.2 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2012 as compared to the same period in 2011.
 
Operating Results for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2012
 
For the nine months ended September 30, 2012, net income allocable to our common shareholders was $460.2 million or $2.68 per diluted common share, compared to $397.5 million or $2.33 per diluted common share for the same period in 2011, representing an increase of $62.7 million or $0.35 per diluted common share.  This increase is due to (i) improved property operations (see below) and (ii) a $16.7 million reduction in allocations of net income to preferred shareholders based upon distributions paid due to lower average coupon rates and lower average outstanding preferred shares, offset partially by (iii) a $27.8 million decrease in earnings due to the application of EITF D-42 to our and PSBs redemptions of preferred securities, and (iv) a $16.0 million decrease due to foreign currency exchange gains and losses in translating our Euro-denominated loan receivable from Shurgard Europe into U.S. Dollars.
 
Revenues for the Same Store Facilities (see table below) increased 4.9% or $55.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2012 as compared to the same period in 2011, primarily due to higher realized annual rent per occupied square foot.  Cost of operations for the Same Store Facilities decreased by 0.6% or $2.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2012 as compared to the same period in 2011 due primarily to lower media advertising.  Net operating income for our Same Store Facilities increased 7.5% or $57.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2012 as compared to the same period in 2011.  Net operating income for our non-Same Store facilities increased $14.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2012 as compared to the same period in 2011.
 
Funds from Operations
 
For the three months ended September 30, 2012, funds from operations (FFO) was $1.73 per diluted common share as compared to $1.29 for the same period in 2011, representing an increase of 34.1%.
 
For the three months ended September 30, 2012, FFO was impacted by a foreign currency exchange gain of $9.0 million (compared to a $28.3 million loss for the same period in 2011) and a $12.9 million charge in applying EITF D-42 due to redemptions of preferred securities, including our equity share of PSB (compared to a $16.2 million charge for the same period in 2011).

For the nine months ended September 30, 2012, FFO was $4.46 per diluted common share as compared to $4.17 for the same period in 2011, representing an increase of 7.0%.
 
For the nine months ended September 30, 2012, FFO was impacted by a foreign currency exchange loss of $2.5 million (compared to a $13.5 million gain for the same period in 2011) and a $56.9 million charge in applying EITF D-42 due to redemptions of preferred securities, including our equity share of PSB (compared to a $29.1 million net charge for the same period in 2011).
 
Our FFO was also impacted by impairment charges with respect to non-real estate assets, contingency accruals, our equity share of PSBs lease termination benefits, and costs associated with the acquisition of real estate facilities, which reduced FFO per diluted common share $0.02 in the nine months ended September 30, 2012, and $0.01 in each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011.
 
The following table provides a summary of the per-share impact of the items noted above (unaudited):
 
 
 
FFO is a term defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts.  It is generally defined as net income before depreciation, gains and losses, and impairment charges with respect to real estate assets.  FFO is presented because management and many analysts consider FFO to be one measure of the performance of real estate companies.  In addition, we believe that FFO is helpful to investors as an additional measure of the performance of a real estate investment trust (REIT), because net income includes the impact of depreciation, which assumes that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time, while we believe that the value of real estate fluctuates due to market conditions and in response to inflation.  FFO computations do not consider scheduled principal payments on debt, capital improvements, distributions and other obligations of the Company.  FFO is not a substitute for our cash flow or net income as a measure of our liquidity or operating performance or our ability to pay dividends.  Other REITs may not compute FFO in the same manner; accordingly, FFO may not be comparable among REITs. See the attached reconciliation of net income to FFO.
