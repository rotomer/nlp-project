Post-Spin-Off Agreements
On April 26, 2012, in connection with ConocoPhillips' previously announced spin-off of Phillips 66 through a pro rata distribution to ConocoPhillips shareholders of all of the outstanding shares of Phillips 66 common stock (the "Distribution"), Phillips 66 entered into several agreements with ConocoPhillips that govern the relationship of the parties following the Distribution, including the following:
 
 
 
 
 
 
A summary of certain material features of the agreements can be found in the section entitled "Certain Relationships and Related Transactions  Agreements with ConocoPhillips" in the Information Statement (the "Information Statement") included in Phillips 66's Registration Statement on Form 10, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 14, 2011, as amended, and declared effective on April 12, 2012 (the "Registration Statement"), and is incorporated herein by reference. The summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Separation and Distribution Agreement, Indemnification and Release Agreement, Intellectual Property Assignment and License Agreement, Tax Sharing Agreement, Employee Matters Agreement and Transition Services Agreement, included with this report as Exhibits 2.1, 10.1, 10.2, 10.3, 10.4 and 10.5, respectively, each of which is incorporated herein by reference. A copy of the press release issued by Phillips 66 on May 1, 2012 announcing that ConocoPhillips had completed its spin-off of Phillips 66 is included with this report as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
Receivables Facility
On April 27, 2012, Phillips 66 and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a $1.2 billion accounts receivable securitization facility (the "A/R Facility") to provide additional liquidity and funding for the ongoing business needs of Phillips 66 and its subsidiaries.
The documentation for the A/R Facility includes (i) a Receivables Purchase Agreement (the "Receivables Purchase Agreement") among Phillips 66 Company, a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Phillips 66 (the "Originator"), Phillips 66 Receivables Funding LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a bankruptcy-remote special purpose entity that is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Originator ("SPE"), Royal Bank of Canada, as administrative agent, structuring agent and a facility agent, certain other facility agents, and committed purchasers and conduit purchasers that are parties thereto from time to time (the "Purchasers") and (ii) a Purchase and Contribution Agreement (the "Receivables Sale Agreement") by and between the Originator and the SPE (collectively, the "Agreements").
 
Pursuant to the Receivables Sale Agreement, the Originator has sold and contributed, and will continue to sell or contribute, its trade receivables, together with all related security and interests in the proceeds thereof, to the SPE in exchange for a combination of cash, equity or a subordinated note issued by the SPE to the Originator. Pursuant to the Receivables Purchase Agreement, the SPE may, from time to time, in turn sell undivided interests in such trade receivables, together with all related security and interests in the proceeds thereof, to the Purchasers in exchange for cash proceeds. Collections on the trade receivables for which an undivided interest is sold to the Purchasers will be set aside and held in trust to satisfy the obligations of the SPE under the A/R Facility.
The Originator and the SPE provide customary representations and covenants under the Agreements. Receivables in the A/R Facility are subject to customary criteria, limits and reserves. The Receivables Purchase Agreement provides for certain Termination Events, as defined therein, upon the occurrence of which the Purchasers may terminate further purchases of undivided interests in the trade receivables and impose default fees. The SPE pays Yield (as defined in the Receivables Purchase Agreement) with respect to amounts advanced under the A/R Facility. The calculation of Yield will vary based on the funding alternatives chosen. In addition, the A/R Facility also provides for the issuance of letters of credit.
The amount of credit exposure of the Purchasers outstanding at any one time under the Receivables Purchase Agreement is limited to $1.2 billion. As of April 30, 2012, there were no trade receivable purchases or letters of credit outstanding under the A/R Facility.
The Originator serves as the servicer of the trade receivables under the A/R Facility. Neither the Originator nor the SPE guarantees collectability of the trade receivables or the creditworthiness of obligors thereunder. However, Phillips 66 has provided a guaranty of performance in respect of the obligations of the Originator as originator under the Receivables Sale Agreement and of the obligations of Originator as servicer under the Receivables Purchase Agreement.
Copies of the Receivables Purchase Agreement and Receivables Sale Agreement are included with this report as Exhibits 10.6 and Exhibit 10.7, respectively. The foregoing description of the A/R Facility does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Receivables Purchase Agreement and the Receivables Sale Agreement, which are incorporated herein by reference.
Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC
On May 1, 2012, Phillips 66 and Chevron Corporation entered into the Third Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC ("CPChem") in order to facilitate the substitution of Phillips 66 Company as a member of CPChem in lieu of ConocoPhillips Company.
 
The information included under "Post-Spin-Off Agreements" in Item 1.01 of this report on Form 8-K is incorporated herein by reference. On April 27, 2012, in connection with certain internal restructuring steps implemented in contemplation of the Distribution, ConocoPhillips contributed to Phillips 66 all of the outstanding common stock of Phillips 66 Company, which, directly and through its subsidiaries, holds ownership interests in those entities and assets through which the businesses of Phillips 66 are conducted. In exchange for the shares of Phillips 66 Company common stock, Phillips 66 issued shares of its common stock to ConocoPhillips, assumed certain liabilities from ConocoPhillips and made a special cash distribution of approximately $5.95 billion to ConocoPhillips on April 30, 2012 (which may be adjusted based on actual levels of Phillips 66 cash, inventory and working capital as of April 30, 2012).
 
The information included under "Receivables Facility" in Item 1.01 of this report on Form 8-K is incorporated herein by reference.
 
Effective as of April 30, 2012, Phillips 66 amended and restated its Certificate of Incorporation (the "Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation") and its By-Laws (the "Amended and Restated By-Laws").

The description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and the Amended and Restated By-Laws, included with this report as Exhibits 3.1 and 3.2, respectively, each of which is incorporated herein by reference.

(b) The affirmative vote of shares representing not less than 80% of the votes entitled to be cast by the Voting Stock shall be required to alter, amend or adopt any provision inconsistent with or repeal paragraph (C)(4)(b) of this Article FOURTH, Article FIFTH, Article SEVENTH or Article EIGHTH or any provision of this paragraph (C)(2)(b), and the affirmative vote of shares representing not less than 80% of the votes entitled to be cast by the Voting Stock, acting on the unanimous recommendation of the entire Board of Directors, shall be required to alter, amend or adopt any provision inconsistent with or repeal Article FIRST.

For purposes of this paragraph (C)(3), the voluntary sale, conveyance, lease, exchange or transfer (for cash, shares of stock, securities or other consideration) of all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation or a consolidation or merger of the Corporation with one or more other corporations or other entities (whether or not the Corporation is the corporation surviving such consolidation or merger) shall not be deemed to be a liquidation, dissolution or winding up, voluntary or involuntary.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, whenever holders of outstanding shares of one or more series of Preferred Stock are entitled to elect directors of the Corporation pursuant to the provisions applicable in the case of arrearages in the payment of dividends or other defaults contained in the resolution or resolutions of the Board of Directors providing for the establishment of any such series, any such director of the Corporation so elected may be removed in accordance with the provisions of such resolution or resolutions.

EIGHTH: To the fullest extent that the DGCL or any other law of the State of Delaware as it exists or as it may hereafter be amended permits the limitation or elimination of the liability of directors, no director of the Corporation shall be liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director. No amendment to or repeal of this Article EIGHTH shall apply to or have any effect on the liability or alleged liability of any director of the Corporation for or with respect to any acts or omissions of such director occurring prior to such amendment or repeal.
NINTH: The Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Corporation, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director or officer of the Corporation to the Corporation or the Corporation's stockholders, creditors or other constituents, (iii) any action asserting a claim against the Corporation or any director or officer of the Corporation arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law or the Corporation's Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws (as either may be amended from time to time), or (iv) any action asserting a claim against the Corporation or any director or officer of the Corporation governed by the internal affairs doctrine; provided, that, if and only if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware dismisses any such action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, such action may be brought in another court sitting in the State of Delaware.

The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the Indemnified Person did not act in good faith and in a manner which such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that such person's conduct was unlawful.

Power to Indemnify in Actions, Suits or Proceedings by or in the Right of the Corporation
Section 3. . Any indemnification under this Article VIII (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the director or officer is proper in the circumstances because such claimant has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 1 or Section 2 of this Article VIII, as the case may be. Such determination shall be made, with respect to a claimant who is a director or officer at the time of such determination, (1) if requested by the claimant, by Independent Counsel (as hereinafter defined), or (2) if no request is made by the claimant for a determination by Independent Counsel, (i) by the Board of Directors by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of Disinterested Directors (as hereinafter defined), or (ii) if a quorum of the Board of Directors consisting of Disinterested Directors is not obtainable or, even if obtainable, such quorum of Disinterested Directors so directs, by Independent Counsel in a written opinion to the Board of Directors, a copy of which shall be delivered to the claimant, or (iii) if a quorum of Disinterested Directors so directs, by the stockholders of the Corporation. In the event the determination of entitlement to indemnification is to be made by Independent Counsel at the request of the claimant, the Independent Counsel shall be selected by the Board of Directors unless there shall have occurred within two years prior to the date of the commencement of the action, suit or proceeding for which indemnification is claimed a Change of Control as defined in the Corporation's Stock Option Program dated as of February 14, 2008, in which case the Independent Counsel shall be selected by the claimant unless the claimant shall request that such selection be made by the Board of Directors. To the extent, however, that a present or former director or officer of the Corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding described above, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, such person shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection therewith, without the necessity of authorization in the specific case.
Authorization of Indemnification
 
Section 4. . For purposes of any determination under Section 3 of this Article VIII, a person shall be deemed to have acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, or, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, to have had no reasonable cause to believe such person's conduct was unlawful, if such person's action is based on good faith reliance on the records or books of account of the Corporation or another enterprise, or on information supplied to such person by the officers of the Corporation or another enterprise in the course of their duties, or on the advice of legal counsel for the Corporation or another enterprise or on information or records given or reports made to the Corporation or another enterprise by an independent certified public accountant or by an appraiser or other expert selected with reasonable care by the Corporation or another enterprise. The term "another enterprise" as used in this Section 4 shall mean any other corporation or any partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise of which such person is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent.

Good Faith Defined
Section 5. . Notwithstanding any contrary determination in the specific case under Section 3 of this Article VIII, and notwithstanding the absence of any determination thereunder, any Indemnified Person may apply to the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware for indemnification to the extent otherwise permissible under Sections 1 and 2 of this Article VIII. The basis of such indemnification by a court shall be a determination by such court that indemnification of the Indemnified Person is proper in the circumstances because such person has met the applicable standards of conduct set forth in Section 1 or 2 of this Article VIII, as the case may be. Neither a contrary determination in the specific case under Section 3 of this Article VIII nor the absence of any determination thereunder shall be a defense to such application or create a presumption that Indemnified Person seeking indemnification has not met any applicable standard of conduct. Notice of any application for indemnification pursuant to this Section 5 shall be given to the Corporation promptly upon the filing of such application. If successful, in whole or in part, the Indemnified Person seeking indemnification shall also be entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting such application.

Section 7.. The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by or granted pursuant to this Article VIII shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under the Certificate of Incorporation, any By-Law,

The provisions of this Article VIII shall not be deemed to preclude the indemnification of any person who is not specified in Section 1 or 2 of this Article VIII but whom the Corporation has the power or obligation to indemnify under the provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or otherwise.
Section 8. . The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any Indemnified Person against any liability asserted against such person and incurred by such person by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of the Corporation or is or was a director, officer or employee of the Corporation serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, or arising out of such person's status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power or the obligation to indemnify such person against such liability under the provisions of this Article VIII.
Insurance
Section 9. . For purposes of this Article VIII, references to "the Corporation" shall include, in addition to the resulting corporation, any constituent corporation (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if its separate existence had continued, would have had power and authority to indemnify its directors or officers, so that any person who is or was a director or officer of such constituent corporation, or is or was a director or officer of such constituent corporation serving at the request of such constituent corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, shall stand in the same position under the provisions of this Article VIII with respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as such person would have with respect to such constituent corporation if its separate existence had continued.

For purposes of this Article VIII, references to "Independent Counsel" shall mean a law firm, a member of a law firm, or an independent practitioner, that is experienced in matters of corporation law and shall include any person who, under the applicable standards of professional conduct then prevailing, would not have a conflict of interest in representing either the Corporation or the claimant in an action to determine the claimant's rights under this By-Law. For purposes of this Article VIII, "Disinterested Director" shall mean a director of the Corporation who is not and was not a party to the matter in respect of which indemnification is sought by the claimant.

Indemnifying Party's own expense and by such Indemnifying Party's own counsel, any Third-Party Claim. Within thirty (30) days after the receipt of notice from an Indemnitee in accordance with Section 2.5(a) (or sooner, if the nature of such Third-Party Claim so requires), the Indemnifying Party shall notify the Indemnitee of its election whether the Indemnifying Party will assume responsibility for defending such Third-Party Claim, which election shall specify any reservations or exceptions. After notice from an Indemnifying Party to an Indemnitee of its election to assume the defense of a Third-Party Claim, such Indemnitee shall have the right to employ separate counsel and to participate in (but not control) the defense, compromise, or settlement thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be the expense of such Indemnitee except as set forth in the next sentence.
(c) In the event that the Indemnifying Party has elected to assume the defense of the Third-Party Claim but has specified, and continues to assert, any reservations or exceptions in such notice, then, in any such case, the reasonable fees and expenses of one separate counsel for all Indemnitees shall be the expense of such Indemnitees, but shall be reimbursed by the Indemnifying Party.
In the event that the Indemnifying Party has elected to assume the defense of the Third Party Claim but has specified, and continues to assert, any reservations or exceptions in such notice, then the Indemnitee must consent to any settlement or compromise.
(d) Notwithstanding an election by an Indemnifying Party to defend a Third-Party Claim pursuant to Section 2.5(b), the Indemnitee may, upon notice to the Indemnifying Party, elect to take over the defense of such Third-Party Claim if (i) in its exercise of reasonable business judgment, the Indemnitee determines that the Indemnifying Party is not defending such Third-Party Claim competently or in good faith, (ii) the Credit Rating of the Indemnifying Party is or falls below Investment Grade as determined by at least two Rating Agencies, (iii) the Indemnitee determines in its exercise of reasonable business judgment that there exists a compelling business reason for such Indemnitee to defend such Third-Party Claim (other than as contemplated by the foregoing clause (i)), (iv) the Indemnifying Party makes a general assignment for the benefit of creditors, has filed against it or files a petition in bankruptcy or insolvency or is declared bankrupt or insolvent or declares that it is bankrupt or insolvent, or (v) there occurs a change of control of the Indemnifying Party.
(e) If an Indemnifying Party elects not to assume responsibility for defending a Third-Party Claim, or fails to notify an Indemnitee of its election as provided in Section 2.5(b), or if an Indemnitee takes over the defense of a Third-Party Claim as provided in Section 2.5(d)(i), the Indemnifying Party shall bear the costs and expenses of the Indemnitee incurred in defending such Third-Party Claim. If the Indemnitee takes over the defense of a Third-Party Claim as provided in Section 2.5(d)(ii)-(v), the Indemnifying Party shall bear all of the Indemnitee's reasonable costs and expenses incurred in defending such Third-Party Claim.
(f) If, pursuant to Section 2.5(d) or for any other reason, the Indemnifying Party is not defending a Third-Party Claim for which indemnification is provided under this Agreement, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right, at its own expense, to monitor reasonably the defense of such Third-Party Claim; , that such monitoring activity shall not interfere in any material respect with the conduct of such defense.

(g) If an Indemnifying Party has failed to assume the defense of the Third-Party Claim in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or an Indemnitee takes over the defense of a Third-Party Claim as provided in Section 2.5(d)(i), an Indemnitee may settle or compromise the Third-Party Claim without the consent of the Indemnifying Party. If an Indemnitee takes over the defense of a Third-Party Claim as provided in Section 2.5(d)(ii)-(v), such Indemnitee may not settle or compromise any Third-Party Claim without the consent of the Indemnifying Party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
(h) In the case of a Third-Party Claim, no Indemnifying Party shall consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement of the Third-Party Claim without the consent of the Indemnitee if the effect thereof is to permit any injunction, declaratory judgment or other non-monetary relief to be entered, directly or indirectly against any Indemnitee. For the avoidance of doubt, the consent of any Indemnitee pursuant to this Section 2.5(h) shall be required only with respect to non-monetary relief.
(i) Phillips 66 shall prepare and circulate a legal hold order ("") covering relevant categories of documents as promptly as practical following receipt of any notice pursuant to Section 2.5(a) and shall promptly notify ConocoPhillips after such LHO has been circulated. ConocoPhillips shall prepare and circulate a LHO covering documents in the possession, custody or control of the ConocoPhillips Group with respect to any Action so notified to Phillips 66.

(j) The provisions of this Section 2.5 (other than this Section 2.5(j)) and the provisions of Section 2.6 shall not apply to Taxes (Taxes being governed by the Tax Sharing Agreement).
(k) All Assumed Actions have been tendered by ConocoPhillips to Phillips 66 and are deemed to be formally accepted by Phillips 66 upon the execution of this Agreement.
(l) An Indemnifying Party shall provide the Indemnitee with a monthly written report identifying any Third Party Claims which such Indemnifying Party has elected to defend pursuant to Section 2.5(b) or, in the case of Phillips 66, which are identified on Schedule 1.1. In addition, the Indemnifying Party shall establish a procedure reasonably acceptable to the Indemnitee to automatically send electronic notice from the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnitee through the litigation management system or any successor system when any such Third Party Claim is closed, regardless of whether such Third Party Claim was decided by settlement, verdict, dismissal or was otherwise disposed of.
2.6. .
Additional Matters
(a) Indemnification payments in respect of any Liabilities for which an Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification under this Article II shall be paid by the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnitee as such Liabilities are incurred upon demand by the Indemnitee, including reasonably satisfactory documentation setting forth the basis for the amount of such indemnification payment, including documentation with respect to calculations made and consideration of any Insurance Proceeds that actually reduce the amount of such Liabilities. THE INDEMNITY AGREEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS ARTICLE II SHALL REMAIN
 
OPERATIVE AND IN FULL FORCE AND EFFECT, REGARDLESS OF (I) ANY INVESTIGATION MADE BY OR ON BEHALF OF ANY INDEMNITEE, (II) THE KNOWLEDGE BY THE INDEMNITEE OF LIABILITIES FOR WHICH IT MIGHT BE ENTITLED TO INDEMNIFICATION HEREUNDER AND (III) ANY TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT.
(b) Any claim on account of a Liability that does not result from a Third-Party Claim shall be asserted by written notice given by the Indemnitee to the related Indemnifying Party. Such Indemnifying Party shall have a period of thirty (30) days after the receipt of such notice within which to respond thereto. If such Indemnifying Party does not respond within such thirty (30)-day period, such Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have refused to accept responsibility to make payment. If such Indemnifying Party does not respond within such thirty (30)-day period or rejects such claim in whole or in part, such Indemnitee shall be free to pursue such remedies as may be available to such party as contemplated by this Agreement and the other Ancillary Agreements.
(c) In the event of payment by or on behalf of any Indemnifying Party to any Indemnitee in connection with any Third-Party Claim, such Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated to and shall stand in the place of such Indemnitee as to any events or circumstances in respect of which such Indemnitee may have any right, defense or claim relating to such Third-Party Claim against any claimant or plaintiff asserting such Third-Party Claim or against any other Person. Such Indemnitee shall cooperate with such Indemnifying Party in a reasonable manner, and at the cost and expense of such Indemnifying Party, in prosecuting any subrogated right, defense or claim.
(d) In the event of an Action for which indemnification is sought pursuant to Section 2.2 or 2.3 and in which the Indemnifying Party is not a named defendant, if either the Indemnitee or Indemnifying Party shall so request, the parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to substitute the Indemnifying Party for the named defendant.
(e) In the event that Phillips 66 or ConocoPhillips shall establish a risk accrual in an amount of at least $25 million with respect to any Third-Party Claim for which such party has indemnified the other party pursuant to Section 2.2 or 2.3, as applicable, it shall notify the other party of the existence and amount of such risk accrual (, when the accrual is recorded in the financial statements as an accrual for a potential liability), subject to the parties entering into an appropriate agreement with respect to the confidentiality and/or privilege thereof.
i.e.
(f) Any Applicable Toxic Tort Claim for which, at the time notice is required under Section 2.5(a), ConocoPhillips cannot reasonably determine whether such Applicable Toxic Tort Claim primarily relates to the Phillips 66 Business shall be presumed to fall within Phillips 66's indemnification obligation in Section 2.2(d). If pursuant to Section 2.5(a) an Applicable Toxic Tort Claim is notified to Phillips 66, and thereafter it is determined that Section 2.2 does not provide any indemnification therefor, ConocoPhillips shall pay to Phillips 66 $5,000 to cover Phillips 66's direct and indirect expenses promptly following the re-tender of such Applicable Toxic Tort Claim to ConocoPhillips and its acceptance thereof.
 
(g) Phillips 66 shall provide ConocoPhillips or a Third Party designated by ConocoPhillips with all information necessary for the members of the ConocoPhillips Group to comply with their obligations under Section 111 of the Medicare, Medicaid and SCHIP Extension Act (or any successor thereto) ("") with respect to the settlement or other disposition of any Action by or on behalf of any member of the Phillips 66 Group. If Phillips 66 fails to do so promptly and/or provides materially incorrect information, then Phillips 66 shall indemnify ConocoPhillips pursuant to Section 2.2 for any fines, penalties and/or costs arising from any such Phillips 66 failure or action. Phillips 66 shall bear all costs associated with satisfying such Medicare Reporting Obligations (including but not limited to settlements or releases of personal injury claims from a Medicare beneficiary on behalf of ConocoPhillips), including ConocoPhillips' costs if ConocoPhillips elects to effect reporting, or reasonable third-party costs if ConocoPhillips outsources such reporting. ConocoPhillips agrees that it shall not use a Third Party for such purpose unless such Third Party indemnifies both ConocoPhillips and Phillips 66 on commercially reasonable terms for any wrongful reporting. Phillips 66 shall provide ConocoPhillips with a monthly written report identifying all Actions that are subject to Medicare Reporting Obligations on the part of any member of the ConocoPhillips Group and that have been settled or otherwise disposed of by or on behalf of any member of the Phillips 66 Group. In addition, Phillips 66 shall establish a procedure reasonably acceptable to ConocoPhillips to automatically send electronic notice from Phillips 66 to ConocoPhillips through the litigation management system or any successor system when any such Action is closed, regardless of whether such Action was decided by settlement, verdict, dismissal or was otherwise disposed of.

(b) On or prior to the Distribution Date, to the extent required to obtain a release from a guarantee, letter of credit or other obligation of any member of the ConocoPhillips Group, Phillips 66 shall execute a substitute document in the form of any such existing guarantee or letter of credit, as applicable, or such other form as is agreed to by the relevant parties to such guarantee agreement, letter of credit or other obligation, except to the extent that such existing
 
guarantee contains representations, covenants or other terms or provisions either (i) with which Phillips 66 would be reasonably unable to comply or (ii) which would be reasonably expected to be breached.
(c) If the parties are unable to obtain, or to cause to be obtained, any such required removal as set forth in clauses (a) and (b) of this Section 2.9, (i) Phillips 66 shall, and shall cause the other members of the Phillips 66 Group to, indemnify, defend and hold harmless each of the ConocoPhillips Indemnitees for any Liability arising from or relating to such guarantee, letter of credit or other obligation, as applicable, and shall, as agent or subcontractor for the applicable ConocoPhillips Group guarantor or obligor, pay, perform and discharge fully all of the obligations or other Liabilities of such guarantor or obligor thereunder, and (ii) Phillips 66 shall not, and shall cause the other members of the Phillips 66 Group not to, agree to renew or extend the term of, increase any obligations under, or transfer to a third Person, any loan, guarantee, , letter of credit, lease, contract or other obligation for which a member of the ConocoPhillips Group is or may be liable unless all obligations of the members of the ConocoPhillips Group with respect thereto are thereupon terminated by documentation satisfactory in form and substance to ConocoPhillips in its sole and absolute discretion.

No Impact on Third Parties

No Cross-Claims or Third-Party Claims
2.12. . If any indemnification provided for in this Article II is determined by a Delaware federal or state court to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the liability shall be apportioned between the Indemnitee and the Indemnifying Party as determined in a separate proceeding in accordance with Article IV.

(c) From and after the Distribution Date, except with respect to the insurance matters identified on Schedule 3.1(c), whose treatment shall be as set forth on such Schedule, with respect to any losses, damages and liabilities incurred by any member of the Phillips 66 Group prior to or in respect of the period prior to the Distribution Date, ConocoPhillips will provide Phillips 66 with access to, and Phillips 66 may, upon 10 days' prior written notice to ConocoPhillips, make claims under, ConocoPhillips' third-party insurance policies in place at the time of the Distribution and ConocoPhillips' historical policies of insurance, but solely to the extent that such policies provided coverage for the Phillips 66 Group prior to the Distribution; , that such access to, and the right to make claims under such insurance policies, shall be subject to the terms and conditions of such insurance policies, including any limits on coverage or scope, any deductibles and other fees and expenses, and shall be subject to the following additional conditions:

To the extent that the ConocoPhillips Group or the Phillips 66 Group is allocated more than its portion of such premium due to the timing of losses submitted to ConocoPhillips' insurance carrier(s), the other party shall promptly pay the first party an amount so that each Group has been properly allocated its portion of the reinstatement premium. ConocoPhillips and Phillips 66 can mutually agree not to reinstate the policy aggregate and each Group then will bear all of its own future costs.

(b) Without waiving its rights to any remedy under this Agreement and without first complying with the provisions of Sections 4.2 and 4.3, either party may seek any interim or provisional relief that is necessary to protect the rights or property of that party either (i) before any Delaware federal or state court, (ii) before a special arbitrator, as provided for under the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules, or (iii) before the arbitral tribunal established hereunder.
(c) Unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing, any Dispute to be decided in arbitration hereunder will be decided (i) before a sole arbitrator if the amount in dispute, inclusive of all claims and counterclaims, totals less than $3 million; or (ii) by an arbitral tribunal of three (3) arbitrators if (A) the amount in dispute, inclusive of all claims and counterclaims, is equal to or greater than $3 million, or (B) either party elects in writing to have such dispute decided by three (3) arbitrators when one of the parties believes, in its sole judgment, the issue could have significant precedential value; however, the party who makes that request shall solely bear the increased costs and expenses associated with a panel of three (3) arbitrators (, the additional costs and expenses associated with the two (2) additional arbitrators).
i.e.

If the arbitration will be before a sole independent arbitrator, then the sole independent arbitrator will be appointed by agreement of the parties within fifteen (15) days upon written demand of either party. If the parties cannot agree to a sole independent arbitrator, then upon written application by either party, the sole independent arbitrator will be appointed pursuant to AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules.
(e) The place of arbitration shall be Houston, Texas.

It is understood and agreed that the Service Provider is not a professional provider of the types of services included in the Services and that the Service Provider personnel performing Services have other responsibilities and will not be dedicated full-time to performing Services hereunder.
(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no Service Provider shall be required to perform Services hereunder or take any actions relating thereto that conflict with or violate any applicable law, contract, license, authorization, certification or permit or the Service Provider's governance policies, as they may be amended from time to time. Without limiting the above, the provision of the Services may require consents, waivers, or approvals from certain third parties under permits, licenses and agreements to which the Service Provider, the Service Recipient or one of their respective Affiliates is a party (a "") to enable the Service Provider to provide the Services. The Parties shall promptly notify each other, providing reasonable detail of any specific impairment in the ability to provide any Services by reason of the limitations described in this Section2.7(b). The Parties will use commercially reasonable efforts to develop a resolution that enables the Service Provider to continue the provision of the Services, including obtaining any required consents, waivers or approvals under a Third Party License, with the costs of obtaining such consents, waivers or approvals being the responsibility of the Service Recipient. If no commercially reasonable resolution is available within sixty (60) calendar days of notice of such impairment, either Party may immediately terminate the affected Service by providing written notice to the other Party. To the extent permitted by any applicable contracts of the Service Recipient, the Service Recipient hereby grants to the Service Provider a limited, nontransferable license, without the right to sublicense (except to an Affiliate of the Service Provider or a Third Party Provider who is providing Services on the Service Provider's behalf, solely to the extent necessary for such Affiliate or Third Party Provider to provide the Services), for the term of this Agreement, to use the intellectual property owned by the Service Recipient solely to the extent necessary for the Service Provider to perform its obligations hereunder.

The foregoing sets forth the sole and exclusive remedy of the Service Recipient with respect to any failure of the Service Provider to
 
meet the warranty and the Service Provider's liabilities under this Section 2.7(c) are subject to the liability cap set forth in Section 2.7(h); , that in the event the Service Provider defaults in the manner described in clause (ii) of Section 7.1, the Service Recipient shall have the further rights set forth in Article VII.

(e) The Parties recognize that some of the Services are being provided by the Service Provider in conjunction with the Employees of the Service Recipient and other members of the Service Recipient Group. To the extent that such Employees are not made available to provide the Services in conjunction with the Service Provider, then the Service Provider shall be relieved of its obligations to provide such Services to the extent that such services were dependent on the availability of such Employees.
(f) It is the intent of the Service Provider to plan and staff such that the Service Provider can completely fulfill the needs of the Service Recipient as well as the Service Provider's own needs, and the Service Provider does not anticipate the need for any rationing or limitation of Services. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Service Recipient acknowledges and agrees that the Service Provider shall have the right to establish reasonable priorities between the needs of the Service Provider, on the one hand, and the needs of the Service Recipient, on the other hand, as to the provision of any Service if the Service Provider determines that such priorities are necessary to avoid any adverse affect on the Service Provider. If any such priorities are established, the Service Provider shall advise the Service Recipient as soon as possible of any Service that will be materially delayed as a result of such prioritization, and will use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize the duration and impact of such delays.

(b) Upon a Change in Control of the Service Recipient or in the event the Service Recipient becomes a competitor of the Service Provider or a member of the Service Provider Group or becomes affiliated with a competitor of the Service Provider or of a member of the Service Provider Group, the Service Provider shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to terminate this Agreement or any or all of the applicable Services being provided under this Agreement upon thirty (30) calendar days' prior written notice. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Change in Control" shall have the meaning ascribed to such term in the 2011 Omnibus Stock and Performance Incentive Plan of ConocoPhillips, as such plan exists as of the date hereof and with the term "Company" as used in such definition to mean either ConocoPhillips or Phillips 66 as applicable.
6.2. . Upon the discontinuation or termination of a Service hereunder, this Agreement shall be of no further force and effect with respect to such Service, except as otherwise provided in the Schedule for the specific Service and except as to obligations accrued prior to the date of discontinuation or termination; , that Articles I, IV, VIII, IX and XI and Sections 2.7(g) and 2.7(h) of this Agreement shall survive such discontinuation or termination. Each Party shall, within sixty (60) calendar days after discontinuation or termination of a Service, deliver to the other Party originals of all books, records, contracts, receipts for deposits and all other papers or documents in its Group's possession which pertain exclusively to the business of the other Group and relate to such Service; that a Party may retain copies of material provided to the other Party pursuant to this Section 6.2 as it deems necessary or appropriate in connection with its financial reporting obligations or internal control practices and policies.
Procedures Upon Discontinuation or Termination of Services
provided,
however
provided
6.3. . It is the express intent of the Parties and the members of their respective Groups that, notwithstanding the terms or schedules for performance of the Services provided or referenced in this Agreement, including in Article V and in the Schedules, the performance of Services pursuant to this Agreement be terminated as soon as possible. Consequently, each Service Recipient agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to reduce or eliminate its dependency on each Service as soon as reasonably practicable. Each Party agrees, on its behalf and on behalf of the other members of its Group, to facilitate the smooth transition of the Services from being performed by the Service Provider to being performed by the Service Recipient for itself.
Transition From Services
 
7.1. . In the event (i) of a failure of the Service Recipient to pay for Services in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, or (ii) any Party or member of its Group shall default, in any material respect, in the due performance or observance by it of any of the other terms, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement, then the non-defaulting Party shall have the right, at its sole discretion, to terminate the Service with respect to which the default occurred; that the defaulting Party shall have the right to cure or cause the cure of such default within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt of the written notice of such default and thereby avoid the termination. The Service Recipient's right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Article VII and the rights set forth in Section 2.7 shall constitute the Service Recipient's sole and exclusive rights and remedies for a breach by the Service Provider hereunder (including any breach caused by an Affiliate of the Service Provider or a Third Party Provider).
Termination for Default

Therefore, each of the Parties agrees to maintain all information of or regarding the other Group as confidential and not to use any such information for any purpose other than the performance of Services hereunder and/or necessary communications and cooperation between the Groups in connection with the Distribution. Each Party shall cause the members of its Group to become familiar with these requirements and shall cause such other members to comply with the requirements hereof. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth above, the obligation of confidentiality shall not apply to any information which comes into the authorized possession of a Party (which, for purposes of this Article 9, shall include the Party
Confidentiality
 
itself and any member of its Group) from a source other than the other Party or which becomes part of the public domain other than due to breach of this Agreement by the Party. If a Party is required by audit requirements, legal process or other lawful order to disclose information considered confidential hereunder, such Party shall give the other Party prompt notice of such requirement in order to allow the other Party to seek elimination of such order or to seek protection of such information, but the Party receiving such process or order shall be permitted to comply with such process or order.
9.2. .

(c) If, at any time, the Accessing Party determines that any of its personnel has sought to circumvent, or has circumvented, the Security Regulations, that any unauthorized Accessing Party personnel has accessed the Systems, or that any of its personnel has engaged in activities that may lead to the unauthorized access, use, destruction, alteration or loss of data, information or software of the other Party, the Accessing Party shall promptly terminate any such person's access to the Systems and immediately notify the other Party. In addition, such
 
other Party shall have the right to deny personnel of the Accessing Party access to its Systems upon notice to the Accessing Party. The Accessing Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with the other Party in investigating any apparent unauthorized access to such other Party's Systems.
10.1. . Continued performance of a Service, except for any obligation to pay amounts due, may be suspended immediately to the extent the fulfillment of such Service is prevented, frustrated, hindered or delayed by any event or condition beyond the reasonable control of the Person suspending such performance (and not involving any willful misconduct of such Person), including acts of God, pandemics, floods, fire, earthquakes, labor or trade disturbances, strikes, war, acts of terrorism, civil commotion, electrical shortages or blackouts, breakdown or injury to computing facilities, compliance in good faith with any Law (whether or not it later proves to be invalid), unavailability of materials or bad weather (a ""). Unless the Service Provider Group incurs costs under agreements with its Third Party Providers, the Service Recipient shall not be obligated to pay any amount for Services that it does not receive as a result of a Force Majeure Event (and the Parties shall negotiate reasonably to determine the amount applicable to such Services not received). In addition to the reduction of any amounts owed by the Service Recipient hereunder, during the occurrence of a Force Majeure Event, to the extent the provision of any Service has been disrupted or reduced, during such disruption or reduction, (a) the Service Recipient may replace any such affected Service by, at its own cost, providing any such Service for itself or engaging one or more third parties to provide such Service at the expense of the Service Recipient and (b) the Service Provider shall cooperate with, provide such information to and take such other actions as may be reasonably required to assist such third parties to provide such substitute Service.

Any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the Party to be bound thereby. No failure or delay on the part of either Party in the exercise of any right hereunder shall impair such right or be construed to be a waiver of, or acquiescence in, any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right preclude other or further exercise thereof or of any other right.
Amendment; Waivers
11.4. .

(iii) if and to the extent any Purchaser or LC Bank shall be required for any reason to pay over to an Obligor any amount received on its behalf hereunder, such amount shall be deemed not to have been so received but rather to have been retained by the Seller and, accordingly, such Purchaser or LC Bank, as applicable, shall have a claim against the Seller for such amount, payable when and to the extent that any distribution from or on behalf of such Obligor is made in respect thereof.

(f) Notwithstanding that Reinvestment Purchases are only made on Business Days pursuant to Section 2.05 and that Collections are only allocated and applied by the Servicer pursuant to this Section 2.08 on Business Days, the Seller and the Servicer agree that at all times Collections held by the Servicer or the Seller or in any Lockbox, Lockbox Account or Depositary Account shall be deemed to be held in trust for the benefit of the Facility Agents (for the benefit of their respective Purchasers and LC Banks) and the Seller (if held by the Servicer or in any Lockbox, Lockbox Account or Depositary Account), to the extent of their respective interests therein.

On the second Business Day (first Business Day, if a Downgrade Event exists and is continuing) after the date of such notification, the Seller shall pay the Mandatory Reduction Amount to the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall distribute such funds (i) first, to each LC Bank owed any Reimbursement Obligations(s) (for further distribution to each Facility Agent whose Purchasers funded

Participation Advances to such LC Bank), its pro rata share (based on such LC Banks' Reimbursement Obligation(s) as a percentage of the aggregate amount of Reimbursement Obligations owed to LC Banks) of such Mandatory Reduction Amount (but in no event in excess of the Reimbursement Obligations(s) owed to each such LC Bank), (ii) second, to pay to each Facility Agent, its Purchase Group's Purchase Group Percentage of any remaining Mandatory Reduction Amount to repay all or a portion of the related Purchase Group's Net Investment, and (iii) to the LC Cash Collateral Account, any remaining Mandatory Reduction Amount.

. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, each LC Bank, in reliance on the agreements of the Facility Agents set forth in Section 2.11, agrees to issue standby and documentary letters of credit (the "") for the account of the Seller on any Business Day during the period from the Effective Date to the Termination Date (or, in the case of an LC Bank in a Non-Extending Purchase Group, the applicable Non-Extension Date) in such form as may be approved from time to time by such LC Bank; that no LC Bank shall have any obligation to Issue any Letter of Credit if, after giving effect to such Issuance, (i) without the consent of the applicable LC Bank, the LC Obligations owed to such LC Bank at such time would exceed such LC Bank's LC Bank Sublimit, (ii) the Percentage Interest would exceed 100% (95% if a Downgrade Event exists and is continuing), (iii) in the event that the Scheduled Termination Date shall have been extended pursuant to Section 2.16 with respect to some but not all of the Purchase Groups, the portion of the LC Obligations attributable to Letters of Credit with expiry dates after the next Non-Extension Date will exceed the portion of the Maximum Net Investment attributable to the Maximum Net Investment of the Purchase Groups that are not Non-Extending Purchase Groups or (iv) any Committed Purchaser is a Defaulting Purchaser, unless (x) arrangements with respect to such Defaulting Purchaser have been made which are reasonably satisfactory to such LC Bank to mitigate such LC Bank's risk with respect to such Defaulting Purchaser (as to both existing Letters of Credit and any proposed new Issuance), (y) the Seller has fulfilled the requirements set forth in Section 2.12(a), or (z) such Defaulting Purchaser has assigned all of its rights, interests and obligations hereunder to Assignee(s) in accordance with Sections 11.02 and 11.08 hereof.

Additionally, the Seller shall furnish to the applicable LC Bank such other certificates, documents and other papers and information as such LC Bank may request. Upon receipt of any Letter of Credit Application, such LC Bank will also provide a copy thereof to the Administrative Agent and, following receipt, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Facility Agents thereof. Such LC Bank will process such Letter of Credit Application and the certificates, documents and other papers and information delivered to it in connection therewith in accordance with its customary procedures. Unless such LC Bank has knowledge, or has received written notice from any Facility Agent, the Administrative Agent or the Seller at least one Business Day prior to the requested date of the applicable Issuance or Modification, that one or more applicable conditions contained in Section 3.03 shall not then be satisfied, then, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, such LC Bank shall promptly Issue or Modify the Letter of Credit, as the case may be, requested by such Letter of Credit Application and related documentation (but in no event shall such LC Bank be required to Issue or Modify any Letter of Credit earlier than three Business Days after its receipt of the Letter of Credit Application therefor and all related documentation) by Issuing the original of such Letter of Credit (or requested Modification, if applicable) to the beneficiary thereof or as otherwise may be agreed to by such LC Bank and the Seller. Such LC Bank shall furnish a copy of such Letter of Credit or any amendment thereto to the Seller promptly following the Issuance or Modification thereof. Such LC Bank shall promptly furnish to the Administrative Agent, which shall in turn promptly furnish to the Facility Agents, notice of the Issuance or Modification, as applicable, of each Letter of Credit (including the amount thereof), each increase or decrease in the amount of such Letter of Credit (including the amount thereof) and the termination of such Letter of Credit.
(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else to the contrary contained herein, no LC Bank shall be under any obligation to Issue any Letter of Credit if: (i) any order, judgment or decree of any Governmental Authority or arbitrator shall by its terms purport to enjoin or restrain such LC Bank from Issuing such Letter of Credit, or any Law applicable to such LC Bank or any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over such LC Bank (x) shall prohibit, or request that such LC Bank refrain from, the issuance of letters of credit generally or such Letter of Credit in particular, (y) shall impose upon such LC Bank with respect to such Letter of Credit any restriction, reserve or capital requirement (for which such LC Bank is not otherwise entitled to be compensated hereunder) not in effect on the Closing Date, or (z) shall impose upon such LC Bank any unreimbursed loss, cost or expense which was not applicable on the Closing Date and which such LC Bank in good faith deems material to it; that, in the cases of clauses (y) and (z), such LC Bank shall have provided written notice to the Seller of its refusal to issue any Letter of Credit and the specific reasons therefor and the Seller shall not have compensated such LC Bank for the imposition of such restriction, reserve or capital requirement or reimbursed such LC Bank for such loss, cost or expense, as applicable; (ii) the Issuance of such Letter of Credit would otherwise conflict with, or cause such LC Bank or any Purchase Group to exceed any limits imposed by, any applicable Law; or (iii) the Issuance of such Letter of Credit would

violate one or more policies of such LC Bank applicable to letters of credit generally. An LC Bank shall not be obligated to Modify any Letter of Credit if (A) such LC Bank would have no obligation at such time to Issue the Letter of Credit in its amended form under the terms hereof, or (B) the beneficiary of the Letter of Credit does not accept the proposed amendment to the Letter of Credit.
(d) The Seller shall authorize and direct each LC Bank to name the Seller as the "Applicant" or "Account Party" of each Letter of Credit; provided, that any such Letter of Credit may indicate that it is issued "on behalf of Phillips 66 Company or an Affiliate of Phillips 66 Company". Notwithstanding that a Letter of Credit Issued or otherwise outstanding hereunder is in support of any obligations of a Person other than the Seller, the Seller shall be obligated to reimburse the applicable LC Bank hereunder for any and all drawings under such Letter of Credit as provided in this Agreement.
(e) If any draft shall be presented for payment under any Letter of Credit, the relevant LC Bank shall promptly notify the Seller and the Administrative Agent of the date and the amount thereof and whether such LC Bank has made or will make a payment thereunder; that any failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the Seller of its obligation to reimburse such LC Bank with respect to any drawing under a Letter of Credit in accordance with the terms hereof. Upon receipt of any such notice, the Administrative Agent shall promptly advise the Facility Agents thereof. The responsibility of such LC Bank to the Seller in connection with any draft presented for payment under any Letter of Credit shall, in addition to any payment obligation expressly provided for in such Letter of Credit, be limited to determining that the documents (including each draft) delivered under such Letter of Credit in connection with such presentment are substantially in conformity with such Letter of Credit.

"Stated Amount"
(h) The Seller shall cause the aggregate Stated Amount of all Letters of Credit outstanding hereunder and all Reimbursement Obligations under clause (i) of that definition to be secured at all times by the Receivable Interest, and shall on every Business Day make such further grant, assignment, transfer and conveyance to the Facility Agents, for the benefit of the related Purchasers and LC Banks, in the Receivables, Related Security and Collections, as is necessary (if any) to cause such Receivable Interest to be so maintained.
(i) All payments made by an LC Bank pursuant to any Letter of Credit shall be made from funds of such LC Bank, and not from the funds of any other Person.
 
. (a) In the event of any request for a drawing under a Letter of Credit by the beneficiary or transferee thereof, the applicable LC Bank will promptly notify the Seller and the Administrative Agent of such request on the date such request is made, and the Administrative Agent shall, in turn, promptly advise the Facility Agents thereof. Upon its receipt of such notice, (i) the Seller will be deemed to have requested that a Purchase (each such Purchase, a ) be made on the date of the required drawing in the amount paid by such LC Bank under such Letter of Credit in respect of such drawing on such date and (ii) the Administrative Agent will deliver promptly to the Facility Agents a Purchase Notice with respect to the Reimbursement Purchase. If the conditions precedent to a Reimbursement Purchase set forth in Section 3.03 are satisfied, a Reimbursement Purchase will be made by each Facility Agent (on behalf of its related Purchasers) by delivering its portion of such Reimbursement Purchase (or, in the case of a Defaulting Purchaser, by the Administrative Agent using funds in the LC Cash Collateral Account, if available, to fund such Defaulting Purchaser's portion of the Reimbursement Purchase as provided in Section 2.12(a)) in such amount as determined in accordance with, and pursuant to, the terms set forth in Section 2.02 hereof, directly to the applicable LC Bank pursuant to the remittance instructions provided by the applicable LC Bank.

The Seller shall use its own funds available therefor to satisfy its Reimbursement Obligation; that on and after the Termination Date, the Administrative Agent shall apply funds on deposit in the LC Cash Collateral Account to pay the applicable LC Bank the Reimbursement Obligation owed to it. If the Seller shall not have satisfied its Reimbursement Obligation, the applicable LC Bank shall promptly, notify the Administrative Agent, the Seller and the Facility Agents of such non-payment by the Seller of its Reimbursement Obligation and that it is requesting that each Facility Agent (on behalf of its related Purchaser(s)) fund a Participation Advance in an amount equal to its ratable share of such unreimbursed Reimbursement Obligation (or, in the case of a Defaulting Purchaser, by directing the Administrative Agent to apply funds in the LC Cash Collateral Account, if available, to fund such Defaulting Purchaser's portion of such Participation Advance as provided in Section 2.12(a)) and pursuant to the remittance instructions provided by the applicable LC Bank. Any such notice given by an LC Bank may be oral if promptly confirmed in writing; , that the lack of such an immediate confirmation shall not affect the conclusiveness or binding effect of such notice. Each Purchaser may make a Participation Advance by making available to the applicable LC Bank by 5:00 P.M., New York time on such Business Day, an amount in immediately available funds equal to its ratable share of such unreimbursed Reimbursement Obligation; that, in no event shall any Facility Agent make a Participation Advance in the event that, after giving effect to the making of such Participation Advance, the related Purchase Group's Exposure Amount would exceed such Purchase Group's Maximum Net Investment. The requirement to make Participation Advances hereunder shall continue until the last to occur of any of the following events: (i) each LC Bank ceases to be obligated to Issue or cause to be Issued Letters of Credit hereunder; (ii) no Letter of Credit Issued hereunder remains

outstanding and uncancelled; and (iii) all Persons (other than the Seller or any Affiliate) have been fully reimbursed for all payments made under or relating to Letters of Credit. No Participation Advance shall reduce the then outstanding Reimbursement Obligations owed by the Seller to the applicable LC Bank. The Seller shall have an absolute obligation to reimburse such LC Bank, for its benefit and the benefit of each Purchaser that makes a Participation Advance to such LC Bank, in the amount of such Reimbursement Obligation, plus all Yield thereon. To the extent that (A) the Committed Purchaser is the LC Bank to which any Reimbursement Obligation is owed does not make its Participation Advance under this Section 2.11(b) or (B) any Committed Purchaser does not make such Participation Advance hereunder, the aggregate amount of such unfunded Participation Advances shall be deemed to be Participation Advances of such LC Bank until such time (if at all) that any such Defaulting Purchaser funds such Participation Advance to such LC Bank.
(c) If an LC Bank receives funds from or for the account of the Seller in payment of any Reimbursement Obligations with respect to which a Participation Advance has been made, such LC Bank will pay to each Facility Agent (for the benefit of its related Purchaser(s)) that has made such Participation Advance such Facility Agent's ratable allocation of such funds (based on the outstanding Participation Advances of the Purchaser(s) in such Facility Agent's Purchase Group), which shall also include all interest that has accrued with respect thereto received by such LC Bank; it being understood that such LC Bank shall retain a ratable amount of such funds that relate to the Participation Advances deemed made by such LC Bank's Purchase Group. If an LC Bank is required at any time to return to the Seller or any other Person, or to a trustee, receiver, liquidator, custodian, or any official in any insolvency proceeding, any portion of the payments made by the Seller to such LC Bank pursuant to this Agreement in reimbursement of a payment made under any Letter of Credit or interest or fee thereon and with respect to which a portion of such payment was paid by such LC Bank to the Facility Agents (on behalf of their respective Purchasers) pursuant to this Section, each Purchaser that has received a portion of such payment shall, on demand of such LC Bank, forthwith return to such LC Bank its ratable amount (based on the amount of such payment received by such Facility Agent) of any amounts so returned by such LC Bank.
(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, prior to the date on which a drawing occurs on any Letter of Credit (each such date, a ), no Yield shall accrue or be payable on the Stated Amount of such Letter of Credit, but fees with respect thereto shall be payable in accordance with the Fee Letter and each LC Bank Fee Letter. Following the Drawing Date of any Letter of Credit (and until a Reimbursement Purchase or payment or satisfaction in full of the Reimbursement Obligation arising as a result of such drawing), Yield shall accrue and be payable on the outstanding unpaid amount of such Reimbursement Obligation for each day from and including the date such Reimbursement Obligation arose to but excluding the date that Seller reimburses such Reimbursement Obligation in full (or such time that Reimbursement Purchases are made to satisfy such Reimbursement Obligation in full) at the applicable Yield. Interest on each Participation Advance shall accrue and be payable thereon for each day from and including the date such Participation Advance is made to but excluding the date that the Seller reimburses its Reimbursement Obligation for which such Participation Advance relates in full (or such time that Reimbursement Purchases are made to satisfy such Reimbursement Obligation in full) at the applicable Yield.
"Drawing Date"
 
(e) The Seller's obligations under this Section 2.11 shall be absolute and unconditional under any and all circumstances and irrespective of any setoff, counterclaim or defense to payment that the Seller may have or have had against any LC Bank, any beneficiary of a Letter of Credit or any other Person. The Seller also agrees with each LC Bank that no LC Bank shall be responsible for, and the Seller's Reimbursement Obligations shall not be affected by, among other things, (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit or any Transaction Document or any term or provision therein, (ii) any draft or other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment by any LC Bank under a Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that does not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit, or (iv) any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this Section 2.11(e), constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or provide a right of setoff against, the Seller's obligations hereunder. Neither the Administrative Agent, the Facility Agents, the Purchasers nor the LC Banks, nor any of their Related Parties, shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of any LC Bank; provided that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse the relevant LC Bank from liability to the Seller to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the Seller to the extent permitted by applicable Law) suffered by the Seller that are caused by such LC Bank's failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof. The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of an LC Bank (as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), such LC Bank shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such determination. In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree that, with respect to documents presented which appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, an LC Bank may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit.
(f) If any Letter of Credit remains outstanding and undrawn (either in full or in part) on the Termination Date, effective as of such date, the Seller shall have a Reimbursement Obligation with respect to all such Letters of Credit in an amount equal to the aggregate Stated Amount of outstanding and undrawn Letters of Credit on such day, together with the associated Fee Collateral Amount, and the Seller agrees to satisfy such Reimbursement Obligation by depositing such amount into the LC Cash Collateral Account.
. (a) If any Committed Purchaser becomes a Defaulting Purchaser at any time when there are undrawn Letters of Credit outstanding, then the Seller shall (i) within three (3) Business Days

The Administrative Agent shall (1) apply funds deposited into the LC Cash Collateral Account pursuant to this Section 2.12(a) to satisfy a Defaulting Purchaser's obligation to fund it portion of a Reimbursement Purchase pursuant to Section 2.11(a) or Participation Advance pursuant to Section 2.11(b) hereof and (2) transfer funds in the LC Cash Collateral Account in excess of the Required LC Cash Collateral Amount to the Seller as provided in Section 2.08(e) hereof.
(b) If the Seller has satisfied its obligations under Section 2.12(a), the Seller shall not be required to pay such Defaulting Purchaser the portion of the Used Fee or Unused Fee pursuant to the Fee Letter with respect to the amount of the undrawn Letters of Credit that is so cash collateralized by the Seller.
(c) Except for the portion of any fees not otherwise payable to such Defaulting Purchaser pursuant to Section 2.12(b), no amount payable by the Seller for the account of a Defaulting Purchaser under this Agreement (whether on account of Net Investment, Yield, indemnity payments or other amounts) shall be paid or distributed to such Defaulting Purchaser (or its Facility Agent), but instead shall be deposited to the LC Cash Collateral Account until the amount therein is equal to the amount of such Defaulting Purchaser's ratable share of the Stated Amount of the undrawn Letters of Credit that is not cash collateralized in accordance with Section 2.12(a), and to the extent of any remaining amounts, to pay to such Defaulting Purchaser amounts owed to it.
All per annum fees payable under this Agreement shall be calculated for the actual days elapsed on the basis of a 360-day year. All amounts to be paid or deposited by the Seller or the Servicer hereunder shall be paid or deposited in accordance with the terms hereof in immediately available funds no later than the time specified in the applicable provision of this Agreement, or, if not so specified, by 11:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the day when due. All such amounts shall be paid or deposited to the applicable party or account, as applicable, at the address listed on Schedule I hereto (or in the applicable Assignment and Assumption Agreement); , that, if such amounts are payable to any Purchasers or LC Banks, they shall be paid or deposited in the applicable Facility Agent's account indicated on Schedule I hereto (or in the applicable Assignment and Assumption Agreement), until otherwise notified by such party. The Seller shall, to the extent permitted by Law, pay interest on all amounts not paid or deposited when due hereunder at a rate equal to the Default Rate. All computations of Yield hereunder shall be made on the basis of a year of 360 days for the actual number of days (including the first but excluding the last day) elapsed other than computations of interest calculated by reference to the Alternate Base Rate which shall be calculated on the basis of a 365- or 366-day year, as applicable.

The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the Purchase Price with respect to the Receivables, Related Security, Collections and Proceeds sold on the initial Purchase Date shall be paid (i) first, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 2.02(b)(2), by means of an increase in the amount of the Subordinated Loan and (ii) second, by means of a contribution to Purchaser's capital.
(b) Subject to the limitations set forth in Section 2.02(a)(2), the Seller irrevocably agrees to make each increase in the amount of the Subordinated Loan as contemplated in Section 2.02(a)(2) so long as no Purchase Termination Event exists.

provided
(c) Although the Purchase Price for each Purchase of Receivables, Related Security, Collections and Proceeds shall be due and payable in full by the Purchaser to the Seller on each Purchase Date, settlement of the Purchase Price between the Purchaser and the Seller will be effected on each Distribution Date with respect to all Purchases within the most recently ended Calculation Period. Although cash settlements shall be effected on each Distribution Date, increases or decreases in the Subordinated Loan shall be deemed to have occurred and shall be effective as of the last Business Day of the Calculation Period to which such settlement relates.
(d) Each contribution of Receivables, Related Security, Collections and Proceeds by Seller to Purchaser pursuant to Section 2.02(a)(3) shall be deemed to be a Purchase of such Receivables, Related Security, Collections and Proceeds by Purchaser for all purposes of this Agreement.

If any Person fails to pay any amount hereunder when due, such Person agrees to pay, on demand, interest on the past due amount at the Default Rate until paid in full; that such interest shall not at any time exceed the maximum rate permitted by applicable Law.

Access to Records.
 
(b) In addition to the requirements of Section 4.03, the Seller (i) shall take such action reasonably requested by the Purchaser or its assignee that may be necessary or desirable to ensure that the Purchaser has an enforceable ownership interest in the Records relating to the Receivables purchased from, or contributed by, the Seller hereunder and (ii) shall use its reasonable efforts to ensure that the Purchaser and the Servicer each has an enforceable right (whether by license or sublicense or otherwise) to use all of the computer software used to account for the Receivables and/or to recreate such Records.
Section 2.06. (a) If, notwithstanding the intention of the parties expressed in Section 2.01(c), any sale or contribution by the Seller to the Purchaser of Receivables, Related Security, Collections and Proceeds hereunder shall be characterized as a secured loan and not a sale or contribution, as the case may be, then this Agreement shall be deemed to constitute a security agreement under the UCC and other applicable Law. For this purpose and without being in derogation of the parties' intention that each sale and contribution of Receivables, Related Security, Collections and Proceeds hereunder shall constitute a true sale or contribution, respectively, thereof, the Seller hereby grants to the Purchaser a duly perfected security interest in all of the Seller's right, title and interest in, whether now existing or hereafter arising, in and to (i) (A) the Receivables, (B) all Related Security with respect thereto, and (C) all Collections and (ii) all Proceeds of any of the foregoing, which security interest shall be prior to all other Liens thereon. The Purchaser and its assigns shall have as against the Seller, in addition to the rights and remedies which they may have under this Agreement, all other rights and remedies provided to a secured creditor under the UCC and other applicable Law, which rights and remedies shall be cumulative. The Seller hereby authorizes Purchaser (or any of its assigns), as secured party, within the meaning of Section 9-509 of any applicable enactment of the UCC, to file, without further authorization by Seller, as debtor, the UCC financing statements contemplated hereby. In the event that a court of competent jurisdiction holds that the transactions hereunder are not true sales or contributions, each of the Seller and the Purchaser represents and warrants as to itself that, each remittance of Collections by the Seller to the Purchaser hereunder will have been made (i) in payment of a debt incurred by the Seller in the ordinary course of the Seller's and the Purchaser's business or financial affairs and (ii) made in the ordinary course of the Seller's and the Purchaser's business or financial affairs.
Characterization; Granting Clause.
Section 2.07.

Greg C. Garland, the new chairman and chief executive officer of Phillips 66, has more than 30 years of experience in the oil and gas and chemicals industries.
"Our strategic approach combines one of the world's most competitive refining and marketing operations with rapidly growing midstream and chemicals businesses," Garland said. "Phillips 66 will be clearly differentiated from pure-play refining companies with specific plans for enhancing returns and growing shareholder distributions. We have an exciting future ahead of us."
Refining and Marketing
Phillips 66's plans to enhance returns in Refining and Marketing include disciplined capital allocation, portfolio optimization and increased margins through building access to advantaged feedstocks and improving clean product yield. The company's Refining and Marketing operations include 15 refineries with a net crude oil capacity of 2.2 million barrels per day, 10,000 branded marketing outlets, and 15,000 miles of pipeline systems.
Phillips 66 owns or has an interest in 11 refineries in the United States, three in Europe and one in Asia. Its Transportation business provides strategic, timely and environmentally safe delivery of crude oil, refined products, natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGL) throughout the United States. Phillips 66 markets gasoline, diesel, aviation fuel and lubricants, under the brand names Phillips 66, Conoco, 76, JET and Kendall.
Midstream
Phillips 66 primarily conducts its Midstream operations through DCP Midstream, LLC, a 50 percent joint venture with Spectra Energy and one of the largest natural gas gatherers and processors in the United States, as well as the largest producer of NGL in North America. Now in its 13th year of operations, DCP Midstream is a full-service provider of gathering, processing and NGL logistics services with strategically located assets in liquids-rich developments. The gas collected by DCP Midstream is processed at 61 owned or operated plants and treaters. Growth in liquids-rich developments in the United States is driving infrastructure demand and expansion opportunities for our Midstream segment. DCP Midstream has $4 billion in major projects currently in execution, including two major pipeline projects. The Southern Hills Pipeline will run more than 900 miles to Mont Belvieu, Texas, with a target capacity of more than 150,000 barrels per day of NGL. The project is expected to start up in mid-2013. The Sand Hills Pipeline is a 720-mile NGL line that will run through the Permian and Eagle Ford basins to market centers along the U.S. Gulf Coast. Initial capacity will be 200,000 barrels per day, and service may be expanded to 350,000 barrels per day. The Sand Hills Pipeline will be phased into service, with the first phase completed by the third quarter of 2012 and the second phase expected as soon as the third quarter of 2013.
Phillips 66's Midstream business also consists of directly held assets and other equity affiliates. These include natural gas gathering and processing operations, NGL fractionation and marketing businesses and a 25 percent interest in Rockies Express Pipeline.
Chemicals
Phillips 66's Chemicals business is conducted through its 50 percent interest in Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC (CPChem), a joint venture with Chevron U.S.A. Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Chevron Corporation. Now in its 12th year of operations, CPChem is one of the world's top producers of olefins and polyolefins with more than 30 billion pounds of net annual chemicals processing capacity across its product lines.
Like the Midstream business, the rapid development of natural gas and NGL from shale formations in the United States is driving major growth opportunities for CPChem. At its Cedar Bayou Chemical Complex in Baytown, Texas, CPChem is building the world's largest on-purpose 1-hexene plant capable of producing up to 250,000 metric tons (551,000,000 lbs.) per year. Construction of the 1-hexene plant is expected to begin in the first half of 2012, and the project is anticipated to start up during 2014. CPChem also aims to construct a world-scale ethane cracker at its Cedar Bayou facility in Baytown, Texas, and two polyethylene facilities near its Sweeny facility in Old Ocean, Texas, with anticipated startup in 2017, pending final investment decisions.
"Phillips 66 starts out with a clear advantage over many other downstream companies," said Garland. "We have a robust portfolio of businesses that already rank among the best-performing players in their industry segments, a strong financial position, an extraordinary global workforce, and a continued commitment to safety and operating excellence. We have an unparalleled foundation for success."
After the market closed yesterday, shareholders of ConocoPhillips received one share of Phillips 66 common stock for every two shares of ConocoPhillips common stock held as of the April 16 record date.
Garland will join other Phillips 66 employees tomorrow on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange to mark the first week of regular trading as a downstream company. They will ring the opening bell to begin trading at 8:30 a.m. CT.
