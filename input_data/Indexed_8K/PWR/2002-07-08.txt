ITEM 4. CHANGES IN REGISTRANT'S CERTIFYING ACCOUNTANT. On June 28, 2002, Quanta Services, Inc. ("Quanta") dismissed its former accountants and engaged PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as its new independent auditors for its fiscal year ending December 31, 2002. This determination followed Quanta's decision to seek proposals from independent accountants to audit the financial statements of Quanta, and was approved by Quanta's Board of Directors upon the recommendation of its Audit Committee. Prior to the selection of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, Arthur Andersen LLP served as the company's independent auditors. Arthur Andersen's reports on Quanta's consolidated financial statements for each of the years ended December 31, 2000 and 2001 did not contain an adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, nor were they qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles. During the years ended December 31, 2000 and 2001 and through June 28, 2002, there were no disagreements with Arthur Andersen on any matter of accounting principle or practice, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure which, if not resolved to Arthur Andersen's satisfaction, would have caused them to make reference to the subject matter in connection with their report on Quanta's consolidated financial statements for such years. During the years ended December 31, 2000 and 2001 and through June 28, 2002, there were no reportable events of the kind listed in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K . A letter from Arthur Andersen addressed to the Securities and Exchange Commission stating their agreement with the above statements is attached hereto as Exhibit 16.1. During the years ended December 31, 2000 and 2001 and through June 28, 2002, Quanta did not consult with PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP regarding any of the matters or events set forth in Item 304(a)(2)(i) or (ii) of Regulation S-K.
