(NYSE: PWR) announced today that it has closed on the second equity investment by First Reserve Fund IX, L.P., a private equity fund managed by First Reserve Corporation, after successfully amending certain provisions of its agreements with its lenders and senior secured note holders. First Reserve Corporation has purchased 2,430,741 shares of Series E Preferred Stock for $30.00 per share, each share of which, upon shareholder approval, will be convertible into ten common shares. Proceeds from the sale of shares to First Reserve will be used initially to pay down outstanding balances under the company's credit facility. As announced on October 16, 2002, the First Reserve Fund purchased from Quanta 8,666,666 shares of common stock at $3.00 per share, and purchased from Aquila, Inc. 3,303,100 shares of Quanta common stock at $3.00 per share and 939,380 shares of Quanta Series A Preferred Stock (convertible into 4,696,900 shares of common stock) at $3.00 per common share equivalent. "We are very pleased with First Reserve becoming the largest shareholder in Quanta and providing growth capital," stated John Colson, chairman and chief executive officer. "We believe we are well served by having a partner like First Reserve on our team." Ben Guill, president of First Reserve, has joined the Company's board of directors. In addition, First Reserve has the right to nominate two other members to the Company's board of directors. First Reserve now owns approximately 37 percent of Quanta's voting stock, assuming full conversion of the Series E Preferred Stock and Series A Preferred Stock. A meeting of Quanta's stockholders to approve the convertibility of the Series E Preferred Stock is scheduled for December 27, 2002. First Reserve has an agreement with Quanta not to exceed a 37 percent investment without the consent of Quanta's independent directors.

In conjunction with the offer, the number of shares of common stock that may be issued under Quanta's 2001 Stock Incentive Plan will be reduced from 15 percent of common stock outstanding to 12 percent of common stock outstanding (in each case, assuming full conversion of the company's Series A and Series E convertible stock).
