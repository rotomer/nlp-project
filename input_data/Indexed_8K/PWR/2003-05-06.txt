Revenues in the first quarter of 2003 were $367.1 million compared to revenues of $449.2 million in the first quarter of 2002.

The prior year results include the impact of a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle related to the adoption of SFAS No. 142.

The prior year results also include the impact of $4.6 million in expenses associated with a proxy contest with Aquila, Inc.
 
"The extreme weather that struck the Northeast, South, Southeast and Mountain regions of the United States, combined with margin pressures and an overall depressed market had a significant impact on our first quarter results," said John Colson, chief executive officer of Quanta Services. "In spite of the weather in the first quarter, we achieved cash flow from operations of $37.3 million and, after deducting capital expenditures of $4.9 million, free cash flow of $32.4 million."
