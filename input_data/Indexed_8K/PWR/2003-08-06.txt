DRG&E / 713-529-6600 713-629-7600 QUANTA SERVICES REPORTS SECOND QUARTER RESULTS GAAP LOSS PER SHARE WAS $0.08 NON-GAAP ADJUSTED EARNINGS WERE $0.03 PER DILUTED SHARE HOUSTON - AUGUST 6, 2003 - Quanta Services, Inc. (NYSE:PWR) today announced results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2003. Results for the second quarter of 2003 versus management's previous estimates are as follows: o Revenues were $408.3 million compared to previous estimates of $380 to $420 million o Non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share were $0.03 compared to previous estimates of $0.03 to $0.05 per diluted share o Adjustments recorded in the second quarter consisted of allowances for certain accounts and notes receivable in the amount of $19.0 million, related primarily to notes receivable from one customer Revenues in the second quarter of 2003 were $408.3 million, compared to revenues of $432.5 million in the second quarter of 2002. For the second quarter of 2003, GAAP net loss attributable to common stock was $9.8 million, or a loss per share of $0.08, compared to GAAP net loss attributable to common stock of $177.4 million, or a loss per share of $2.26, in last year's second quarter. "We are encouraged by the stabilization of our telecommunication revenues and are poised for growth when capital expenditures and maintenance funds flow from our utility and telecommunications customers," said John Colson, chairman and chief executive officer of Quanta Services. "While our markets appear to have stabilized, we have less visibility on the second half of the year based on the delay of awards from bid activity during the second quarter."
This year's second quarter results include allowances for certain accounts and notes receivable in the amount of $19.0 million, related primarily to notes receivable from one customer. For the three months ended June 30, 2003, non-GAAP net income attributable to common stock adjusted for these allowances was $3.1 million, or $0.03 per diluted share. For the three months ended June 30, 2002, non-GAAP adjusted net income attributable to common stock was $2.2 million, or $0.03 per diluted share. The 2002 second quarter results include the impact of an interim non-cash SFAS No. 142 impairment charge of approximately $166.6 million. In addition, during the second quarter of 2002, the company recognized $5.9 million in expenses associated with a proxy contest with Aquila, Inc. and $17.0 million related to allowances for balances primarily related to certain customers that declared bankruptcy during the quarter. A reconciliation of the second quarter 2003 and 2002 GAAP net income (loss) attributable to common stock to non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to common stock has been provided in the attached table. We are providing these non- GAAP measures to enable investors to evaluate quarterly performance absent large, customer- specific allowances and other items, and to perform additional comparisons of operating results. Revenues for the first six months of 2003 were $775.4 million, compared to $881.7 million for the first six months of 2002. For the first six months of 2003, the company reported a GAAP net loss attributable to common stock of $12.6 million, or a loss per diluted share of $0.13, compared to a GAAP net loss attributable to common stock of $612.8 million, or a loss per diluted share of $7.82 in the first half of last year. In addition to the previously discussed charges recorded in last year's second quarter, GAAP results for the first six months of 2002 include the impact of a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in the amount of $445.4 million, net of tax, related to the adoption of SFAS No. 142 and $4.6 million of expenses associated with the proxy contest with Aquila incurred during the first quarter of 2002. OUTLOOK The following statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward looking and actual results may differ materially. These statements do not include the potential impact of any business combinations, divestitures or financings that may be completed after the date of this press release.
The company expects revenues for the third quarter of 2003 to be between $410 million and $430 million and diluted earning per share to be in the range of $0.04 to $0.07. For fiscal 2003, Quanta now expects revenues of $1.55 billion to $1.65 billion, non-GAAP earnings per share, adjusted for the allowances recorded in the second quarter, to range between $0.08 to $0.12, and GAAP earnings to range between $0.02 loss per share to $0.02 earnings per diluted share. Colson commented, "The current delays of bids and contract awards have led us to modify our earnings estimates for the remainder of the year."

Quanta has chosen to provide this supplemental non-GAAP information to investors to enable them to perform additional comparisons of operating results and as a means to emphasize the results of ongoing operations absent large, customer-specific allowances and other items.
