SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION WASHINGTON, D.C. 20549 --------------- FORM 8-K CURRENT REPORT PURSUANT TO SECTION 13 OR 15(D) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 Date of Report (Date of earliest event reported): September 30, 2003 QUANTA SERVICES, INC. (Exact name of registrant as specified in its charter) Delaware (State or other jurisdiction of incorporation) 1-13831 74-2851603 (Commission File No.) (IRS Employer Identification No.) 1360 Post Oak Boulevard, Suite 2100 Houston, Texas 77056 (Address of principal executive offices, including ZIP code) (713) 629-7600 (Registrant's telephone number, including area code) Not Applicable (Former name or former address, if changed since last report)
ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS AND REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE. Quanta Services, Inc. ("Quanta") currently is considering financing alternatives to replace its existing credit facility and senior secured notes. In conjunction with these alternative financings, effective as of September 30, 2003, Quanta obtained a waiver from the lenders under its existing credit facility and from its senior secured note holders for potential events of default under certain of its financial covenants through January 1, 2004 (filed herewith are both such agreements). On October 2, 2003, Quanta also obtained a signed commitment letter from a lender for a new $200 million credit facility, subject to certain conditions precedent, to replace Quanta's existing credit facility. Should Quanta not be able to complete these alternative financings and not be able to comply with the covenants under the existing credit facility and senior secured notes, noncompliance would constitute an event of default under the credit facility and the senior secured notes. This Form 8-K contains various forward-looking statements and information, that are based on management's belief as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to management. Although Quanta's management believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to have been correct. Such statements are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions including, among other matters, future growth in electric utility and telecommunications outsourcing, the ability of Quanta to effectively integrate the operations of its companies, access to sufficient funding, compliance with financial covenants, dependence on fixed price contracts, cancellation provisions in contracts and departure of key personnel, as well as general risks related to the industries in which Quanta operates. Should one or more of these risks materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those expected. For a discussion of risks, investors are urged to refer to Quanta's reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. ITEM 7. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS (c) Exhibits.

LIMITATION ON RESTRICTED PAYMENTS. The Company shall make no Restricted Payment prior to September 21, 2005 other than (i) cash dividends in respect of the Company's preferred stock not to exceed $1,000,000 during any fiscal year of the Company, (ii) if the Company has declared a stock split in respect of its common stock, cash distributions in lieu of 5
issuing fractional shares of capital stock which would otherwise result from a stock split, (iii) repurchases of common stock of the Company from officers, directors, and employees pursuant to the Company's Stock Option Plan or Stock Compensation Program to pay withholdings in respect of taxes owed by recipients as a result of grants of stock options and stock compensation thereunder so long as the Company's performance of its obligations under such Stock Option Plan or Stock Compensation Program cannot reasonably be expected to have a material negative impact on projected cash flows, and (iv) payments made in connection with repurchases of its common stock and share repurchase and/or share derivative transactions, in each case made in connection with the issuance of the 2003 Convertible Subordinated Notes, provided that, (A) all such payments are made substantially contemporaneously with the issuance of the 2003 Convertible Subordinated Notes, (B) no such payment is made to an officer, director or Affiliate (including, without imitation, First Reserve) of the Company, (C) no Default or Event of Default (which has not been waived) exists at the time of each such payment or would exist as a result thereof, (D) the gross proceeds of the Initial 2003 Convertible Subordinated Notes (as such term is defined below) are at least $100,000,000, (E) if the gross proceeds of the 2003 Convertible Subordinated Notes are at least $100,000,000 but less than $125,000,000, the aggregate amount of all such payments does not exceed $15,000,000, and (F) if the gross proceeds of the 2003 Convertible Subordinated Notes are $125,000,000 or more, then the aggregate amount of all such payments does not exceed an amount equal to the applicable percentage of the gross proceeds of the 2003 Convertible Subordinated Notes set forth in the table below opposite such level of proceeds: The amount of payments permitted pursuant to the foregoing clauses (E) and (F) shall be deemed to include the $15,000,000 which the Company is permitted to retain from net offering proceeds in accordance with Section 8.8(e). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company issues additional 2003 Convertible Subordinated Notes ("Additional 2003 Convertible Subordinated Notes") after the closing of the sale of the first 2003 Convertible Subordinated Notes to be sold ("Initial 2003 Convertible Subordinated Notes"), then (x) the Company shall not be permitted to retain any amounts from the proceeds of the Additional 2003 Convertible Subordinated Notes that it might otherwise be entitled to retain pursuant to Section 8.8(e), and (y) if the sale of the Additional 2003 Convertible Subordinated Notes causes the gross proceeds of the 2003 Convertible Subordinated Notes to increase to a higher "gross proceeds level" in the table above, the percentage in such table applicable to such higher "gross proceeds level" shall apply only with respect to proceeds within such higher "gross proceeds level" and not to any other proceeds of the 2003 Convertible Subordinated Notes. For example, if the proceeds of the Initial 2003 Convertible Subordinated Notes are $150,000,000 6
and the proceeds of the Additional 2003 Convertible Subordinated Notes are $30,000,000, then the 20% from the table above would apply to the proceeds of the Initial 2003 Convertible Subordinated Notes and $24,999,999 of the proceeds of the Additional 2003 Convertible Subordinated Notes, and the 25% from the table above would apply to the remaining proceeds of the Additional 2003 Convertible Subordinated Notes." 4.3 Section 10.16 of the Existing Note Purchase Agreement is hereby amended by deleting the present subsections (f) and (g) and adding the following "(f) Convertible Subordinated Notes (as such term is defined in the Bank Credit Agreement as in effect on the Second Amendment Effective Date) in an aggregate principal amount of up to $172,500,000; (g) Debt not to exceed $250,000,000 at any time outstanding issued under the 2003 Note Purchase Agreement, including without limitation, the 2003 Convertible Subordinated Notes; provided that, such Debt and any related obligations are unsecured and subordinated upon terms not less favorable to the Noteholders than the terms of the Convertible Subordinated Notes (as such term is defined in the Bank Credit Agreement as in effect on the Third Amendment Effective Date), have a maturity date of not earlier than October 1, 2010 and are otherwise on terms reasonably satisfactory to the Required Holders, and provided further that all net cash proceeds from the issuance of such Debt are applied in accordance with Section 8.8(e); and (h) other Debt not included within subsections (a) through (g) above, provided that such Debt shall not exceed, at any one time outstanding, an amount equal to 8.5% of Consolidated Net Worth as of the end of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter (without taking into account adjustments to the determination of Consolidated Net Worth in accordance with SFAS 142 in accordance with GAAP)." 4.4 A subsection (m) is added at the end of Section 11 as follows: "(m) an event of default shall occur and be continuing under (i) the Subordinated Indenture, the First Supplemental Indenture, the Convertible Subordinated Notes, (as such terms are defined in the Bank Credit Agreement as in effect on the Third Amendment Effective Date) or any other document evidencing Debt under such Subordinated Indenture, First Supplemental Indenture or Convertible Subordinated Notes, or (ii) the 2003 Note Purchase Agreement or the 2003 Convertible Subordinated Notes, or any other document evidencing Debt under the 2003 Note Purchase Agreement or the 2003 Convertible Subordinated Notes." 7
4.5 Schedule B of the Existing Note Purchase Agreement is hereby amended by adding the following definitions to read in their entirety as follows: "AMENDMENT NO. 3" means that certain Amendment No. 3 to this Note Purchase Agreement, dated as of September 30, 2003. "THIRD AMENDMENT EFFECTIVE DATE" means September 30, 2003.

"2003 CONVERTIBLE SUBORDINATED NOTES" means the notes, guarantees, and all other obligations now or hereafter arising under, or in connection with, the 2003 Note Purchase Agreement. "2003 NOTE PURCHASE AGREEMENT" means that certain Note Purchase Agreement dated on or about October 1, 2003, by and among the Company, as issuer, and the purchasers named therein, as initial purchasers of the 2003 Convertible Subordinated Notes, as the same may be amended, restated or supplemented from time to time. 8
SECTION 5. TEMPORARY WAIVER Subject to the covenants, terms and conditions set forth in this Amendment, and in reliance upon the representations and warranties of the Company made herein, the Noteholders hereby waive any Default or Event of Default arising out of the Company's failure to comply with (a) the required Minimum Interest Coverage Ratio set forth in Section 10.4 at the end of the fiscal quarter ending on September 30, 2003, (b) the required Funded Debt to EBITDA ratio set forth in Section 10.2 at the end of the fiscal quarter ending on September 30, 2003, and (c) the required Senior Debt to EBITDA ratio set forth in Section 10.11 at the end of the fiscal quarter ending on September 30, 2003; provided that, all such waivers shall terminate and become null and void on January 2, 2004, at which time the Company's obligations to comply with the requirements set forth in such sections with respect to the fiscal quarter ending on September 30, 2003 shall be valid, binding and enforceable, and any non-compliance by the Borrower with any such requirements shall thereupon result in an immediate Event of Default with no notice or cure period. The temporary waivers set forth in this Amendment are limited to the extent specifically set forth in this Section 5, and no other terms, covenants or provisions hereof are intended to be waived hereby. SECTION 6. EFFECT OF AMENDMENT. Except as expressly provided in this Amendment, the Existing Note Purchase Agreement shall remain in full force and effect, without modification or amendment. This Amendment shall be binding upon, and shall inure to the benefit of, the successors and assigns of the parties hereto and the holders from time to time of the Notes. SECTION 7.

EXHIBIT 10.1 TENTH AMENDMENT TO THIRD AMENDED AND RESTATED SECURED CREDIT AGREEMENT THIS TENTH AMENDMENT TO THIRD AMENDED AND RESTATED SECURED CREDIT AGREEMENT (this "Amendment"), dated as of September 30, 2003, is entered into among QUANTA SERVICES, INC., a Delaware corporation (the "Borrower"), the Lenders (defined below) who are signatories hereto, and BANK OF AMERICA, N.A., as administrative agent for the Lenders (in such capacity, the "Agent"). Capitalized terms used but not defined in this Amendment have the meaning given them in the Credit Agreement (defined below). BACKGROUND A. The Borrower is party to that certain Third Amended and Restated Secured Credit Agreement dated as of June 14, 1999 (as amended through the date hereof and as may be further amended, restated or supplemented from time to time, the "Credit Agreement"), among the Borrower, the Agent, and the lenders from time to time party to the Credit Agreement (each a "Lender" and collectively, the "Lenders"). B. The Borrower, Majority Lenders and the Agent desire to make certain amendments to the Credit Agreement. NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the covenants, conditions and agreements hereinafter set forth, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are all hereby acknowledged, the Borrower, Majority Lenders and the Agent covenant and agree as follows: 1. AMENDMENTS TO CREDIT AGREEMENT. The Credit Agreement is hereby amended as follows: (a) Amendments to Section 1.1. Section 1.1 is amended by adding or entirely amending the following defined terms: "FUNDED DEBT" means, as of any date of determination, the sum, without duplication, of the following for the Borrower and its Subsidiaries: (i) Indebtedness for borrowed money, all obligations evidenced by bonds, debentures, notes or similar instruments, and purchase money obligations which in accordance with GAAP would be shown on the consolidated balance sheet of the Borrower as a liability, (ii) all L/C Obligations, and all reimbursement obligations relative to the face amount of all other letters of credit issued for the account of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, and (iii) all Capitalized Lease Obligations; provided that, for purposes of calculating the Funded Debt to EBITDA Ratio, the Senior Debt to EBITDA Ratio and the Minimum Asset Coverage Ratio for purposes of determining compliance with SECTIONS 6.22, 6.23 and 6.24 hereof, the sum referenced above shall be reduced by the amount of cash proceeds from the issuance of the 2003 Convertible Subordinated Notes to the extent such proceeds are being held by the Agent as cash collateral for the L/C Obligations and the Loans.
"2003 CONVERTIBLE SUBORDINATED NOTES" means the notes, guarantees, and all other obligations now or hereafter arising under, or pursuant to, the 2003 Note Purchase Agreement. "2003 NOTE PURCHASE AGREEMENT" means that certain Purchase Agreement dated as of a date in the fourth quarter of calendar year 2003, by and among the Borrower, as issuer, and the purchasers listed on "Schedule A" attached thereto, as initial purchasers of the Borrower's convertible subordinated debentures due 2023, as the same may be amended, restated or supplemented from time to time. (b) Amendments to Section 4.2. Section 4.2 is amended by (i) deleting the word "and" immediately following the semi-colon (";") found in clause (e) therein, (ii) deleting the period (".") immediately following the end of clause (f) thereof and replacing it with a semi-colon (";"), and (iii) adding new clauses (g) and (h) thereto immediately following clause (f), as set forth below: (g) Compliance with Financial Covenants. After giving effect to the proposed Borrowing or Letter of Credit, the Borrower shall be in compliance with SECTIONS 6.20 through 6.24 of this Agreement as of the date of the proposed Borrowing, whether or not the Lenders shall have waived any Default or Event of Default arising out of the Borrower's failure to comply with any of such SECTIONS, provided, however, that such condition precedent shall not apply to the issuance, extension or increase of any Letter of Credit listed on SCHEDULE 4.2(g); and (h) Cash Collateral. Solely with respect to Letters of Credit issued or increased after the issuance of the 2003 Convertible Subordinated Notes, the Borrower shall provide the Agent with cash collateral in an amount equal to the face amount of any such Letter of Credit to the extent that net proceeds of the 2003 Convertible Subordinated Notes were sufficient to cash collateralize such Letters of Credit had they been outstanding on the date of issuance of the 2003 Convertible Subordinated Notes. (c) Amendment to Section 6.10(a). Clause (a) of Section 6.10 is amended by adding a new clause (iv) thereto so that the entire clause (a) shall read as follows: (a) The Borrower shall not pay any dividends or other distributions on its capital stock other than (i) when no Default or Event of Default exists or will result therefrom, cash dividends in respect of the Preferred Stock not to exceed $1,000,000 during any fiscal year of the Borrower, (ii) dividends made wholly in the form of additional shares of the Borrower's capital stock, provided that, in respect of any stock split, the Borrower may make cash distributions in lieu of issuing fractional shares of capital stock which would otherwise result from such stock split, (iii) repurchases of common stock of the Borrower from officers, directors and employees pursuant to the Borrower's restricted stock option or compensation programs, to pay withholdings in respect of taxes owed as a result of grants of stock options and stock compensation thereunder, so long as the Borrower's performance of its obligations under such restricted stock option or 2
compensation programs cannot reasonably be expected to have a material negative impact on projected cash flows, and (iv) the Borrower may repurchase its common stock and make payments in connection with share repurchase and/or share derivative transactions with respect to its common stock so long as (A) such transactions are consummated either simultaneously with the issuance of the 2003 Convertible Subordinated Notes or in connection with repurchase rights and/or obligations from time to time arising in connection with such issuance, (B) no Default or Event of Default that has not been waived exists or will result therefrom, (C) if the gross proceeds of the 2003 Convertible Subordinated Notes are at least $100,000,000 but less than $125,000,000, the aggregate amount of all payments made in connection with such transactions does not exceed $15,000,000, (D) the Borrower receives no less than $100,000,000 in gross proceeds from the issuance of the Initial 2003 Convertible Subordinated Notes (as such term is defined below), and (E) if the aggregate gross proceeds of the 2003 Convertible Subordinated Notes are $125,000,000 or more, the aggregate amount of all such payments does not exceed an amount equal to the applicable percentage of the gross proceeds received by the Borrower from the issuance of the 2003 Convertible Subordinated Notes set forth in the table below: Provided that nothing in this SECTION 6.10(a) shall affect the Borrower's obligation to comply with SECTION 2.10(c) with respect to such proceeds. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Borrower issues additional 2003 Convertible Subordinated Notes ("Additional 2003 Convertible Subordinated Notes") after the closing of the sale of the first 2003 Convertible Subordinated Notes to be sold ("Initial 2003 Convertible Subordinated Notes"), then (x) the Borrower shall not be permitted to retain any amounts from the proceeds of the Additional 2003 Convertible Subordinated Notes that it might otherwise be entitled to retain pursuant to Section 2.10(c), and (y) if the sale of the Additional 2003 Convertible Subordinated Notes causes the gross proceeds of the 2003 Convertible Subordinated Notes to increase to a higher "gross proceeds level" in the table above, the percentage in such table applicable to such higher "gross proceeds level" shall apply only with respect to proceeds within such higher "gross proceeds level" and not to any other proceeds of the 2003 Convertible Subordinated Notes. For example, if the proceeds of the Initial 2003 Convertible Subordinated Notes are $150,000,000 and the proceeds of the Additional 2003 Convertible Subordinated Notes are $30,000,000, then the 20% from the table above would apply to the proceeds of the Initial 2003 Convertible Subordinated Notes and $24,999,999 of the proceeds of the Additional 2003 3
Convertible Subordinated Notes, and the 25% from the table above would apply to the remaining proceeds of the Additional 2003 Convertible Subordinated Notes. (d) Amendment to Section 6.14(e). Clause (e) of Section 6.14 is amended and restated in its entirety, as follows: (e) [Intentionally Deleted] (e) Further Amendments to Section 6.14. Section 6.14 is further amended by (i) deleting the word "and" immediately following the semi-colon (";") found in clause (g) therein, (ii) amending and restating clause (h) thereof in its entirety, as set forth below, and (iii) adding new clauses (i) and (j) thereto immediately following clause (h), as set forth below: (h) Indebtedness under the Subordinated Indenture, including without limitation, the Indebtedness under the Convertible Subordinated Notes and the First Supplemental Indenture; provided that the principal amount of such Indebtedness shall not at any time exceed $172,500,000; (i) Indebtedness not to exceed $250,000,000 at any time under the 2003 Note Purchase Agreement, including without limitation, the Indebtedness under the 2003 Convertible Subordinated Notes; provided that, such Indebtedness is unsecured and upon terms not materially less favorable than the terms of the Convertible Subordinated Notes and is otherwise on terms reasonably satisfactory to the Agent, including without limitation ranking subordination terms at least as favorable to the Lenders as those contained in the Convertible Subordinated Notes, and provided further that all net cash proceeds from the issuance of such Indebtedness are applied in accordance with SECTION 2.10(c) of this Agreement, which contemplates that such proceeds will be allocated to the Lenders and to the holders of the Senior Notes (based on the proportion of the Commitment Amount under this Agreement and the proportion of the outstanding principal amount of the Senior Notes to the sum of both) and applied as follows: (A) with respect to the proceeds allocated to the Lenders, paid to the Agent as a prepayment of the Loans, and if all Loans have been satisfied, to the Agent as cash collateral for the outstanding L/C Obligations (which security interest shall be expressly senior to any security interest in such cash collateral which secures the Senior Notes), in each case together with a corresponding, automatic and permanent reduction of the Commitment Amount by the amount of net proceeds that would be allocated to the Lenders if the Loans and L/C Obligations exceeded such amount of net proceeds (and not any lesser amount which may ultimately be allocated to the Lenders if the Loans and L/C Obligations are less than such amount of net proceeds), and if all of the L/C Obligations have been so cash collateralized, to the holders of the Senior Notes to be applied in accordance with Section 8.8(e) of the Note Purchase Agreement, and (B) with respect to the proceeds allocated to 4
the holders of the Senior Notes, paid to such holders to be applied in accordance with Section 8.8(e) of the Note Purchase Agreement; and (j) Guaranties from domestic Subsidiaries entered into or delivered in connection with either the 2003 Convertible Subordinated Notes or the Senior Notes and obligations covered by CLAUSE (VI) of the definition of Indebtedness to the extent that such obligations are entered into or arise in connection with the 2003 Convertible Subordinated Notes. (f) Amendment to Section 6.15(h). Clause (h) of Section 6.15 is amended and restated in its entirety as follows: (h) Investments involving share repurchase and/or share derivative transactions to the extent permitted by SECTION 6.10. (g) Amendment to Section 7.1(n). Clause (n) of Section 7.1 is amended and restated in its entirety, as follows: (n) an event of default shall occur and be continuing under (i) the Subordinated Indenture, the First Supplemental Indenture or the Convertible Subordinated Notes, or any other document evidencing Indebtedness under the Subordinated Indenture, the First Supplemental Indenture or the Convertible Subordinated Notes, or (ii) the 2003 Note Purchase Agreement or the 2003 Convertible Subordinated Notes, or any other document evidencing Indebtedness under the 2003 Note Purchase Agreement or the 2003 Convertible Subordinated Notes. (h) New Schedule 4.2(g). A new SCHEDULE 4.2(g) in the form attached to this Amendment as SCHEDULE 4.2(g) is hereby added to the Credit Agreement. 2. TEMPORARY WAIVER Upon the effectiveness of this Amendment, and in reliance upon the representations and warranties of the Borrower and the Guarantors made herein, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any of the Credit Documents, the Agent and the Lenders hereby waive any Default or Event of Default arising out of the Borrower's failure in any respect to comply with (a) the required Minimum Interest Coverage Ratio set forth in Section 6.21 of the Credit Agreement at the end of the fiscal quarter ending on September 30, 2003, (b) the required Funded Debt to EBITDA Ratio set forth in Section 6.22 of the Credit Agreement at the end of the fiscal quarter ending on September 30, 2003, (c) the required Senior Debt to EBITDA Ratio set forth in Section 6.23 of the Credit Agreement at the end of the fiscal quarter ending on September 30, 2003 and (d) any obligation to furnish, deliver or provide any projections or forecasts pursuant to Section 6.6 of the Credit Agreement after September 15, 2003 through January 1, 2004 (collectively, the "Specified Defaults"); provided that, all such waivers shall terminate and become null and void on January 2, 2004, at which time the Borrower's obligations to comply with the requirements set forth in Sections 6.21, 6.22, and 6.23 of the Credit Agreement with respect to the fiscal quarter ending on September 30, 2003 and to furnish any such items pursuant to Section 6.6 shall be valid, binding and enforceable, and any non-compliance by the Borrower with any such requirements shall thereupon result in an 5
immediate Event of Default with no notice or cure period. The temporary waivers set forth in this Section 2 of this Amendment are limited to the extent specifically set forth above in this Section 2, and no other terms, covenants or provisions of the Credit Agreement are intended to be waived hereby. 3. BORROWING RESTRICTIONS. Notwithstanding anything in the Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document to the contrary, from the date hereof through and including January 1, 2004, the Lenders shall not be obligated to make any Revolving Loans other than Revolving Loans pursuant to the Agent's request in respect of Swing Line Loans made by the Agent in accordance with Section 2.1(b) of the Credit Agreement, provided that the aggregate amount of all such Swing Line Loans outstanding at any one time during such period shall never exceed $5,000,000. 4. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. Each of the Borrower and the Guarantors represents and warrants to the Lenders that (a) it possesses all requisite power and authority to execute, deliver and comply with the terms of this Amendment, (b) this Amendment has been duly authorized and approved by all requisite corporate, partnership or limited liability company action, as applicable, by it, (c) no consent of any Person that has not been obtained is required for its execution and delivery of this Amendment, (d) its execution and delivery of this Amendment will not violate its organizational documents, (e) the representations and warranties in each Credit Document to which it is a party are true and correct in all material respects on and as of the date of this Amendment as though made on the date of this Amendment (except to the extent that such representations and warranties speak to a specific date), (f) it is in full compliance with all covenants and agreements contained in each Credit Document to which it is a party, and (g) no Default or Event of Default exists as of the date of this Amendment. 5.
