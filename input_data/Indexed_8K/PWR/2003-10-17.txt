SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION WASHINGTON, D.C. 20549 --------------- FORM 8-K CURRENT REPORT PURSUANT TO SECTION 13 OR 15(D) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 Date of Report (Date of earliest event reported): October 9, 2003 Quanta services, Inc. (Exact name of registrant as specified in its charter) Delaware (State or other jurisdiction of incorporation) 1-13831 74-2851603 (Commission File No.) (IRS Employer Identification No.) 1360 Post Oak Boulevard, Suite 2100 Houston, Texas 77056 (Address of principal executive offices, including ZIP code) (713) 629-7600 (Registrant's telephone number, including area code) Not Applicable (Former name or former address, if changed since last report)
ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS AND REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE. In connection with the private placement by Quanta Services, Inc. ("Quanta") of its 4.50% Convertible Subordinated Debentures due 2023 pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, Quanta has entered into amendments with the lenders under its existing credit facility and its senior secured note holders that, among other things, increase the maximum aggregate principal amount of the debentures from $250 million to $275 million. Filed herewith are both such amendments. Statements in this Current Report on Form 8-K that contain "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the private placement and the principal amount of debentures. Such statements are based on management's belief as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to management, and such statements are inherently subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Although Quanta's management believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to have been correct. These risk factors include, among others, risks of a continued economic downturn that could lead to less demand for Quanta's services, Quanta's inability to access sufficient funding in the future to finance desired growth, possible variations in Quanta's operating results, Quanta's dependence on fixed price contracts, possible adverse effects on Quanta's results of operations due to goodwill impairments, possible contract cancellations, the potential for rapid technological and structural changes in the industries Quanta serves which could reduce the demand for Quanta's services, competition, inability or failure to obtain or maintain necessary performance bonds, failure to generate internal growth, self-insurance, as well as other general risks related to the industries in which Quanta operates. Should one or more of these risks materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may differ materially from those expected. Investors are urged to refer to Quanta's reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which contain a discussion of the risk factors that could impact these areas and Quanta's overall business and financial performance. Given these concerns, investors and analysts should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. ITEM 7. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS (c) Exhibits.

EXHIBIT 10.1 ELEVENTH AMENDMENT TO THIRD AMENDED AND RESTATED SECURED CREDIT AGREEMENT THIS ELEVENTH AMENDMENT TO THIRD AMENDED AND RESTATED SECURED CREDIT AGREEMENT (this "Amendment"), dated as of October 9, 2003, is entered into among QUANTA SERVICES, INC., a Delaware corporation (the "Borrower"), the Lenders (defined below) who are signatories hereto, and BANK OF AMERICA, N.A., as administrative agent for the Lenders (in such capacity, the "Agent"). Capitalized terms used but not defined in this Amendment have the meaning given them in the Credit Agreement (defined below). BACKGROUND A. The Borrower is party to that certain Third Amended and Restated Secured Credit Agreement dated as of June 14, 1999 (as amended through the date hereof and as may be further amended, restated or supplemented from time to time, the "Credit Agreement"), among the Borrower, the Agent, and the lenders from time to time party to the Credit Agreement (each a "Lender" and collectively, the "Lenders"). B. The Borrower, Majority Lenders and the Agent desire to make certain amendments to the Credit Agreement. NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the covenants, conditions and agreements hereinafter set forth, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are all hereby acknowledged, the Borrower, Majority Lenders and the Agent covenant and agree as follows: 1. AMENDMENTS TO CREDIT AGREEMENT. The Credit Agreement is hereby amended as follows: (a) Amendment to Section 6.10(a). Clause (a) of Section 6.10 is amended by adding a new sentence at the end thereto to read as follows: The amount of payments permitted pursuant to the foregoing clauses (D) and (E) shall be deemed to include the $15,000,000 which the Borrower is permitted to retain from the net offering proceeds in accordance with Section 2.10(c). (b) Amendment to Section 6.14. Section 6.14(i) is amended and restated in its entirety, as follows: (i) Indebtedness not to exceed $275,000,000 at any time under the 2003 Note Purchase Agreement, including without limitation, the Indebtedness under the 2003 Convertible Subordinated Notes; provided that, such Indebtedness is unsecured and upon terms not materially less favorable than the terms of the Convertible Subordinated Notes and is otherwise on terms reasonably satisfactory to the Agent, including without limitation ranking subordination terms at least as favorable to the Lenders as those contained in the Convertible Subordinated
Notes, and provided further that all net cash proceeds from the issuance of such Indebtedness are applied in accordance with SECTION 2.10(C) of this Agreement, which contemplates that such net cash proceeds in excess of $15,000,000 (which $15,000,000 the Borrower is permitted to retain consistent with Section 2.10(c)) will be allocated to the Lenders and to the holders of the Senior Notes (based on the proportion of the Commitment Amount under this Agreement and the proportion of the outstanding principal amount of the Senior Notes to the sum of both) and applied as follows: (A) with respect to the proceeds allocated to the Lenders, paid to the Agent as a prepayment of the Loans, and if all Loans have been satisfied, to the Agent as cash collateral for the outstanding L/C Obligations (which security interest shall be expressly senior to any security interest in such cash collateral which secures the Senior Notes), in each case together with a corresponding, automatic and permanent reduction of the Commitment Amount by the amount of net proceeds that would be allocated to the Lenders if the Loans and L/C Obligations exceeded such amount of net proceeds (and not any lesser amount which may ultimately be allocated to the Lenders if the Loans and L/C Obligations are less than such amount of net proceeds), and if all of the L/C Obligations have been so cash collateralized, to the holders of the Senior Notes to be applied in accordance with Section 8.8(e) of the Note Purchase Agreement, and (B) with respect to the proceeds allocated to the holders of the Senior Notes, paid to such holders to be applied in accordance with Section 8.8(e) of the Note Purchase Agreement; and (c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Borrower shall be permitted to disregard any Make-Whole Amount (as defined in the Note Purchase Agreement) paid or required to be paid as a result of or in connection with the 2003 Note Purchase Agreement or any offering or issuance of the 2003 Convertible Subordinated Notes for purposes of any determination of the Borrower's compliance with any covenant contained in Section 6.20, 6.21, 6.22, 6.23 or 6.24 of this Agreement. 2.

(b) The Borrower and each Guarantor covenants and agrees never to commence, voluntarily aid in any way, prosecute or cause to be commenced or prosecuted against any of the Released Lender Parties any action or other proceeding based upon any of the Borrower Claims which may have arisen at any time on or prior to the date of this Amendment and were in any manner related to any of the Credit Documents.
