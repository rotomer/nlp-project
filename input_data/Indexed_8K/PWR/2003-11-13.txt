DRG&E 713-629-7600 713-529-6600 QUANTA SERVICES REPORTS THIRD QUARTER RESULTS REFINANCED DEBT & REDUCED INTEREST EXPENSE SECURES $100 MILLION IN NEW CONTRACTS HOUSTON - NOVEMBER 13, 2003 - Quanta Services, Inc. (NYSE:PWR) today announced results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2003. Revenues in the third quarter of 2003 were $436.1 million, compared to revenues of $436.2 million in the third quarter of 2002. For the third quarter of 2003, net income attributable to common stock was $5.4 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, compared to a net loss attributable to common stock of $8.6 million, or a loss per share of $0.14 in last year's third quarter. Last year's third quarter results include the impact of a pretax charge of $31.0 million to provide allowances for certain accounts. "Our performance in the third quarter was in line with our expectations and we continue to see our customers' financial position improve," said John Colson, chairman and chief executive officer of Quanta Services. "Quanta remains well positioned to partner with its customers to address their emerging needs -- from the pressure being placed on utilities to address the state of the transmission grid to increased interest in fiber-to-the-home initiatives by various telecommunications companies, municipalities and utilities." Revenues for the first nine months of 2003 were $1.21 billion, compared to $1.32 billion for the first nine months of 2002. For the first nine months of 2003, after considering the impact of a pretax charge of $19.0 million for allowances recorded for certain accounts in the second quarter, the company reported a net loss attributable to common stock of $7.2 million, or a loss per share of $0.06, compared to a net loss attributable to common stock of $621.4 million, or a loss per share of $10.19 in the first nine months of last year. - more -
The prior year results include the effect of charges of $48.0 million to provide allowances for certain accounts, $10.5 million in proxy defense costs, the impact of an interim non-cash SFAS No. 142 impairment charge of approximately $166.6 million and a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in the amount of $445.4 million, net of tax, also related to the adoption of SFAS No. 142. RECENT HIGHLIGHTS o SECURED TWO MAJOR PROJECTS VALUED AT APPROXIMATELY $100 MILLION - Quanta has been awarded two major projects with combined revenues of approximately $100 million over 18 months. Quanta will construct a 90-mile, 765,000-volt transmission line for American Electric Power (NYSE: AEP) that will help reinforce the transmission system serving western Virginia and southern West Virginia. Tennessee Valley Authority has selected Quanta for construction and modification services on TVA's transmission and substation infrastructure through a five-year contract. o COMPLETED OFFERING OF $270 MILLION OF CONVERTIBLE SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES - In the fourth quarter of 2003, Quanta completed an offering of $270 million of Convertible Subordinated Debentures due in 2023 through a private placement. The company used the net proceeds of the offering to repay a portion of its senior secured notes and associated make-whole prepayment premiums. o AMENDED CREDIT FACILITY - Quanta has amended its existing facility in the fourth quarter of 2003 to convert it into a fully funded $60 million term loan and letter of credit facility of up to $120.0 million and extended its maturity to January 1, 2005. The term loan was used to repay a portion of Quanta's senior secured notes and associated make-whole prepayment premiums. o REDUCED INTEREST EXPENSE - As a result of the above refinancing efforts and the repayment of the company's senior secured notes, interest expense in future years will be reduced by approximately $8 million per year. o SUPPORTED NINE UTILITIES IN RESTORATION EFFORTS - Quanta provided more than 1,500 people over the span of 3 weeks in an effort to restore power to the areas affected by Hurricane Isabel. Quanta crews supported six different utilities in this initiative. Additionally, Quanta provided 350 people to help three major utilities recover from the massive fires affecting California in late October and early November. -- more --
OUTLOOK The following statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward looking, and actual results may differ materially. Quanta expects revenues for the fourth quarter of 2003 to range from $380 million to $410 million. Loss per share for the quarter is expected to range from $0.16 to $0.19 due to the make-whole prepayment premium associated with the repayment of the senior secured notes and write-off of deferred financing costs for debt refinanced in the fourth quarter which are expected to total approximately $35 million and have a negative after-tax effect of approximately $0.21 in the fourth quarter. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share before the above-mentioned costs are expected to be between $0.02 and $.05.
