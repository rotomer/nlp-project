[QUANTA SERVICES LOGO] PRESS RELEASE FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 04-02 Contacts: James Haddox, CFO Ken Dennard / ksdennard@drg-e.com Reba Reid Lisa Elliott / lelliott@drg-e.com 713-629-7600 DRG&E / 713-529-6600 QUANTA SERVICES REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS REVENUES WERE $431.3 MILLION GAAP LOSS PER SHARE WAS $0.23 NON-GAAP EARNINGS EXCLUDING CHARGES WERE $0.04 PER DILUTED SHARE HOUSTON - FEBRUARY 26, 2004 - Quanta Services, Inc. (NYSE: PWR) today announced results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2003. Revenues in the fourth quarter of 2003 were $431.3 million, compared to revenues of $432.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2002. For the fourth quarter of 2003, GAAP net loss attributable to common stock was $25.7 million, or a loss per share of $0.23 compared to GAAP net loss attributable to common stock of $6.7 million, or a loss per share of $0.10 in last year's fourth quarter. This year's fourth quarter results include a $35.1 million charge comprised of make-whole pre-payment premiums, the write-off of deferred financing costs and other related costs due to the early extinguishment of debt; a $6.5 million goodwill impairment charge associated with the closure of an operating unit; and a $2.9 million charge as a result of the disposition of an investment in a fiber network, all on a pre-tax basis. For the three months ended December 31, 2003, non-GAAP net income attributable to common stock adjusted for these charges was $4.4 million, or $0.04 per diluted share. For the three months ended December 31, 2002, non-GAAP net income attributable to common stock was $4.8 million, or $0.06 per diluted share. A reconciliation of the fourth quarter 2003 and 2002 GAAP net income (loss) attributable to common stock to non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to common stock has been provided in the attached table. These non-GAAP measures are provided to enable investors to evaluate our quarterly performance excluding the effects of certain items that we believe impact the comparability of our results between reporting periods. "Our $117 million in cash flow from operations less capital expenditures of $36 million yielded free cash flow of $81 million for the year, excluding debt extinguishment costs. Our free cash flow, combined with the refinancing completed in the fourth quarter, resulted in approximately $200 million in cash on our balance sheet as of today - ensuring our future ability - more -
to grow," said John Colson, chairman and chief executive officer of Quanta Services. "In addition to the operational improvements we made this year, we favorably refinanced our debt which will yield annual net interest savings of approximately $8 million. In 2004 we will continue to propel Quanta toward its full potential as capital spending, the regulatory process and the general economy progress." Revenues for the twelve months of 2003 were $1.64 billion, compared to $1.75 billion for the twelve months of 2002. For the twelve months of 2003, the company reported a GAAP net loss attributable to common stock of $32.9 million, or a loss per share of $0.30, compared to a GAAP net loss attributable to common stock of $628.1 million, or a loss per share of $9.98 for the year 2002. In addition to the previously discussed charges recorded in the fourth quarter of 2003, GAAP results for 2003 were impacted by allowances for certain accounts and notes receivable in the amount of $19.0 million, related primarily to notes receivable from one customer. OUTLOOK The following statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially. Quanta expects revenue for the first quarter of 2004 to range from $340 million to $360 million, and a loss per share of approximately $0.04 to $0.07 due to normal business seasonality and start-up and development costs associated with an initiative to pursue government contracts. Quanta expects revenue for 2004 to range from $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion and diluted earnings per share of approximately $0.20 to $0.30.
