FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
04-11
Quanta Services, Inc. (NYSE:PWR) today announced results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2004.
HOUSTON  August 6, 2004 
     Revenues in the second quarter of 2004 were $389.2 million compared to revenues of $408.3 million in the second quarter of 2003. For the second quarter of 2004, the net loss attributable to common stock was $3.5 million, or a loss of $0.03 per share, compared to a net loss attributable to common stock of $9.8 million, or a loss per share of $0.08 in the second quarter of 2003.
     "We are beginning to see the positive impact of our profit enhancement initiatives. Our gross profit margin improved more than 55 percent in the second quarter as compared to the first quarter of 2004 as a result of our initiatives and improved weather conditions," said John Colson, chairman and chief executive officer of Quanta Services. "Our balance sheet remains strong and we remain positioned to leverage emerging opportunities such as the deployment of Fiber-to-the-Premise initiatives and the essential enhancement of the country's electric transmission grid."
     The loss for the second quarter of 2004 includes tax expense of approximately $3.3 million due to a change in the effective tax rate for the six months ended June 30, 2004 compared to the effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2004.
     Last year's second quarter results included allowances for certain accounts and notes receivable in the amount of $19.0 million, related primarily to notes receivable from one customer. We did not have similar allowances during the second quarter of 2004.
 
     Revenues for the first six months of 2004 were $744.2 million, compared to $775.4 million for the first half of 2003. For the first six months of 2004, the company reported a net loss attributable to common stock of $15.2 million or a loss per diluted share of $0.13, compared to a net loss attributable to common stock of $12.6 million or a loss per diluted share of $0.11 in the first half of last year.
