Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Principal Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Principal Officers.
Thomas J. Sikorski resigned as a director of Quanta Services, Inc. ("Quanta") effective as of November 30, 2004. Mr. Sikorski was designated for election to Quanta's board by First Reserve Fund IX, L.P. ("First Reserve") in connection with First Reserve's initial investment in Quanta, and Mr. Sikorski's resignation follows First Reserve's recent sale of 20,125,000 shares of Quanta's common stock. As a result of the sale, First Reserve owns approximately 16.3% of Quanta's outstanding common stock. First Reserve retains the contractual right to designate one director for election to Quanta's board so long as it owns between 10% and 20% of Quanta's outstanding common stock. Ben A. Guill serves as First Reserve's current designee to Quanta's board of directors.
