J.P. MORGAN SECURITIES INC. 270 Park Avenue New York, New York 10017
Ladies/Gentlemen:
     The selling stockholder, First Reserve Fund IX, L.P. (the "Selling Stockholder"), proposes, subject to the terms and conditions stated herein, to sell to J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. (the "Underwriter") an aggregate of 3,692,000 shares (the "Shares") of common stock, par value $0.00001 per share (the "Common Stock"), of Quanta Services, Inc., a corporation organized and existing under the laws of Delaware (the "Company"). The Shares are more fully described in the Registration Statement and Prospectus referred to below.
     1. . The Company represents and warrants to, and agrees with, the Underwriter that:
Representations and Warranties of the Company
        (a) The Company has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") a registration statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-114938), and amendments thereto, and related preliminary prospectuses for the registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), of the Shares and the offering thereof from time to time in accordance with Rule 415 of the rules and regulations of the Commission under the Securities Act (the "Securities Act Regulations"). Such registration statement has been declared effective by the Commission, and the Company has filed such post-effective amendments thereto (or such preliminary prospectus or preliminary supplemental prospectus) as may be required under the Securities Act and the Securities Act Regulations, and each such post-effective amendment has been declared effective by the Commission and copies of which have heretofore been delivered to the Underwriter. The registration statement, as amended at the time it became effective, including the prospectus, financial statements, schedules, an exhibits and information (if any) deemed to be part of the registration statement at the time of effectiveness pursuant to Rule 434(d) under the Securities Act, is hereinafter referred to as the "Registration Statement." If the Company has filed or is required pursuant to the terms hereof to file a registration statement pursuant to Rule 462(b) under the Securities Act registering additional shares of Common Stock (a "Rule 462(b) Registration Statement"), then, unless otherwise specified, any reference herein to the term "Registration Statement" shall be deemed to include such Rule 462(b) Registration Statement. Other than a Rule 462(b) Registration Statement, which, if filed, becomes effective upon filing, no other document with respect to the Registration
 
Statement has heretofore been filed with the Commission other than any applicable prospectus supplements filed pursuant to Rule 424(b)(3). All of the Shares have been registered under the Securities Act pursuant to the Registration Statement or, if any Rule 462(b) Registration Statement is filed, will be duly registered under the Securities Act with the filing of such Rule 462(b) Registration Statement. No stop order suspending the effectiveness of either the Registration Statement or the Rule 462(b) Registration Statement, if any, has been issued and no proceeding for that purpose has been initiated or overtly threatened by the Commission. The Company, if required by the Securities Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission (the "Rules and Regulations"), proposes to file the Prospectus (as defined below) with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act ("Rule 424(b)"). The prospectus, in the form in which it is to be filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b), or, if the prospectus is not to be filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b), the prospectus in the form included as part of the Registration Statement at the time the Registration Statement became effective, is hereinafter referred to as the "Prospectus," except that if any revised prospectus or prospectus supplement shall be provided to the Underwriter by the Company for use in connection with the offering and sale of the Shares contemplated herein (the "Offering") which differs from the Prospectus (whether or not such revised prospectus or prospectus supplement is required to be filed by the Company pursuant to Rule 424(b)), the term "Prospectus" shall also refer to such revised prospectus or prospectus supplement, as the case may be, from and after the time it is first provided to the Underwriter for such use. Any preliminary prospectus or prospectus subject to completion included in the Registration Statement or filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424 under the Securities Act is hereafter called a "Preliminary Prospectus." Any reference herein to the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 which were filed under the Exchange Act (as defined below) on or before the effective date of the Registration Statement, the date of such Preliminary Prospectus or the date of the Prospectus, as the case may be, and any reference herein to the terms "amend," "amendment" or "supplement" with respect to the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include (i) the filing of any document under the Exchange Act after the effective date of the Registration Statement, the date of such Preliminary Prospectus or the date of the Prospectus, as the case may be, which is incorporated therein by reference and (ii) any such document so filed. All references in this Agreement to the Registration Statement, the Rule 462(b) Registration Statement, a Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus, or any amendments or supplements to any of the foregoing shall be deemed to include any copy thereof filed with the Commission pursuant to its Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval System ("EDGAR").
        (b) At the time of the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or any Rule 462(b) Registration Statement or the effectiveness of any post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement, when the Prospectus is first filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) or Rule 434 under the Securities Act ("Rule 434"), when any supplement to or amendment of the Prospectus is filed with the Commission, when any document filed under the Exchange Act was or is filed and at the Closing Date (as hereinafter defined), the Registration Statement and the Prospectus and any amendments thereof and supplements thereto complied or will comply in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Rules and Regulations and did not and will not contain an untrue
 
statement of a material fact and did not and will not omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein (i) in the case of the Registration Statement, not misleading and (ii) in the case of the Prospectus or any related Preliminary Prospectus in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. When any Preliminary Prospectus was first filed with the Commission (whether filed as part of the registration statement for the registration of the Shares or any amendment thereto or pursuant to Rule 424(a) under the Securities Act) and when any amendment thereof or supplement thereto was first filed with the Commission, such Preliminary Prospectus and any amendments thereof and supplements thereto complied in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Rules and Regulations and did not contain an untrue statement of a material fact and did not omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. No representation and warranty is made in this subsection (b), however, with respect to any information contained in or omitted from the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or any related Preliminary Prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by Underwriter specifically for use therein. The parties acknowledge and agree that such information provided by the Underwriter consists solely of the material included in paragraphs 4 and 8 under the caption "Underwriting" in the Prospectus.

        (d) Subsequent to the respective dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, except as disclosed in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus and in any amendments thereof and supplements thereto filed with the Commission, the Company has not declared, paid or made any dividends or other distributions of any kind on or in respect of its capital stock and there has been no material adverse change, or any development that would reasonably be expected to result in a material adverse change, whether or not arising from transactions in the ordinary course of business, in (i) the business, condition (financial or otherwise), results of operations, stockholders' equity, properties or prospects of the Company and each subsidiary of the Company listed on Schedule I hereto (the "Subsidiaries"), taken as a whole; or (ii) the long-term debt or capital stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (a "Material Adverse Change"). Since the date of the latest balance sheet presented, or incorporated by reference, in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has incurred or undertaken any liabilities or obligations, whether direct or indirect, liquidated or contingent, matured or unmatured, or entered into any transactions not in the ordinary course of businessincluding any acquisition or disposition of any business or asset, which are material to the Company and the Subsidiaries taken as a whole, except for liabilities, obligations and transactions which are disclosed in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus and in any amendments thereof and supplements thereto filed with the Commission.

        (e) As of December 9, 2004, the authorized, issued and outstanding capital stock of the Company was as set forth in the Prospectus under the caption "Description of Capital Stock." All of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company are fully paid and non-assessable and have been duly and validly authorized and issued, in compliance with all applicable state, federal and foreign securities laws and not in violation of or subject to any preemptive or similar right that does or will entitle any person, upon the issuance or sale of any security, to acquire from the Company or any Subsidiary any Common Stock or other security of the Company or any Subsidiary or any security convertible into, or exercisable or exchangeable for, Common Stock or any other such security (any "Relevant Security"), except for such rights as may have been fully satisfied or waived prior to the effectiveness of the Registration Statement. The Shares to be delivered on the Closing Date (as hereinafter defined), have been duly and validly authorized, are duly and validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable, have been issued in compliance with all applicable state, federal and foreign securities laws and have not been issued in violation of or subject to any preemptive or similar right that does or will entitle any person to acquire any Relevant Security from the Company or any Subsidiary upon issuance or sale of Shares in the Offering. The Common Stock and the Shares conform to the descriptions thereof contained or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus. Except as disclosed in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has outstanding warrants, options to purchase, or any preemptive rights or other rights to subscribe for or to purchase, or any contracts or commitments to issue or sell, any Relevant Security.
        (f) The Subsidiaries are the only subsidiaries of the Company within the meaning of Rule 405 under the Securities Act. Except for the Subsidiaries, as otherwise disclosed in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus and for the Company's ownership interest in each of Lightwave LLC and Pivotel, LLC, the Company holds no ownership or other interest, nominal or beneficial, direct or indirect, in any corporation, partnership, joint venture or other business entity. All of the issued shares of capital stock of or other ownership interests in each Subsidiary have been duly and validly authorized and issued and are fully paid and non-assessable and are owned directly or indirectly by the Company free and clear of any lien, charge, mortgage, pledge, security interest, claim, equity, trust or other encumbrance, or preferential arrangement of any kind whatsoever (a "Lien"), except to the extent that the capital stock of each of the Subsidiaries is pledged as security to the lenders under the Credit Agreement dated as of December 19, 2003 (as amended through the date of this Agreement) between the Company and the lenders and other parties as set forth therein.
        (g) Each of the Company and the Subsidiaries has been duly organized and validly exists as a corporation, partnership or limited liability company in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization. Each of the Company and the Subsidiaries is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing as a foreign corporation, partnership or limited liability company in each jurisdiction in which such qualification is required by law, other than those jurisdictions as to which the failure to be so qualified or in good standing could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on (i) the business, condition (financial or otherwise), results of operations, stockholders' equity, properties or prospects of the Company and the Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; (ii) the long-term debt or capital stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; or (iii) the Offering or consummation of any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Registration

Each such Consent is valid and in full force and effect, and neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has received written notice of any investigation or proceedings which has resulted in or, if decided adversely to the Company or any Subsidiary, could reasonably be expected to result in, the revocation of, or imposition of a materially burdensome restriction on, any such Consent. Each of the Company and the Subsidiaries is in compliance with all applicable laws, rules, regulations, ordinances, directives, judgments, decrees and orders, foreign and domestic, except where failure to be in compliance could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

        (j) No Consent of, with or from any judicial, regulatory or other legal or governmental agency or body or any third party, foreign or domestic, is required for the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement or consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, including the sale and delivery of the Shares to be sold and delivered hereunder, except the registration under the Securities Act of the Shares, which has become effective, and such Consents as may be

        (l) The financial statements, including the notes thereto, and the supporting schedules included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus present fairly in all material respects the financial position as of the dates indicated and the cash flows and results of operations for the periods specified of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus; except as otherwise stated in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, said financial statements have been prepared in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods involved; and the supporting schedules included in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus present fairly in all material respects the information required to be stated therein.
        (m) There are no pro forma financial statements which are required to be included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and Prospectus in accordance with Regulation S-X which have not been included as so required.

     (p) Neither the Company nor any of its affiliates that is directly or indirectly controlled by the Company (each, a "Controlled Affiliate") has taken, directly or indirectly, any action which constitutes or is designed to cause or result in, or which could reasonably be expected to constitute, cause or result in, the stabilization or manipulation of the price of any security to facilitate the sale or resale of the Shares.
     (q) Neither the Company nor any of its Controlled Affiliates has, prior to the date hereof, made any offer or sale of any securities which could be "integrated" for purposes of the Securities Act or the Rules and Regulations with the offer and sale of the Shares pursuant to the Registration Statement.
     (r) Except as disclosed in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, no holder of any Relevant Security has any rights to require registration of any Relevant Security as part or on account of, or otherwise in connection with, the offer and sale of the Shares contemplated hereby, and any such rights so disclosed have either been fully complied with by the Company or effectively waived by the holders thereof, and any such waivers remain in full force and effect.
     (s) The conditions for use of Form S-3 to register the Offering under the Securities Act, as set forth in the General Instructions to such Form, have been satisfied.
     (t) The documents incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference in the Prospectus, at the time they were or hereafter are filed with the Commission, complied and will comply in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Rules and Regulations, and, when read together with the other information in the Prospectus, do not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

     (w) There are no contracts or other documents (including, without limitation, any voting agreement), which are required to be described in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus or filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement by the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or the Rules and Regulations and which have not been so described or filed.
     (x) No relationship, direct or indirect, exists between or among any of the Company or any affiliate of the Company, on the one hand, and any director, officer, stockholder, customer or supplier of the Company or any affiliate of the Company, on the other hand, which is required by the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or the Rules and Regulations to
 
be described in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which is not so described as required. There are no outstanding loans, advances (except normal advances for business expenses in the ordinary course of business) or guarantees of indebtedness by the Company to or for the benefit of any of the officers or directors of the Company or any of their respective family members, except as disclosed in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus. The Company has not, in violation of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, directly or indirectly, including through a Subsidiary, extended or maintained credit, arranged for the extension of credit, or renewed an extension of credit, in the form of a personal loan to or for any director or executive officer of the Company.
        (y) Except as disclosed in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, there are no contracts, agreements or understandings between the Company and any person that would give rise to a valid claim against the Company or the Underwriter for a brokerage commission, finder's fee or other like payment in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Registration Statement and the Prospectus or, to the Company's knowledge, any arrangements, agreements, understandings, payments or issuance with respect to the Company or any of its officers, directors, stockholders, partners, employees, Subsidiaries or affiliates that may affect the Underwriter's compensation as determined by the NASD.
        (z) The Company and each Subsidiary owns or leases all such properties as are necessary to the conduct of its business as presently operated. The Company and the Subsidiaries have good title in fee simple to all real property and good title to all personal property owned by them, in each case free and clear of all Liens (i) except such as are described in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, (ii) except that all such real and personal property is subject to mortgages and liens granted as security to the lenders under the Credit Agreement dated as of December 19, 2003 (as amended through the date of this Agreement) between the Company and the lenders and other parties as set forth therein and (iii) except such as do not (individually or in the aggregate) materially affect the value of such property or interfere with the use made or proposed to be made of such property by the Company and the Subsidiaries; and any real property and buildings held under lease or sublease by the Company and the Subsidiaries are held by them under valid, subsisting and enforceable leases with such exceptions as are not material to, and do not interfere with, the use made and proposed to be made of such property and buildings by the Company and the Subsidiaries. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has received any written notice of any claim adverse to its ownership of any real or personal property or of any claim against the continued possession of any real property, whether owned or held under lease or sublease by the Company or any Subsidiary, except as could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
        (aa) The Company and each Subsidiary owns or possesses adequate right to use all patents, patent applications, trademarks, service marks, trade names, trademark registrations, service mark registrations, copyrights, licenses, formulae, customer lists, and know-how and other intellectual property (including trade secrets and other unpatented and/or unpatentable proprietary or confidential information, systems or procedures, "Intellectual Property") necessary for the conduct of their respective businesses as being conducted, except as could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any notice of infringement or conflict with asserted Intellectual Property rights of others, any notice that any of the technology employed by the
 
Company has been obtained or is being used by the Company in violation of any contractual obligation binding on the Company or, to the Company's knowledge, any contractual obligation binding on any of its officers, directors or employees or otherwise in violation of the rights of any person, and which such infringement, conflict or violation, if the subject of an unfavorable decision, would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
        (bb) Except as disclosed in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, the Company and the Subsidiaries maintain insurance or are self insured with sufficient reserves in such amounts and covering such risks as the Company reasonably considers adequate for the conduct of its business and the value of its properties and as is customary for companies engaged in similar businesses in similar industries, all of which insurance is in full force and effect, except where the failure to maintain such insurance could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. There are no material claims by the Company or any Subsidiary under any such policy or instrument as to which any insurance company is denying liability or defending under a reservation of rights clause. The Company reasonably believes that it will be able to renew its existing insurance as and when such coverage expires or will be able to obtain replacement insurance adequate for the conduct of the business and the value of its properties at a cost that would not have a Material Adverse Effect.
        (cc) Subject to applicable deductibles and customary limitations and exceptions, the Company has in effect insurance covering the Company and its directors and officers for liabilities or losses arising in connection with this Offering, including, without limitation, liabilities or losses arising under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Rules and Regulations.
        (dd) Each of the Company and the Subsidiaries has, in all material respects, accurately prepared and timely filed all federal, state, foreign and other tax returns that are required to be filed by it and has paid or made provision for the payment of all taxes, assessments, governmental or other similar charges, including without limitation, all sales and use taxes and all taxes which the Company or any Subsidiary is obligated to withhold from amounts owing to employees, creditors and third parties, with respect to the periods covered by such tax returns (whether or not such amounts are shown as due on any tax return). No deficiency assessment with respect to a proposed adjustment of the Company's or any Subsidiary' federal, state, local or foreign taxes is pending or, to the Company's knowledge, threatened, except as could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. The accruals and reserves on the books and records of the Company and the Subsidiaries in respect of tax liabilities for any taxable period not finally determined are adequate to meet any assessments and related liabilities for any such period and, since the date of most recent audited financial statements, the Company and the Subsidiaries have not incurred any liability for taxes other than in the ordinary course of its business. There is no tax lien, whether imposed by any federal, state, foreign or other taxing authority, outstanding against the assets, properties or business of the Company or any Subsidiary, except as could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.
        (ee) No labor disturbance by the employees of the Company or any Subsidiary exists or, to the Company's knowledge, is imminent which, (individually or in the aggregate), could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
 
        (ff) No "prohibited transaction" (as defined in either Section 406 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, including the regulations and published interpretations thereunder ("ERISA") or Section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended from time to time (the "Code")), "accumulated funding deficiency" (as defined in Section 302 of ERISA) or other event of the kind described in Section 4043(b) of ERISA (other than events with respect to which the 30-day notice requirement under Section 4043 of ERISA has been waived) has occurred with respect to any employee benefit plan for which the Company or any Subsidiary would have any liability which could (individually or in the aggregate) reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect; each employee benefit plan for which the Company or any Subsidiary would have any liability is in compliance in all material respects with applicable law, including (without limitation) ERISA and the Code; the Company has not incurred and does not expect to incur liability under Title IV of ERISA with respect to the termination of, or withdrawal from any "pension plan;" and each plan for which the Company would have any liability that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code is so qualified and nothing has occurred, whether by action or by failure to act, which could cause the loss of such qualification.
        (gg) There has been no storage, generation, transportation, handling, treatment, disposal, discharge, emission or other release of any kind of toxic or other wastes or other hazardous substances by, due to, or caused by the Company or any Subsidiary (or, to the Company's knowledge, any other entity for whose acts or omissions the Company is or may be liable) upon any property now or previously owned or leased by the Company or any Subsidiary, or upon any other property, which would be a violation of or give rise to any liability under any applicable law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree or permit relating to pollution or protection of human health and the environment ("Environmental Law"), except for violations and liabilities which, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. There has been no disposal, discharge, emission or other release of any kind onto such property or into the environment surrounding such property of any toxic or other wastes or other hazardous substances with respect to which the Company or any Subsidiary has knowledge, except as could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

litigation, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever, and any and all amounts paid in settlement of any claim or litigation), joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, as originally filed or any amendment thereof, or any related Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus, or in any supplement thereto or amendment thereof, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent but only to the extent that any such loss, liability, claim, damage or expense arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with the Selling Stockholder Statements or written information furnished to the Company by the Underwriter expressly for use therein. The parties agree that such information provided by the Underwriter consists solely of the material referred to in the last sentence of Section 1(b) hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement in or omission or alleged omission from any Preliminary Prospectus the indemnity agreement contained in this subsection (a) shall not inure to the benefit of any Underwriter (or any person who controls such Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act) from whom the person asserting any such losses, claims, damages or liabilities purchased the Shares concerned, to the extent that a Prospectus relating to such Shares was required to be delivered by such Underwriter under the Securities Act in connection with such purchase and any such loss, claim, damage or liability of such Underwriter results from the fact that there was not sent or given to such person, at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale of such Shares to such person, a copy of the Prospectus (exclusive of material incorporated by reference) if the Company had previously furnished copies thereof to such Underwriter. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have, including but not limited to other liability under this Agreement.
provided, however,
        (b) The Selling Stockholder shall indemnify and hold harmless the Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls the Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act against any and all losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses whatsoever as incurred (including but not limited to reasonable attorneys' fees and any and all expenses whatsoever incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever and any and all amounts paid in settlement of any claim or litigation), joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement for the registration of the Shares, as originally filed or any amendment thereof, or any related Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus, or in any supplement thereto or amendment thereof, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading but only with respect to untrue statements or omissions, or alleged untrue statements or omissions, made in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), or any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus (or any
 
amendment or supplement thereto) in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by the Selling Stockholder expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) or such Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto). The Underwriter acknowledges that the Selling Stockholder Statements constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the Selling Stockholder expressly for use in the Registration Statement relating to the Shares as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, related Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, as the case may be. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement in or omission or alleged omission from any Preliminary Prospectus the indemnity agreement contained in this subsection (b) shall not inure to the benefit of the Underwriter (or any person who controls the Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act) from whom the person asserting any such losses, claims, damages or liabilities purchased the Shares concerned, to the extent that a Prospectus relating to such Shares was required to be delivered by such Underwriter under the Securities Act in connection with such purchase and any such loss, claim, damage or liability of the Underwriter results from the fact that there was not sent or given to such person, at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale of such Shares to such person, a copy of the Prospectus (exclusive of material incorporated by reference) if the Company had previously furnished copies thereof to the Underwriter.
        (c) The Underwriter shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the Selling Stockholder, each of the directors of the Company, each of the officers of the Company who shall have signed the Registration Statement, and each other person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, against any losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses whatsoever as incurred (including but not limited to attorneys' fees and any and all expenses whatsoever incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever, and any and all amounts paid in settlement of any claim or litigation), joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, as originally filed or any amendment thereof, or any related Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that any such loss, liability, claim, damage or expense arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by the Underwriter specifically for use therein. The parties agree that such information provided by the Underwriter consists solely of the material referred to in the last sentence of Section 1(b) hereof. This indemnity will be in addition to any liability which the Underwriter may otherwise have, including but not limited to other liability under this Agreement.
        (d) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a), (b) or (c) above of notice of any claims or the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such
 
subsection, notify each party against whom indemnification is to be sought in writing of the claim or the commencement thereof (but the failure so to notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve the indemnifying party from any liability which it may have under this Section 8 to the extent that it is not materially prejudiced as a result thereof and in any event shall not relieve it from any liability that such indemnifying party may have otherwise than on account of the indemnity agreement hereunder). In case any such claim or action is brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies an indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate, at its own expense in the defense of such action, and to the extent it may elect by written notice delivered to the indemnified party promptly after receiving the aforesaid notice from such indemnified party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party; , that counsel to the indemnifying party shall not (except with the written consent of the indemnified party) also be counsel to the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the indemnified party or parties shall have the right to employ its or their own counsel in any such case, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party or parties unless (i) the employment of such counsel shall have been authorized in writing by one of the indemnifying parties in connection with the defense of such action, (ii) the indemnifying parties shall not have employed counsel to have charge of the defense of such action within a reasonable time after notice of commencement of the action, (iii) the indemnifying party does not diligently defend the action after assumption of the defense, or (iv) such indemnified party or parties shall have reasonably concluded that there may be defenses available to it or them which are different from or additional to those available to one or all of the indemnifying parties (in which case the indemnifying parties shall not have the right to direct the defense of such action on behalf of the indemnified party or parties), in any of which events such fees and expenses shall be borne by the indemnifying parties. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, effect any settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened claim, investigation, action or proceeding in respect of which indemnity or contribution may be or could have been sought by an indemnified party under this Section 8 or Section 9 hereof (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party thereto), unless (x) such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, investigation, action or proceeding and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or any failure to act, by or on behalf of the indemnified party, and (y) the indemnifying party confirms in writing its indemnification obligations hereunder with respect to such settlement, compromise or judgment.
provided however
     9. . In order to provide for contribution in circumstances in which the indemnification provided for in Section 8 hereof is for any reason held to be unavailable from any indemnifying party or is insufficient to hold harmless a party indemnified thereunder, the Company and the Selling Stockholder on the one hand and the Underwriter on the other hand shall contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses of the nature contemplated by such indemnification provision (including any investigation, legal and other expenses incurred in connection with, and any amount paid in settlement of, any action, suit or proceeding or any claims asserted, but after deducting in the case of losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses suffered by the Company and the Selling Stockholder, any contribution received by the Company and the Selling Stockholder from persons, other than the Underwriter, who may also be liable for contribution, including persons who control the Company or the
Contribution
 
Selling Stockholder within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, officers of the Company who signed the Registration Statement and directors of the Company) as incurred to which the Company, the Selling Stockholder and the Underwriter may be subject, in such proportions as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Selling Stockholder on the one hand and the Underwriter on the other hand from the Offering or, if such allocation is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportions as are appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to above but also the relative fault of the Company and the Selling Stockholder on the one hand and the Underwriter on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations; , the Selling Stockholder and the Underwriter shall be obligated to contribute under this Section 9 only with respect to losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses arising out of an untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission of a material fact made in reliance upon and in conformity with the information described in Section 8(b) or Section 8(c), respectively, hereunder. The relative benefits received by the Company and the Selling Stockholder on the one hand and the Underwriter on the other hand shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as (x) the total proceeds from the Offering (net of underwriting discounts and commissions but before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the Selling Stockholder bears to (y) the underwriting discount or commissions received by the Underwriter, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus. The relative fault of each of the Company and the Selling Stockholder on the one hand and of the Underwriter on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or a Selling Stockholder on the one hand or the Underwriter on the other hand and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company, the Selling Stockholder and the Underwriter further agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 9 were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 9. The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by an indemnified party and referred to above in this Section 9 shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any judicial, regulatory or other legal or governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 9, (i) the Underwriter shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the discounts and commissions applicable to the Shares underwritten by it and distributed to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which the Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission, (ii) the Selling Stockholder shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the total proceeds received by the Selling Stockholder from the offering of the Sha res by the Selling Stockholder by reason of any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission, and (iii) no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 9, each person, if any,
provided
 
who controls the Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Underwriter, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, each officer of the Company who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company and the Selling Stockholder, as applicable, subject in each case to clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of the immediately preceding sentence. Any party entitled to contribution will, promptly after receipt of notice of commencement of any action, suit or proceeding against such party in respect of which a claim for contribution may be made against another party or parties, notify each party or parties from whom contribution may be sought, but the omission to so notify such party or parties shall not relieve the party or parties from whom contribution may be sought from any obligation it or they may have under this Section 9 or otherwise.
     10. [This section left intentionally blank.]
     11. . If the Selling Stockholder shall default in its obligation to sell and deliver any Shares hereunder, then the Underwriter may, by notice to the Company, terminate this Agreement without any liability on the part of any non-defaulting party except that the provisions of Sections 1, 2, 6, 8, 9, 12, 13 and 14 through 19 inclusive hereof shall remain in full force and effect. No action taken pursuant to this Section 11 shall relieve the Selling Stockholder so defaulting from liability, if any, in respect of such default.
Selling Stockholder Default
     12. . All representations and warranties, covenants and agreements of the Underwriter, the Company and the Selling Stockholder contained in this Agreement or in certificates of officers of the Company or any Subsidiary or of the Selling Stockholder submitted pursuant hereto, including the agreements contained in Section 6, the indemnity agreements contained in Section 8 and the contribution agreements contained in Section 9, shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Underwriter or any controlling person thereof or by or on behalf of the Company or the Selling Stockholder, any of their officers and directors or any controlling person thereof, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Shares to and by the Underwriter. The representations contained in Sections 1 and 2 and the agreements contained in Sections 6, 8, 9, 12, 13 and 14 through 19 inclusive shall survive any termination of this Agreement, including termination pursuant to Section 11 or 13 hereof.
Survival of Representations and Agreements
     13. .
Effective Date of Agreement; Termination
        (a) This Agreement shall become effective upon the execution of this Agreement.
        (b) The Underwriter shall have the right to terminate this Agreement at any time prior to the Closing Date if (i) any domestic or international event or act or occurrence has materially disrupted, or in the opinion of the Underwriter will in the immediate future materially disrupt, the market for the Company's securities or securities in general; or (ii) if trading on The New York Stock Exchange ("the NYSE"), or The NASDAQ National Market (the "NASDAQ") shall have been suspended or been made subject to material limitations, or minimum or
 
maximum prices for trading shall have been fixed, or maximum ranges for prices for securities shall have been required, on the NYSE, the NASDAQ or by order of the Commission or any other governmental authority having jurisdiction; or (iii) if a banking moratorium has been declared by any state or federal authority or if any material disruption in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services shall have occurred; (iv) (A) if there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities or acts of terrorism involving the United States or there is a declaration of a national emergency or war by the United States or (B) if there shall have been any other calamity or crisis or any change in political, financial or economic conditions if the effect of any such event in (A) or (B), in the judgment of the Underwriter, makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offering, sale and delivery of the Shares on the terms and in the manner contemplated by the Prospectus; (v) any change, or any development or event involving a prospective change, in the condition (financial or other), business, properties or results of operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole which, in the judgment of the Underwriter, is material and adverse and makes it impractical or inadvisable to proceed with completion of the public offering or the sale of and payment for the Shares; or (vi) any suspension of trading of any securities of the Company on the New York Stock Exchange.
        (c) Any notice of termination pursuant to this Section 13 shall be in writing.

     Re: Quanta Services, Inc.
Ladies and Gentlemen:
     We have acted as counsel to Quanta Services, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the Underwriting Agreement dated December , 2004 (the "Agreement") among the Company, First Reserve Fund IX, L.P. and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. This opinion letter is delivered to you pursuant to Section 7(b) of the Agreement. Capitalized terms used herein have the meanings assigned to them in the Agreement unless they are otherwise defined herein.
     
     We have reviewed the Registration Statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-114938) (the "Registration Statement"), the Registration Statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-119134) (the "462(b) Registration Statement" and, together with the Registration Statement, the "Registration Statements") and such other documents and made such other investigation as we have considered appropriate for purposes of this opinion letter. As to certain matters of fact material to the opinions expressed herein, we have relied on the representations made in the Agreement and on certificates of public officials and of officers of the Company. We have not independently established or otherwise verified those facts.
     We have assumed, without independent verification or investigation, the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to originals of all documents submitted to us as copies, and the authenticity of the originals of all such copies. We also have assumed, without independent verification or investigation, the due authorization, execution and delivery of the Agreement by the parties thereto other than the Company.
     Based on the foregoing and subject to the limitations set forth below, we express the following opinions.
 
     1. The Company is a corporation validly existing and, based solely on a certificate dated December , 2004 of the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, in good standing under the law of the State of Delaware.

     2. The Company has the corporate power to own its properties and to conduct the business in which it is engaged as described in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus.
     3. The Company has the corporate power to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under the Agreement; has taken all corporate action necessary to authorize that execution, delivery and performance; and has duly executed and delivered the Agreement.
     4. The execution and delivery by the Company of the Agreement do not and the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated thereunder will not (a) result in a violation of any law of the United States or the State of New York or Delaware, any rule or regulation thereunder, or any order, writ, injunction or decree of any court or governmental authority binding on the Company of which we have knowledge, assuming the approvals and filings referred to in clause (b) of this paragraph 4 have been obtained or made, or (b) require any approval from or filing with any governmental authority under any law of the United States or the State of New York or Delaware, or under any rule or regulation thereunder, except for the filings and other actions required under or pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and other federal or state securities or "blue sky" laws and the rules of the New York Stock Exchange and the NASD, as to which we express no opinion in this paragraph.
     5. The execution and delivery by the Company of the Agreement do not, and the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated thereunder will not, (a) result in a violation of the Certificate of Incorporation or the By-laws of the Company, or (b) result in a violation of, or the creation or imposition of any lien or otherencumbrance upon any property or assets of the Company pursuant to, any agreement listed on Schedule II.
     6.

     7. The statements under the captions "Description of Capital Stock" and "Underwriting" in the Prospectus and in Item 15 of Part II of the Registration Statement, insofar as such statements constitute a summary of the legal matters, documents or proceedings referred to therein, fairly present the information called for with respect to such legal matters, documents and proceedings.
 
     8. The Company is not, and after giving effect to the offering and sale of the Shares as described in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, will not be, an "investment company" as such term is defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
     9. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is a "holding company," or a "subsidiary company" of a "holding company," or an "affiliate" of a "holding company" within the meaning of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended.
     10. The Registration Statements are effective under the Securities Act, and to our knowledge, no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statements or any post-effective amendment thereof has been issued and no proceedings therefore have been initiated or overtly threatened by the Commission, and all filings required by Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act have been made.

     Re: Quanta Services, Inc.
Ladies and Gentlemen:
     Reference is made to the Registration Statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-114938) (the "Registration Statement"), the Registration Statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-119134) (the "462(b) Registration Statement" and, together with the Registration Statement, the "Registration Statements"), the prospectus supplement dated December    , 2004 (the "Prospectus Supplement") and the base prospectus dated June 30, 2004 (together with the Prospectus Supplement, the "Prospectus") of Quanta Services, Inc. (the "Company") as to which we have acted as counsel. This letter is furnished to you pursuant to Section 7(b) of the Underwriting Agreement dated December    , 2004, among the Company, First Reserve Fund IX, L.P. and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. (the "Agreement"). Capitalized terms used herein have the meanings assigned to them in the Agreement unless they are otherwise defined herein.
     The primary purpose of our professional engagement was not to establish or confirm factual matters or financial or quantitative information, and many determinations involved in the preparation of the Prospectus are of a non-legal character. In addition, we have not undertaken any obligation to verify independently any of the factual matters set forth in the Prospectus or in the documents incorporated by reference therein and filed prior to the date hereof (the "Incorporated Documents"). Consequently, in this letter we are not passing upon and do not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus. Also, we do not make any statement herein with respect to any of the financial statements or related notes thereto, the financial statement schedules or the financial, statistical or accounting data contained or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus.
     We have reviewed the Prospectus including the Incorporated Documents and we have participated in conferences with representatives of the Company, its independent public accountants, and you and your counsel, at which conferences the contents of the Prospectus, the Incorporated Documents, and related matters were discussed.

J.P. MORGAN SECURITIES INC. 270 Park Avenue New York, New York 10017
Ladies and Gentlemen:
     I am General Counsel to Quanta Services, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company") and am delivering this opinion letter pursuant to Section 7(c) of the Underwriting Agreement dated December, 2004 (the "Agreement") among the Company, First Reserve Fund IX, L.P. ("First Reserve") and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. Capitalized terms used herein have the meanings assigned to them in the Agreement unless they are otherwise defined herein.
     
     I have reviewed the Registration Statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-114938) (the "Registration Statement"), the Registration Statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-119134) (the "462(b) Registration Statement" and, together with the Registration Statement, the "Registration Statements") and such other documents and made such other investigation as I have considered appropriate for purposes of this opinion letter. As to certain matters of fact material to the opinions expressed herein, I have relied on the representations made in the Agreement and on certificates of public officials and of officers of the Company. I have not independently established or otherwise verified those facts. Schedule I hereto lists certain subsidiaries of the Company (the "Significant Subsidiaries").
     I have assumed, without independent verification or investigation, the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted to me as originals, the conformity to originals of all documents submitted to me as copies, and the authenticity of the originals of all such copies. I also have assumed, without independent verification or investigation, the due authorization, execution and delivery of the Agreement by the parties thereto other than the Company.
     Based on the foregoing and subject to the limitations set forth below, I express the following opinions.
     1. Each of the Significant Subsidiaries is a corporation validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its state of incorporation. Each of the Significant Subsidiaries is duly
 
qualified to transact business and is in good standing as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction identified in Schedule II except as otherwise noted thereon.
     2. Each of the Significant Subsidiaries has the corporate power to own its properties and to conduct the business in which it is engaged as described in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus.
     3. The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 300,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $.00001 per share, 3,345,333 shares of limited vote common stock, par value $.00001 per share, and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $.00001 per share. All of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company, including the Shares to be delivered on the Closing Date, are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and have not been issued in violation of or subject to any preemptive or, to my knowledge, similar rights pursuant to law or the Company's Certificate of Incorporation. All of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of each Significant Subsidiary are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and are owned by the Company directly or through subsidiaries, free and clear of all Liens, except that the shares are pledged as security under the Company's credit agreement dated as of December 19, 2003.
     4. Except for the preemptive rights held by First Reserve, to my knowledge, no stockholder of the Company has any contractual preemptive right, right of first refusal, or similar right to subscribe for or purchase securities of the Company.
     5. The Shares to be sold to the Underwriter under the Agreement are listed on the New York Stock Exchange.
     6. To my knowledge, there are no legal or governmental actions, suits, or proceedings pending or overtly threatened against or affecting the Company or its Subsidiaries to which (i) the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or (ii) which has as the subject thereof any property of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, where in any such case (A) there is a reasonable possibility that such action, suit or proceeding might be determined adversely to the Company or such Subsidiary and (B) any such action, suit or proceeding, if so determined adversely, would reasonably be expected to, individually, or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.
     7. The execution and delivery by the Company of the Agreement do not, and the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated thereunder will not: (i) result in a violation of, or the creation or imposition of any lien or other encumbrance upon any property or assets of any Significant Subsidiary pursuant to, any of the terms, conditions, or provisions of any agreement known to me to which any Significant Subsidiary is a party or by which it is bound, except for such conflicts, defaults, or violations that would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, or (ii) result in a violation of (a) any of the terms, conditions, or provisions of the charter or by-laws of any Significant Subsidiary, (b) any Texas, Delaware corporate, or federal law or regulation applicable to any Significant Subsidiary (other than federal and state securities or blue sky laws, as to which I express no opinion in this paragraph),
 
or (c) to my knowledge, any judgment, decree, order, writ or injunction of any court or governmental authority binding on the Company or any Significant Subsidiary.
     8. To my knowledge, neither the Company nor any Significant Subsidiary is in violation of its charter or its by-laws or any law, administrative regulation or administrative or court decree applicable to the Company or any such Significant Subsidiary, or is in default in the performance or observance of any of the terms, conditions, or provisions of any agreement to which the Company or any such Significant Subsidiary is a party or by which it or its property is bound, except for such conflicts, defaults, or violations that would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.
     In addition, I have participated in conferences with representatives of the Company, its independent public accountants, and you and your counsel, at which conferences the contents of the Prospectus, the documents incorporated by reference therein (the "Incorporated Documents"), and any supplements or amendments thereto, and related matters were discussed, and although I am not passing upon and I do not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Prospectus or the Incorporated Documents (in each case, other than as specified above), and any supplements or amendments thereto, on the basis of the foregoing, no facts have come to my attention which cause me to believe that (a) the Registration Statementsat the time each of them became effective under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and as of the date hereofcontained or contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, (b) the Prospectus, as of the date of the Underwriting Agreement, and as of date hereof, contained or contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and (c) the Incorporated Documents, as of the date they were filed with the Commission, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (it being understood that I express no belief as to the financial statement schedules or the financial, statistical, or accounting data derived therefrom included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto).

     The opinions expressed herein are limited to the laws of the State of Texas, the corporate laws of the State of Delaware, and the federal laws of the United States, and I express no opinion as to the effect on the matters covered by this letter of the laws of any other jurisdiction. For the purposes of Paragraphs 1, 2, 3 and 7 hereof, I have assumed that the laws of the state of incorporation for each Significant Subsidiary are the same as the laws of the State of Delaware.
