Item 1.02
Termination Of A Material Definitive Agreement.
     Quanta Services, Inc. ("Quanta") is party to change of control employment agreements dated March 13, 2002 (the "Change of Control Agreements") with certain of its executives, including agreements with the following officers:
     The Change of Control Agreements provide each executive party thereto with specified severance payments if the executive's employment is terminated following a change of control of Quanta. These agreements are supplemental to other employments agreements that generally govern the employment relationship between Quanta and its executives.
     At a meeting held on December 2, 2004, the Board of Directors of Quanta determined that it would be in the best interests of the shareholders of Quanta to terminate the Change of Control Agreements. On December 9, 2004, Quanta delivered notice of termination of the Change of Control Agreements to each of the executive parties thereto. The Change of Control Agreements provide that, on each anniversary of the execution date thereof, they shall be renewed for an additional three-year term unless Quanta provides notice to the executive, within 60 days prior to the anniversary date, that the term of the agreement will not be so extended. Accordingly, as a result of the termination notices, the Change of Control Agreements will terminate on March 13, 2007.
