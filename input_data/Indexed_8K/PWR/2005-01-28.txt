Executive Summary & Selected Highlights
Founded in August 1997, with its IPO in February 1998, Quanta Services is a leading national provider of specialty contracting solutions to the electric power, natural gas, telecom, cable television and other industries. That is, Quanta's current and future customers are expecting  as they grow their businesses through mergers and increased outsourcing  specialty contractors to increase the scope of their service capabilities and geographic reach. Through its operating units located throughout the US, Quanta provides design, installation, repair, maintenance and emergency response services that enable its customers to reduce costs, increase operating efficiencies and improve network performance.
Quanta was created to respond to the increasing need for the outsourcing of infrastructure services.
The August 2003 power blackout, the largest in North America's history, brought to the forefront what the power industry has known for years: the nation's power grid is old, overloaded, and needs significant upgrading and maintenance to serve the country's current and future power needs. According to Platts, a leading energy news, research and consulting company, before the August 2003 blackout there were $27.5 billion worth of T&D projects to begin in 2004 and be completed by 2008. The discrepancy between the $27.5 billion earmarked before the blackout versus the $100 billion the Electric Power Research Industry estimates it would cost to fix the system illustrates the magnitude of the underinvestment by the electric utility industry in its T&D infrastructure over the years.
Quanta estimates that it will cost between $100 billion and $200 billion to upgrade and maintain the country's transmission and distribution (T&D) system adequately over the next ten to fifteen years.
Quanta and the industries it serves have faced the most difficult operating conditions in thirty years due to challenging economic and capital markets conditions and the collapse of the telecom industry. Though the Company believes that normal operating conditions may not return for some time, Quanta's utility customers have improved their balance sheets over the last 18 months and conditions in the telecom industry have stabilized. :
As operating conditions return to normal and growth opportunities return, there are several major trends that could generate long-term organic revenue growth opportunities of approximately 15% annually
Faced with extremely difficult operating conditions for the last three years, Quanta has focused on its operations and on maintaining a healthy financial position. As of September 30, 2004, Quanta had $217.7 million of cash on its balance sheet and $35.5 million in available borrowing capacity under its $185 million credit facility. For the nine months ended September 30, 2004, Quanta generated $85.5 million of cash provided by operating activities, which, less capital expenditures of $30.0 million yielded free cash flow of $55.5 million. In addition, to align its operations with the changing needs of its customers  who are themselves refocusing on their core operations  in 2003 Quanta reorganized its operations to focus on two primary client bases: Electric Power/Natural Gas and Telecom/Cable television.
Quanta believes it is well positioned, both financially and operationally, to operate in the current environment and to capitalize on future growth opportunities.

Quanta Services Company Overview
Founded in August 1997, with its IPO in February 1998, Quanta Services is a leading national provider of specialty contracting solutions to the electric power, natural gas, telecom, cable television, and specialty services industries. Through its operating units located throughout the US, Quanta provides design, installation, repair, maintenance and emergency response services that enable Quanta's customers to reduce costs, increase operating efficiencies and improve network performance. The Company also provides a variety of ancillary services such as inside electrical wiring; intelligent traffic networks; cable and control systems for light rail lines, airports and highways; and specialty rock trenching, directional boring and road milling for industrial and commercial customers.
That is, Quanta's customers are expecting specialty contractors to increase the scope of their service capabilities and geographic reach as they grow their businesses through mergers and increased outsourcing. Such requirements are a tall order for the average private specialty contractor, so in February 1998, Quanta went public to obtain additional capital to pursue a strategy of "smart growth" consolidation coupled with organic growth, driven by the growth in infrastructure services outsourcing trends and increased customer demands.
Quanta was created to respond to the increasing need for outsourced infrastructure services.
After its IPO, Quanta selectively acquired approximately 85 specialty contractors over several years to increase the scope of its services, expand its geographic reach and diversity, and enhance its future growth opportunities. Though initially focused on the electric utility industry, Quanta expanded into the telecom and cable television infrastructure services industries as its core utility customers began expanding into those unregulated sectors and turned to Quanta to perform simultaneous electrical, telecom and cable television related projects.
With the challenges in the telecom and cable television sectors, Quanta's utility customers largely have ceased pursuing telecom and cable television initiatives and have refocused on the electric and gas utility side of their businesses. To meet the ever changing needs of its core customers, Quanta has reorganized its operations to focus on two primary client bases: Electric Power/Natural Gas and Telecom/Cable Television.
 
Major Market Trends & Outsourcing Thesis
Heightened Awareness of Transmission and Distribution Network Upgrade Needs
The August 14, 2003 power blackout was the largest in North America's history. The statistics regarding the impact of the blackout are staggering:
Due to the number of people impacted by the catastrophic failure of the country's power grid, the event has increased the nation's awareness of what has been known in the power industry for many years: the nation's electrical grid is old, overloaded, and needs significant maintenance and expansion to handle the country's current and growing power needs. Despite previous power blackouts since the 1960s that left tens of millions of people in the dark, expansion and maintenance of the grid has fallen short. As the country's population has grown and technology has become a larger part of everyday life,
generating capacity has increased nearly eight fold over the past ten years
2
while demand for electricity has grown over 20%
3
. However, transmission capacity over the last ten years has fallen by approximately 16% and is expected to decline by approximately 7% from 2003 to 2008
4
.
So far, the August 2003 blackout has caught the attention of the media, the general population, the politicians, and the electric utility industry, and discussions are ongoing to find solutions to remedy the problem. For example, the Electric Power Research Institute
began a public education campaign to raise some $100 billion from investors, governments and consumers to upgrade the nation's power grid.
 
The August 2003 blackout was the worst in the nation's history, but it was not the first major blackout impacting North America, and unfortunately, may not be the last. The accompanying table lists examples of other major bulk electric system power outages that have hit North America. Note that this list excludes many past power outage events that also impacted many people, such as the rolling blackouts experienced in California during 2000 and 2001.
Further, each year there are smaller power outages that occur throughout North America that do not get significant media attention, but are more frequent than one would expect. The dots in the chart below represent individual outages in North America between 1984 and 1997.
 
Customers Focusing on Core Business; Value of End-to-End Solutions
All of the industries Quanta serves are facing very competitive environments. With challenging economic and capital market conditions over the last few years, many companies in the electric and gas utility, telecom, and cable television industries have refocused on core operations, operating efficiencies and prudent capital investment in their networks. The absolute dollar amount of network capital expenditures by Quanta's customers has declined over the past few years. However, conditions generally have stabilized and Quanta's customers will need to begin investing in the development and maintenance of their networks once again.
Small owner-operated contractors are not as well positioned as Quanta to serve the broad range of needs that many utilities, telecom, and cable television companies request. Further, service providers are reducing the number of vendors they deal with to reduce paperwork, bidding and vendor management costs, and time.
One way for Quanta's customers to focus on core operations, operating efficiencies and prudent capital investment is to outsource non-revenue-generating functions, such as network infrastructure development and maintenance.
Increasingly, the industries Quanta serves are looking for companies like Quanta that are able to provide a wide array of network infrastructure services on a national basis  on time and on budget.
Increased Infrastructure Outsourcing
Challenging economic and capital market conditions, stiff competition amongst their peers, focus on efficiencies, and the need to enhance and maintain the lifeblood of their business  their networks - - are causing companies in the electric and gas utility, telecom, and cable television industries to increase the amount of network infrastructure work they outsource to specialty contractors like Quanta Services.
     Quanta estimates that annual infrastructure spending in the primary industries Quanta serves is approximately $30 - $40 billion. Quanta further estimates that the electric power industry typically outsources approximately 30%-40% of its infrastructure work to specialty contractors, telecom typically outsources approximately 50%-60% of its infrastructure work, and cable television typically outsources approximately 70% - 80% of its infrastructure work to specialty contractors. As economic, capital market, and operating conditions improve for Quanta's customers and they return to more normalized levels of investment in their networks, Quanta's annual addressable market opportunity and the amount of work that is outsourced should grow.
 
In addition to service providers outsourcing elements of their network installation and maintenance activities, Quanta believes there is significant opportunity in its customers completely outsourcing the operation and maintenance of their network infrastructure (utilities, telecom and cable television companies alike). In fact,
Quanta is the only specialty contractor to successfully develop and implement a complete infrastructure outsourcing program with an electric utility.
Puget Sound Energy was one of the first utilities to announce that it would progressively outsource 100% of its infrastructure operations and maintenance functions. Puget Sound considered twelve different companies for this vital task and chose Quanta for both electric and gas infrastructure outsourcing initiatives. Today, Quanta is managing all electric and gas construction for new residences and businesses in Puget Sound's Washington service area, as well as managing all related inventory and materials. Productive work hours have increased by at least one hour per day, a 30% cost savings over historical numbers is projected, and service levels continue to improve. Puget Sound and Quanta forged new ground with this outsourcing model. As it has proven successful, more and more companies are seriously examining a complete outsourcing model.
 
Massive Need for Transmission & Distribution Upgrades & Maintenance
The August 2003 power blackout, the largest in North America's history, brought to the forefront what the power industry has known for years: the nation's power grid is old, overloaded, and needs significant upgrades and maintenance to serve the country's current and future power needs. With a now concerned public and 50 million angry northeastern constituents, politicians began taking the grid's most spectacular failure seriously and are engaging in discussions toward clarifying the regulatory uncertainty so that electric utilities will have the economic incentive to and be able to attract capital investment for upgrading and maintaining the nation's power grid.
The challenge the industry faces is not one of a shortage of electricity and generating capacity, but capacity strains and bottlenecks for transmitting and distributing the electricity to the end user. The map above depicts the nation's major transmission lines and identifies key capacity constraints. As indicated, there are a troubling number of key transmission capacity constraints. While demand for electricity has grown over 20% over the past decade, transmission capacity has fallen by approximately 16% and is expected to decline further by approximately 7% from 2003 to 2008.

Following the August 2003 blackout, the power industry began a campaign to raise $100 billion from investors, governments, and consumers to upgrade the various power grids across the nation. According to Platts, before the August 2003 blackout there was $27.5 billion worth of T&D projects to begin in 2004 and be completed by 2008. The discrepancy between the amount of earmarked projects before the blackout versus the $100 billion investment the power industry is now trying to attract illustrates the magnitude of the electric power industry's underinvestment in its T&D infrastructure over the years.
Quanta estimates that it will cost between $100 billion and $200 billion to significantly upgrade and maintain the country's transmission and distribution (T&D) system over the next ten to fifteen years.
Prior to the August 2003 blackout, R.J. Rudden Associates estimated that bringing spending in line with forecast demand would require a 25% annual increase in transmission spending and a 50% annual increase in distribution spending.
The majority of the nation's T&D infrastructure was built shortly after World War II, is over 50 years old in many cases, and is beyond its useful life. The table below illustrates the number of poles installed annually by a particular electric power utility. While the identity of the specific utility will remain concealed, the chart illustrates an investment pattern that is typical for the average US electric utility. The vast majority of the grid system was installed from 1945 to the late 1970's. With these assets already past or rapidly approaching the end of their useful life, as depicted in the chart below, there is significant demand for pole repair and replacement going forward based on past T&D investment.
 
Electric utilities have underinvested in their T&D infrastructure for three primary reasons: (1) uncertainty regarding the final terms of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (FERC) standard market design proposal, (2) the inability to recover investment costs in T&D investment under state imposed rate freezes, and (3) balance sheet issues resulting from energy trading losses, telecom business investments, etc. Note that many of the state rate freezes began to expire in 2003 and pressure will mount on utilities to invest in their T&D infrastructure.
     It is troubling that investment in T&D infrastructure has declined over the years while demand for electricity has meaningfully increased. Coupled with the fact that much of the nation's T&D infrastructure is 50 years old, it is apparent that the power industry is increasingly relying on aging assets. This is a recipe for significant future problems as power demand increases on an aged and overloaded grid.
     The accompanying table adjusts the dollar figures from the "Capital Spending" table on the previous page to year 2000 dollars and assumes that T&D assets have a 40 year useful life. The data suggests (1) capital spending has not been enough to replace old transmission assets and (2) distribution has not earmarked enough spending to replace aging distribution assets in the future.
     As the charts and data show, utility investment in the expansion and maintenance of T&D assets has lagged what is needed. Further, there is significant pending demand for the replacement and repair of poles that were installed 50 years ago.
 
Expanding and improving current T&D assets to meet current and future power demand is a daunting task. Further complicating the issue, the demand for electricity is expected to continue to grow at a healthy rate for the next few decades as (1) the country's population expands and (2) we become increasingly dependent on technology, which requires power.
The map below illustrates the estimated demand for electricity by state in the US from 2003 to 2014. It is estimated that overall electricity demand in the US will grow in excess of 20% over this period. Areas such as California and the northeastern US are expected to have 40%-55% increases in electricity demand over the period; note both are areas that have had major blackouts and brownouts in the past few years.
The electric utility industry finds itself in the position of playing catch-up from underinvestment, needing to replace and repair a significant amount of its legacy distribution network, and properly plan for future electricity demand. While the August 2003 blackout has caught the attention of utilities and politicians, it is too early to determine if it will result in real efforts to fix the grid. To the extent that this wake up call is heeded, it may take twelve months or more before hurdles are crossed and serious T&D investment begins. However, as one of the largest specialty electrical infrastructure contractor in the country, Quanta is well positioned to meet the needs of its customers and to harvest the fruits of future increases in T&D network investment by the electric utility industry.
 
Quanta Services Operations Overview
For the quarter ending September 30, 2004, revenues generated by customers in the electric power and natural gas industries accounted for approximately 68% of revenue, telecom for approximately 12%, cable television for approximately 3% and ancillary services for approximately 17%. For the year 2003, revenues generated by customers in the electric power and natural gas industries accounted for approximately 60% of revenue, telecom for approximately 15%, cable television for approximately 7%, and ancillary services for approximately 18%.
Quanta estimates that the combined historical average market opportunity for infrastructure spending is approximately $30  $35 billion annually. Of that, Quanta estimates that the largest public and private specialty contractors serving these combined industries only account for 15% or less of the market. Quanta estimates that it commands the largest portion of this estimated 15% share, but that it is less than 5% of the total addressable market. The balance of the market is served by smaller, typically private companies. With its greater scope of services, greater financial and organizational resources, and superior work force, Quanta believes it has significant opportunities to increase its market share over time. Quanta estimates that approximately 30%-40% of electric and gas infrastructure work is typically outsourced, 50%-60% of telecom infrastructure work is outsourced, and 70%-80% of cable television infrastructure work is outsourced currently.
As the accompanying charts depict, the percentage of revenues Quanta derived from the telecom and cable television industries in 3Q04 declined versus the year 2001. This is primarily due to the historic collapse of the telecom market and challenging operating environment in the cable television market. As a result, nearly all of Quanta's telecom and cable television customers have been experiencing operating and financial challenges for several years, and a number of Quanta's telecom and cable television customers have filed for bankruptcy. As a result, capital expenditures and overall network investment by the telecom and cable television sectors have declined significantly versus levels in the late 1990s and early 2000, and also relative to normal historical levels.
 
Quanta believes the historic downturn of the telecom industry has reached bottom and that the industry has stabilized. Further, there are several telecom initiatives currently in discussion and underway by several government organizations, wire line carriers and wireless carriers that could provide Quanta with pockets of opportunity for its telecom group in the future. However, Quanta currently does not believe these opportunities are indicative of an overall return to historical network investment levels by the telecom industry as a whole.
With the stabilization of several of Quanta's markets, the Company has begun to see gross margins generally stabilize as well. While operating conditions are still abnormal and many challenges remain, Quanta is also beginning to see some opportunity for margins to improve slightly, but they are not expected to return to historical levels in the near term. To the extent that Quanta's primary markets remain stable or begin to improve, margins could gradually continue to improve.
Quanta is unique from its competitors because it has always had a diversified network infrastructure service offering for its customers and a diversified customer base. Thus, Quanta is not overly reliant on a given industry or client for business. For 3Q04 Quanta's largest customer accounted for 5% of revenues. For 3Q04 Quanta's top ten and top twenty customers accounted for approximately 29% and 41% of revenues, respectively. This diverse customer base reduces Quanta's reliance on any one customer in a given period and is one reason why the Company was able to remain financially healthy through the tumultuous telecom downturn over the past few years.
Quanta has low customer concentration...
* For quarter ending 10/04
Quanta's backlog at the end of 3Q04 was approximately $1.070 billion, which is the amount of work expected to be completed over the next 12 months, including estimates of work under long-term maintenance contracts and new contractual agreements on work that has not yet begun. Quanta's 3Q04 backlog of $1.070 billion was up versus its 2Q04 backlog of $1.042 billion, and up versus 3Q03 backlog of $983 million. Approximately one third of Quanta's revenues are typically derived from strategic alliances the Company has with various customers, engineering firms, manufacturers, distributors, and others.
 
These factors include influences due to weather, capital expenditure spending patterns, bidding seasons, and holidays. Typically, the of the year is the slowest for Quanta, since weather is typically cold, snowy, or wet, and the bidding season for projects to commence throughout the year is just beginning. The is typically better than the first, as some projects begin, but cold and wet weather can often impact second quarter productivity. The is typically the best of the year, as projects are in full swing and weather is typically accommodating to work on projects. The of the year is typically not as good as the third, but a bit better than the second. Projects begin to complete in the fourth quarter, things tend to slow due to the holiday season, and weather can sometimes impact work. However, the fourth quarter can remain robust if some of Quanta's customers have not yet finished spending their budget, and they race to spend their remaining funds. The Company would note that it has not experienced these normal seasonal patterns for the last few years due to the meltdown in the telecom industry, slowing on the cable television side of the business, and starts and stops from the utility sector as they have dealt with challenging economic and capital market conditions.
It is important to understand that Quanta's business is typically influenced by seasonal factors.

Electric Utility Infrastructure Services
Quanta performs a complete range of specialty contracting installation, maintenance and repair services for the electric utility industry. Types of electric utility customers include investor-owned utilities (IOUs), independent power producers (IPPs), rural electric associations (REAs) and federal, state and municipal agencies.
As the largest specialty electric power contractor in the US, Quanta has some of the most experienced contractors and employees in the industry. In fact, many of the companies that are now part of Quanta contributed to the original build-out of the national transmission and distribution system over 70 years ago.
Quanta has the ability to handle any electrical infrastructure need for its customers. From project-based engineering and construction of a multi-state, several hundred mile, high voltage transmission line and substation system to complex underground distribution networks, Quanta can handle every size and scope of power project. In fact, there are more than 200,000 miles of overhead electrical lines and thousands of miles of underground electrical cable that have been built and/or are maintained by Quanta Services.
Some of Quanta's power infrastructure services capabilities include:
 
Energized Services
One of Quanta's significant competitive advantages on the power side is its unmatched expertise and capabilities in the field of energized services. Quanta's Energized Services and techniques enable Quanta to perform a wide variety of installation, maintenance, rebuild and repair services to almost all parts of an electric network while the network remains energized, without service interruption. Unique to Quanta's specialty electrical service offering is its exclusive, patented LineMaster Robotic Arm. Quanta owns the US rights and the exclusive right to use the LineMaster Robotic Arm for more than the next 10 years. The LineMaster Robotic Arm is used in the construction, maintenance, repair, and improvement of energized T&D lines and substation facilities, and can reduce project completion times by more than 50% versus traditional methods. The telescoping robotic arm temporarily supports live power lines to allow repair or replacement of transmission poles, cross-arms, insulators, etc., while maintaining an energized connection.
TM
Importantly, this capability prevents Quanta's customers from having to shut down a portion of the power grid to allow work to be done, eliminating downtime costs and angry consumers.
- Hotstick and barehand techniques also enable crews to work on lines without interrupting the customer's power supply. Quanta uses hotsticks to move conductors, install fuses, and open and close switches. For more intricate repairs, Quanta's crews use barehand techniques in which live-line workers wear specially designed protective gear that enables them to work at the same electrical potential as the line. Quanta's employees performing energized services are hand-selected, experienced journeymen, each of whom have completed more than 120 hours of specialized barehand training and annual, recurrent training to be "energized certified".
Hotstick & Barehand
Barehand crews can safely handle and efficiently repair live lines up to 765kV. On one project, Quanta used barehand techniques to repair a nuclear plant's 345kV substation switches in one day without shutting down the reactor. - the cost associated with shutting down the reactor, making repairs, returning it to operation and making spot market power purchases during the down time.
This saved the utility an estimated $10 million
Coupling the LineMaster Robotic Arm technology with Quanta's barehand and hotstick methods provides a complete energized solution that increases efficiency, reliability, levelization, and safety.
 
Energized Services Case Study
Kansas City Power & Light (KCP&L) was experiencing transmission congestion on its 345kV LaCygne-Stilwell Line, representing a major bottleneck for members and customers of the Southwest Power Pool (SPP) who rely on the line for service. Since the line was vital to the service needs of KCP&L and the SPP, taking the line out of service for any extended period of time for upgrades would have proved extremely disruptive in the form of lost revenue, power outages, and angry customers.
Since the line was built in 1972, KCP&L had done a number of system augmentations including substation enhancements at either end of the line as well as installing monitoring equipment that provided incremental capacity as power demand grew over the years. However, as KCP&L looked for additional capacity enhancements for the line, it became clear that KCP&L would have to rebuild or upgrade the line to truly solve its capacity problem.
The advent of a high-temperature conductor, or ACSS (aluminum conductor steel supported), meant that the ACSS could carry twice the load of the conductors KCP&L was using on the line, and that if the 345-kV line could be reconductored with the ACSS, KCP&L could use the existing H-frames supporting the line. If this were able to be done while the line remained energized, the line's capacity problem would be solved and customers would not experience any service disruption.
Because of Quanta's unmatched expertise in energized services, proprietary tools and work methods, KCP&L approached Quanta to work toward a rebuild solution on the 345-kV LaCygne-Stillwell Line. Quanta worked with KCP&L and developed a plan predicated on reconductoring the line while energized at 345-kV. At that time, Quanta had worked on many energized projects for KCP&L, but none of this magnitude.
To do the job, Quanta used the Equal Potential Stringing Method, which isolated the working area and the conductor being pulled, used proprietary processes, tools and equipment to solve complicated issues and completed the project  all while the line remained in service. The project ran smoothly and was completed a month ahead of schedule, a major accomplishment given the snow and mud experienced at the start of the project in February and spring rains and storms in May.
In summary, Quanta and KCP&L broke new ground with this project in solving transmission congestion problems and upgrading conductors in an energized state. The project was completed ahead of schedule in under five months and cost less than $8 million. Had the line been replaced using traditional installation methods, the project would have taken longer, required the line to be shut down for periods at a time, been significantly more costly, and been disruptive to customers.
 
Natural Gas & Pipeline Services
Like the electric power industry, the continued growth of the natural gas industry is expected to generate significant activity, including the development of new pipelines and expansion or upgrades of current systems. Natural gas consumption in the US is expected to rise significantly over the next two decades. It is estimated that the US needs 263,000 miles of distribution pipelines and another 38,000 miles of large diameter transmission pipelines. With the implementation of new legislative mandates requiring more structured and regular maintenance and monitoring of systems, there has been a sharp increase in demand for gas and pipeline services.
Quanta is involved in the assessment, development, maintenance, and expansion of natural gas pipelines. Quanta delivers a comprehensive set of solutions for the natural gas and pipeline industries, including surveying, designing, installing, maintaining, and repairing and testing for all systems and methods of transmitting natural gas. This includes transmission and distribution pipelines, gathering systems, compressor stations, and meter stations.
Quanta also provides services for:
Telecom Network Services
Quanta is equipped to provide a complete scope of services to the telecom industry for both wire line and wireless services and is well positioned to capitalize on the demand for services related to fiber to the premise (FTTP) and fiber to the node (FTTN) initiatives. Quanta's telecom customers include incumbent local exchange carriers (ILECs), long-distance carriers, rural telecom providers, competitive local exchange carriers (CLECs), wireless carriers, and others. Quanta not only configures telecom networks, but also provides the services to design, install, operate, test and maintain them. Quanta has the capabilities to install and maintain fiber optic networks across the country, through mountains, valleys and prairies, to businesses, buildings and homes, telephones and modems. From route selection to positioning of the product, Quanta's telecom network services group provides a turnkey solution.

Specialty Services
In addition to the comprehensive services previously described, Quanta provides a number of specialty services, many of which have applications and customers that span the electric and gas utility, telecom, and cable television industries. Quanta's specialty services capabilities include:
 
Understanding Margins
It is important to understand how various factors - some controllable, some not - impact Quanta's gross margins on a quarterly or annual basis.
Again, it is important to understand how various factors impact gross margin. Just because gross margin narrows in a quarter may not mean that Quanta is not managing its costs of services well.
 
Quanta's Growth Strategy  Steady Organic Growth Supplemented by Selected Acquisitions
As discussed, the past three years have been the most challenging and abnormal operating environments for Quanta and its peers in thirty years. No one could have predicted the severity and depth of the telecom industry's collapse and challenging environment for cable television, leading to the significant reduction in network development and maintenance investment. The electric power industry, to a lesser extent, was impacted as well.
Throughout this period, Quanta transitioned from a company focused on growth to a company focused on managing its business in a tumultuous environment. Quanta has been successful in reducing its cost structure, streamlining and focusing on operations, and improving its balance sheet. Though the operating environment has not returned to normal or demonstrated a return to a growth trend, Quanta has positioned itself to operate successfully in the current environment and is well positioned to capitalize on growth opportunities as conditions improve.
In normal market conditions, Quanta enjoyed solid organic revenue growth in excess of 20%. Quanta believes that a sustainable long-term organic revenue growth rate for its business is approximately 10% to 15% in normal operating conditions. This growth will be driven by the need to invest in the expansion and maintenance of the nation's power grid and continued development and maintenance of telecom and cable television networks as technology continues to develop new applications and services. It will also be driven by increased network infrastructure installation and maintenance outsourcing trends.
Since the founding of Quanta, the Company has augmented its organic growth with strategic acquisitions of top tier companies, enabling it to expand its service offering and geographic reach to better serve its customers. Quanta has not completed an acquisition since early 2002, but as business conditions return to normal, Quanta may elect to selectively and opportunistically pursue the acquisition of companies to continue to enhance its service offering and expand its geographic reach.
We would note that Quanta has not purchased start-up companies or turnarounds, instead focusing on companies with an average operating history of 20 to 30 years and with a record of operational excellence and profitability. Quanta has a disciplined acquisition approach that focuses on various financial, geographic, and management criteria including:
 
Recent Financial Results & Commentary
Quanta's 3Q04 results generally came in at the high end or exceeded its previously disclosed 3Q04 financial outlook as a result of continued gradually improving operating and financial performance and increased stability in the end-markets Quanta serves. Further, there were several developments in 3Q04 that signal a steadily improving operating environment in the near and far term. Several events occurred in 3Q04 that impacted Quanta:
3Q04 financial results included the following highlights:
Gross margin (including depreciation expense) in 3Q04 was 12.6%, up versus 2Q04 gross margin of 11.9% and flat versus 12.6% in 3Q03. Excluding the $8.6 million insurance charge Quanta incurred in 3Q04, gross margin would have been 14.5%. The increase in gross margin in 3Q04 versus 2Q04 was due to storm work in the Southeast due to the hurricanes and normal seasonal improvements in margins. Excluding the insurance charge, utility margins were higher in 3Q04 compared to 3Q03 and 2Q04, while margins in the other industries Quanta serves were very close to margins earned in those industries in both 2Q04 and 3Q03.
Revenue Breakdown by Type of Customer
G&A expenses increased in 3Q04 to $44.3 million versus $39.2 million in 3Q03. Approximately $2.2 million of the increase is attributable to incurring net losses on the sale of property and equipment. Quanta's G&A expenses continue to be higher than normal due to ongoing professional fees associated
 
with Sarbanes-Oxley documentation and testing. In addition, Quanta incurred approximately $500,000 in expense related to the offering of a portion of First Reserve's shares during the quarter.
Quanta's net income attributable to common stock in 3Q04 was $4.2 million, or $0.04 per diluted share versus net income of $5.4 million, or $0.05 per diluted share in 3Q03. As discussed, 3Q04 results were negatively impacted by a pretax insurance charge of approximately $8.6 million, which was the result of higher than anticipated insurance claims developed during the quarter.
Cash flow from operations in 3Q04 was approximately $45.8 million. Cash flow from operations of $45.8 million less capital expenditures in the quarter of approximately $10.5 million generated free cash flow of approximately $35.3 million in 3Q04. Cash flow in 3Q04 was positively impacted by the receipt of a $30.2 million tax refund and $23.5 million from the sale of Quanta's Adelphia receivable. Cash flow from operations was negatively impacted by increased working capital requirements as revenues in the quarter increased by $73.9 million sequentially over 2Q04.
For the nine months ending September 30, 2004, cash flow from operations was $85.5 million. Subtracting nine month capital expenditures of $30.0 million yields free cash flow of $55.5 million for the same nine month period. For all of 2004, Quanta estimates it will generate approximately $100 million in free cash flow, inclusive of the $30.2 million tax refund and cash from the sale of the Adelphia receivable. To the extent telecom or utility projects accelerate through the balance of the year, free cash flow could be temporarily negatively impacted due to working capital and capital expenditure increases as projects ramp-up. However, such a development should have a positive impact on Quanta's revenue and profits.
Quanta's backlog at the end of 3Q04 was $1,070 million, up from backlog at the end of 2Q04 of $1,042 million, and up versus 3Q03 backlog of $983 million. For 3Q04, Quanta's largest customer accounted for 5% of revenues. Quanta's top 10 customers for the quarter accounted for 29% of revenues and top 20 customers accounted for 41% of revenues. At the end of 3Q04, Quanta's employee count was 11,122 versus 10,618 at the end of 2Q04.
Quanta's days sales outstanding (DSO), which includes current accounts receivable plus costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts less billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts, was 85 days at the end of 3Q04 versus 86 days at the end of 2Q04 and compared to 89 days at the end of 3Q03. Quanta's expects its DSOs to continue to decrease slightly through the balance of the year. Quanta's target DSO level is the mid-80 day range.
 
Quanta's electric power and natural gas operations experienced a significant increase in revenues in 3Q04 over 3Q03 primarily due to an increase in storm restoration work performed throughout the southeast resulting from hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan and Jeanne. Quanta deployed approximately 1,300 workers over a six-week span to participate in power restoration efforts. While the hurricanes resulted in additional work for Quanta in the southeast, as the storms traveled north and weakened in intensity, the resulting heavy rain and flooding caused delays on some projects that partially offset financial gains from storm restoration work.
The majority of the financial impact of the storm restoration work is reflected in 3Q04 results, but some ongoing work will continue. While much of the work immediately following the storms was directed at power restoration, additional work is needed to fully repair the impacted electric systems to get them operating reliably at full capacity. As a result of the impact of the storms, some Florida utilities are evaluating significant changes to their infrastructure to minimize susceptibility to future storm damage, for example, underground distribution systems.
In 3Q04 Quanta saw increased demand for transmission and distribution maintenance work by a number of utilities. Utilities across the country are regaining their financial health and are making plans to start spending on their T&D systems. As a result, Quanta anticipates more extensive pole change outs, line upgrades and maintenance projects on many systems over the next several quarters. Further, with the Presidential election complete, Quanta is hopeful that a comprehensive energy bill could be passed that could clarify regulatory uncertainties and provide proper incentives for the power industry to invest in and spend money on their transmission and distribution systems.
Quanta has seen spending levels in most of the industries it serves become increasingly stable with each quarter. Quanta saw increased activity in the telecom sector in 3Q04 that reinforces its belief that spending is returning to certain pockets of the telecom industry  particularly from fiber to the premise (FTTP) and fiber to the node (FTTN) initiatives. Such initiatives have been announced by Verizon and SBC Communications and municipalities have also become active in FTTP initiatives.
Quanta is working on FTTP projects for Verizon in California and Florida, performing path creation, cable placement, splicing, and permit management functions. Since the end of 3Q04 Verizon announced that it has added six more states to its deployment plan, with a stated goal to pass one million homes by the end of 2004 and two million additional homes in 2005.
Since the end of the quarter, three announcements have added momentum and incentives to FTTP and FTTN initiatives:
 
As a result of these various announcements, Quanta expects FTTP and FTTN activity to gain momentum over the next six months. Quanta remains active in the bidding process for various FTTP and FTTN projects around the country and is involved in higher level strategic negotiations regarding FTTP and FTTN strategies.
Spending in the cable television industry remains flat. However, with several telecom companies increasing the pace of their FTTP and FTTN projects that will enable them to offer TV services via fiber to their customers, such initiatives could serve as a catalyst for the cable industry to begin a new network upgrade cycle to expand its service offerings in an effort to retain and attract customers.
Quanta's wireless division continued to be impacted by the then pending AT&T Wireless and Cingular merger in 3Q04. Both customers limited capital expenditures in 3Q04 pending final merger approval by the FCC. In late October, the FCC announced that it had approved their merger and the two companies subsequently completed their merger. As a result, spending on wireless networks should gradually resume by the newly combined entity. In addition, several other wireless companies have announced plans to increase their cell site deployment plans over the next year.
Outlook
For 4Q04, Quanta expects revenues to range from $390 million to $410 million and that diluted EPS will range between a loss of $0.01 to income of $0.01. Quanta expects operating margins for 4Q04 to be between 1.0% and 2.0%; average diluted shares outstanding for 4Q04 to be approximately 115 million; and its effective tax rate for 4Q04 to be approximately 23%. Quanta estimates capital expenditures for full year 2004 of approximately $40 million. Quanta plans to announce its fourth quarter and full year 2004 financial results in early to mid-March, 2005.

Peer Operation & Valuation Comparison
The specialty contracting industry is highly fragmented and very competitive. Quanta estimates that its annual addressable market is approximately $30 billion to $40 billion. Quanta believes that the top five specialty contractors (based on revenues) account for approximately 15% of this annual market opportunity. Quanta estimates that it commands the largest portion of this estimated 15% share, but that it is less than 5% of the total addressable market. The remaining 85% market share is held by smaller, private specialty contracting companies.
With its diversified service offering and customer base, and national presence, Quanta is unique. Below is a table of Quanta's peers, indicating the various markets each specialty contractor serves. Also included is a peer valuation analysis of a broader peer group that includes several companies in the construction and engineering sector. While Quanta may not compete directly with some of these companies, they are included because they perform construction and engineering services and are often impacted by similar macro and/or other trends as Quanta. Of this peer group, InfraSource, Dycom Industries and MasTec are Quanta's closest public peers. However, both Dycom and MasTec focus more on the telecom and cable television industries and InfraSource does not have as large a geographic presence as Quanta does.

Director Compensation
The Governance and Nominating Committee has the responsibility of recommending to the Board non-employee directors' compensation and benefits. The committee is guided by certain director compensation principles set forth in Quanta's Corporate Governance Guidelines. Directors who also are employees of Quanta or any of its subsidiaries do not receive additional compensation for serving as directors. Each non-employee director receives a fee for attendance at each meeting of the Board of Directors or any committee according to the following schedule:
Upon initial appointment to the Board of Directors other than at an annual meeting of stockholders, each non-employee director receives a pro rata portion of (i) an annual cash retainer payment of $30,000 and (ii) an annual grant of shares of restricted stock with a value equal to $60,000 for the period from appointment through the end of the director service year during which the appointment is made. Upon initial election to the Board of Directors at an annual meeting of stockholders, each non-employee director receives an annual cash retainer payment of $30,000 and an award of shares of restricted stock with a value equal to $120,000. At each subsequent annual meeting of stockholders at which a non-employee director is re-elected or remains a director, the non-employee director receives an annual cash retainer payment of $30,000 and an award of shares of restricted stock with a value equal to $60,000. Directors are reimbursed for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in attending meetings of the Board of Directors or the committees thereof, and for other expenses reasonably incurred in their capacity as directors of Quanta.
On December 2, 2004, the Board of Directors of Quanta approved a revision to Quanta's director compensation, effective as of the 2005 Annual Meeting of the Board of Directors, that provides for the payment of annual cash retainers in the amounts of (a) $5,000 to the chairman of the Audit Committee and (b) $3,000 to the chairman of the Governance and Nominating Committee and to the chairman of the Compensation Committee.
