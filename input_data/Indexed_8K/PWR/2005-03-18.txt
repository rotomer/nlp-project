Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Principal Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Principal Officers.
In connection with First Reserve Fund IX, L.P.'s ("First Reserve") recent sale of 3,544,400 shares of Quanta Services, Inc.'s ("Quanta") common stock, Ben A. Guill resigned as a director of Quanta effective as of March 17, 2005. Immediately prior to its recent sale, First Reserve owned between 10% and 20% of Quanta's outstanding common stock and therefore retained the contractual right to designate one director for election to Quanta's board of directors. Pursuant to this contractual right, Mr. Guill served as First Reserve's designee to Quanta's board. First Reserve now owns less than 10% of Quanta's outstanding common stock. Consequently, First Reserve no longer has a contractual right to designate any directors for election to Quanta's board of directors resulting in Mr. Guill's resignation.
