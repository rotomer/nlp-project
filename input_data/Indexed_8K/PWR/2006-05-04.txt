Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On May 3, 2006, Quanta Services ("Quanta" or the "Company") completed the offering of $143.75 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2026 (the "Notes"). The Notes were offered and sold to the initial purchasers in reliance on Section 4(2) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"). The offers and resales of the Notes by the initial purchasers were made to qualified institutional buyers in transactions exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act in accordance with Rule 144A under the Securities Act.
In connection with the issuance and sale of the Notes, the Company entered into an indenture (the "Indenture"), dated as of May 3, 2006, between the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee. The description of the Notes and the Indenture set forth below in Item 2.03 is hereby incorporated into this Item 1.01 by reference.
In connection with the issuance and sale of the Notes, the Company also entered into a registration rights agreement, (the "Registration Rights Agreement"), dated as of May 3, 2006, with Banc of America Securities LLC, J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, in their capacity as representatives of the initial purchasers of the Notes (collectively, the "Initial Purchasers"). Under the Registration Rights Agreement, the Company has agreed to file a shelf registration statement with respect to the resale of the Notes and the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes within 120 days after the issuance of the Notes, and to use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the shelf registration statement to become effective within 210 days after the issuance of the Notes. The Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to keep the shelf registration statement effective until the earliest of (i) two years after the last date of the original issuance of any of the Notes, (ii) the sale pursuant to the shelf registration statement or pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act or any similar provision then in force of all the Notes or the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes, (iii) the date when all the Notes or shares of common stock issued upon conversion cease to be outstanding, or (iv) the date when the holders of the Notes and the common stock issuable upon conversion thereof are able to sell all such securities immediately without restriction pursuant to the volume limitation provisions of Rule 144 under the Securities Act or any similar provision then in force. The Company will be required to pay additional interest, subject to some limitations, to the holders of the Notes if it fails to comply with its obligation to register the resale of the Notes and the underlying common stock and to maintain the shelf registration statement effective. A copy of the Registration Rights Agreement, the terms of which are incorporated herein by reference, is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.
The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates have provided certain commercial banking, financial advisory and investment banking services to the Company or its affiliates for which they receive customary fees. Bank of America, N.A., an affiliate of Banc of America Securities LLC, is the administrative agent under the Company's existing senior secured credit facility, and Bank of America, N.A. and JPMorgan Chase, an affiliate of J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., and affiliates of certain of the other Initial Purchasers of the Notes are lenders under the Company's existing revolving credit facility. Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC indirectly owns less than one
 
percent of the outstanding common stock of the Company as a result of its investment in third party funds.
Item 2.03 Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.
On May 3, 2006, the Company completed the offering of $143.75 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2026 (the "Notes"). The terms and conditions of the Notes and related matters are set forth in the Indenture, dated as of May 3, 2006, between the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee (the "Indenture"). A copy of the Indenture, including the form of the Note, the terms of which are incorporated herein by reference, is attached as Exhibit 99.2 to this report.
The Notes rank junior in right of payment to all of the Company's existing and future senior indebtedness, including indebtedness under the Company's existing senior secured credit facility. The Notes rank equally in right of payment to all of the Company's other subordinated indebtedness and are effectively subordinated in right of payment to the existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of the Company's subsidiaries, including trade payables. The Notes bear interest at 3.75% per annum payable semi-annually in arrears on April 30 and October 30 of each year, beginning on October 30, 2006. The Notes will mature on April 30, 2026. Beginning with the six-month interest period commencing on April 30, 2010, and for each six-month interest period thereafter, the Company will pay contingent interest during the applicable interest period if the average trading price of the Notes reaches a specified threshold. The contingent interest payable within any applicable interest period will equal an annual rate of 0.25% of the average trading price of the Notes during a five trading day reference period.
The Company's obligations under the Notes are not guaranteed by the Company's subsidiaries or any third party.
The Notes are convertible, based on an initial conversion rate of 44.6229 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes (which is equal to an initial conversion price of approximately $22.41 per share), subject to adjustment, only in the following circumstances:
Upon conversion, the Company has the right to deliver, in lieu of common stock, cash or a combination of cash and common stock in the amounts described in the Indenture. Holders who convert their Notes in connection with certain change in control transactions may be entitled to a
 
make whole premium in the form of an increase in the conversion rate. In the event of a change in control, in lieu of paying holders a make whole premium, if applicable, the Company may elect, in some circumstances, to adjust the conversion rate and related conversion obligations so that the Notes are convertible into shares of the acquiring or surviving company.
Prior to April 30, 2010, the Notes are not redeemable. At any time on or after April 30, 2010 until April 30, 2013, the Company may redeem for cash all or part of the Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if the closing price of the Company's common stock reaches a specified threshold. In addition, the Company may redeem for cash all or part of the Notes at any time on or after April 30, 2010 at the redemption prices specified in the Indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest.
The holders of the Notes have the ability to require the Company to repurchase all or a part of the Notes in cash on each of April 30, 2013, April 30, 2016 and April 30, 2021, and in the event of a change in control of the Company, at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest.
Upon the occurrence of customary events of default, the principal amount of the outstanding Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, may be declared immediately due and payable. Events of default also include a cross-default provision with the Company's other debt instruments exceeding $20.0 million in borrowings.

The period during which the availability of the Shelf Registration, any Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus is suspended (the "") shall not exceed 45 days in any 90-day period or 120 days in the aggregate in any twelve-month period; provided, however, if the disclosure relates to a previously undisclosed proposed or pending material business transaction, the disclosure of which the Company determines in good faith would be reasonably likely to impede its ability to consummate such transaction, the Company may extend the suspension period from 45 days to 60 days;

                    (xvi) cause the Company's officers, directors and employees to supply all relevant information reasonably requested by such representatives of the Holders or any such attorney, accountant or agent in connection with the Shelf Registration Statement as is customary for similar due diligence examinations, subject to receipt of such confidentiality agreement;
                    (xvii) cause all Common Stock covered by the Shelf Registration Statement to be listed or quoted, as the case may be, on each securities exchange or automated quotation system on which the Common Stock is then listed or quoted; and

          (e) The Company shall cooperate and assist in any filings required to be made with the NASD by any underwriter, placement or sales agent, or broker or dealer that is required to be retained in accordance with the NASD Rules in connection with any sales of Securities pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement.
     4. .

Each Notice Holder agrees promptly to furnish to the Company all information required to be disclosed in order to make the information previously furnished to the Company by such Notice Holder not misleading and any other information regarding such Notice Holder and the distribution of such Registrable Securities as the Company may from time to time reasonably request. Any sale of any Registrable Securities by any Holder shall constitute a representation and warranty by such Holder that the information relating to such Holder and its plan of distribution is as set forth in the Prospectus delivered by such Holder in connection with such distribution, that such Prospectus does not as of the time of such sale contain any untrue statement of a material fact relating to or provided by such Holder or its plan of distribution and that such Prospectus does not as of the time of such sale omit to state any material fact relating to or provided by such Holder or its plan of distribution necessary to make the statements in such Prospectus, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
Holder's Obligations
     5. . The Company shall bear all of its expenses incurred in connection with the performance of its obligations hereunder.
Registration Expenses
     6. .
Indemnification and Contribution
          (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Holder of Securities covered by the Shelf Registration Statement, each Initial Purchaser and each person who controls any such Holder or Initial Purchaser within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or other federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Shelf Registration Statement as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or in any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, any preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, any preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made) not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by it in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; provided, however, that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of the party claiming indemnification specifically for inclusion therein and provided further, that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that a Holder fails to deliver, at or prior to the written confirmation of sale, the most recent Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, if such Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, had been previously furnished by or on behalf of the Company to such Holder and corrected such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission of a material fact and the delivery thereof by such Holder was required by law or any rule or regulation of any applicable stock exchange. This indemnity agreement shall be in addition to any liability that the Company may otherwise have.
 
          (b) Each Holder of Securities covered by the Shelf Registration Statement (including each Initial Purchaser that is a Holder, in such capacity) severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, officers and employees and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each such Holder, against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which the Company or such persons may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or other federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Shelf Registration Statement as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or in any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, any preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, any preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus, in light of the circumstances under which they were made) not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by it in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action, but in each case only to the extent that the untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information relating to such Holder furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Holder specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement shall be acknowledged by each Notice Holder that is not an Initial Purchaser in such Notice Holder's Notice and Questionnaire and shall be in addition to any liability that any such Notice Holder may otherwise have.
          (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 6 or notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 6, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses or the indemnifying party is otherwise materially prejudiced as a result thereof; and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel (including local counsel) of the indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel, other than local counsel if not appointed by the indemnifying party, retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); provided however, that such counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in respect of the legal expenses of any indemnified party in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified parties. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel (including local counsel) to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the defendants in any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that a conflict may arise between the positions of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party in conducting the defense of any such action or that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties that are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party; (ii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action; or (iii) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party in writing to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. An indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such
 
claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding.
          (d) In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 6 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, then each applicable indemnifying party shall have a joint and several obligation to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending loss, claim, liability, damage or action) (collectively "") to which such indemnified party may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by such indemnifying party, on the one hand, and such indemnified party, on the other hand, from the Initial Placement and the Shelf Registration Statement which resulted in such Losses; provided, however, that in no event shall any Initial Purchaser be responsible, in the aggregate, for any amount in excess of the purchase discount or commission applicable to such Security received by the Initial Purchasers; provided further, that in no event shall the Company be responsible, in the aggregate, for any amount in excess of the total net proceeds from the Initial Placement pursuant to the Purchase Agreement (before deducting expenses) of the Registrable Securities to which such Losses relate; provided further, that in no event shall any Holder be responsible, in the aggregate, for any amount in excess of the amount by which (i) the total price at which the Notes purchased by it were resold exceeds (ii) the amount of any damages which such Holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of any untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of such indemnifying party, on the one hand, and such indemnified party, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Benefits received by the Company shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the Initial Placement (before deducting expenses) as set forth in the Final Memorandum. Benefits received by the Initial Purchasers shall be deemed to be equal to the total purchase discounts and commissions received by the Initial Purchasers, and benefits received by any other Holders shall be deemed to be equal to the value of Securities received by such Holder and registered for resale under the Act. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the indemnifying party, on the one hand, or by the indemnified party, on the other hand, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The parties agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Holders were treated as one entity for such purpose) or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 6, each person who controls a Holder within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and each director and officer of such Holder shall have the same rights to contribution as such Holder, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each officer and other employee of the Company and each director of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (d).
Losses
          (e) The provisions of this Section 6 shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Holder or the Company or any of the indemnified persons referred to in this Section 6, and shall survive the sale by a Holder of Securities covered by the Shelf Registration Statement.
     7. . The Company agrees with each Holder, for so long as any Registrable Securities remain outstanding and during any period in which the Company (i) is not subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, to make available, upon request of any Holder, to such Holder of Registrable Securities in connection with any sale thereof and any prospective purchaser of such Registrable Securities designated by such Holder, the information required by Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Act in order to permit resales of such Registrable
Rule 144A and Rule 144
 
Securities pursuant to Rule 144A, and (ii) is subject to Section 13 or 15 (d) of the Exchange Act, to make all filings required thereby in a timely manner in order to permit resales of such Registrable Securities pursuant to Rule 144.
     8. .
Registration Defaults
          (a) If, and only if, any of the following events shall occur (each such event, a ""), then the Company shall pay liquidated damages in the form of additional cash interest (the "") to the Holders of Registrable Securities as follows:
Registration Default
Registration Default Damages
                    (i) the Shelf Registration Statement is not filed, or on file, with the Commission prior to or on the Shelf Filing Deadline, commencing on the day following the Shelf Filing Deadline and continuing until the day immediately preceding the filing of the Shelf Registration Statement, Registration Default Damages shall accrue on the Registrable Securities at a rate of 0.25% per annum for the first 90 days from and including the day following the Shelf Filing Deadline and 0.50% per annum thereafter; or
                    (ii) the Shelf Registration Statement has not become effective, or a previously effective Shelf Registration Statement has not been made available, prior to or on the Effectiveness Target Date, commencing on the date following the Effectiveness Target Date and continuing until the day immediately preceding the effectiveness of the Shelf Registration Statement, Registration Default Damages shall accrue on the Registrable Securities at a rate of 0.25% per annum for the first 90 days from and including the day following the Effectiveness Target Date and 0.50% per annum thereafter; or
                    (iii) the Shelf Registration Statement is filed and has become effective but, during the Shelf Registration Period, shall thereafter cease to be effective or fail to be usable for its intended purpose (other than pursuant to Section 3(c)(xi) hereof) for more than 10 Business Days, commencing on the date following the tenth Business Day of such ceased effectiveness or failure to be usable and continuing until the date immediately prior to the cure thereof, Registration Default Damages shall accrue on the Registrable Securities at a rate of 0.25% per annum for the first 90 days from and including such date on which the Shelf Registration Statement ceases to be effective and 0.50% per annum thereafter; or
                    (iv) if the aggregate duration of Deferral Periods in any period exceeds the number of days permitted in respect of such period pursuant to Section 3(c)(xi) hereof, then commencing on the day the aggregate duration of Deferral Periods in any period exceeds the number of days permitted in respect of such period and continuing until the end of such period, Registration Default Damages shall accrue on the Registrable Notes at a rate of 0.25% per annum for the first 90 days from and including such date and 0.50% per annum thereafter.
                    The Registration Default Damages payable as specified above shall be determined:
                         (A) in respect of the Registrable Notes, to each holder of Notes as described in Section 8(a)(i) through (iv); and
                         (B) in respect of the Registrable Notes submitted for conversion into Common Stock during the existence of a Registration Default with respect to the Common Stock, the holder will not be entitled to receive any Registration Default Damages with respect to such Common Stock but (x) will be entitled to a conversion rate adjustment, if any, in accordance with the terms of the Notes as set forth in the Indenture and (y) will receive from the Company on the settlement date with respect to such conversion, accrued and unpaid Registration Default Damages on the Registrable Notes calculated in accordance with paragraph (A) to the Conversion Date (as defined in the Indenture); and
 
          (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will Registration Default Damages be payable in connection with a failure to register the Common Stock for resale. For the avoidance of doubt, if the Company fails to register both the Notes and the Common Stock for resale, then the Registration Default Damages shall be payable in connection with the failure to register the Notes for resale. Further, except as provided in this Section 8, the Company shall have no liabilities for monetary damages with respect to its registration obligations hereunder.
          (c) The Company shall in no event be required to pay Registration Default Damages in respect of more than one Registration Default at any one time. Additionally, in no event will Registration Default Damages accrue at a rate per year in excess of 0.50%.
          (d) Any amounts of Registration Default Damages due pursuant to Section 8(a) will be payable in cash semi-annually in arrears on each April 30 and October 30, with the first semi-annual payment due on the first such payment date after which a Registration Default occurs. A Holder will not be entitled to Registration Default Damages as provided in Section 8 hereof, unless such Holder has timely delivered to the Company a duly completed Notice and Questionnaire, together with such other information reasonably requested of such Holder in accordance with this Agreement.
     9. . The Company has not entered into, and agrees not to enter into, any agreement with respect to its securities that is inconsistent with the rights granted to the Holders herein or that otherwise conflicts with the provisions hereof.
No Inconsistent Agreements
     10. . The provisions of this Agreement may not be amended, qualified, modified or supplemented, and waivers or consents to departures from the provisions hereof may not be given, unless the Company has obtained the written consent of the Holders of a majority of the aggregate principal amount of the Registrable Securities outstanding, provided that the Holders of Shares issued upon conversion of Notes, which Shares are Registrable Securities, shall not be deemed Holders of Shares, but shall be deemed Holders of the aggregate principal amount at maturity of Notes from which such Shares were converted; provided, that, with respect to any matter that directly or indirectly affects the rights of any Initial Purchaser hereunder, the Company shall obtain the written consent of each such Initial Purchaser against which such amendment, qualification, supplement, waiver or consent is to be effective; provided, further, that no amendment, qualification, supplement, waiver or consent with respect to Section 8 hereof shall be effective as against any Holder of Registered Securities unless consented to in writing by such Holder; and provided further, that the provisions of this Section 10 may not be amended, qualified, modified or supplemented, and waivers or consents to departures from the provisions hereof may not be given, unless the Company has obtained the written consent of the Initial Purchasers and each Holder. Notwithstanding the foregoing (except the foregoing provisos), a waiver or consent to departure from the provisions hereof with respect to a matter that relates exclusively to the rights of Holders whose Securities are being sold pursuant to a Shelf Registration Statement and that does not directly or indirectly affect the rights of other Holders may be given by the Majority Holders, determined on the basis of Securities being sold rather than registered under such Shelf Registration Statement.
Amendments and Waivers
     11. . All notices and other communications provided for or permitted hereunder shall be made in writing by hand-delivery, first-class mail, telecopier or air courier guaranteeing overnight delivery:
Notices
          (a) if to a Holder, at the most current address given by such Holder to the Company in accordance with the provisions of the Notice and Questionnaire, which address initially is, with respect to each Holder, the address of such Holder maintained by the Registrar under the Indenture;
          (b) if to the Initial Purchasers, initially at the address or addresses set forth in the Purchase Agreement; and

mailed; when receipt is acknowledged, if transmitted by telecopier; and on the next Business Day, if timely delivered to an air courier guaranteeing overnight delivery.
     Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may provide notices to the Holders pursuant to any means permitted by The Depository Trust Company. The Initial Purchasers or the Company by notice to the other parties may designate additional or different addresses for subsequent notices or communications.
     12. . Each Holder, in addition to being entitled to exercise all rights provided to it herein and to receive Registration Default Damages as provided in Section 8 hereof, in the Indenture or in the Purchase Agreement or granted by law will be entitled to specific performance of its rights under this Agreement. The Company agrees that monetary damages would not be adequate compensation for any loss incurred by reason of a breach by it of the provisions of this Agreement and hereby agrees to waive in any action for specific performance the defense that a remedy at law would be adequate.
Remedies
     13. . This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns, including, without the need for an express assignment or any consent by the Company thereto, subsequent Holders of Securities, and the indemnified persons referred to in Section 6 hereof.

               (i) . A Global Security may not be transferred, in whole or in part, to any Person other than the Depositary or a nominee or any successor thereof, and no such transfer to any such other Person may be registered; provided that this clause (i) shall not prohibit any transfer of a Security that is issued in exchange for a Global Security but is not itself a Global Security. No transfer of a Security to any Person shall be effective under this Indenture or the Securities unless and until such Security has been registered in the name of such Person. Nothing in this Section 2.13(c)(i) shall prohibit or render ineffective any transfer of a beneficial interest in a Global Security effected in accordance with the other provisions of this Section 2.13(c).
Transfer of Global Security

               (iii) . When Certificated Securities are presented to the Registrar with a request:
Transfer and Exchange of Certificated Securities
the Registrar shall register the transfer or make the exchange as requested if its requirements for such transaction are met, including any information necessary to ensure compliance with the Securities Act; provided, however, that the Certificated Securities surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange shall be duly endorsed or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form reasonably satisfactory to the Company and the Registrar, duly executed by the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing.
               (iv) . A Certificated Security may not be exchanged for a beneficial interest in a Global Security.
Restrictions on Transfer of a Certificated Security for a Beneficial Interest in a Global Security
          (d) The restrictions imposed by the Private Placement Legend upon the transferability of any Security shall cease and terminate when such Security has been sold pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act or transferred in compliance with Rule 144 under the Securities Act (or any successor provision thereto) or, if earlier, upon the expiration of the holding period applicable to sales thereof under Rule 144(k) under the Securities Act (or any successor provision). Any Security as to which such restrictions on transfer shall have expired in accordance with their terms or shall have terminated may, upon a surrender of such Security for exchange to the Registrar in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.13 (accompanied, in the event that such restrictions on transfer have terminated by reason of a transfer in compliance with Rule 144 or any successor provision, by an Opinion of Counsel reasonably acceptable to the Company and the Registrar and addressed to the Company and the Registrar, to the effect that the transfer of such Security has been made in compliance with Rule 144 or such successor provision), be exchanged for a new Security, of like tenor and aggregate principal amount, which shall not bear the Private Placement Legend. The Company shall inform the Trustee of the effective date of any registration statement registering the offer and sale of the Securities under the Securities Act. The Trustee or the Registrar shall not be
 
liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in accordance with the aforementioned Opinion of Counsel or registration statement.
          (e) The provisions of this Section 2.13(e) shall apply only to Global Securities:
               (i) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Indenture or the Securities, a beneficial interest in a Global Security shall not be exchanged for a Certificated Security unless the Depositary has notified the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for such Global Security or such Depositary has ceased to be a "clearing agency" registered under the Exchange Act, and a successor Depositary is not appointed by the Company within 90 days. Any Global Security exchanged pursuant to this clause (i) shall be so exchanged in whole and not in part.
               (ii) Certificated Securities issued in exchange for beneficial interests in a Global Security shall have an aggregate Principal Amount equal to that of such Global Security, shall be registered in such names and be in such authorized denominations as the Depositary shall designate and shall bear the applicable legends provided for herein. Any Global Security to be so exchanged shall be surrendered by the Depositary to the Registrar. Upon any such surrender, the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver each Certificated Security issuable on such exchange to or upon the order of the Depositary or an authorized representative thereof.
               (iii) Subject to the provisions of clause (v) below, the Global Security Holder may grant proxies and otherwise authorize any Person, including Agent Members (as defined below) and Persons that may hold interests through Agent Members, to take any action which a Holder is entitled to take under this Indenture or the Securities.
               (iv) In the event of the occurrence of any of the events specified in clause (i) above, the Company will promptly make available to the Trustee a reasonable supply of Certificated Securities.
               (v) Neither any members of, or participants in, the Depositary (collectively, the "") nor any other Persons on whose behalf Agent Members may act shall have any rights under this Indenture with respect to any Global Security registered in the name of the Depositary or any nominee thereof, or under any such Global Security, and the Depositary or such nominee, as the case may be, may be treated by the Company, the Trustee and any Agent as the absolute owner and Holder of such Global Security for all purposes whatsoever. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall (1) prevent the Company, the Trustee or any Agent from giving effect to any written certification, proxy or other authorization furnished by the Depositary or such nominee, as the case may be, or (2) impair, as between the Depositary, its Agent Members and any other Person on whose behalf an Agent Member may act, the operation of
Agent Members
 
customary practices of such Persons governing the exercise of the rights of a holder of any Security.
          (f) Until the expiration of the holding period applicable to sales thereof under Rule 144(k) under the Securities Act (or any successor provision thereto), any stock certificate representing Common Stock issued upon conversion of any Security shall bear a legend in substantially the following form, unless such Common Stock has been sold pursuant to a registration statement that has been declared effective under the Securities Act (and which continues to be effective at the time of such transfer) or transferred in compliance with Rule 144 under the Securities Act (or any successor provision thereto), or such Common Stock has been issued upon conversion of Securities that have been transferred pursuant to a registration statement that has been declared effective under the Securities Act or pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act (or any successor provision thereto), or unless otherwise agreed by the Company in writing with written notice thereof to the transfer agent:

          SECTION 3.02. .
Selection of Securities to Be Redeemed
          If fewer than all of the outstanding Securities are to be redeemed, the Trustee shall, upon 15 days' prior notice from the Company (unless the Trustee consents to a shorter period), select the Securities to be redeemed in Principal Amounts of $1,000 or integral multiples thereof. The Trustee may select the Securities by lot, pro rata or by any other method the Trustee considers fair and appropriate or in any manner required by the Depositary.
          If a portion of a Holder's Securities is selected for partial redemption and the Holder thereafter surrenders a portion of such Securities for conversion before termination of the conversion right with respect to the portion of the Securities so selected for redemption, the portion of such Securities surrendered for conversion shall be deemed (so far as may be), solely for purposes of determining the aggregate Principal Amount of Securities to be redeemed by the Company, to be the portion selected for redemption.
          Securities which have been converted during a selection of Securities to be redeemed may be treated by the Trustee as outstanding for the purpose of such selection. Nothing in this Section 3.02 shall affect the right of any Holder to convert any Security pursuant to Sections 11.01 before the termination of the conversion right with respect thereto.
          SECTION 3.03. .
Notice of Redemption
          (a) If the Company elects to redeem Securities, at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the Redemption Date with respect to such Securities the Company shall provide a notice of redemption (a "") to the Trustee and to each Holder of Securities to be redeemed at such Holder's address kept by the Registrar.

               (i) the Redemption Date;
               (ii) the Redemption Price;

               (iv) the name and address of the Paying Agent and the Conversion Agent;
               (v) that Securities called for redemption must be surrendered to the Paying Agent to collect the Redemption Price;
               (vi) that the Securities called for redemption may be converted at any time before the close of business on the second Business Day prior to the Redemption Date and whether the Company has elected to satisfy all or a portion of its Conversion Obligation with cash in lieu of delivering shares of Common Stock with respect to any Securities converted prior to the Redemption Date and, if the Company has so determined to satisfy all or a portion of the Conversion Obligation in cash, the dollar amount thereof (which must be expressed either as 100% of the Conversion Obligation or as a fixed dollar amount);
               (vii) that Holders who wish to convert Securities must comply with the procedures in Article 11 and paragraph 8 of the Securities;
               (viii) that, unless the Company defaults in making payment of the Redemption Price for the Securities called for redemption, interest on the Securities will cease to accrue on and after the Redemption Date and the only remaining right of the Holder will be to receive payment of the Redemption Price upon presentation and surrender to the Paying Agent of the Securities;
               (ix) if fewer than all the outstanding Securities are to be redeemed, the certificate number and Principal Amounts of the particular Securities to be redeemed; and

          SECTION 3.04. .
Effect of Notice of Redemption
          Once a Notice of Redemption is given by the Company, Securities called for redemption become due and payable on the Redemption Date and at the Redemption Price stated in such notice, except for Securities that are converted in accordance with the provisions of Article 11. Upon their presentation and surrender to the Paying Agent, Securities called for redemption shall be paid at the Redemption Price. Failure to give notice or any defect in the notice to any Holder shall not affect the validity of the notice to any other Holder.
 
          SECTION 3.05. .
Deposit of Redemption Price
          Prior to 11:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the Redemption Date, the Company shall deposit with the Paying Agent (or, if the Company or an Affiliate of the Company is acting as the Paying Agent, shall segregate and hold in trust) an amount of money sufficient to pay the aggregate Redemption Price of all the Securities to be redeemed on the Redemption Date other than the Securities or portions thereof called for redemption which on or prior thereto have been delivered by the Company to the Trustee for cancellation or have been converted.

          Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may not redeem the Securities if the Principal Amount of the Securities has been accelerated, and such acceleration has not been rescinded, on or prior to such Redemption Date (except in the case of an acceleration resulting from a default by the Company in the payment of the Redemption Price with respect to such Securities).
          SECTION 3.07. .

               (b) register the transfer of or exchange any Security so selected for redemption, in whole or in part, except the unredeemed portion of any Security being redeemed in part.

          No amendment to cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency in this Indenture made solely to conform this Indenture to the description of the Securities contained in the Offering Memorandum will be deemed to adversely affect the interests of the Holders.
          SECTION 10.02. .
Supplemental Indentures with Consent of Holders
          With the written consent of the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate Principal Amount of the Outstanding Securities, the Company and the Trustee may amend this Indenture or the Securities or may enter into an indenture or indentures supplemental hereto for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of this Indenture or of modifying in any manner the rights of the Holders; , , that no such amendment or supplemental indenture shall, without the consent of each Holder of Outstanding Securities:
provided
however
          (a) reduce the Principal Amount, reduce the rate or change the time of payment of interest on any Security, Redemption Price, Repurchase Price or Change in Control Purchase Price with respect to any Security, or extend the Maturity Date of any Security or make any Security payable in money or securities other than that stated in the Securities;
          (b) make any reduction in the principal amount of Securities whose Holders must consent to an amendment or any waiver under this Indenture or modify this Indenture provisions relating to such amendments or waivers;
          (c) make any change that adversely affects the right to convert any Security or the right to require the Company to purchase a Security; or

          It shall not be necessary for the consent of the Holders under this Section 10.02 to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment or supplemental indenture, but it shall be sufficient if such consent approves the substance thereof.
          After an amendment under this Section 10.02 becomes effective, the Company shall mail to each Holder a notice briefly describing the amendment.
          SECTION 10.03. .
Compliance with Trust Indenture Act
          Every supplemental indenture executed pursuant to this Article shall comply with the TIA as then in effect.
 
          SECTION 10.04. .
Revocation and Effect of Consents, Waivers and Actions
          Until an amendment or waiver becomes effective, a consent to it or any other action by a Holder is a continuing consent by the Holder and every subsequent Holder of that Security or portion of that Security that evidences the same obligation as the consenting Holder's Security, even if notation of the consent, waiver or action is not made on the Security. However, any such Holder or subsequent Holder may revoke the consent, waiver or action as to such Holder's Security or portion of the Security if the Trustee receives the notice of revocation before the Company or an agent of the Company certifies to the Trustee that the consent of the requisite aggregate Principal Amount of the Securities has been obtained. After an amendment, waiver or action becomes effective, it shall bind every Holder.
          The Company may, but shall not be obligated to, fix a record date for the purpose of determining the Holders entitled to consent to any amendment or waiver with respect to the Securities. If a record date is fixed, then notwithstanding the first two sentences of the immediately preceding paragraph, those Persons who were Holders at such record date (or their duly designated proxies), and only those Persons, shall be entitled to revoke any consent previously given, whether or not such Persons continue to be Holders after such record date. No such consent shall be valid or effective for more than 90 days after such record date.
          SECTION 10.05. .
Notation on or Exchange of Securities
          Securities authenticated and delivered after the execution of any supplemental indenture pursuant to this Article may, and shall if required by the Trustee, bear a notation in form approved by the Trustee as to any matter provided for in such supplemental indenture. If the Company shall so determine, new Securities so modified as to conform, in the opinion of the Trustee and the Company, to any such supplemental indenture may be prepared and executed by the Company and authenticated and delivered by the Trustee in exchange for Outstanding Securities.
          SECTION 10.06. .
Trustee to Sign Supplemental, Indentures
          The Trustee shall sign any supplemental indenture authorized pursuant to this Article 10 if the amendment does not adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee. If it does, the Trustee may, but need not, sign it. In signing such amendment the Trustee shall be entitled to receive, and (subject to the provisions of Section 8.01) shall be fully protected in relying upon, an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel stating that such amendment is authorized or permitted by this Indenture.
          SECTION 10.07. .
Effect of Supplemental Indentures
          Upon the execution of any supplemental indenture under this Article, this Indenture shall be modified in accordance therewith, and such supplemental indenture shall form a part of this Indenture for all purposes; and every Holder theretofore or thereafter authenticated and delivered hereunder shall be bound thereby.
 
          SECTION 11.01. .
Conversion Privilege; Payment Upon Conversion
          (a) Subject to the conditions described in this Section 11.01, and upon compliance with the provisions of this Article 11, a Holder shall have the right, at such Holder's option, to convert all (or any portion specified in Section 11.01(f)) of such Holder's Securities at any time if one or more of the following conditions for conversion are satisfied:
     (i) if, with respect to any fiscal quarter of the Company (the ""), the Sale Price for at least 20 Trading Days in a period of 30 consecutive Trading Days ending on the last Trading Day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter of the Company exceeds 130% of the Conversion Price on the last day of such preceding fiscal quarter (the ""), then a Holder may surrender its Securities for conversion in accordance with this Article 11 during and only during the Applicable Quarter;
Applicable Quarter
Conversion Trigger Price
     (ii) if the Company calls the Securities for redemption pursuant to and in accordance with Article 3, a Holder may surrender all or a portion of its Securities for conversion from the date of mailing of the Notice of Redemption (the "") until the close of business on the second Business Day prior to the Redemption Date;
Redemption Notice Date
     (iii) Holders may surrender Securities for conversion if the Company:
               (1) elects to distribute to all holders of Common Stock rights entitling them to purchase, for a period expiring within 60 days after the record date for such distribution, Common Stock at less than the average Sale Price for the five consecutive Trading Days ending on the date immediately preceding the record date for such distribution;
               (2) elects to distribute to all holders of Common Stock cash, debt securities (or other evidence of Indebtedness) or other assets (excluding dividends or distributions described in Sections 11.07(a), (b), (c) and (d)), which distribution has a per share value as determined by the Company's Board of Directors exceeding 15% of the average Sale Price for the five consecutive Trading Days ending on the date immediately preceding the record date for such distribution; or
               (3) is a party to a share exchange, consolidation or merger, or a sale, lease or other transfer of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in each case pursuant to which the shares of its Common Stock would be converted into cash, securities or other property; or
 
     (iv) Holders may surrender their Securities for conversion at any time on or after March 1, 2026 until the close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding the Maturity Date.
          (b) If the Company makes a distribution described in Section 11.01(a)(iii)(1) or Section 11.01(a)(iii)(2), the Company must notify Holders at least 20 days prior to the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution (""). Once the Company has given a Distribution Notice, Holders may surrender their Securities for conversion at any time until the earlier of (x) the close of business on the Business Day prior to the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution or (y) the Company's announcement that such distribution will not take place. No Holder may exercise such right to convert if such Holder is entitled to participate in the distribution without conversion. In the case of Section 11.01(a)(iii)(3), a Holder may surrender its Securities for conversion at any time from and after the date which is 15 days prior to the anticipated effective date for the transaction described therein until 15 days after the actual effective date of such transaction or, if such transaction also constitutes a Change in Control, the Change in Control Purchase Date.
Distribution Notice
          (c) In addition to the conversion right set forth in Section 11.01(a)(iii)(3), if the transaction described therein constitutes a Change in Control, then a Holder of any Security may elect to require the Company to purchase such Security pursuant to Section 4.02. A Security for which a Holder has delivered a Repurchase Notice or a Change in Control Purchase Notice requiring the Company to purchase the Security may be converted only if such Repurchase Notice or Change in Control Purchase Notice is withdrawn in accordance with Section 4.03. The Company may not become party to any such transaction unless its terms are consistent with the foregoing.
          (d) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 11.01, the Securities will not become convertible by reason of a merger, consolidation or other transaction effected with one of the Company's Subsidiaries for the purpose of changing the Company's state of incorporation to any other state within the United States or District of Columbia.
          (e) The Conversion Rate is subject to adjustment as provided in Section 11.07.
          (f) A Holder may convert a portion of the Principal Amount of a Security if the portion is $1,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000. Provisions of this Article 11 that apply to conversion of all of a Security also apply to conversion of a portion of a Security.
          (g) [Intentionally omitted.]
          (h) In the event that the Company receives a Conversion Notice from a Holder on or prior to (1) the Redemption Notice Date or (2) the date that is 20 days prior to the Maturity Date (the ""), the following procedures shall apply:
Final Notice Date
     (i) If the Company elects to satisfy all or any portion of its obligation to convert the Securities (the "") in cash, the Company shall notify such Holder through the Trustee of the dollar amount of the Conversion Obligation to be satisfied in cash (which must be expressed either as 100% of the Conversion Obligation or as a fixed dollar amount) at any time on or before the
Conversion Obligation
 
date that is two Business Days following the Conversion Date (the ""). If the Company timely elects to pay cash for any portion of the Common Stock otherwise issuable to such Holder upon conversion, the Holder may retract its Conversion Notice at any time during the two Business Days following the final day of the Cash Settlement Notice Period (the ""). No such retraction can be made (and a Conversion Notice shall be irrevocable) if the Company does not elect to deliver cash in lieu of Common Stock (other than cash in lieu of fractional shares). Upon the expiration of a Conversion Retraction Period, a Conversion Notice shall be irrevocable. If the Company elects to satisfy all or any portion of the Conversion Obligation in cash, and the applicable Conversion Notice has not been retracted, then settlement (in cash or in cash and Common Stock) will occur on the Business Day following the final Trading Day of the 20 Trading Day period beginning on the Trading Day immediately after the final day of the Conversion Retraction Period (the "").
Cash Settlement Notice Period
Conversion Retraction Period
Cash Settlement Averaging Period
     (ii) If the Company does not elect to satisfy any part of the Conversion Obligation in cash (other than cash in lieu of any fractional shares), delivery of the Common Stock into which the Securities are converted (and cash in lieu of any fractional shares) shall occur through the Conversion Agent or the Depositary, as the case may be, as soon as practicable on or after the Conversion Date.
          (i) Any cash and shares of Common Stock due upon conversion of the Securities ("") pursuant to Section 11.01(h) will be computed as follows:
Settlement Amount
     (i) If the Company elects to satisfy the entire Conversion Obligation in Common Stock, it shall deliver to Holders that have delivered the Conversion Notice giving rise to the Conversion Obligation a number of shares of Common Stock equal to (1) the aggregate Principal Amount of Securities to be converted divided by $1,000, multiplied by (2) the Conversion Rate. In addition, the Company shall pay cash for any fractional shares of Common Stock based on the Sale Price on the Trading Day immediately preceding the Conversion Date.
     (ii) If the Company elects to satisfy the entire Conversion Obligation in cash, it shall deliver to Holders that have delivered the Conversion Notice giving rise to the Conversion Obligation cash in an amount equal to the product of:
     (A) a number equal to (1) the aggregate Principal Amount of Securities to be converted divided by $1,000, multiplied by (2) the Conversion Rate; and
     (B) the average of the Sale Prices on each Trading Day during the Cash Settlement Averaging Period.
     (iii) If the Company elects to satisfy a fixed portion (other than 100%) of the Conversion Obligation in cash, it will deliver to Holders, for each $1,000 Principal Amount of Securities surrendered for Conversion, (A) cash in an
 
amount equal to the lesser of (1) the Conversion Value and (2) the specified cash amount for each $1,000 Principal Amount of Securities (the ""), and (B) if the Conversion Value is greater than the Cash Amount, a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the excess, if any, of the number of shares calculated as if the Company elected to satisfy the entire Conversion Obligation in shares over the number of shares equal to the sum, for each Trading Day of the Cash Settlement Averaging Period, of (x) the Cash Amount divided by the number of Trading Days in the Cash Settlement Averaging Period, divided by (y) the Sale Price for such Trading Day. In addition, the Company shall pay cash for all fractional shares of Common Stock based on the average Sale Price during the Cash Settlement Averaging Period.
Cash Amount
          (j) With respect to Conversion Notices received by the Company after the Redemption Notice Date or the Final Notice Date, the Company shall not send individual notices to Holders of its election to satisfy all or any portion of the Conversion Obligation in cash. Instead, with respect to Conversion Notices received by the Company after the Redemption Notice Date, the Company must determine whether or not it will satisfy all or a portion of the Conversion Obligation in cash at the time it issues a Redemption Notice and such notice will state the amount of the Conversion Obligation to be settled in cash (which must be expressed either as 100% of the Conversion Obligation or a fixed dollar amount). If the Company elects to satisfy all or any portion of the Conversion Obligation with respect to conversions after the Final Notice Date in cash, on or before the Final Notice Date the Company will send a single notice to Holders indicating the dollar amount to be satisfied in cash (which must be expressed either as 100% of the Conversion Obligation or a fixed dollar amount).
          (k) In the event that the Company receives a Conversion Notice after the Redemption Notice Date or the Final Notice Date, the Settlement Amounts will be computed and settlement dates will be determined in the same manner as set forth in paragraphs (h) and (i) of this Section 11.01, except that the Cash Settlement Averaging Period shall be the 20 Trading Day period beginning on the Trading Day after the Redemption Date or Maturity Date, as the case may be. If a Conversion Notice is received from a Holder after the Redemption Notice Date or the Final Notice Date, such Holder may not retract its Conversion Notice, and such Conversion Notice shall be irrevocable. Settlement (in cash and/or Common Stock) will occur on the Business Day following the final Trading Day of such Cash Settlement Averaging Period; provided, however, if the Company does not elect to satisfy any part of the Conversion Obligation in cash (other than cash in lieu of any fractional shares), then delivery of shares of Common Stock into which the Securities are converted (and cash in lieu of any fractional shares) will occur through the Conversion Agent or the Depositary, as the case may be, as soon as practicable on or after the Conversion Date.
 
          SECTION 11.02. .
Conversion Procedure
          (a) To convert a Security that is represented by a Global Security, a Holder must comply with the Depositary's applicable procedures, including the delivery to the Conversion Agent of any required Conversion Notice, within the applicable time period required in Section 11.01.
          (b) To convert a Security that is represented by a Certificated Security, a Holder must, within the applicable time period required by Section 11.01, (1) complete and manually sign a conversion notice substantially in the form of Exhibit B to this Indenture ("") and deliver such notice to the Conversion Agent, (2) surrender the Security to the Conversion Agent, (3) furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents if required by the Conversion Agent, the Company or the Trustee and (4) pay any transfer or similar tax, if required by Section 11.05.
Conversion Notice
          (c) Each conversion of a Security (or portion thereof) shall be deemed to have been effected as to such Security (or portion thereof) on the date on which the requirements set forth in this Article 11 have been satisfied as to such Security (or portion thereof) (such date, the ""), and the Person in whose name any certificate for shares of Common Stock shall be issuable upon such conversion shall be deemed to have become on said date the holder of record of the shares represented thereby; provided that any such satisfaction on any date when the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed shall constitute the Person in whose name the certificate is to be issued as the record holder thereof for all purposes on the next succeeding day on which such stock transfer books are open, but such conversion shall be at the Conversion Rate in effect on the date upon which such satisfaction occurred.
Conversion Date
          (d) The right to surrender Securities for conversion will expire at the close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding the Maturity Date.
          (e) Upon conversion of a Security, the Holder will not receive any interest thereon (other than any overdue interest as provided in this Section 11.02(e)), unless such conversion occurs after the close of business on a Regular Record Date but prior to the related Interest Payment Date. Holders of Securities at the close of business on a Regular Record Date will receive payment of the interest payable on the corresponding Interest Payment Date notwithstanding the conversion of such Securities at any time after the close of business on the applicable Regular Record Date. Securities surrendered for conversion by a Holder after the close of business on any Regular Record Date but prior to the next Interest Payment Date must be accompanied by payment of an amount equal to the interest payment that is due on such Securities on that Interest Payment Date; provided, however, that no such payment need be made (1) if the Company has specified a Redemption Date that is after a Regular Record Date and on or prior to the next Interest Payment Date, (2) if the Company has specified a Change in Control Purchase Date following a Regular Record Date and on or prior to the next Interest Payment Date, or (3) only to the extent of overdue interest, if any overdue interest exists at the time of conversion with respect to such Securities. The Company will not be required to convert any Securities that are surrendered for conversion without payment of interest as required by this Article 11.
 
          (f) No payment or adjustment will be made for dividends on, or other distributions with respect to, any Common Stock except as provided in this Article 11. Holders of Common Stock issued upon conversion will not be entitled to receive any dividends payable to Holders of the Common Stock as of any record date before the close of business on the Conversion Date.
          (g) If the Holder converts more than one Security at the same time, the Settlement Amount (together with the cash payment, if any, in lieu of fractional shares) shall be based on the total Principal Amount of the Securities converted.
          (h) If the last day on which a Security may be converted is a Legal Holiday, the Security may be surrendered on the next succeeding day that is not a Legal Holiday.
          (i) Upon surrender of a Security that is converted in part, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder, a new Security in an authorized denomination equal in Principal Amount to the unconverted portion of the Security surrendered.
          SECTION 11.03. .
Fractional Shares
          A Holder of a Security otherwise entitled to a fractional share of Common Stock will receive cash in lieu thereof in an amount determined in accordance with Section 11.01.
          SECTION 11.04. .
Effect of Conversion
          The Company's delivery to the Holder of the Settlement Amount, will be deemed:
          (a) to satisfy the Company's obligation to pay the Principal Amount of the Security; and
          (b) to satisfy any obligation to pay all other amounts owed on the Securities including accrued and unpaid interest, if any.
          Accrued and unpaid interest will be deemed paid in full rather than canceled, extinguished or forfeited. The Company will not adjust the Conversion Rate to account for accrued interest.
          SECTION 11.05. .
Taxes on Conversion
          If a Holder converts a Security, the Company shall pay any documentary, stamp or similar issue or transfer tax due on the issue of any shares of Common Stock upon the conversion. However, the Holder shall pay any such tax which is due because the Holder requests the shares to be issued in a name other than the Holder's name. The Conversion Agent may refuse to deliver any certificate representing the Common Stock being issued in a name other than the Holder's name until the Conversion Agent receives a sum sufficient to pay any tax which will be due because the shares are to be delivered in a name other than the Holder's name.
 
          SECTION 11.06. .
Company to Provide Stock
          The Company shall, prior to issuance of any Securities under this Article 11, and from time to time as may be necessary, reserve out of its authorized but unissued Common Stock, or shares of Common Stock held in its treasury, a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock to provide for the conversion of the Securities from time to time as such Securities are presented for conversion.
          All shares of Common Stock delivered upon conversion of the Securities shall be newly issued shares or treasury shares, shall be duly and validly issued and fully paid and nonassessable and shall be free from preemptive rights and free of any lien or other adverse claim created by the Company.
          The Company will comply with all federal and state securities laws regulating the offer and delivery of shares of Common Stock upon conversion of Securities, if any, and will list or cause to have quoted such shares of Common Stock on each national securities exchange or in the over-the-counter market or such other market on which the Common Stock is then listed or quoted.
          SECTION 11.07. .
Adjustments in Conversion Rate
          As provided in Sections 11.08 through 11.11 and 11.19 below, the Conversion Rate will be adjusted in the event, after the Issue Date of the Securities, the Company:
          (a) pays a dividend or makes a distribution to all holders of its Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock;
          (b) subdivides its shares of Common Stock;
          (c) splits or combines its shares of Common Stock;
          (d) issues by reclassification of its Common Stock any shares of its Capital Stock in accordance with Section 11.19;
          (e) makes a distribution to all holders of its Common Stock of any rights, options or warrants to purchase shares of its Common Stock for a period expiring within 60 days from the date of issuance of such rights at a price per share less than the Average Closing Price;
          (f) makes a distribution to all holders of Common Stock of the Company's assets or debt or other securities (including shares of Capital Stock of the Company other than Common Stock or its Subsidiaries) or rights, warrants or options to purchase securities (excluding cash dividends or other cash distributions from current or retained earnings, those rights, warrants or options to purchase shares of Common Stock referred to in Section 11.07(e) and any dividend or distribution referred to in Section 11.07(a) above);
          (g) makes a distribution of cash to all holders of Common Stock (excluding (a) any dividend or distribution on the Common Stock paid after April 30, 2013 to the extent that the aggregate amount of such payment per share of Common Stock in any twelve month period does
 
not exceed 5% of the average Sale Price during the ten Trading Days immediately prior to the declaration date for such dividend or distribution and (b) any dividend or distribution in connection with the liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary); and
          (h) makes a distribution of its or its Subsidiaries' cash or other consideration in respect of a tender offer or exchange offer for Common Stock described in Section 11.11.
          SECTION 11.08. .
Adjustments for Stock Dividends, Rights Issue, Etc
          (a) In case the Company shall pay a dividend or make a distribution to all holders of the Common Stock in shares of Common Stock as described in Section 11.07(a), the Conversion Rate, as in effect at the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or other distribution, shall be increased by multiplying such Conversion Rate by a fraction,
     (i) the numerator of which shall be the sum of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or other distribution plus the total number of shares of Common Stock constituting such dividend or other distribution, and
     (ii) the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the date fixed for such determination,
such increase to become effective immediately after the opening of business on the Business Day following the date fixed for such determination. If any dividend or distribution of the type described in this Section 11.08(a) is declared but not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.
          (b) In case outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be subdivided or split into a greater number of shares of Common Stock as described in Section 11.07(b) or (c), the Conversion Rate in effect at the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such subdivision or split becomes effective shall be proportionately increased, and, conversely, in case outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be combined into a smaller number of shares of Common Stock as described in Section 11.07(c), the Conversion Rate in effect at the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such combination becomes effective shall be proportionately reduced, such increase or reduction, as the case may be, to become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such subdivision, split or combination becomes effective.
          (c) If, after the Issue Date, the Company distributes any rights, warrants or options to all holders of its Common Stock described in Section 11.07(e), the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted in accordance with the formula:
 
          where:
          R' = the adjusted Conversion Rate.
          R = the current Conversion Rate.
          O = the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on the record date for the distribution to which this Section 11.08(c) is being applied.
          N = the number of additional shares of Common Stock offered pursuant to the distribution.
          P = the offering price per share of the additional shares.
          M = the Average Closing Price.
The adjustment shall become effective the Trading Day immediately prior to the date on which stockholders are no longer entitled to receive the rights, warrants or options to which this Section 11.08(c) applies, whether by determination of a record date by the Company or by trading of "due bills" containing such rights, warrants or options as required by the U.S. National Securities Exchange or quotation market on which the Common Stock is traded. If all of the shares of Common Stock subject to such rights, warrants or options have not been issued when such rights, warrants or options expire, then the Conversion Rate shall promptly be readjusted to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect had the adjustment upon the issuance of such rights, warrants or options been made on the basis of the actual number of shares of Common Stock issued upon the exercise of such rights, warrants or options.
          SECTION 11.09. .
Adjustment for Other Distributions
          (a) If, after the Issue Date, the Company distributes to all holders of its Common Stock any of its assets or debt or other securities (including shares of other Capital Stock of the Company) or any rights, warrants or options to purchase securities described in Section 11.07(f), the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted, subject to the provisions of Section 11.09(c), in accordance with the formula:
          where:
          R' = the adjusted Conversion Rate.
          R = the current Conversion Rate.
          M = the Average Closing Price.
          F = the fair market value (on the record date for the distribution to which this Section 11.09(a) applies) of the assets, securities, rights, warrants or options to be distributed in respect of each share of Common Stock in the distribution to which this Section 11.09(a) is being
 
applied (including, in the case of cash dividends or other cash distributions giving rise to an adjustment, all such cash distributed concurrently).
The Board of Directors shall determine fair market values for the purposes of this Section 11.09(a). The adjustment shall become effective immediately after the date on which the stockholders are no longer entitled to receive the distribution to which this Section 11.09(a) applies whether by determination of a record date by the Company or by trading of "due bills" containing such rights, warrants or options as required by the U.S. National Securities Exchange or quotation market on which the Common Stock is traded.
          (b) If, after the Issue Date, the Company pays a dividend or makes a distribution to all holders of its Common Stock consisting of Capital Stock of any of its Subsidiaries, then the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted in accordance with the formula:
          R' = the adjusted Conversion Rate.
          R = the current Conversion Rate.
          M = the average of the Post-Distribution Prices of the Common Stock for the ten Trading Days commencing on and including the fifth Trading Day after the Ex-Dividend Date for such dividend or distribution on the principal United States exchange or market which such securities are then listed or quoted.
          F = the fair market value of the securities distributed in respect of each share of Common Stock for which this Section 11.09(b) applies, meaning the number of securities distributed in respect of each share of Common Stock multiplied by the average of the Post-Distribution Prices of those securities distributed for the ten Trading Days commencing on and including the fifth Trading Day after the Ex-Dividend Date for such dividend or distribution on the principal United States or regional exchange or market on which such securities are then listed or quoted.
          The "" of any Capital Stock on any date means the closing per unit sale price (or, if no closing sale price is reported, the average of the bid and ask prices or, if more than one in either case, the average of the average bid and the average ask prices) on such date for trading of such units on a "when issued" basis without due bills (or similar concept) as reported in the composite transactions for the principal United States securities exchange on which such Capital Stock is traded or, if the Capital Stock is not listed on a United States national or regional securities exchange, as reported by the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation System or by the National Quotation Bureau Incorporated; provided, however, that if on any date such units have not traded on a "when issued" basis, the Post-Distribution Price shall be the closing per unit sale price (or, if no closing sale price is reported, the average of the bid and ask prices or, if more than one in either case, the average of the average bid and the average ask prices) on such date for trading of such units on a "regular way" basis without due bills (or similar concept) as reported in the composite transactions for the principal United States securities exchange on which such Capital Stock is traded or, if the
Post-Distribution Price
 
Capital Stock is not listed on a United States national or regional securities exchange, as reported by the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation System or by the National Quotation Bureau Incorporated. In the absence of such quotation, the Company shall be entitled to determine the Post-Distribution Price on the basis of such quotations which reflect the post-distribution value of the relevant Capital Stock as it considers appropriate.
          (c) In the event that, with respect to any distribution to which Section 11.09(a) would otherwise apply, the difference "M-F" as defined in the formula set forth in Section 11.09(a) is less than $1.00 or "F" is equal to or greater than "M", then the adjustment provided by Section 11.09(a) shall not be made and in lieu thereof the provisions of Section 11.19 shall apply to such distribution, with the result that, rather than being entitled to an adjustment in the Conversion Rate, the Holder will be entitled to receive upon conversion, in addition to shares of Common Stock and/or cash, the kind and amount of assets, securities or rights, warrants or options comprising the distribution that such Holder would have received if such Holder had converted such Holder's Securities immediately prior to the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to receive the distribution.
          SECTION 11.10. .
Adjustment for Cash Dividends
          If, after the Issue Date of the Securities, the Company distributes to all or substantially all holders of its Common Stock any cash (excluding (a) any dividend or distribution on the Common Stock paid after April 30, 2013 to the extent that the aggregate amount of such payment per share of Common Stock in any twelve month period does not exceed 5% of the average Sale Price during the ten Trading Days immediately prior to the declaration date for such dividend or distribution and (b) any dividend or distribution in connection with the liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary), the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted in accordance with the formula:
          where,
          R' = the adjusted Conversion Rate;
          R = the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the Time of Determination;
          M = the Average Closing Price; and
          C = the amount in cash per share the Company distributes to holders of Common Stock (and for which no adjustment has been made) that exceeds the amount of dividends and distributions permitted to be excluded pursuant to the initial parenthetical clause of this Section 11.10.
          SECTION 11.11. .
Adjustment for Tender Offer
          If, after the Issue Date, the Company makes a payment of cash or other consideration to holders of Common Stock in respect of a tender offer or exchange offer for the
 
Common Stock, other than an odd-lot tender offer, and the sum of the cash and the fair market value of any other consideration paid for such Common Stock, expressed as an amount per share of Common Stock validly tendered or exchanged pursuant to such tender offer or exchange offer, exceeds the Sale Price on the Trading Day immediately following the last time (the "") on which tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to the tender or exchange offer, then the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted in accordance with the formula:
Expiration Time
          where,
          R' = the Conversion Rate in effect immediately after the Expiration Time;
          R = the Conversion Rate in effect at the Expiration Time;
          F = the aggregate amount of all cash and the fair market value of any other consideration (as determined by the Board of Directors) paid or payable for shares of Common Stock validly tendered or exchanged and not withdrawn as of the Expiration Time (the "");
Purchased Shares
          O = the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after the Expiration Time excluding any Purchased Shares;
          O' = the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Expiration Time, including any Purchased Shares; and
          P = the Sale Price of the Common Stock on the Trading Day next succeeding the Expiration Time.
Such increase (if any) shall become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the day following the Expiration Time. In the event that the Company is obligated to purchase shares pursuant to any such tender offer, but the Company is prevented by applicable law from effecting any such purchases or all such purchases are rescinded, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such tender or exchange offer had not been made. If the application of this Section 11.11 to any tender or exchange offer would result in a decrease in the Conversion Rate, no adjustment shall be made for such tender or exchange offer under this Section 11.11.
          SECTION 11.12. .
Adjustment to Conversion Rate Upon Make-Whole Change in Control Transactions
          (a) If, after the Issue Date and prior to April 30, 2013, a Make-Whole Change in Control occurs and a Holder elects to convert its Securities in connection with such Make-Whole Change in Control, the Company will increase the Conversion Rate for the Securities surrendered for conversion by a number of additional shares of Common Stock (the ""), as described in this Section 11.12. A conversion of Securities will be deemed
Make-Whole Shares
 
for the purposes of this Section 11.12 to be "in connection with" a Make-Whole Change in Control transaction if the notice of conversion of the Securities is received by the Conversion Agent from a Holder during the period from and including the date that is 15 days prior to the anticipated effective date of the Make-Whole Change in Control, up to and including the Trading Day prior to the related Change in Control Purchase Date.
          (b) The Company shall give a notice to the Holders and the Trustee in the manner provided in Section 13.02 no later than 20 days prior to the anticipated effective date of the Make-Whole Change in Control describing briefly such transaction and the provisions of this Section 11.12.
          (c) The number of Make-Whole Shares to be added to the Conversion Rate will be determined by reference to the table below and is based on the date which such Make-Whole Change in Control transaction becomes effective (the "") and the price (the "") paid per share of Common Stock in such Make-Whole Change in Control transaction. If the holders of Common Stock receive only cash in the Make-Whole Change in Control transaction, the Stock Price shall be the cash amount paid per share of Common Stock (excluding cash paid for fractional shares or pursuant to statutory appraisal rights). Otherwise, the Stock Price shall be the average Sale Price for the five consecutive Trading Days immediately preceding, but not including, the Change in Control Effective Date.
Change in Control Effective Date
Stock Price
          (d) The Stock Prices set forth in the first column of the table below (, the row headers) will be adjusted as of any date on which the Conversion Rate is adjusted. The adjusted Stock Prices will equal the Stock Prices in effect immediately prior to such adjustment, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Conversion Rate immediately prior to the adjustment giving rise to the Stock Price adjustment and the denominator of which is the Conversion Rate as so adjusted.
i.e.
          (e) The following table sets forth for specified Stock Prices and Change in Control Effective Dates the number of Make-Whole Shares to be added to the Conversion Rate per $1,000 Principal Amount of Securities, which number shall be subject to adjustment in the same manner as the Conversion Rate is subject to adjustment pursuant to this Article 11.
 
          (f) If the exact Stock Prices and Change in Control Effective Dates are not set forth in the table, then:
     (i) if the Stock Price is between two Stock Price amounts in the table or the Change in Control Effective Date is between two dates in the table, the number of Make-Whole Shares issued upon conversion of the Securities will be determined by a straight-line interpolation between the number of Make-Whole Shares set forth for the higher and lower Stock Price amounts and/or the two dates in the table, based on a 365-day year, as applicable;
     (ii) if the Stock Price exceeds $100.00 per share, subject to adjustment as set forth herein, no Make-Whole Shares will be issued upon conversion of the Securities; and
     (iii) if the Stock Price is less than $16.60 per share, subject to adjustment as set forth herein, no Make-Whole Shares will be issued upon conversion of the Securities.
          (g) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will the Company increase the Conversion Rate pursuant to this Section 11.12 to the extent the increase will cause the Conversion Rate to exceed 60.2329 per $1,000 Principal Amount of Securities, subject to adjustment as set forth herein.
          SECTION 11.13. .
Adjustment to Conversion Rate After a Public Acquirer Change in Control
          (a) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 11.12, if, following the Issue Date, a Change in Control constituting a Public Acquirer Change in Control occurs, the Company may, in lieu of issuing any Make-Whole Shares upon conversion, elect to adjust the Conversion Rate and the related Conversion Obligation such that from and after the effective date of such Public Acquirer Change in Control (the ""), Holders shall be entitled to convert their Securities into a number of shares of Public Acquirer Common Stock, subject to the option of the Company to pay cash upon conversion pursuant to this Article
Public Acquirer Change in Control Effective Date
 
11 and to the other conditions of this Article 11, determined by multiplying the Conversion Rate in effect immediately before the Public Acquirer Change in Control by a fraction (i) the numerator of which will be (a) in the case of a consolidation, merger or binding share exchange pursuant to which the Common Stock is converted into cash, securities or other property, the average value of all cash and any other consideration (as determined by the Board of Directors) paid or payable per share of Common Stock or (b) in the case of any other Public Acquirer Change in Control, the average Sale Price for the ten consecutive Trading Days prior to but excluding the Public Acquirer Change in Control Effective Date; and (ii) the denominator of which will be the average of the last reported sale prices of the Public Acquirer Common Stock for the ten consecutive Trading Days commencing on the Trading Day next succeeding the Public Acquirer Change in Control Effective Date.
          (b) A "" means a Change in Control in which the acquirer has a class of common stock traded on a U.S. national securities exchange or quoted on The Nasdaq National Market (at such time that The Nasdaq National Market is not a U.S. national securities exchange) or which will be so traded or quoted when issued or exchanged in connection with such Change in Control (the ""). If an acquirer does not itself have a class of common stock satisfying the foregoing requirement, it will be deemed to have "Public Acquirer Common Stock" if an entity that directly or indirectly owns at least a majority of the acquirer has a class of common stock satisfying the foregoing requirement and, in such case, all references to Public Acquirer Common Stock shall refer to such class of common stock. Majority owned for these purposes means having "beneficial ownership" (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) of more than 50% of the total voting power of all shares of the respective entity's Capital Stock that are entitled to vote generally in the election of directors.
Public Acquirer Change in Control
Public Acquirer Common Stock
          (c) Within 10 Trading Days prior to but not including the expected effective date of a Change in Control that is also a Public Acquirer Change in Control, the Company will provide to all Holders of the Securities and the Trustee and the Conversion Agent a notification stating whether the Company will:
     (i) elect to adjust the Conversion Rate and related Conversion Obligation, in which case the Holders will not have the right to receive any Make-Whole Shares upon conversion, as described in Section 11.12; or
     (ii) not elect to adjust the Conversion Rate and related Conversion Obligation, in which case the Holders will have the right to convert Securities and, if applicable, receive Make-Whole Shares upon conversion as described in Section 11.12.
          SECTION 11.14. .
When Adjustment May Be Deferred
          (a) No adjustment in the Conversion Rate will be required unless such adjustment would require a change of at least 1% of the Conversion Rate then in effect; provided that any adjustment that would otherwise be required to be made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all such carried forward adjustments shall be made at the time a Notice of Redemption is mailed and thereafter any
 
Conversion Rate adjustment shall be made without regard to the 1% threshold described in the preceding sentence.
          (b) All calculations under this Article 11 shall be made to the nearest cent or to the nearest 1/10,000th of a share, as the case may be (with one-half cent and 5/100,000ths of a share being rounded upward).
          SECTION 11.15. .
When No Adjustment Required
          (a) No adjustment to the Conversion Rate need be made if Holders may participate in the transaction (without exercising their conversion option) that would otherwise give rise to such an adjustment.
          (b) No adjustment to the Conversion Rate need be made:
     (i) upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock pursuant to any present or future plan providing for the reinvestment of dividends or interest payable on securities of the Company and the investment of additional optional amounts in shares of Common Stock under any plan;
     (ii) upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock or options or rights to purchase those shares pursuant to any present or future employee, director or consultant benefit plan or program of or assumed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries;
     (iii) upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock pursuant to any option, warrant, or exercisable, exchangeable or convertible security not described in (ii) above and outstanding as of the Issue Date;
     (iv) for a change in the par value of the Common Stock; or
     (v) for accrued and unpaid interest, if any.
          (c) To the extent the Securities become convertible pursuant to this Article 11 into cash, no adjustment need be made thereafter as to the cash. Interest will not accrue on the cash.
          (d) Upon conversion of the Securities, the Holders of such Securities will receive, to the extent that the Company delivers shares of Common Stock upon such conversion, the rights related to such Common Stock pursuant to any existing or future shareholder rights plan. However, there will not be any adjustment to the conversion privilege or Conversion Rate as a result of:
     (i) the issuance of such rights;
     (ii) the distribution of separate certificates representing such rights;
 
     (iii) the exercise or redemption of such rights in accordance with any rights agreement; or
     (iv) the expiration, termination or invalidation of such rights.
          (e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Holder of Securities exercising its right of conversion after the distribution of rights pursuant to any rights plan in effect at the time of such conversion is not entitled to receive the rights that would otherwise be attributable (but for the date of conversion) to the shares of Common Stock to be received upon such conversion, if any, the Conversion Rate will be adjusted as though the rights were being distributed to holders of Common Stock on the date the rights become separable from such stock. If such an adjustment is made and such rights are later redeemed, invalidated or terminated, then a corresponding reversing adjustment will be made to the conversion rate on an equitable basis.
          (f) In no event will the Conversion Rate be adjusted to the extent the adjustment would reduce the Conversion Price below the par value per share of Common Stock.
          SECTION 11.16. .
Notice of Adjustment
          Whenever the Conversion Rate is adjusted, the Company shall promptly mail to Securityholders a notice of the adjustment. The Company shall file with the Trustee and the Conversion Agent such notice and an Officers' Certificate briefly stating the facts requiring the adjustment and the manner of computing it. The certificate shall be conclusive evidence that the adjustment is correct, about manifest error. Neither the Trustee nor any Conversion Agent shall be under any duty or responsibility with respect to any such certificate except to exhibit the same to any Holder desiring inspection thereof.
          SECTION 11.17. .
Voluntary Increase
          The Company from time to time may increase the Conversion Rate by any amount for any period of time. Whenever the Conversion Rate is increased, the Company shall mail to Securityholders and file with the Trustee and the Conversion Agent a notice of the increase. The Company shall mail the notice at least 15 days before the date the increased Conversion Rate takes effect. The notice shall state the increased Conversion Rate and the period it will be in effect.
          A voluntary increase of the Conversion Rate does not change or adjust the Conversion Rate otherwise in effect for purposes of this Article 11.
          SECTION 11.18. .
Notice of Certain Transactions
          If:
          (a) the Company takes any action that would require an adjustment in the Conversion Rate pursuant to Section 11.08, 11.09 or 11.10 (unless no adjustment is to occur pursuant to Section 11.15); or
 
          (b) the Company takes any action that would require a supplemental indenture pursuant to Section 11.19; or

Non-Electing Share
 
          (b) The above provisions of this Section shall similarly apply to successive reclassifications, consolidations, mergers, share exchanges, combinations, sales and conveyances.

1. Interest
          This Security shall bear cash interest at the rate of 3.75% per annum. The Company shall also pay any Additional Interest owing hereon pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement and any Contingent Interest owing hereon pursuant to Article 14 of the Indenture, and all references to "interest" in this Security shall be deemed to include Additional Interest and Contingent Interest, unless the context indicates otherwise. Interest on this Security shall accrue from the Issue Date, or from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or provided for. Interest shall be payable semiannually in arrears on April 30 and October 30 of each year, beginning on October 30, 2006, to the holders of record of Securities at the close of business on the April 15 or October 15 immediately preceding such Interest Payment Date; provided, however, that interest payable upon redemption or purchase of the Securities by the Company shall be paid to the Person to whom Principal is payable, unless the Redemption Date, Repurchase Date or Change in Control Purchase Date, as the case may be, is an Interest Payment Date. Each payment of cash interest on this Security shall include interest accrued for the period commencing on and including the immediately preceding Interest Payment Date (or, if none, the Issue Date) through the day before the applicable Interest Payment Date. Any payment required to be made on any day that is not a Business Day shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day. Interest shall be calculated using a 360-day year composed of twelve 30-day months. Interest shall cease to accrue on this Security upon its Maturity or conversion.
          If any portion of the Principal Amount hereof or any premium hereon is not paid when due (whether upon acceleration pursuant to Section 7.02 of the Indenture, upon the Redemption Date, the date set for payment of the Repurchase Price pursuant to paragraph 6 hereof, the date set for payment of the Change in Control Purchase Price pursuant to paragraph 7 hereof or at the Maturity Date) or if interest due hereon or any portion of such interest is not paid when due, then in each such case the overdue amount shall, to the extent permitted by law, bear interest at the rate of 3.75% per annum, compounded semiannually, which interest shall accrue from the date such overdue amount was originally due to the date payment of such amount, including interest thereon, has been made or duly provided for. All such interest shall be payable on demand.
2. Method Of Payment; Subordination
          Subject to the terms and conditions of the Indenture, the Company will make payments in respect of Redemption Prices, Repurchase Prices and Change in Control Purchase Prices and at the Maturity Date to Holders who surrender Securities to a Paying Agent to collect such payments in respect of the Securities. The Company will pay any cash amounts in money of the United States that at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts. Subject to the rights of the Holders of Certificated Securities to receive payments by wire transfer as provided in Section 12.01 of the Indenture, the Company may pay interest thereon by check mailed to the address of the Holder as it appears on the register of the Securities; provided, however, that all payments on any Global Security shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account of the Global Security Holder.
 
          This Security is subordinated in right of payment, to the extent and in the manner provided in Article 15 of the Indenture, to the prior payment in full of Senior Indebtedness of the Company.

          (f) final unsatisfied judgments not covered by insurance aggregating in excess of $20,000,000 are rendered against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and are not stayed, bonded or discharged within a period of 60 consecutive days; or

If an Event of Default described in clause (g) occurs with respect to the Company, the Principal Amount of the Outstanding Securities, plus all accrued and unpaid interest thereon through, but excluding, the date of such occurrence shall become immediately due and payable.

          Securityholders may not enforce the Indenture or the Securities except as provided in the Indenture.
