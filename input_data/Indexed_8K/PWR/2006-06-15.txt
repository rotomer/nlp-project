Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
Item 2.03 Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.
On June 12, 2006, Quanta Services, Inc. (the "Company") entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the "Restated Credit Agreement") among the Company, as Borrower, the Company's subsidiaries party thereto, as Guarantors, Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent, Swing Line Lender and L/C Issuer, and the lenders party thereto. The Restated Credit Agreement amends and restates the Credit Agreement, dated as of December 19, 2003, as amended, among the Company, as Borrower, the Company's subsidiaries party thereto, as Guarantors, Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent, Swing Line Lender, L/C Issuer and Credit-Linked L/C Issuer, and the lenders party thereto.
The Restated Credit Agreement provides for a $300.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility maturing on June 12, 2011. The entire amount of the facility is available for the issuance of standby letters of credit, and up to $15.0 million of the facility is available for swing line loans. In addition, subject to the conditions specified in the Restated Credit Agreement, the Company has the option to increase the revolving commitments under the Restated Credit Agreement by up to an additional $125.0 million from time to time upon receipt of additional commitments from new or existing lenders. Borrowings under the Restated Credit Agreement are to be used for working capital, capital expenditures and for other general corporate purposes.
As of June 12, 2006, the Company had approximately $124.4 million of letters of credit issued under the Restated Credit Agreement and no outstanding revolving loans. The remaining $175.6 million was available for revolving loans or issuing new letters of credit. Amounts borrowed under the Restated Credit Agreement bear interest, at the Company's option, at a rate equal to either (a) the Eurodollar Rate under the Restated Credit Agreement plus 1.25% to 1.875%, as determined by the ratio of the Company's total funded debt to EBITDA, or (b) the Base Rate plus 0.25% to 0.875%, as determined by the ratio of the Company's total funded debt to EBITDA. Letters of credit issued under the Restated Credit Agreement are subject to a letter of credit fee of 1.25% to 1.875%, based on the ratio of the Company's total funded debt to EBITDA. The Company is also subject to a commitment fee of 0.25% to 0.35%, based on the ratio of its total funded debt to EBITDA, on any unused availability under the Restated Credit Agreement. The Base Rate equals the higher of (i) the Federal Funds Rate (as defined in the Restated Credit Agreement) plus 1/2 of 1% and (ii) Bank of America's prime rate.
The Restated Credit Agreement contains certain covenants, including a maximum funded debt to EBITDA ratio, a maximum senior debt to EBITDA ratio, a minimum interest coverage ratio and a minimum consolidated net worth covenant, in each case as specified in the Restated Credit Agreement. The Restated Credit Agreement limits certain acquisitions, mergers and consolidations, capital expenditures, asset sales and prepayments of indebtedness and, subject to certain exceptions, prohibits liens on material assets. The credit facility also includes limits on the payment of dividends and stock repurchase programs in any fiscal year to an annual aggregate amount of up to 25% of the Company's consolidated net income (plus the amount of
 
non-cash charges that reduced such consolidated net income) for the prior fiscal year. The Restated Credit Agreement does not limit dividend payments or other distributions payable solely in capital stock.
The Restated Credit Agreement provides for customary events of default and carries cross-default provisions with the Company's existing 4.0% convertible subordinated notes due 2007, 4.5% convertible subordinated notes due 2023 and 3.75% convertible subordinated notes due 2026 (collectively, the "Subordinated Notes"), the Company's Underwriting, Continuing Indemnity and Security Agreement with its surety and all of the Company's other debt instruments exceeding $10.0 million in borrowings. If an Event of Default (as defined in the Restated Credit Agreement) occurs and is continuing, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Restated Credit Agreement, amounts outstanding under the Restated Credit Agreement may be accelerated and may become or be declared immediately due and payable.
The Restated Credit Agreement is secured by a pledge of all of the capital stock of the Company's U.S. subsidiaries, 65% of the capital stock of its foreign subsidiaries and substantially all of the Company's assets. The Company and its subsidiaries party to the Restated Credit Agreement entered into an Amended and Restated Security Agreement and an Amended and Restated Pledge Agreement in connection with the Restated Credit Agreement. The Company's U.S. subsidiaries guarantee the repayment of all amounts due under the Restated Credit Agreement. The Company's obligations under the Restated Credit Agreement constitute designated senior indebtedness under the Subordinated Notes.
Banc of America Securities LLC, which acted as Sole Lead Arranger and Sole Book Manager for the Restated Credit Agreement, and some of the other lenders under the Restated Credit Agreement and their respective affiliates, have provided financial advisory and investment banking services to the Company and its subsidiaries for which they have received customary fees.
The foregoing summary of some of the terms of the Restated Credit Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text thereof, a copy of which is filed as an exhibit to this report and is incorporated herein by reference.
Item 8.01 Other Events.
On June 15, 2006, Quanta issued a press release announcing its entry into a $300 million amended and restated revolving credit facility and the expiration and results of its cash tender offer for all of its outstanding 4.0% convertible subordinated notes due 2007.

Power of Attorney

The Administrative Agent shall be under no duty to exercise or withhold the exercise of any of the rights, powers, privileges, and options expressly or implicitly granted to the Administrative Agent in this Agreement, and shall not be liable for any failure to do so or any delay in doing so.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent shall be conclusively deemed to have exercised reasonable care in the custody of the Collateral if the Administrative Agent takes such action, for purposes of preserving rights in the Collateral, as any of the Debtors may reasonably request in writing, but no failure or omission or delay by the Administrative Agent in complying with any such request by such Debtor, and no refusal by the Administrative Agent to comply with any such request by such Debtor, shall of itself be deemed to be a failure to exercise reasonable care.

     3.1 . Such Pledgor owns or, with respect to Collateral acquired after the date hereof, such Pledgor will own, legally and beneficially, the Collateral free and clear of any Lien, security interest, pledge, claim, or other encumbrance or any right or option on the part of any third person to purchase or otherwise acquire the Collateral or any part thereof, except for the security interest granted hereunder and Permitted Liens.

Title
 
and there exists no "adverse claim" within the meaning of Section 8-102 of the UCC with respect to the Collateral.

Any sums paid upon or in respect of the Collateral upon the liquidation or dissolution of the issuer thereof in violation of the Credit Agreement shall be paid over to the Administrative Agent to be held by it as additional Collateral for the Secured Obligations subject to the terms hereof except as otherwise provided in the Credit Agreement; and in case any distribution shall be made on or in respect of the Collateral while a Default or an Event of Default shall be continuing or any property shall be distributed while a Default or an Event of Default shall be continuing upon or with respect to the Collateral pursuant to any recapitalization or reclassification of the capital of the issuer thereof or pursuant to any reorganization of the issuer thereof, the property so distributed shall be delivered to the Administrative Agent to be held by it, as additional Collateral for the Secured Obligations, subject to the terms hereof.

SECTION 5.
Rights of the Administrative Agent and Pledgor
     5.1 . Each Pledgor hereby irrevocably and with the power of substitution constitutes and appoints the Administrative Agent on behalf of the holders of the Secured Obligations and any officer or agent thereof, with full power of substitution, as its true and lawful attorney-in-fact with full irrevocable power and authority in the place and stead and in the name of each Pledgor or in its own name, from time to time in the Administrative Agent's discretion during the continuance of an Event of Default and prior to the Collateral Termination Date, to take any and all action and to execute any and all documents and instruments which may be necessary or desirable to accomplish the purposes of this Agreement and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, hereby gives the Administrative Agent the power and right on behalf of the Pledgors and in its own name to do any of the following after the
Power of Attorney
 
occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default and to the extent permitted by applicable laws, without notice to or the consent of the Pledgors:
 
This power of attorney is a power coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable. The Administrative Agent shall be under no duty to exercise or withhold the exercise of any of the rights, powers, privileges, and options expressly or implicitly granted to the Administrative Agent in this Agreement, and shall not be liable for any failure to do so or any delay in doing so. The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any act or omission or for any error of judgment or any mistake of fact or law in its individual capacity or in its capacity as attorney-in-fact except acts or omissions constituting or resulting from its willful misconduct or gross negligence. This power of attorney is conferred on the Administrative Agent solely to protect, preserve, and realize upon its security interest in the Collateral.
     5.2 . Until written notice shall be given to the Pledgors in accordance with Section 6.2(d) that the Administrative Agent has exercised its rights under Section 6.2(d) to vote the Collateral (provided, however, if the Administrative Agent is prevented from providing such notice as a result of Section 362 of the United States Bankruptcy Code or similar law the Pledgors shall be entitled to exercise such rights so long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing), a Pledgor shall be entitled to exercise any and all voting and other rights relating or pertaining to the Collateral or any part thereof and the Administrative Agent shall execute and deliver (or cause to be executed and delivered) to such Pledgor all such proxies and other instruments as such Pledgor may reasonably request for the purpose of enabling such Pledgor to exercise the voting and other rights which it is entitled to exercise pursuant to this sentence.
Voting Rights
     5.3 . Until written notice shall be given to the Pledgors in accordance with Section 6.2(d) that the Administrative Agent has exercised its rights under Section 6.2(d) to vote the Collateral, each Pledgor shall be entitled to receive and collect for its own use all Collateral Proceeds.
Collateral Proceeds
     5.4 . If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing or if a Pledgor fails to perform or comply with any of its agreements contained herein, the Administrative Agent may perform or cause performance of or compliance with such agreement and in so doing may expend such sums as the Administrative Agent may reasonably deem advisable in the performance thereof. All such expenses of the Administrative Agent so expended, together with interest thereon at the rate of interest provided in the Credit Agreement, shall be payable by the Pledgors on a joint and several basis to the Administrative Agent on demand and shall constitute Secured Obligations secured by this Agreement.
Performance by the Administrative Agent of the Pledgors' Obligations
     5.5 . Other than the exercise of reasonable care in the physical custody of the Collateral while held by the Administrative Agent hereunder, the Administrative Agent shall have no responsibility for or obligation or duty with respect to all or any part of the Collateral or any matter or proceeding arising out of or relating thereto, including, without limitation, any obligation or duty to collect any sums due in respect thereof or to protect or preserve any rights against prior parties or any other rights pertaining thereto, it being understood and agreed that Pledgor shall be responsible for preservation of all rights in the Collateral. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent shall be conclusively deemed to have exercised reasonable care in the custody of the Collateral if the Administrative Agent takes such action, for purposes of preserving rights in the Collateral, as Pledgor may reasonably request in writing, but no failure or omission or delay by the Administrative Agent in complying with any such request by Pledgor, and no refusal by the Administrative Agent to comply with any such request by Pledgor, shall of itself be deemed to be a failure to exercise reasonable care.
The Administrative Agent's Duty of Care

Event of Default
     6.2 . Prior to the Collateral Termination Date, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default and so long as the same shall be continuing, the Administrative Agent shall have the following rights and remedies to the extent not prohibited by applicable laws:
Rights and Remedies
 
Because of applicable securities laws, including without limitation, the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and other applicable state securities laws, there may be legal restrictions or limitations affecting attempts of the Administrative Agent to dispose of the Collateral in the enforcement of its rights and remedies hereunder, the Administrative Agent is hereby authorized by the Pledgors, but not obligated, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, to the extent permitted by applicable law, to sell all or any part of the Collateral at private sale, subject to investment letters or in any other manner which will not require the Collateral or any part thereof, to be registered in accordance with the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any other applicable securities law or regulation. The Pledgors specifically agree that under these circumstances, such a sale is a commercially reasonable method of disposition of the Collateral. The Administrative Agent is also hereby authorized by the Pledgors, but not obligated, to take such actions, give such notices, obtain such rulings and consents, and do such other things as the Administrative Agent may deem appropriate in the event of such a sale or disposition of any of the Collateral. The Pledgors acknowledge that the Administrative Agent may, in its reasonable discretion, approach a restricted number of potential purchasers and that a sale under such circumstances may yield a lower price for the Collateral or any part or parts thereof than would otherwise be obtainable if the same were registered and sold in the open market, the Pledgors agrees that such private sale shall constitute a commercially reasonable method of disposing of the Collateral in view of the time, expense, and potential liability to the parties of such transactions of registration of the Collateral in accordance with applicable securities laws.
     6.3 . Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default, any payments in respect of the Secured Obligations and any proceeds of the Collateral, when received by the Administrative Agent or any of the holders of the Secured Obligations in cash or its equivalent, will be applied in reduction of the Secured Obligations in the order set forth in the Credit Agreement.
Application of Proceeds
SECTION 7.
Miscellaneous.
     7.1 . No failure on the part of the Administrative Agent to exercise and no delay in exercising, and no course of dealing with respect to, any right, power, privilege or remedy under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise
No Waiver; Cumulative Remedies
 
of any right, power, privilege or remedy under this Agreement preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power, privilege or remedy. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable laws, the rights, powers, privileges and remedies provided for in this Agreement are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights, powers, privileges and remedies provided by law. The Administrative Agent may exercise any right, power, privilege or remedy under this Agreement or under applicable law against any Pledgor without enforcing any rights, powers, privileges or remedies against any other Pledgor under this Agreement or otherwise, each of the Pledgors expressly waiving any rights or requirements that the Administrative Agent or any Lender first enforce any right, power, privilege or remedy against the Borrower, any other Pledgor or any other Collateral for the Secured Obligations.
     7.2 . This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of each Pledgor and the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the holders of the Secured Obligations and their respective heirs, successors, and assigns, except that none of the Pledgors may assign any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the Required Lenders under the Credit Agreement except to the extent permitted by the Credit Agreement.

Exhibit 99.4
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 06-13
     Quanta Services, Inc. (NYSE: PWR) announced today that it has entered into an amended and restated credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders led by Bank of America, N.A. The $300.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility matures on June 12, 2011 and replaces Quanta's previous $182.0 million credit facility. The amended credit agreement contains customary financial and other covenants and provides improved flexibility for certain matters including acquisitions, investments, capital expenditures, subordinated indebtedness and debt prepayments.
Houston  June 15, 2006 
five-year
     "We are extraordinarily pleased with the results of our refinancing efforts during the second quarter of 2006," said James H. Haddox, CFO of Quanta Services, Inc. "These refinancing activities will provide Quanta with increased financial flexibility, lengthened debt maturities and lower borrowing costs. Considering our substantial cash balance, the facility will be initially used for letters of credit totaling $124.4 million, which will be priced at 1.625% of the face amount of the letters of credit versus approximately 3.0% under the previous credit facility."
     Quanta Services also announced today the expiration and final results of its cash tender offer for any and all of its outstanding 4.0% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2007. The tender offer expired at midnight, New York City time, on June 13, 2006.
     As of the expiration date of the tender offer, $139,227,000 principal amount of the notes, representing approximately 80.7% of the notes outstanding, had been validly tendered pursuant to the tender offer, all of which Quanta accepted for payment. Each holder who tendered notes on or before the expiration date will receive $985 in cash for each $1,000 of principal amount of notes tendered, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but not including, the date the notes are paid pursuant to the offer. Banc of America Securities LLC, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. acted as Dealer Managers in connection with the tender offer.
     As a result of amending the credit agreement and the repurchase of the convertible notes, Quanta expects to record a charge in the second quarter of 2006 of approximately $3.2 million related to the write-off of deferred financing costs. Partially offsetting this charge will be a gain on early extinguishment of debt of approximately $1.6 million, net of the tender offer costs.
 
     In conjunction with the restated credit agreement, Quanta Services will file a Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This filing will also be available on the company's web site at www.quantaservices.com.
