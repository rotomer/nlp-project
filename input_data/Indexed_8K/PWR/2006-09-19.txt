Executive Summary & Selected Highlights
Quanta Services is a leading national provider of specialty contracting solutions to the electric power, natural gas, telecommunications, broadband cable television and specialty services industries. That is, Quanta's current and future customers are expecting, as they grow their businesses through mergers and increased outsourcing, specialty contractors to increase the scope of their service capabilities and geographic reach. Through its operating units located across the United States, Quanta provides design, installation, repair, maintenance and emergency response services that assist customers in reducing costs, increasing operating efficiencies and improving network performance.
Quanta was created to respond to the increasing need for the outsourcing of infrastructure services.
The August 2003 power blackout, the largest in North America's history, brought to the forefront what the power industry has known for years: the nation's power grid is old, overloaded and in need of significant upgrades and maintenance to serve the country's current and future power needs. Prompted in part by the August 2003 blackout, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPAct) was signed into law to, among other things, improve the nation's electric transmission capacity and reliability and to promote investment in the nation's energy infrastructure.
Quanta estimates that it will cost between $100 billion and $200 billion over the next ten to fifteen years to expand, upgrade and maintain the United States' transmission and distribution (T&D) system adequately.
Quanta and the industries it serves have emerged from one of the most difficult operating environments in thirty years due to challenging economic and capital markets conditions and the collapse of the telecommunications industry from 2001 through 2003. However, Quanta's customers have largely regained their financial strength and operational stability and their spending patterns have been improving. It may take some additional time before customer spending levels and Quanta's margins return to normal levels, but both spending and margins have been trending upwards and Quanta believes its operating environment is headed in a positive direction. :
As favorable operating conditions and growth opportunities continue, there are several major trends that could generate long-term organic revenue growth opportunities of approximately 10-15% annually
Quanta remains focused on its operations and on maintaining a healthy financial position. Quanta has seen its end-markets experience increased stability and show signs of growth over the past year. As Quanta's customers' financial health has improved, these customers have been increasing investment in their infrastructure networks. Quanta is assuming industry trends will remain positive and expects to continue to improve margins and profitability through the course of the year.
With $309.5 million of cash on its balance sheet as of June 30, 2006, Quanta believes it is well positioned, both financially and operationally, to capitalize on future growth opportunities in the industries it serves.

Quanta Services Company Overview
Quanta Services is a leading national provider of specialty contracting solutions to the electric power, natural gas, telecommunications, broadband cable television, and specialty services industries. Through its operating units located throughout the United States, Quanta provides design, installation, repair, maintenance and emergency response services that assist Quanta's customers in reducing costs, increasing operating efficiencies and improving network performance. The Company also provides a variety of specialty services such as energized energy services; inside electrical wiring; intelligent traffic networks; cable and control systems for light rail lines, airports and highways; and specialty rock trenching, directional boring and road milling for industrial and commercial customers.
Quanta's customers are expecting specialty contractors to increase the scope of their service capabilities and geographic reach as these customers grow their businesses through mergers and increased outsourcing. These requirements are a tall order for the average private specialty contractor, so in February 1998, Quanta became a publicly traded company to obtain additional capital to pursue a strategy of "smart growth" consolidation coupled with organic growth. This decision was driven by increased infrastructure services outsourcing trends and greater customer demands.
Quanta was created to respond to the increasing need for outsourced infrastructure services.
After its IPO, Quanta selectively acquired approximately 85 specialty contractors over several years to increase the scope of its services, expand its geographic reach and diversity, and enhance its future growth opportunities. Though initially focused on the electric utility industry, Quanta expanded into the telecommunications and broadband cable television infrastructure services industries as its core utility customers began expanding into those unregulated sectors and turned to Quanta to provide simultaneous electrical, telecommunications and broadband cable television infrastructure services.
Due to challenges in the telecommunications and broadband cable television sectors from 2001 through 2003, Quanta's utility customers largely have ceased pursuing telecommunications and broadband cable television initiatives and have refocused on the electric and gas utility side of their businesses. Quanta believes that its customers' operational refocusing and improved balance sheets coupled with favorable regulatory developments in the utility, telecommunications and broadband cable TV industries create a positive operating environment for Quanta.

Major Market Trends & Outsourcing Thesis
Energy Policy Act of 2005
Signed into law in August 2005, the EPAct includes provisions designed to improve the nation's electric transmission capacity and reliability and to promote investment in the nation's energy infrastructure. The EPAct calls for a self-regulated reliability organization that will implement and enforce mandatory reliability standards on all market participants, with oversight by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). FERC is required to issue rules promoting capital investment to enlarge, improve and maintain the nation's transmission facilities; provide a rate of return that attracts investment in transmission; and provide for recovery of costs of complying with the new mandatory reliability standards. As a result, over the next twelve to twenty-four months, Quanta expects many utilities to evaluate the condition of their infrastructure more closely and act on much needed upgrades to meet the higher reliability standards and ever increasing demand.
FERC is also authorized to issue permits for the construction or modification of transmission facilities within national interest electric transmission corridors when states fail to act in a timely manner or lack authority to issue permits. Quanta expects these new rules to lead to a streamlined permitting process, which should make investment in the nation's transmission system more attractive.
The EPAct also modifies a longstanding barrier to effective competition by repealing the Public Utility Holding Company Act (PUHCA). The repeal of PUHCA is expected to attract new investors in this sector. These non-utility investors are likely to focus on reducing costs, while enabling utilities to focus on their core competencies. Quanta believes that the repeal of PUHCA may lead to increased interest in outsourcing solutions.
Heightened Awareness of Network Upgrade Needs
Due to challenging operating and capital market conditions, the collapse of the telecommunications industry from 2001 through 2003 and previous regulatory uncertainties, many service providers in the industries Quanta serves have not adequately invested in their networks. This has been a problem in the electric utility industry for many years, which was highlighted during the August 2003 power blackout. The collapse of the telecommunications industry from 2001 through 2003 resulted in nearly all telecommunications companies significantly reducing network maintenance and minimizing expansion plans for several years. These issues have created demand for general network maintenance as well as for new network development to handle demand and competition for new communications and entertainment services.

Need for Transmission & Distribution (T&D) Network Upgrade & Maintenance  Highlighted by Outages
For many years the electric power industry has not invested enough in its transmission and distribution networks to keep pace with electricity demand. The August 14, 2003 power blackout  the largest power blackout in North America's history  highlighted the significant need for T&D network upgrade and maintenance. Due to the number of people impacted by the catastrophic failure of the United States. power grid, the event increased the nation's awareness of what has been known in the power industry for many years: the nation's electrical grid is old, overloaded and in need of significant maintenance and expansion to handle the country's current and growing power needs.
Despite previous power blackouts since the 1960s that left tens of millions of people in the dark, expansion and maintenance of the grid has fallen short. As the country's population has grown and technology has become a larger part of everyday life,
generating capacity has increased nearly eight fold over the past ten years

while demand for electricity has grown more than 20%

. However, transmission capacity over the last ten years has fallen by approximately 16% and is expected to decline by approximately 7% from 2003 to 2008

.
While the August 2003 blackout was the worst in the nation's history, it was not the first major blackout impacting North America, and unfortunately, may not be the last. The accompanying table lists examples of other major bulk electric system power outages that have hit North America. Note that this list excludes many past power outage events that also impacted many people, such as the rolling blackouts experienced in California during 2000 and 2001.
Each year there are smaller power outages that occur throughout North America. While these do not get significant media attention, they are more frequent than one would expect. The chart to the bottom right of the page depicts the number of power outages that occur versus the number of people the outage impacts. For example, the orange data point in the lower right hand corner of the graph represents the large outage of August 10, 1996, which affected more than seven million consumers in eleven western states and two Canadian provinces.

Telecommunications Network Maintenance & Upgrade Needs
As a result of the challenges faced by telecommunications companies in the early part of this decade, telecommunications networks have not been properly maintained over the last few years and network expansion has been minimal.
Telecommunications industry spending stabilized in 2004, and in the latter half of 2004, several significant new telecommunications initiatives were announced that require significant network expansion and upgrades. These new initiatives involve bringing fiber optic cable much closer to the end user: fiber to the home, fiber to the premise (FTTP) and fiber to the node (FTTN). Such initiatives, often referred to as FTTx, are being implemented by Verizon and AT&T (formerly SBC Communications), and municipalities have also become active in FTTx initiatives. These projects will increase telecommunications network spending by billions of dollars over the next five to ten years and should create favorable demand for the network installation and maintenance services Quanta provides.
Quanta experienced increasing demand for its services in 2005 related to FTTx initiatives and continues to see demand related to these initiatives year-to-date in 2006. Verizon confirmed that it had passed more than three million homes and businesses in 16 states by the end of 2005. Verizon also announced plans to pass an additional three million homes and businesses in 2006. In addition, AT&T announced plans to deliver Internet telephone service to 18 million homes by the first half of 2008, including the installation of more than 38,000 miles of fiber at an estimated cost of $4 billion. This fiber will deliver integrated Internet Protocol (IP)-based television, high speed Internet and voice and wireless bundles of products and services.
Customers Focusing on Core Business; Value of End-to-End Solutions
All of the industries Quanta serves are facing very competitive environments. After several years of challenging economic and capital market conditions, many companies in the electric and gas utility, telecommunications and broadband cable television industries have refocused their human and financial assets on core operations, operating efficiencies and prudent capital investment in their networks. The absolute dollar amount of network capital expenditures by Quanta's customers declined from 2002 through 2004. However, conditions stabilized in 2005 and since then Quanta's customers have begun to gradually increase spending on network maintenance and installation. Network spending has not returned to historically "normal" levels, but customer indications, bidding activity and other industry developments point to the return of a positive spending trend by the industries Quanta serves.
Small owner-operated contractors are not as well positioned as Quanta to serve the broad range of needs that many utilities, telecommunications, and broadband cable television companies request. Further, service providers are reducing the number of vendors they deal with to reduce paperwork, bidding and vendor management costs, and time.
One way for Quanta's customers to focus on core operations, operating efficiencies and prudent capital investment is to outsource non-revenue-generating functions, such as network infrastructure development and maintenance.
Increasingly, the industries Quanta serves are looking for companies like Quanta that are able to provide a wide array of network infrastructure services on a national basis  on time and on budget.
Increased Outsourcing of Infrastructure Services
Challenging economic and capital market conditions, stiff competition among peers, focus on efficiencies, and the need to enhance and maintain the lifeblood of their business  their networks  are causing companies in the electric and gas utility, telecommunications, and broadband cable television industries to

increase the amount of network infrastructure work outsourced to specialty contractors like Quanta Services.
Quanta estimates that annual outsourced infrastructure spending in the primary industries Quanta serves is in excess of $30 billion. Quanta further estimates that the electric power and natural gas industry typically outsources approximately 30%-40% of its infrastructure work to specialty contractors, the telecommunications industry typically outsources approximately 50%-60% of its infrastructure work, and the broadband cable television industry typically outsources approximately 70%-80% of its infrastructure work to specialty contractors. As economic, capital market and operating conditions have generally improved for Quanta's customers, they have begun to return to more normalized levels of investment in their networks. As a result, Quanta's annual addressable market opportunity and the amount of work that is outsourced should grow.
In addition to service providers outsourcing elements of their network installation and maintenance activities, Quanta believes there is significant opportunity in its customers completely outsourcing the operation and maintenance of their network infrastructure (utilities, telecommunications and broadband cable television companies alike). In fact,
Quanta is the only specialty contractor to successfully develop and implement a complete infrastructure outsourcing program with an electric utility.
Puget Sound Energy was one of the first utilities to announce that it would progressively outsource 100% of its infrastructure operations and maintenance functions. Puget Sound Energy considered twelve different companies for this vital task and chose Quanta for both electric and gas infrastructure outsourcing initiatives. Today, Quanta is managing all electric and gas construction for new residences and businesses in Puget Sound's Washington service area, as well as managing all related inventory and materials. Under Quanta's management, productive work hours have increased by at least one hour per day, a 30% cost savings over historical numbers is projected, and service levels continue to improve. Puget Sound Energy and Quanta forged new ground with this outsourcing. As it has proven successful, more companies are seriously examining a complete outsourcing model.

Massive Need for Transmission & Distribution Upgrades & Maintenance
The August 2003 power blackout, the largest in North America's history, brought to the forefront what the power industry has known for years: the nation's power grid is old, overloaded, and needs significant upgrades and maintenance to serve the country's current and future power needs. With a concerned public and 50 million angry northeastern constituents, politicians began taking the grid's most spectacular failure seriously, as is evident with the passage of EPAct.
 
The challenge the industry faces is not one of a shortage of electricity and generating capacity, but capacity constraints and bottlenecks for transmitting and distributing the electricity to the end user. The map above depicts the nation's major transmission lines and identifies key capacity constraints. As indicated, there are a troubling number of key transmission capacity constraints. As indicated by the charts below, while demand for electricity has grown over 20% over the past decade, transmission capacity has fallen by approximately 16% and is expected to decline further by approximately 7% from 2003 to 2008. It is believed the EPAct will help to reduce transmission constraints and reliability.

The Edison Electric Institute estimates that more than $6 billion will be invested in transmission by integrated and stand-alone transmission companies in 2006. According to Platts Research, currently there are more than 700 proposed transmission projects totaling over 23,700 miles being planned.
Quanta estimates that it will cost between $100 billion and $200 billion to significantly upgrade and maintain the United States transmission and distribution (T&D) system over the next ten to fifteen years.
According to Platts, before the August 2003 blackout there was $27.5 billion worth of T&D projects beginning in 2004 with completion by 2008. The discrepancy between the amount of earmarked projects before the blackout versus the significant amount that is estimated as necessary to meaningfully upgrade the nation's T&D infrastructure illustrates the magnitude of the electric power industry's underinvestment in its T&D infrastructure over the years.
Prior to the August 2003 blackout, R.J. Rudden Associates estimated that bringing spending in line with forecast demand would require a 25% annual increase in transmission spending and a 50% annual increase in distribution spending (see data on following page).
The majority of the nation's T&D infrastructure was built shortly after World War II, is over 50 years old in many cases, and is beyond its useful life. The table below illustrates the number of poles installed annually by a particular electric power utility. While the identity of the specific utility is concealed, the chart illustrates an investment pattern that is typical for the average United States electric utility. The vast majority of the grid system was installed from 1945 to the late 1970s. With these assets already past or rapidly approaching the end of their useful life, as depicted in the chart below, significant demand now exists for pole repair and replacement going forward based on past T&D investment.
Electric utilities have underinvested in their T&D infrastructure for three primary reasons: (1) uncertainty regarding the final terms of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (FERC) standard market design proposal, (2) the inability to recover investment costs in T&D investment under state imposed rate freezes, and (3) lack of capital to invest as a result of energy trading losses, telecommunications business investments and other financial pressures.
With the enactment of the EPAct in 2005, many regulatory uncertainties have been cleared up and utilities have begun to analyze their T&D infrastructure in light of new reliability requirements as well as new regulations that make investment in their networks more attractive and easier to complete. In fact, a number of aspects of the EPAct have already been implemented and utilities are responding accordingly. Further, improved economic conditions and stronger utilities' balance sheets have better positioned utilities to invest in their T&D networks.

It is troubling that investment in T&D infrastructure has declined over the years while demand for electricity has meaningfully increased. Coupled with the fact that much of the nation's T&D infrastructure is 50 years old, it is apparent that the power industry is increasingly relying on aging assets. This is a recipe for significant future problems as power demand increases on an aged and overloaded grid.
Deflated T&D Expenditures in Year 2000 Dollars
($ in Billions)
The table to the right depicts adjusted historical utility T&D expenditures and suggests that (1) capital spending has not been sufficient to replace old transmission assets and (2) sufficient spending has not been earmarked to replace aging distribution assets in the future. As the graphs and data show, utility investment in the expansion and maintenance of T&D assets has lagged behind what is needed.
Expanding and improving current T&D assets to meet current and future power demand is a daunting task. Further complicating the issue, the demand for electricity is expected to continue to grow at a healthy rate for the next few decades as (1) the country's population expands and (2) we become increasingly dependent on technology, which requires power. The good news is utilities have increased spending on transmission lines after a period of declining spending. Based on data depicted below, it is anticipated that utilities will meaningfully increase annual transmission spending through 2008 and beyond.

The map below illustrates the estimated demand for electricity by state in the United States from 2003 to 2014. Platts estimates that overall electricity demand in the United States will grow in excess of 20% over this period. Areas such as California and the northeastern United States are expected to have 40%-55% increases in electricity demand over the period. Both of these areas have had major blackouts and brownouts in the past few years.
The electric utility industry finds itself in the position of playing catch-up from underinvestment, needing to replace and repair a significant amount of its legacy distribution network, and properly plan for future electricity demand. The August 2003 blackout caught the attention of utilities and politicians, and was a catalyst for the adoption of the EPAct in August 2005. Quanta expects the EPAct to lead to increased infrastructure investment by utilities over the next twelve to twenty-four months. As one of the largest specialty electrical infrastructure contractor in the country, Quanta is well positioned to meet the needs of its customers and to benefit from future increases in T&D network investment by the electric utility industry.

Quanta Services Operations Overview
For the three months ending June 30, 2006, revenues generated by customers in the electric power and natural gas industries accounted for approximately 66% of revenue, telecommunications and broadband cable television for approximately 17% and ancillary for approximately 17%. For the year 2005, revenues generated by customers in the electric power and natural gas industries accounted for approximately 67% of revenue, telecommunications and broadband cable television for approximately 15% and ancillary for approximately 18%. For the year 2004, revenues generated by customers in the electric power and natural gas industries accounted for approximately 65% of revenue, telecommunications and broadband cable television for approximately 17% and ancillary for approximately 18%.
Quanta estimates that annual infrastructure spending in the primary industries Quanta serves is in excess of $30 billion. Of that, Quanta estimates that the six largest public and private specialty contractors serving these combined industries only account for 15% or less of the market. Quanta estimates that it commands the largest portion of this estimated 15% share, but it is less than 5% of the total addressable market. The balance of the market is served by smaller, typically private companies. With its broader scope of services, greater financial and organizational resources, and superior work force, Quanta believes it has significant opportunities to increase its market share over time. Quanta estimates that currently approximately 30%-40% of electric and gas infrastructure work is outsourced, 50%-60% of telecommunications infrastructure work is outsourced, and 70%-80% of broadband cable television infrastructure work is outsourced.
As the accompanying charts depict, the percentage of revenues Quanta derived from the telecommunications and broadband cable television industries for the first six months of 2006 was significantly less versus the year 2001. This is primarily due to the historic collapse of the telecommunications market and a challenging operating environment in the broadband cable television market from 2001 through 2003. During that period, nearly all of Quanta's telecommunications and broadband cable television customers experienced operating and financial challenges, and a number of Quanta's telecommunications and broadband cable television customers filed for bankruptcy. As a result, capital expenditures and overall network investment by the telecommunications and broadband cable television sectors during that period declined significantly versus levels in the late 1990s and early 2000, and also relative to normal historical levels. Expenditures in the telecommunications and broadband cable TV sector have stabilized and are beginning to increase.

Quanta believes the effects of the historic downturn of the telecommunications industry from 2001 through 2003 have passed, and the industry has stabilized and is selectively pursuing growth opportunities. There are several telecommunications initiatives currently in discussion and underway by several government organizations, wire line carriers and wireless carriers that are providing Quanta with growth opportunities, in particular FTTx initiatives. Quanta believes these initiatives will continue through 2006. However, Quanta currently does not believe these opportunities are indicative of an overall return to historical network investment levels by the telecommunications industry as a whole.
As the industries Quanta serves continue to gain strength and gradually increase network spending, the Company has begun to see gross margins improve. In fact, Quanta has been experiencing improved margins on new work and believes that margins could continue to improve through the balance of the year.
Quanta is unique from its competitors because it has a diversified network infrastructure service offering for its customers and a diversified customer base. For the second quarter of 2006, Quanta's largest customer accounted for approximately 6% of revenues. For the second quarter of 2006, Quanta's top ten and top twenty customers accounted for approximately 34% and 50% of revenues, respectively. This diverse customer base reduces Quanta's reliance on any one customer in a given period and is one reason why the Company was able to remain financially healthy through the tumultuous telecommunications downturn over the past few years.

Quanta's backlog at the end of the second quarter of 2006 was approximately $1.335 billion, which is the amount of revenue it expects to realize from work to be performed over the next twelve months on uncompleted contracts, including new contractual agreements on which work has not begun. Quanta's backlog at the end of the second quarter of 2006 of $1.335 billion was up from backlog at the end of the second quarter of 2005 of $1.200 billion, and up versus backlog of $1.295 billion at the end of 2005. Approximately one third of Quanta's revenues are typically derived from strategic alliances the Company has with various customers, engineering firms, manufacturers, distributors, and others.

These factors include influences due to weather, capital expenditure spending patterns, bidding seasons, and holidays. Typically, Quanta's revenues are lowest in the first quarter of the year because cold, snowy or wet conditions cause delays. The second quarter is typically better than the first, as some projects begin, but continued cold and wet weather can often impact second quarter productivity. The third quarter is typically the best of the year, as a greater number of projects are underway and weather is more accommodating to work on projects. Revenues during the fourth quarter of the year are typically lower than the third quarter but higher than the second quarter. Many projects are completed in the fourth quarter and revenues often are positively impacted by customers seeking to spend their capital budget before the end of the year; however, the holiday season and inclement weather sometimes can cause delays.
It is important to understand that Quanta's business is typically influenced by seasonal factors.
Electric Utility Infrastructure Services
Quanta performs a complete range of specialty contracting installation, maintenance and repair services for the electric utility industry. Types of electric utility customers include investor-owned utilities (IOUs), independent power producers (IPPs), rural electric associations (REAs) and federal, state and municipal agencies.
As the largest specialty electric power contractor in the United States, Quanta has some of the most experienced contractors and employees in the industry. In fact, a number of the companies that are now part of Quanta contributed to the original build-out of the national transmission and distribution system over 70 years ago.
Quanta has the ability to handle any electrical infrastructure need for its customers. From project-based engineering and construction of a multi-state, several hundred mile, high voltage transmission line and substation system to complex underground distribution networks, Quanta can handle every size and scope of power project. In fact, there are more than 200,000 miles of overhead electrical lines and thousands of miles of underground electrical cable that have been built and/or are maintained by Quanta Services.
Some of Quanta's power infrastructure services capabilities include:

Energized Services
One of Quanta's significant competitive advantages on the power side is its unmatched expertise and capabilities in the field of energized services. Quanta's energized services and techniques enable Quanta to perform a wide variety of installation, maintenance, rebuild and repair services to almost all parts of an electric network while the network remains energized, without service interruption. Unique to Quanta's specialty electrical service offering is its exclusive, patented LineMaster Robotic Arm. Quanta owns the United States rights and the exclusive right to use the LineMaster Robotic Arm for more than the next 10 years. The LineMaster Robotic Arm is used in the construction, maintenance, repair, and improvement of energized T&D lines and substation facilities, and can reduce project completion times by more than 50% versus traditional methods. The telescoping robotic arm temporarily supports live power lines to allow repair or replacement of transmission poles, cross-arms, insulators, etc., while maintaining an energized connection.

Importantly, this capability prevents Quanta's customers from having to shut down a portion of the power grid to allow work to be done, eliminating downtime costs and angry consumers.
 Hotstick and barehand techniques also enable crews to work on lines without interrupting the customer's power supply. Quanta uses hotsticks to move conductors, install fuses, and open and close switches. For more intricate repairs, Quanta's crews use barehand techniques in which live-line workers wear specially designed protective gear that enables them to work at the same electrical potential as the line. Quanta's employees performing energized services are hand-selected, experienced journeymen, each of whom have completed more than 120 hours of specialized barehand training and annual, recurrent training to be "energized certified."
Hotstick & Barehand
Barehand crews can safely handle and efficiently repair live lines up to 765kV. On one project, Quanta used barehand techniques to repair a nuclear plant's 345kV substation switches in one day without shutting down the reactor.  the cost associated with shutting down the reactor, making repairs, returning it to operation and making spot market power purchases during the down time.
This saved the utility an estimated $10 million
Coupling the LineMaster Robotic Arm technology with Quanta's barehand and hotstick methods provides a complete energized solution that increases efficiency, reliability, levelization, and safety.

Energized Services Case Study
Kansas City Power & Light (KCP&L) was experiencing transmission congestion on its LaCygne-Stilwell Line, representing a major bottleneck for members and customers of the Southwest Power Pool (SPP) who rely on the line for service. Since the line was vital to the service needs of KCP&L and the SPP, taking the line out of service for any extended period of time for upgrades would have proved extremely disruptive in the form of lost revenue, power outages, and angry customers.
Since the line was built in 1972, KCP&L had done a number of system augmentations including substation enhancements at either end of the line as well as installing monitoring equipment that provided incremental capacity as power demand grew over the years. However, as KCP&L looked for additional capacity enhancements for the line, it became clear that KCP&L would have to rebuild or upgrade the line to truly solve its capacity problem.
The advent of a high-temperature conductor, or ACSS (aluminum conductor steel supported), meant that the ACSS could carry twice the load of the conductors KCP&L was using on the line, and that if the 345-kV line could be reconductored with the ACSS, KCP&L could use the existing H-frames supporting the line. If this were able to be done while the line remained energized, the line's capacity problem would be solved and customers would not experience any service disruption.
Because of Quanta's unmatched expertise in energized services, proprietary tools and work methods, KCP&L approached Quanta to work toward a rebuild solution on the LaCygne-Stillwell Line. Quanta worked with KCP&L and developed a plan predicated on reconductoring the line while energized. At that time, Quanta had worked on many energized projects for KCP&L, but none of this magnitude.
To do the job, Quanta used the Equal Potential Stringing Method, which isolated the working area and the conductor being pulled, used proprietary processes, tools and equipment to solve complicated issues and completed the project  all while the line remained in service. The project ran smoothly and was completed a month ahead of schedule, a major accomplishment given the snow and mud experienced at the start of the project in February and spring rains and storms in May.
In summary, Quanta and KCP&L broke new ground with this project in solving transmission congestion problems and upgrading conductors in an energized state. The project was completed ahead of schedule in under five months and cost less than $8 million. Had the line been replaced using traditional installation methods, the project would have taken longer, required the line to be shut down for periods at a time, been significantly more costly, and been disruptive to customers.

Natural Gas & Pipeline Services
Like the electric power industry, the continued growth of the natural gas industry is expected to generate significant activity, including the development of new pipelines and expansion or upgrades of current systems. Natural gas consumption in the United States is expected to rise significantly over the next two decades. Industry sources estimate that the United States needs 263,000 miles of distribution pipelines and another 38,000 miles of large diameter transmission pipelines. With the implementation of new legislative mandates requiring more structured and regular maintenance and monitoring of systems, there has been a sharp increase in demand for gas and pipeline services.
Quanta's services include the assessment, development, maintenance, and expansion of natural gas pipelines. Quanta delivers a comprehensive set of solutions for the natural gas and pipeline industries, including surveying, designing, installing, maintaining, and repairing and testing for all systems and methods of transmitting natural gas.

Understanding Gross Margins
It is important to understand how various factors  some controllable, some not  impact Quanta's gross margins on a quarterly or annual basis. Quanta's gross margin is gross profit expressed as a percentage of revenues. Cost of services consist primarily of salaries, wages and benefits to employees, depreciation, fuel and other equipment expenses, equipment rentals, subcontracted services, insurance, facilities expenses, materials and parts and supplies.
Seasonal patterns can have a significant impact on gross margins. Generally, business is slower in the winter months versus the warmer months of the year. This can be offset somewhat by increased demand for electrical service and repair work resulting from severe weather. In addition, the mix of business conducted in different parts of the country will affect margins, as some parts of the country offer the opportunity for higher gross margins than others.
Seasonal and Geographical.
Adverse or favorable weather conditions can impact gross margins in a given period. For example, it is typical in the first quarter of any fiscal year that parts of the country may experience snow or rainfall that may negatively impact Quanta's revenue and gross margin. In many cases, projects may be delayed or temporarily placed on hold due to inclement weather. Conversely, in periods when weather remains dry and temperatures are accommodating, more work can be done, sometimes with less cost, which would have a favorable impact on gross margins. In some cases, strong storms or hurricanes can provide Quanta with high margin emergency service restoration work, which generally has a positive impact on margins.
Weather.
The mix of revenue derived from the industries Quanta serves will impact gross margins. Changes in Quanta's customers' spending patterns in each of the industries it serves can cause an imbalance in supply and demand and, therefore, affect margins and mix of revenue by industry served.
Revenue Mix.
In general, installation work has a higher gross margin than maintenance work. This is because installation work is often obtained on a fixed price basis which has higher risk than other types of pricing arrangements. Quanta typically derives approximately 50% of its revenue from maintenance work, which is performed under pre-established or negotiated prices or cost-plus pricing arrangements. Thus, a higher portion of installation work in a given quarter may result in a higher gross margin.
Service and Maintenance versus Installation.
Work that is subcontracted to other service providers generally has lower gross margins. An increase in subcontract work in a given period may contribute to a decrease in gross margin. Quanta typically subcontracts approximately 10%  15% of its work to other service providers.
Subcontract Work.
Margins may be lower on projects on which Quanta furnishes materials as material prices are generally more predictable than labor costs. Consequently, Quanta generally is not able to mark up materials as much as labor costs. In a given period, a higher percentage of work that has a higher materials component may decrease overall gross margin.
Materials versus Labor.
Quanta includes depreciation in cost of services. This is common practice in Quanta's industry, but can make comparability to other companies difficult. This must be taken into consideration when comparing Quanta to other companies.
Depreciation.
Gross margins could be impacted by fluctuations in insurance accruals related to Quanta's deductibles in the period in which such adjustments are made. As of June 30, 2006, Quanta had a deductible of $1.0 million per occurrence related to employer's and general liability insurance and a deductible of $2.0 million per occurrence for automobile liability and workers' compensation insurance. Quanta also has a non-union employee health care benefit plan that is subject to a deductible of $250,000 per claimant per year.
Insurance.
Again, it is important to understand how various factors impact gross margin. Just because gross margin narrows in a quarter may not mean that Quanta is not managing its cost of services well.

Quanta's Growth Strategy  Steady Organic Growth Supplemented by Selected Acquisitions
Quanta is optimistic that demand for its services will continue to grow through the remainder of 2006 after recovering from several years of the most challenging and abnormal operating environments for Quanta and its peers in thirty years. No one could have predicted the severity and depth of the telecommunications industry's collapse and challenging environment for broadband cable television, leading to the significant reduction in network development and maintenance investment. The electric power industry, to a lesser extent, was impacted as well.
Throughout this period, Quanta transitioned from a company focused on growth to a company focused on managing its business in a tumultuous environment. Quanta has been successful in reducing its cost structure, streamlining operations, and improving its balance sheet. Quanta's current operating environment is much improved from several years ago but has not completely returned to normal.
In normal market conditions, Quanta enjoyed solid organic revenue growth in excess of 20%. Quanta believes that a sustainable long-term organic revenue growth rate for its business is approximately 10% to 15% in normal operating conditions. This growth will be driven by the need to invest in the expansion and maintenance of the nation's power grid and continued development and maintenance of telecommunications and broadband cable television networks as technology continues to develop new applications and services, such as FTTx initiatives. It will also be driven by increased network infrastructure installation and maintenance outsourcing trends as well as favorable regulatory developments.
Since its founding, Quanta has augmented its organic growth with strategic acquisitions of top tier companies, enabling it to expand its service offering and geographic reach to better serve its customers. Quanta has not completed an acquisition since early 2002, but with its strong balance sheet and operating conditions improving, Quanta may elect to selectively and opportunistically pursue the acquisition of companies to continue to enhance its service offering and expand its geographic reach.
We would note that Quanta has not purchased start-up companies or turnarounds, instead focusing on companies with an average operating history of 20 to 30 years and with a record of operational excellence and profitability. Quanta has a disciplined acquisition approach that focuses on various financial, geographic, and management criteria including:

Recent Financial Results & Commentary
Quanta's second quarter 2006 actual were higher than the Company's previously disclosed 2Q06 financial outlook, with margins and diluted EPS exceeding expectations due to solid growth across almost all of the industries Quanta serves. Quanta is pleased with its financial and operational performance year-to-date and expects operating conditions to remain favorable for the balance of the year. With solid demand for Quanta's services, Quanta believes the industries it serves will continue to turn to Quanta as they seek to partner with an industry leader to strengthen their delivery systems while managing costs and maximizing efficiency and customer service.
The second quarter of 2006 actual results included the following financial and operational highlights:
The quarter's improved financial results were attributable to additional opportunities due to continuing improvement in the financial health of Quanta's customers, improved pricing, better productivity and cost control as well as improved overall fixed cost absorption as a result of higher revenues. As more utilities and telecom service providers seek to form partnerships and continue to outsource more work, Quanta expects the trend toward negotiated work to continue. Electric power and gas revenues grew 22% in the second quarter of 2006 versus the same period a year ago and telecommunication and cable revenues grew 17.5% in the second quarter of 2006 versus the same quarter in 2005. Quanta's overall internal revenue growth was 17% in the second quarter of 2006.

Revenue Breakdown by Type of Customer
Quanta's backlog at the end of the second quarter of 2006 was $1.335 billion, up from fourth quarter 2005 backlog of $1.295 billion, and up versus end of second quarter 2005 backlog of $1.200 billion. Backlog is the amount of revenue it expects to realize from work to be performed over the next twelve months on uncompleted contracts, including new contractual agreements on which work has not begun. For the second quarter of 2006, Quanta's largest customer accounted for approximately 6% of revenues. Quanta's top 10 customers for the quarter accounted for 34% of revenues and top 20 customers accounted for 50% of revenues. At the end of the second quarter of 2006, Quanta's employee count was 11,664 versus 11,104 at the end of the fourth quarter of 2005 and versus 11,161 at the end of the second quarter of 2005.
Cash flow from operations in the second quarter of 2006 was $41.9 million. Cash flow from operations of $41.9 million less second quarter 2006 capital expenditures of $15.7 million resulted in free cash flow of $26.2 million in the second quarter of 2006.
Quanta's days sales outstanding (DSO), which is current accounts receivable plus costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts less billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts divided by the average revenues per day during the period, was 83 days at the end of the second quarter of 2006 versus 85 days at the end of the second quarter of 2005 and versus 86 days at the end of the first quarter of 2006.
The momentum behind the EPAct is growing and its mandated implementation schedule is keeping the federal, state and other organizations focused on its various requirements. It has been a year since the EPAct was signed into law. Since then, various mandates have begun to be implemented and numerous deadlines are rapidly approaching that will impact the future of power delivery. This legislation continues to spur general optimism and investment in infrastructure within the power industry. The following are several developments of interest:

This focus on reliability is not expected to diminish any time soon as demand for electricity continues to increase and power grid congestion gets tighter and tighter. The antiquity of the grid and the significant need for upgrade and new investment has again become apparent due to the impact of very hot weather across the United States in July 2006 that continues to put strain on the nation's power grid. More than three million Americans found themselves without power for hours, others for days. During the recent heat wave both LaGuardia Airport and the New York subway lost power, leaving many travelers and commuters stranded. In Queens, New York, as many as 100,000 people were affected by a nine-day outage caused by primary and secondary feeder lines that burned up due to strain. On the West Coast, California has called for a Stage 1 Power Emergency, which prepares for the possibility of rolling blackouts.
Many utilities are turning to new methods and technologies to increase productivity and efficiency while maintaining customer service. As a result, Quanta is working closely with its customers to evaluate outsourcing opportunities and to deploy its proprietary energized resources where applicable. Quanta's energized services continue to be a key competitive advantage for the Company. Utilities often come to Quanta to design a custom solution to a unique challenge with the power infrastructure. In these cases, it is typically too costly for the utility to take an outage or the system is too critical in nature to take out of service. Quanta's energized services team is focused on working with utilities and outlining a relationship that will allow the required work to be done to the system while minimizing outages.
Quanta's telecommunications operations continue to see pockets of activity spurred by a variety of factors, including regulatory changes, various FTTx initiatives, merger and acquisition activity and a recovering economy. Quanta's telecommunications and broadband cable TV operations generated 17.5% internal revenue growth in the second quarter of 2006. After several challenging years, Quanta is seeing a recovery in these markets as customers begin to increase spending to maintain and build out their networks. In addition to solid top line growth, Quanta continues to focus on maintaining margins and profitability.
The improved financial health and overall optimism throughout the telecommunications industry is driven partly by continued demand for high-bandwidth delivery of dynamic interactive services such as video-on-demand and voice over internet protocol (VoIP). In order to meet this ever-growing demand, service providers and network operators must drive fiber deeper into the network. This is a core service and strength for Quanta.
Quanta's outside plant services made good strides during 2Q06 with a significant portion of its revenues for the telecommunications group coming from FTTx initiatives for Verizon and AT&T, as well as other providers throughout the nation. Verizon recently reported that it added more than 111,000 new FiOS customers in 2Q06, a 47% increase compared to the same period last year. In all, the FiOS FTTP broadband service has been deployed in 16 states, passing a total of 4.5 million homes. Verizon remains on target to pass six million homes by the end of 2006. Most of Quanta's work for Verizon continues to

be in California, Florida, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas and Washington.
AT&T is also continuing to move forward with its project LightSpeed and integrations of new technologies. Last quarter, AT&T launched its new U-Verse service that integrates digital TV, high-speed Internet and voice services. Quanta has expanded its work for AT&T, particularly in the Western states as AT&T's deployment begins to ramp-up.
These FTTx efforts are being supported by recent legislative developments. Texas recently passed new franchise legislation which set a new milestone for telcos and others entering the video market. Such legislation continues to gain momentum with similar legislation being passed or considered in various states. Both South Carolina and Arizona recently passed franchise legislation. Meanwhile, California's bill passed the house, as did the bills in Michigan and Louisiana. Franchise bills in New Jersey, Iowa, Missouri, North Carolina and Tennessee are in various stages of the legislative process.
New federal telecommunications legislation is in process and some industry experts call the new bill the "most important piece of legislation the Congress will take up this session." (Source: ) The legislation went before the Senate Commerce Committee in June and is a rewrite of the oldest existing telecommunications law, the Telecommunications Act of 1934. The franchising element is one piece of the bill, but what is currently getting the most attention is the "Net Neutrality" element of the bill.
The Seattle Times
Under the Net Neutrality aspect of the bill, telecom companies would be able to split Internet access into premium lanes and segregate access to customers based on content, origin and purpose of the data. Net Neutrality was rejected in a Senate vote in June, but there is potential for it to be reincorporated before the bill becomes law. Even without the Net Neutrality element of the law, telecom companies are rapidly encroaching on the cable market and speeding up their deployment of video services.
Activities in Quanta's broadband cable operations are beginning to be positively affected by the response of multiple system operators (MSOs) to the FTTx initiatives of the telecommunication companies. In addition, with the resolution of the Adelphia bankruptcy, Quanta is in discussions with both Comcast and Time Warner concerning specific projects they intend to deploy beginning in the fourth quarter of this year. These network enhancement projects will further strengthen the ability for the MSOs to deploy VoIP service as well as more robust bandwidth capabilities for Internet access and video services. Quanta believes it may begin to see a positive impact from these projects on its operations in 4Q06.

Peer Operation & Valuation Comparison
The specialty contracting industry is highly fragmented and very competitive. Quanta estimates that its annual addressable market is in excess of $30 billion. Quanta believes that the top six specialty contractors (based on revenues) account for less than 15% of this annual market opportunity. Quanta estimates that it commands the largest portion of this estimated 15% share, but that it is less than 5% of the total addressable market. The remaining 85% market share is held by smaller, private specialty contracting companies.
With its diversified service offering and customer base, and national presence, Quanta is unique. Below is a table of Quanta's peers, indicating the various markets each specialty contractor serves. Also included is a peer valuation analysis of a broader peer group that includes several companies in the construction and engineering sector. While Quanta may not compete directly with some of these companies, they are included because they perform construction and engineering services and are often impacted by similar macro and/or other trends as Quanta. Of this peer group, Dycom Industries, MasTec, InfraSource and Pike Electric are Quanta's closest public peers. However, both Dycom and MasTec focus more on the telecommunications and broadband cable television industries, and InfraSource and Pike Electric do not have as large a geographic presence as Quanta does.
