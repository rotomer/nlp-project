Bonds; Conditions Precedent to all Bonds
 
      Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the determination of Surety in its sole and absolute discretion, to issue any Bond will be subject to the further conditions precedent that on the date of such issuance each of the following conditions will be satisfied, in the sole and absolute discretion of Surety:
          (a) The following statements will be true and, by its request for the issuance of such Bond, Indemnitors will be deemed to have certified to Surety that as of the date of such issuance:
                    (1) the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement and the Surety Credit Documents are correct in all material respects on and as of the date of such issuance as though made on and as of such date, except to the extent that such representations and warranties specifically refer to an earlier date, in which case they are true and correct as of such earlier date; and
                    (2) no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, or would result from the issuance of such Bond.

      4. . Quanta Services, Inc. has full right and authority to execute any and all current or future documents and/or amendments on behalf of any Principals and Indemnitors without requiring the separate signature of any such Principal and Indemnitors. Although execution will not be necessary to bind any such Person as an Indemnitor hereunder, at the request of Surety, Indemnitors will cause any such Person to execute this Agreement. Said Domestic Subsidiaries and such other Person will be deemed to be an Indemnitor hereunder as though they were original signatories hereto. Indemnitors agree to indemnify, and keep indemnified, and hold and save harmless Surety against all Surety Loss. The duty of Indemnitors to indemnify Surety is a continuing duty, separate from the duty to exonerate, and survives any payments made in exoneration of Surety. Amounts due Surety (together with interest at the Default Rate) will be payable upon written demand.
Indemnity; Exoneration
 
      Indemnitors recognize and acknowledge the common law right of Surety to be exonerated by Indemnitors. Upon a Surety Loss, in the event Indemnitors fail or refuse to exonerate Surety upon written demand, all Indemnitors agree, upon demand by Surety, to exonerate Surety from Surety Loss, by satisfying Indemnitors' obligations under the Bonded Contracts and obtaining either a withdrawal of all claims against Surety under the Bonds or a general release.
      Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or any other Surety Credit Document (exclusive of any Surety Credit Document executed by any Foreign Subsidiary) to the contrary, no Foreign Subsidiary will be liable under this Agreement for, or obligated to indemnify Surety or hold Surety harmless from or against, any Surety Loss or any other amount except, with respect to a Bond executed or procured by Surety for a specific Foreign Subsidiary in its capacity as a named principal under such Bond, for such amounts described in subsection (a) of the definition of Surety Loss for which such Foreign Subsidiary is expressly obligated pursuant to such Bond. The forgoing will not limit the indemnity obligations of any Foreign Subsidiary as may be agreed to by such Foreign Subsidiary in any agreement entered into by such Foreign Subsidiary.
      5. . To secure payment or other performance of any and all Surety Loss, and the payment and performance of all other obligations and undertakings now or hereafter owing to Surety with respect to the Bonds and/or under the Surety Credit Documents, as same may now or hereafter be modified, replaced, extended, or renewed, Indemnitors hereby grant to Surety a first priority (subject to Permitted Liens) security interest in the Collateral. The security interest created herein will attach without the execution or delivery to Surety of any instruments, documents, assignments, or other agreements of transfer, and in the event any such instruments, documents, or other agreements of transfer are or will be delivered to Surety, the same are and will be in furtherance of and in addition to the security interest created by virtue of this Agreement. As additional security for any and all Surety Loss, Indemnitors have caused to be delivered to Surety and named Surety as the beneficiary of that certain Letter of Credit No. 3064365 dated July 14, 2004, issued by Bank of America in the face amount of Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000).
Security Interest; Obligation Secured
      Except as herein provided otherwise, Indemnitors will at all times keep Surety's security interest properly perfected and hereby designate Surety and any collateral agent that may be designated by Surety pursuant to Section 33 as their attorney in fact to do any acts or deeds or execute such documents reasonably appropriate to accomplish said perfection. Said designation will be irrevocable as long as any obligation of any of Indemnitors to Surety under this Agreement and/or any of the Surety Credit Documents is outstanding. Surety agrees that it will not and will cause its agents not to, process notices of assignment or any other documentation under the Contract Disputes Act, 41 U.S.C. 601, et. seq. and/or the Federal Acquisition Regulations unless an Event of Default has occurred, or the agent for the lenders under the Bank Credit Documents requests Surety to perfect, or any other Person has taken any action to perfect, an assignment or Lien with respect to any Bonded Contracts or other Collateral that is subject to the Contract Disputes Act, 41 U.S.C. 601, et. seq. and/or any Federal Acquisition Regulations.
      The right is expressly granted to Surety, at Surety's reasonable discretion, to file in those jurisdictions where the same is permitted, one or more financing statements under the UCC and indicating therein the types or describing the items of the Collateral. Without the prior written
 
consent of Surety, none of Indemnitors will, after the date hereof, file or authorize or permit to be filed in any jurisdiction any financing or like statement relating to the Collateral other than filings of or relating to Permitted Liens. Surety's security interest will be first and prior to any other Liens on the Collateral except for Permitted Liens. Surety reserves all rights to contest the validity or priority of any Lien.
      If any Accounts constituting Collateral should be evidenced by promissory notes, trade acceptances, or other instruments for the payment of money, Indemnitors promptly will deliver the same to Surety appropriately endorsed to the order of Surety. Regardless of the form of each endorsement, Indemnitors hereby waive presentment, demand, notice of dishonor, protest, and notice of protest, and all other notices with respect thereto, except as required by this Agreement.
      At any time, and at reasonable intervals, upon the request of Surety and subject to the Permitted Liens, Indemnitors will: (a) give, execute, deliver, file, and/or record any notice, statement, instrument, document, agreement, or other papers that may be necessary or desirable, or that Surety and/or any collateral agent designated by it pursuant to Section 33 may reasonably request in order to create, preserve, perfect, or validate any security interest granted herein or to enable Surety and/or such collateral agent to exercise and enforce its rights hereunder or with respect to such security interest; and (b) permit Surety or Surety's representatives, upon advance written notice and, at reasonable intervals during normal business hours, to inspect and make abstracts from any of Indemnitors' books and records pertaining to the Collateral.
      Upon the Indebtedness being paid and satisfied in full (including, but not limited to, the expiration of any time period for which any latent defect or warrant claim could be made), Surety will, with reasonable promptness, execute all necessary documents and file same in every jurisdiction in which the security agreement or any Surety Credit Document was filed to effectuate a termination of said security agreement and all Liens evidenced thereby.
      6. . Collateral includes all amounts that may be owing from time to time by Surety to any Indemnitor in any capacity, including, but without limitation, any balance or share belonging to any Indemnitor of any deposit or other account with Surety (this Lien and security interest will be independent of any right of setoff which Surety may have); all rights of any Principal to any distribution, right to distribution, or other similar interest in connection with or on account of any Bond signed by Surety on behalf of any Joint Venture; all of any Principal or Indemnitor's right, title, and interest in and to all Bonded Contracts; Accounts; all rights of any Principal that is a Joint Venture to any distributions from any Person that is a party to or has an interest in any Bonded Contract with respect to such Bonded Contract (whether such Principal is the named Principal in such Bonded Contract); all claims, rights, and chooses in action against any Obligee on any Bond or against any other Person in either case on account of any Bond or Bonded Contract; Bonded Contract Balances; to the extent assignable (provided, that, any such prohibition on assignment would not be rendered ineffective pursuant to Article 9 of the UCC, including, without limitation Section 9-406 and 9-408 of the UCC, or any successor provisions and further, provided, that, any such prohibition on assignment has not otherwise been rendered ineffective, lapsed, or terminated) all rights and actions that any Indemnitor may have or acquire in any subcontract, purchase order, or other agreement in connection with any Bonded Contract, and against any subcontract, purchase

      Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, (i) the Collateral is not intended to and does not include any Licensed Property or any property or assets of any nature of any Foreign Subsidiary (except solely to the extent that a Foreign Subsidiary executes and delivers an agreement for the benefit of Surety designating any specified property or assets of such Foreign Subsidiary as Collateral hereunder), (ii) Indemnitors will remain liable under any contracts and agreements included in the Collateral, solely to the extent set forth therein, to perform all of their duties and obligations thereunder to the same extent as if this Agreement had not been executed, (iii) the exercise by Surety of any of the rights hereunder will not release any Indemnitor from any of its duties or obligations under the contracts and agreements included in the Collateral, and (iv) Surety will not have any obligation or liability under any contracts and agreements included in the Collateral by reason of this Agreement, nor will Surety be obligated to perform any of the obligations or duties of Indemnitor thereunder or take any action to collect or enforce any claim for payment assigned hereunder.

Indemnitors will deliver to Surety copies of certificates of insurance dated on or about the date of this Agreement showing Surety as an additional insured for all such insurance policies which Surety has specifically requested that it be added as an additional insured, except as to professional liability coverages.
          (l) As of the date hereof, Principals, Indemnitors, and their Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, are not insolvent within the meaning of the Bankruptcy Code.
          (m) Principal or Indemnitors will give prompt notice to Surety of their knowledge of any pending or threatened proceeding or claim before any court or governmental agency or department which involves a reasonable material risk of having a Material Adverse Effect.
          (n) Indemnitors are in material compliance with all laws, statutes and governmental rules and regulations applicable to it or them, except for any failure so to be in compliance which would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
          (o) Indemnitors will not make any distributions or payments of any kind to any Affiliate that is not an Indemnitor at any time that any Surety Loss (exclusive of Surety Loss described in clause (b) of the definition of Surety Loss and other attorneys fees and similar fees and professional fees incurred in the ordinary course of business that are promptly reimbursed to Surety by Indemnitors) exists.
      8. . Subject to the terms of any applicable intercreditor agreement, following the occurrence of an Event of Default, if Surety decides, in its sole and absolute discretion, to perform and complete, or to cause or procure the performance or completion of any the Bonded Contracts, Indemnitors hereby agree that Surety, or any properly licensed third party appointed by Surety, will have full access to and use of all Identified Equipment, reasonably necessary for the discharge of the duties, obligations, and undertakings of Surety under the Bonds issued in relation to the Bonded Contracts. Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, in the event Principal or Indemnitors want to encumber such Identified Equipment, Surety agrees to permit such encumbrance provided that the appropriate lender or other Person enters into an Identified Equipment utilization agreement in favor of Surety providing for Surety's use of the Identified Equipment as provided in this Section.
Use of Identified Equipment
      Upon a determination by Surety to utilize, or reserve for utilization, any Identified Equipment in which any lender holds a first priority security interest, Surety will periodically
 
(and in any event no less frequently than monthly), pay such lender the fair market rental value of the Identified Equipment for the period said Identified Equipment is utilized, or reserved for utilization, by Surety or its appointee, in consideration of the utilization or reservation of Identified Equipment necessary to fulfill the Bonded Contracts.
      In the event Surety and lender cannot agree on the above referenced "fair market rental value," then subject to the terms of any applicable intercreditor agreement, Surety will be entitled to utilize the Identified Equipment during the period that the parties are endeavoring to resolve their dispute and come to an agreement regarding the "fair market rental value." All disputes regarding the "fair market rental value" will be determined by appraisal. Surety and any such lender will endeavor to agree on the selection of an appraiser of national recognition to determine such "fair market rental value." In the event such lender and Surety cannot agree on an appraiser, then each of Surety and such lender will select an appraiser to determine said "fair market rental value" and the average of the values so determined by these appraisers will be the "fair market rental value." The appraiser's determination will be deemed final and conclusive. The cost of the appraisers will be borne by Indemnitors.
      During any period in which Surety is utilizing, or reserving for utilization any Identified Equipment, Surety will preserve and maintain said Identified Equipment in good repair, and will return said Identified Equipment in as good a condition as when received by Surety, ordinary wear and tear excepted. In addition, Surety will maintain insurance coverage relative to the Identified Equipment during any period in which Surety is utilizing, or reserving for utilization, Identified Equipment. Any and all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by Surety in exercising its rights pursuant to this Section 8 will be borne by Indemnitors.
      Surety agrees that in the event any of the Identified Equipment utilized, or reserved for utilization, by Surety is also needed to be used in connection with the completion and performance of contracts other than Bonded Contracts, Surety will work with Principal to allow Principal and its Affiliates reasonable access to and use of such Identified Equipment; provided, however, in this event, any consideration paid by Surety for the use of such Identified Equipment will be prorated and reduced for the time that such Identified Equipment is utilized or reserved for utilization on any contract other than a Bonded Contract.
      9. . Principal and Indemnitors will use reasonable efforts to preserve the Collateral and defend the title and Surety's security interest therein, at Principal and Indemnitors' cost and expense. Each Principal's principal place of business and chief executive office as of the date of this Agreement is correctly reflected on . The principal place of business and chief executive office of Quanta Services, Inc. is correctly reflected on . As of the date of this Agreement, the Records of Quanta Services, Inc. related to the Bonded Contracts and the Records of each Principal related to the Collateral are located at locations specified on . Indemnitors agree to give Surety immediate prior written notification of the establishment of any new chief executive office or principal place of business of any Principal and the discontinuance of any chief executive office or principal place of business.
Preservation of the Collateral
Exhibit A
Exhibit A
Exhibit A
 
      Indemnitors will give prompt written notice to Surety of the institution of any suit or proceeding involving any of Indemnitors that might reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. Indemnitors will pay and discharge promptly all taxes, assessments, and governmental charges or levies imposed upon the Collateral, as well as all judgment liens and all claims for labor and materials which, if unpaid, might constitute a Lien or charge upon the Collateral, unless and only to the extent that the same will currently be duly contested in good faith (and for which adequate reserves have been established) by appropriate proceedings and as to which foreclosure and other enforcement proceedings will not have been commenced (unless fully bonded or otherwise effectively stayed).
      Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, at its option, Surety may discharge valid taxes, Liens, security interests, or other encumbrances at any time levied or placed on said Collateral. Indemnitors agree to reimburse Surety, on demand, for any such payment made, or any such expense reasonably incurred by Surety pursuant to the foregoing authorization. Any amounts so advanced, paid or expended will be included within the defined term "the Indebtedness," and will bear interest from the time advanced, paid, or expended at the Default Rate and be secured by the Collateral and its payment enforced as if it were part of the original Indebtedness. Any sum expended, paid, or advanced under this paragraph will be at Surety's sole option and not constitute a waiver of any default or right arising from the breach by Indemnitors of any covenant or agreement contained in the Surety Credit Documents.
      10. . Indemnitors agree and expressly declare that all funds due or to become due under the Bonded Contracts are trust funds, whether in possession of Indemnitors or another, for the benefit and the payment of all Persons to whom Indemnitors incur obligations in the performance of the Bonded Contracts, for which Surety is or may be liable under the Bonds. If Surety discharges any such obligations, with or without a claim asserted against Surety under the Bonds, it will be entitled to assert the right of such Person to the trust fund. All payments received for or on account of any Bonded Contract will be deemed to be held in a trust fund to assure the payment of obligations incurred or to be incurred in the performance of any Bonded Contract and for labor, materials, and services furnished in the prosecution of the performance required by any Bonded Contract or any extension or modification thereof. All monies due and to become due under any Bonded Contract are also trust funds, whether in the possession of Indemnitors, or otherwise. Such trust funds will be for the benefit and payment of all obligations for which Surety is or may be liable under any Bonds. Such trust funds will inure to the benefit of Surety for any liability or Surety Loss it may have or sustain under any Bond, and this Agreement and declaration constitute notice of such trust. The trust funds, unless otherwise restricted or regulated by state or local laws, can be commingled with other funds, but the trust fund nature and purpose as stated in this paragraph will not be modified nor waived by this commingling provision.
Indemnitors to Hold Contract Funds in Trust
      Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, Indemnitors will, upon demand of Surety, open an account(s) with a bank or similar depository designated by Indemnitors and approved by Surety, which account(s) will be designated as trust account(s) for the deposit of such trust funds, and will deposit therein all monies paid or to be paid under the Bonded Contracts. Once any funds due under a Bonded Contract are converted to cash or trust funds are co-mingled with other funds,
 
Surety will not have any "look back" or other rights with respect to any such trust funds in such cash or co-mingled funds. Withdrawals from such account(s) will be by check or similar instruments signed by a representative of Surety and, at Surety's option, countersigned by Indemnitors. Said trust(s) will terminate on the payment by Indemnitors of all the contractual obligations for the payment of which the trust(s) is created. The foregoing provisions of this Section 10 are subject to the terms of any applicable intercreditor agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or any other Surety Credit Document to the contrary, Surety acknowledges and agrees that absent the occurrence of an Event of Default, Principal's and Indemnitors' cash management system or use of funds will not be affected or changed in any respect by the terms of this Agreement or any other Surety Credit Document and Principals and Indemnitors and their Subsidiaries are not required by this Agreement or any other Surety Credit Document (exclusive of the Bonds and Bonded Contracts) to segregate funds or take any other action of any nature in order to comply with this Section 10.
      11. . Indemnitors agree to pay all premiums on the Bonds, computed in accordance with the regular manual of rates in effect on the date the Bond(s) are executed. The failure of any Indemnitor to pay the bond premiums or the failure of Surety to receive premiums will not provide Indemnitors with any defense to an action under this Agreement. Indemnitors also agree to pay all premiums due Surety on any insurance policy(ies) issued by Surety for the benefit of any Indemnitor.
Premium Payment
      12. . None of Principal or Indemnitors has used any trade name (other than its legal name) or previous names within the one (1) year period prior to the date of this Agreement other than those set forth on , except for any such names that are not material to its business or operations. Each of Principal and Indemnitors is a corporation or other legal entity duly organized, validly existing, and in good standing under the laws of the state and/or other jurisdiction as indicated in . Each of Principal and Indemnitors has the corporate or other power to own its properties and to engage in the business it conducts, and is duly qualified and in good standing as a foreign corporation or other entity in the jurisdictions wherein the nature of the business transacted by it or property owned by it makes such qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Each of Principal and Indemnitors will maintain their formal existence (in good standing where appropriate under state or other governing law) and remain or become duly qualified (and in good standing where appropriate under state or other governing law) as a foreign entity in each jurisdiction in which the conduct of their respective businesses requires such qualification or license except where the failure to be so qualified would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Principal and Indemnitors will use reasonable efforts to furnish Surety with any financial information related to Indemnitors or the Collateral in the form and at the time reasonably appropriate and as reasonably requested by Surety and as set out in Section 5 of this Agreement.
Corporate Identity and Existence
Exhibit A
Exhibit A
      13. . Indemnitors will: (a) provide Surety with copies of yearly audited consolidated financial statements as soon as reasonably practicable upon completion and in no event later than one hundred twenty (120) days after the end of the period under audit; and (b) furnish Surety with true copies of unaudited quarterly consolidated financial statements for Indemnitors as soon as reasonably practicable and in no event
Accounts; Financial Reporting; Books and Records
 
later than sixty (60) days after the end of the applicable quarterly period; (c) provide Surety with copies of any and all financial records or similar financial disclosures that Indemnitors provide to any lender under the terms set out in any credit facility entered into or to be entered into by any Indemnitors; and (d) such other financial information in a form as Surety will reasonably require upon completion and in no event later than sixty (60) days after the period under review; provided, however, that providing Surety with a copy of the filing of such financial statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission (which may be provided via e-mail to an e-mail address specified by Surety) will be deemed to constitute satisfaction of the foregoing items (a) and (b). These financial statements will be prepared in conformity with GAAP, subject to normal year-end audit adjustments and the absence of footnotes as applicable, and in each instance will present fairly and accurately the financial condition of Indemnitors, as applicable, as of the dates of the statements and the results of their operations for the periods then ended. Indemnitors agree to immediately notify Surety of the occurrence of any material change in their financial condition that would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Indemnitors represent that their books and records will be kept accurately and in a timely manner and in accordance with good business practices.
      Indemnitors at all times will use reasonable efforts to keep accurate and complete Records of Indemnitors' Accounts and Bonded Contracts, and make those Records available for review, upon a reasonable and appropriate request by Surety. Surety will have the right at all times during regular business hours to free access to the papers of each Indemnitor including, without limitation, its books, records, accounts, computer software, and other computer stored information, licenses, copyrights, patents, and other intellectual property, for the purpose of examining, copying, or reproducing the same. Each Indemnitor authorizes and requests any and all depositories in which funds of any Indemnitor may be deposited to furnish to Surety statements of account and any other documents reflecting receipts and disbursements and any Person doing business with Indemnitors is authorized to furnish any information requested by Surety concerning any transaction. Surety may furnish copies of any and all statements, agreements, and financial statements and any information which it now has or may obtain concerning each of the Indemnitors to other Persons or companies for the purpose of procuring co-suretyship or reinsurance, or during the investigation of claims that may be, or have been, asserted against Surety.
      14. . None of Indemnitors intends to file any proceeding in bankruptcy, or for reorganization, or for readjustment of their debts under the Bankruptcy Code. Indemnitors acknowledge that any such filing would be a fundamental change in circumstances. The representations and warranties of Indemnitors contained in this Agreement are true and correct and complete on and as of the date of this Agreement.
Representations; Duty to Notify Surety
      Indemnitors hereby undertake the duty to notify Surety promptly of: (i) any material change in the terms or provisions of any of the Bonded Contracts that would materially and adversely affect Surety; and (ii) any material change in any representation made in this Agreement or in any other Surety Credit Document that would materially and adversely affect Surety. Indemnitors acknowledge hereby that Surety has and will continue to rely upon such information in undertaking its obligations to third parties under said Bonds. Indemnitors will promptly notify Surety promptly if any of them becomes aware of the occurrence of any Event of Default or of any fact, condition, or event that only with the giving of notice or passage of time or both, would become
 
an Event of Default, or of the failure of Indemnitors to observe in any material respect any of their respective undertakings hereunder and under any of the Surety Credit Documents.
      15. . In the event: (a) any of Indemnitors file for relief under the Bankruptcy Code; and (b) Surety determines that it is necessary or desirable that bankruptcy court approval be obtained with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereunder, subject to compliance with law and any applicable orders of the bankruptcy court, trustee, receiver or equivalent Person, then Indemnitors will use their respective best reasonable commercial efforts to obtain a court order which, among other things, (i) determines that this Agreement (and any other Surety Credit Documents entered into by Indemnitors with Surety) was proposed by Surety in good faith and should be assumed within the meaning of Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code; and (ii) determines that Surety is a creditor who gave "new value" and entered into a "contemporaneous exchange for value" with Indemnitors as contemplated by the Bankruptcy Code, including, but not limited to, Sections 547(a)(2) and 547(c) of the Bankruptcy Code, when entering into this Agreement (and any other documents entered into by any of Indemnitors with Surety).
Bankruptcy Court Approval
      In such event, and at the request of Surety, Indemnitors, as applicable, will promptly make any filings, take all actions, and use their respective best efforts to obtain any and all other approvals and orders necessary or appropriate for consummation of the transactions contemplated in this Agreement, subject to their obligations to comply with any order of any bankruptcy court.
      In the event an appeal is taken, or a stay pending appeal is requested, from any order entered in any bankruptcy proceeding, Indemnitors, as applicable, will immediately notify Surety of such appeal or stay request and will provide to Surety within one business day a copy of the related notice of appeal or order of stay. Any of Indemnitors, as applicable, will also provide Surety with written notice of any motion or application filed in connection with any appeal from either of such orders.
      Indemnitors will cooperate in providing such information and evidence as is necessary to obtain the orders described in this Section 15.
      16. [Intentionally Omitted]
      17. . Nothing herein will be deemed to be a consent by Surety that Indemnitors use any "cash collateral," within the meaning of Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code, including without limitation proceeds from Bonded Contracts and the Collateral.
Use of Cash Collateral
      18. [Intentionally Omitted]
      19. [Intentionally Omitted]
      20. . Indemnitors will notify Surety promptly if any of them becomes aware of the occurrence of any Event of Default or of any fact, condition, or event that only with the giving of notice or passage of time or both, could become an Event of Default, or of the failure of Indemnitors in any material respect to observe any of their respective
One General Obligation  Default
 
undertakings hereunder or under any of the Surety Credit Documents. It is distinctly understood and agreed that all of the rights of Surety contained in this Agreement will likewise apply insofar as applicable to any modification of or supplement to this Agreement and to any other of the Surety Credit Documents. Any default under the terms of this Agreement or any of the Surety Credit Documents will constitute, likewise, a default by Indemnitors of every existing agreement with Surety, and any default by Indemnitors of any other agreement with Surety will constitute a default of this Agreement.
      21. . In the event of legal proceedings against Surety, the subject matter of which pertains to this Agreement, the Bonds, or any of the Bonded Contracts, Surety may apply for a court order making any or all of Indemnitors party defendants, and each such Indemnitor consents to the granting of such application, including consent to the jurisdiction of the court in which the application is made, and agrees to become such a party defendant or third-party defendant and to allow judgment, in the event of judgment against Surety, to be rendered also against each such Indemnitor, jointly and severally, in like amount and in favor of Surety. The foregoing will not adversely affect the joint and several liability of each Indemnitor to Surety for any and all Surety Loss, including, but not limited to, any Surety Loss incurred in connection with any litigation in which such Indemnitor is not named a third-party defendant.
Indemnitors Agree to Become Party Defendants
      22. . Except as set forth in Section 33, upon any execution, continuation, modification, renewal, enlargement, or amendment of any Bond pursuant to the terms hereof or thereof, Indemnitors waive notice of the execution, continuation, modification, renewal, enlargement, or amendment of any Bond and of any fact, act, or information concerning or affecting the rights or liabilities of Surety or Indemnitors including, but not limited to, any acts giving rise to any Surety Loss under the Bonds. Indemnitors hereby consent and agree that Surety may at any time, and from time to time, without notice to or further consent from Indemnitors, either with or without consideration, (i) surrender any property or other security of any kind or nature whatsoever held by it or by any Person on its behalf or for its account, securing any Surety; (ii) substitute for any collateral so held by it or other collateral of like kind, or of any kind; (iii) modify the terms of any Bonds, renewals of any UCC Financing Statements listing any of Indemnitors as debtor and Surety as secured party, or any intercreditor agreement by and between Surety and any banking institution party to a credit agreement or facility with any Indemnitor relating to such credit agreement or facility, in each case in any manner that is not in violation of the terms of this Agreement; (iv) grant releases, compromises, and indulgences with respect to any of the Surety Credit Documents to any Person now or hereafter liable thereunder or hereunder; or (v) take or fail to take any action of any type whatsoever that is not in violation of the terms of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in the above clause (iii) will limit Surety's ability to modify the terms of any of the Surety Credit Documents (other than this Agreement) at any time (whether an Event of Default has occurred or is continuing) to the extent necessary to keep Surety's security interest in the Collateral properly perfected pursuant to Section 5. No such action which Surety will take or fail to take in connection with the Surety Credit Documents, or any one of them, or any security for the payment of Surety or for the performance of any obligations or undertakings of Indemnitors, nor any course of dealing with Indemnitors, Surety, or any other Person, will release Indemnitors' obligations hereunder, affect this Agreement in any way, or afford Indemnitors any recourse against Surety.
Indemnitors' Waiver of Notice; Rights of Surety
 
      23. . Each of Indemnitors warrants that it is specifically and beneficially interested in obtaining future Bonds or the renewal of any existing Bonds. Indemnitors acknowledge that the execution of this Agreement and the undertaking of indemnity was not made upon any representation by Surety concerning the responsibility of any of Indemnitors or concerning the competence of Indemnitors to perform. Indemnitors agree to make no claim against Surety for any oral representations, promises, or statements made to any of them by Surety or any of its agents or brokers, or for the failure of Surety to disclose facts or information to Indemnitors. This Agreement has been negotiated by the parties and each party has had the benefit of counsel.
Indemnitors' Knowing Consent to Agreement
      24. . Surety, and only Surety, may assign or transfer, in whole or in part, the Indebtedness and all or part of Surety's interest in the Collateral. The transferees will have the same rights and powers with reference to the Collateral as are hereby given to Surety, and upon such transfer, to the extent Surety has assigned its obligations with respect to such Collateral to such transferee, Surety will be fully discharged from all claims with respect to any Collateral so transferred, but will retain all rights and powers hereby given with respect to any of the Collateral not so transferred. Indemnitors may not assign or otherwise transfer their rights and duties under this Agreement without Surety's written approval. In any event, the covenants, representations, warranties, and agreements of Indemnitors set forth herein will be binding upon Indemnitors, their successors and assigns.
Assignment
      25. . Indemnitors agree upon the request of Surety, to sign, execute, file, and/or deliver to Surety all documents, reports, papers, pleadings, and/or instruments reasonably required to obtain and/or confirm any of Surety's rights under this Agreement or the Surety Credit Documents. During the term of this Agreement, Indemnitors will furnish to Surety upon its reasonable written request and reasonable prior notice a statement of all deposits by source and amount of all withdrawals by payee for each project that is bonded by Surety.
Indemnitors' Duty to Deliver and Execute Papers and Other Instruments
      26. . Quanta Services, Inc. will provide Surety on an annual basis (and at such other intervals as Surety may reasonably require with reasonable prior written notice) with a letter in which its Chief Financial Officer, or equivalent officer, represents that he/she has no knowledge of the existence of any condition, event, or act which constitutes, or which with notice or the lapse of time, or both, would reasonably be expected to constitute an Event of Default. If Surety feels that any such letter is overdue or has not been timely provided, Surety may give written notice of same to Indemnitors, and Quanta Services, Inc. agrees to provide such letter within thirty (30) days of the date of such notice. Failure of Indemnitors to timely provide any such letter (after such thirty (30) day cure period) or the presence of any materially incorrect statement on such letter will constitute an Event of Default on the part of Indemnitors after an additional fifteen (15) day written notice from Surety unless such a letter is provided or otherwise secured within such fifteen (15) day period. The Chief Financial Officer (or equivalent officer) who submits such letter will have no personal liability or responsibility of any nature to Surety, including, but not limited to, with respect to the contents of such letter or the failure of Indemnitors to timely provide such letter.
Indemnitors' Representation
 
      27. . Indemnitor agrees to first use any Bonded Contract Balances generated by Bonded Contracts to pay valid labor, materials, and any other costs or expenses incurred when due in connection with the performance of the Bonded Contracts; provided, that, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or any other Surety Credit Document to the contrary, Surety acknowledges and agrees that absent the occurrence of an Event of Default, Principal's and Indemnitors' cash management system or use of funds will not be affected or changed in any respect by the terms of this Agreement or any other Surety Credit Documents and Principals and Indemnitors and their Subsidiaries are not required under the terms of this Agreement or any other Surety Credit Document (exclusive of the Bonds and Bonded Contracts) to segregate funds or take any other action of any nature in order to comply with this Section 27.
Payment of Labor, Material, and Other Costs
      28. . Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default, in addition to other remedies provided herein, Surety is authorized and empowered, but is not obligated to take possession of the Work under any Bonded Contract and at the expense of Indemnitor to complete or to contract for the completion of the same, or to consent to the reletting of the completion thereof, or to take such other steps as in the discretion of Surety may be advisable or necessary to obtain its release or to avoid Surety Loss.
Rights of Surety to Take Possession of the Work
      29. . Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default, in addition to other remedies provided therein, Surety is authorized and empowered, but is not obligated to take over performance of the Work under any Bonded Contracts and at the expense of Indemnitors to complete or to contract for the completion of the same, or to consent to the reletting of the completion thereof, or to take such other steps as in the discretion of Surety may be advisable or necessary to obtain its release or to avoid Surety Loss.
Rights of Surety to Perform Under the Bonded Contracts
      30. . Surety will have the exclusive right for itself and for Indemnitors to decide and determine in good faith and in a reasonable manner whether any claim, demand, suit, or judgment on the Bonds will be paid, settled, defended, or appealed. Any payment or determination made by Surety that: (1) Surety was or might be liable therefor; and (2) such payments were necessary or advisable to protect any of Surety's rights or to avoid or lessen Surety's liability or alleged liability will be final, conclusive, and binding upon Indemnitors; and any Surety Loss which may be sustained or incurred will be paid by Indemnitors upon written demand by Surety. In the event of any payment, settlement, compromise, or investigation, an itemized statement of Surety Loss sworn to by an officer or authorized representative of Surety or vouchers or other evidence of such Surety Loss will be prima facie evidence of the fact and extent of the liability of Indemnitors to Surety in any claim or suit and in any and all matters arising between and among Indemnitors and Surety. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, Surety will have the additional rights set out in Section 33.
Right of Surety to Settle Claims
      31. . In addition to the other remedies provided herein, at the request of any Indemnitor, Surety is authorized and empowered, but is not obligated to advance or loan money or guarantee loans to any Indemnitors as Surety may see fit for the purpose of completing performance of any of the Bonded Contracts, or for the purpose of meeting operational expenses or paying other obligations, bonded or unbonded. Such funds may be advanced or guaranteed at any time, whether before or after default of such
Authority of Surety to Make Loans to Indemnitors
 
Indemnitor under the Bonded Contracts. Upon demand by Surety, Indemnitors will be responsible to reimburse Surety for all funds advanced, loaned, or guaranteed by Surety to any Indemnitor and all Surety Loss incurred by Surety in relation thereto, notwithstanding the failure of such Indemnitor to so use those funds. Indemnitors waive all notice of such advance, loan, or guarantee, and acknowledge that whether to make any such advances, loans, or guarantees will be made in the sole and absolute discretion of Surety.
      32. . Surety will have the right, and is hereby authorized and empowered, but not required: (a) to increase or decrease the penalty or penalties of any Bonds, to change Obligees therein, to execute any continuation, enlargements, modifications, and renewals thereof or substitute therefor with the same or different conditions, provisions or Obligees, and with the same, larger, or smaller penalties, it being agreed that this Agreement will apply to and cover such new or changed Bonds or renewals even though the consent of Surety may or does substantially increase the liability of the Indemnitors; or (b) to take such steps as it may deem necessary or proper to obtain release from liability under the Bonds; or (c) to assent to any changes in any Bonded Contract, including but not limited to, any change in the time for completion of any Bonded Contract and to payments or advances thereunder; or (d) to assent to or take any assignments of any Bonded Contract. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any other Surety Credit Document, prior to an occurrence of an Event of Default, except as may be required by the provisions of any Bond, Bonded Contract, or applicable statute, Surety may not amend or otherwise modify any provision of any Bond except upon the request of a Principal or Indemnitor.
Authority of Surety to Amend Bond
      During the continuance of any Event of Default, Indemnitors agree that they have no right to, and will not, challenge the manner in which Surety handles any claim under any Bond, including, but not limited to, any decision by Surety whether to litigate, settle, or pay any claim (or any settlement or resolution with any Obligee as to any Bonded Contract Balances) and/or assert any defenses, set offs, back charges, etc. with respect to any claim; any such determination with respect to any claim will be made by Surety in its sole and absolute discretion.
      33. . In addition to the rights and remedies granted to it in this Agreement and in any other instrument or agreement securing, evidencing, or relating to any of the Indebtedness, Surety will have all the rights and remedies of a Surety under the UCC.
Rights and Remedies on Default
      In the event of the refusal or failure of Indemnitors to exonerate Surety as required under the Indemnity Agreement, Indemnitors agree upon written demand to provide to Surety a reasonable amount of money designated by Surety and/or other collateral decided upon by Surety. Such funds and/or other collateral will be held by Surety as collateral in addition to the indemnity and other collateral afforded by this Agreement, with the right to use such funds and/or other collateral or any part thereof, at any time in performance, payment, or compromise of any obligations or liability, claims, demands, judgments, damages, fees, and disbursements or other expenses due from Indemnitors. Said deposit and/or provision of money and/or other collateral designated by Surety will be required regardless of whether any Reserve has been established by Surety. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event Surety posts a Reserve, then Indemnitors will deliver to Surety cash in an amount equal to the Reserve posted in addition to the Collateral.
 
Demand will be sufficient if sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, to Indemnitors at the address or addresses given herein or last known to Surety, whether or not actually received. Indemnitors acknowledge that the failure of Indemnitors to deposit with Surety, within five (5) days of such demand, the sum demanded by Surety as collateral security (or, with respect to a Reserve, within ten (10) days of such demand, the amount of such Reserve in accordance with clause (e) of the definition of Event of Default) will cause irreparable harm to Surety for which Surety has no adequate remedy at law. Indemnitors agree that Surety will be entitled to injunctive relief for specific performance of the obligations of Indemnitors to deposit with Surety the sum demanded as collateral security and hereby waive any claims or defenses to the contrary. The deposit of collateral pursuant to this Section 33 will not be deemed to cure any default under the Bonded Contract(s) and Surety may, in its sole and absolute discretion, refuse to issue any bonds; provided, however, the foregoing will not be deemed to alter any provisions under the definition of Event of Default that permit an Event of Default of the type described in clause (e) of the definition of Event of Default to be cured upon the deposit of cash collateral.
      Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default, Surety is entitled to require Indemnitors to deposit or cause to be deposited, all checks, drafts, cash, and other remittances received in payment upon any or all of the Bonded Contracts or other Collateral in a special "lockbox" bank account at a financial institution designated by Surety, over which account Surety alone has power of withdrawal. If an Event of Default has occurred, or the agent for the lenders under the Bank Credit Documents requests Surety to perfect, or any other Person has taken any action to perfect, an assignment or Lien with respect to any Bonded Contracts or other Collateral that is subject to the Contract Disputes Act, 41 U.S.C. 601, et. seq. and/or any Federal Acquisition Regulations, Surety will have the right to designate a collateral agent with respect to any such Bonded Contracts and other Collateral that is subject to the Contract Disputes Act, 41 U.S.C. 601, et. seq. and/or any Federal Acquisition Regulations, and said collateral agent will have the right and authority to process notices of assignment and other documentation necessary under the Contract Disputes Act, 41 U.S.C. 601, et. seq. to perfect the security interest in such Bonded Contracts and other items of Collateral. During the continuance of any Event of Default, Surety and any collateral agent may further instruct any Obligee on any Bond, on behalf of Indemnitors and/or Surety, to pay said remittances directly to Surety. The funds in said special bank account will be held by Surety and/or any such collateral agent as security for all Indebtedness. Said proceeds will be deposited in precisely the form received, except for the endorsement of Indemnitors where necessary to permit collection, which endorsement Indemnitors agree to make and which Surety and/or any such collateral agent is hereby irrevocably authorized to make on Indemnitors' behalf. Pending such deposit, Indemnitors agree that they will not commingle any such checks, drafts, cash, and other remittances with any of Indemnitors' funds or property, but will hold them separate and apart therefrom and upon an express trust for Surety until deposit thereof is made in the said special bank account. Surety will apply, as Surety deems appropriate, any and all of the collected funds on deposit in the said special bank account against the Indebtedness, the order and method of such application to be in the discretion of Surety. Indemnitors agree to execute any documents and perform any acts necessary to assure that remittances described in this paragraph are received by Surety and/or any collateral agent as contemplated herein, including, but not limited to, letters of direction to remit said funds to Surety and/or any collateral agent as contemplated herein.
 
      Upon an occurrence of an Event of Default, Surety is entitled to immediate possession of the Collateral and may dispose of all or any portion of the Collateral pursuant to the provisions of Article 9 of the UCC and may exercise from time to time any other rights and remedies available to it under applicable law, and Surety may require Indemnitors to assemble the Collateral and make it available to Surety at a place to then be designated by Surety, which is reasonably convenient to both parties.
      Indemnitors hereby waive any right they may have under any constitution, statute, or rule of law to notice and/or a hearing prior to seizure of the Collateral following an occurrence of an Event of Default. Surety will have no custodial or ministerial duties to perform with regard to the Collateral except for its safekeeping; and by way of explanation and not by way of limitation thereof, Surety will incur no liability for any diminution in the value of the Collateral unless caused by its willful misconduct; or its failure to notify any party hereto that the Collateral should be so presented or surrendered.
      34. . Surety will have every right and remedy which a personal surety without compensation would have, including the right to secure its discharge from the suretyship, and notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the parties agree that with respect to all funds due or to become due under the Bonded Contracts nothing herein will waive, impair, or limit any right, power, or remedy of Surety under the Indemnity Agreement, or at law or in equity, including, without limitation, Surety's right of equitable subrogation, which right the parties hereby expressly recognize. No failure on the part of Surety to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, power, or remedy hereunder will operate as a waiver thereof, nor will any single or partial exercise of any such right, power or remedy by Surety, preclude any other or further exercise thereof, or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy. All remedies hereunder are cumulative and are not exclusive of any other remedies provided by law.
Preservation of Surety's Rights
      35. . Each right, remedy, and power of Surety provided in this Agreement, the Surety Credit Documents, or by law, equity, or statute will be cumulative, and the exercise by Surety of any right, remedy, or power will not preclude Surety's simultaneous or subsequent exercise of any or all other rights, powers, or remedies. The failure or delay by Surety to exercise any right, power, or remedy will not waive any right, power, or remedy. Except as required herein, no notice or demand upon Surety by any Indemnitor will limit or impair Surety's right to take any action under this Agreement or to exercise any right, power, or remedy.
Authority of Surety to Elect Remedies
      36. . Failure to execute, or defective execution, by any party will not affect the validity of this Agreement as to any other party executing the same and each other party will remain fully bound and liable hereunder. Executions of any application or submission for any Bond by any Indemnitor will not abrogate, waive, or diminish any rights of Surety under this Agreement.
Validity of Agreement
      37. . Surety will not be deemed to have waived any of Surety's rights hereunder or under any other agreement, instrument, or paper signed by any Indemnitor unless such waiver be in writing and signed by Surety. No delay or omission by Surety in exercising
Waiver
 
any right will operate as a waiver of such right or any other right. A waiver on any one occasion will not be construed as a bar to or waiver of any right or remedy on future occasions.
      38. . It is mutually agreed that any and all notices, demands, or other communications herein provided for must be given in writing and will be deemed given (a) if delivered in person, when so delivered, (b) if duly deposited in the United States Mails, postage prepaid for certified mail, return receipt requested, three (3) business days after so mailing, or (c) if delivered prepaid to a nationally recognized overnight carrier and marked for next business day delivery, one (1) business day being so delivered, in each case after being properly addressed to the party to whom given at the address of such party shown below in this Agreement, provided however, that any party may specify any other address in the United States by giving at least ten (10) days written notice thereof to each other party.
Notices
      39. . The failure of Surety, Indemnitors, or any other party to execute documents referenced in this Agreement as being "anticipated to be executed," "anticipate entering into," "to be executed," or words of similar effect, will not affect the validity and enforceability of this Agreement by and among the parties hereto. This Agreement will be effective from the date of its execution until terminated in writing by the parties hereto regardless of whether any other document is entered into or executed by any Person.
Failure to Execute Additional Documents  No Effect
 
      40. . This Agreement will be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of New York (without giving effect to its conflict of laws principles). The parties hereto irrevocably consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States District Court or to the extent not available because the jurisdictional pre-requisites are not met, the Supreme Court of the State of New York, in each instance located in New York County, New York, New York for the purpose of any litigation concerning this Agreement. No party hereto will object to or contest New York County, New York, New York as the proper venue for any action or proceeding to enforce the terms hereof.
Governing Law
      41. . TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW WHICH CANNOT BE WAIVED, EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, AND COVENANTS THAT IT WILL NOT ASSERT (WHETHER AS PLAINTIFF, DEFENDANT, OR OTHERWISE), ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY FORUM IN RESPECT OF ANY ISSUE, CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION, OR CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR BASED UPON THIS AGREEMENT, ANY OTHER OF THE SURETY CREDIT DOCUMENTS, OR THE SUBJECT MATTER HEREOF, IN EACH CASE WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING OR WHETHER IN CONTRACT OR TORT OR OTHERWISE. EACH PARTY HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT HAS BEEN INFORMED THAT THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION 42 CONSTITUTE A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT UPON WHICH THE OTHER PARTIES HAVE RELIED, ARE RELYING, AND WILL RELY IN ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT. THE PARTIES HERETO MAY FILE AN ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OR A COPY OF THIS SECTION 42 WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF SUCH OTHER PARTY TO THE WAIVER OF ITS RIGHTS TO TRIAL BY JURY.
Jury Waiver
      42. . Surety may proceed against any Collateral securing the Indebtedness and against parties liable therefor in such order as it may elect, and neither Indemnitors, nor any surety or guarantor for any Indemnitor nor, to the extent allowable by law, any creditor of any Indemnitor will be entitled to require Surety to marshal assets. The benefit of any rule of law or equity to the contrary is hereby expressly waived.

          (a) Waive: (i) protest of all commercial paper at any time held by Surety on which any Indemnitor is in any way liable; and (ii) notice (except as otherwise required hereunder) and opportunity to be heard before exercise by Surety of the remedies of self-help, setoff, or of other summary procedures permitted by any applicable laws or by any agreement with any Indemnitor, and, except where required hereby or by any applicable laws, notice of any other action taken by Surety;
          (b) release Surety, its officers, directors, attorneys, employees, and agents from (i) any and all claims, causes of action, or liabilities of any nature whatsoever, fixed or
 
contingent, liquidated or non-liquidated, caused by or related to any act of omission, negligence, or other violation of law or breach of contract or other duty on the part of any of them, occurring up to the date of this Agreement, whether known or unknown, and whether discovered or reasonably capable of being discovered; and (ii) any and all claims, causes of action, or liabilities of any nature whatsoever caused by or relating to any act of omission, negligence, or other violation of law or breach of contract or other duty on the part of any of them, except for willful misconduct;

Federal Insurance Company 15 Mountain View Rd. P.O. Box 1615 Warren, New Jersey 07061-1615
Ladies and Gentlemen:
      I am General Counsel of Quanta Services, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and am delivering this opinion pursuant to Section 2(a) of the Underwriting, Continuing Indemnity and Security Agreement, dated as of March 14, 2005 (the "Underwriting Agreement"), among Federal Insurance Company, an Indiana corporation ("Federal"), the Company and the Affiliates and Subsidiaries of the Company identified on Exhibit A to the Underwriting Agreement, in their capacity as named Principal and Indemnitors (such Affiliates and Subsidiaries collectively, together with the Company, the "Indemnitors"). Capitalized terms defined in the Underwriting Agreement and used (but not otherwise defined) herein are used herein as so defined.
      In so acting, I have examined originals or copies (certified or otherwise identified to my satisfaction) of (a)(i) the Underwriting Agreement and (ii) the Intercreditor Agreement, dated March 14, 2005, among the Indemnitors, Federal and Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent for the lenders under the Credit Agreement, dated as of December 19, 2003, as amended, among the Company, certain subsidiaries of the Company as guarantors, and the lenders and other agents party thereto and (b) such corporate records, agreements, documents and other instruments, and such certificates or comparable documents of public officials and of officers and representatives of the Company and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates, and have made such inquiries of such officers and representatives, as I have deemed relevant and necessary as a basis for the opinions hereinafter set forth.
      In such examination, I have assumed the legal capacity of all natural persons, the authenticity of all documents submitted to me as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to me as certified, conformed or photostatic copies and the authenticity of the originals of such latter documents. As to all questions of fact material to these opinions that have not been independently established, I have relied upon certificates or comparable documents of officers and representatives of the Company and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates and upon the representations and warranties of the Indemnitors contained in the Surety Credit Documents.
 
      Based on the foregoing, and subject to the qualifications stated herein, I am of the opinion that:
      1. Each Indemnitor identified on Schedule I hereto is a corporation, partnership or limited liability company validly existing and, if a corporation, in good corporate standing under the laws of the jurisdiction set forth in column 2 on Schedule I hereto beside the name of such Subsidiary.
      2. Each Indemnitor identified on Schedule I hereto has all requisite corporate (or, if applicable, partnership or limited liability company) power and authority to execute and deliver the Specified Documents to which such Indemnitor is a party and to perform its obligations thereunder. The execution, delivery and performance of the respective Specified Documents by the Subsidiaries and Affiliates of the Company identified on Schedule I hereto have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate (or, if applicable, partnership or limited liability company) action on the part of each such Subsidiary or Affiliate. Each of the Specified Documents to which each such Subsidiary or Affiliate is a party has been duly and validly executed and delivered by each of such Subsidiaries or Affiliates party thereto.
      3. The execution and delivery by each Subsidiary or Affiliate of the Company identified on Schedule I hereto of the Specified Documents to which such Subsidiary or Affiliate is a party, and the performance by such Subsidiary or Affiliate of its obligations thereunder, will not conflict with, constitute a default under or violate (a) any of the terms, conditions or provisions of the Articles or Certificate of Incorporation, Certificate of Formation (or comparable formation documents) or bylaws (or comparable governing documents) of such Subsidiary or Affiliate, (b) any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any agreement for indebtedness, determined in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles, which exceeds $25 million to which such Subsidiary or Affiliate is a party or by which it is bound of which I am aware, (c) any Texas or Delaware corporate law or federal law or regulation (other than federal and state securities or blue sky laws as to which I express no opinion, and state trust fund laws, as to which I express no opinion) that I am aware to be binding on such Subsidiary or Affiliate or to be applicable to its business, properties or assets or (d) any writ, injunction, decree or order of any governmental authority binding on such Subsidiary or Affiliate of which I am aware.
      4. To my knowledge, there is no litigation, proceeding or governmental investigation pending or overtly threatened against the Company or any other Indemnitor that relates to any of the transactions contemplated by the Surety Credit Documents.
      5. Assuming the filing and proper indexing of the Financing Statements and the payment of appropriate filing fees with the Secretary of State of the respective State set forth on Schedule II, such security interest will be perfected, to the extent a security interest in the Collateral of such Indemnitors may be perfected by the filing of a financing statement under the law of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts or the States of California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, New York, Washington, North Carolina and Virginia UCC (collectively, "the UCC") in effect in the respective States set forth on Schedule II (but excluding copyrights, tradenames, trademarks, service marks and patent rights). Except as provided in UCC Sections 9-109 and 9-311, "accounts," "equipment" and "inventory," as each
 
such term is defined in the applicable UCC, are types of collateral in which a security interest may be perfected by the filing of a financing statement under the applicable UCC in effect in the respective States set forth on Schedule II.
      The foregoing opinions are subject to the following qualifications:
      (a) My opinions expressed herein are limited to the matters expressly stated herein and no opinion is implied or may be inferred beyond the matters expressly stated.
      (b) My opinions expressed herein are rendered as of the date hereof and are based on existing law which is subject to change. Where my opinions expressed herein refer to events to occur at a future date, I have assumed that there will have been no changes in the relevant law or facts between the date hereof and such future date. I do not undertake to advise you of any changes in the opinions expressed herein from matters that may hereafter arise or be brought to my attention or to revise or supplement such opinions should the present laws of any jurisdiction be changed by legislative action, judicial decision or otherwise.
      (c) In rendering the opinion set forth in paragraph (5) above:
      (i) I have assumed that the law in the specified jurisdictions is identical to the law of Delaware;
      (ii) I express no opinion as to any Collateral that may be included within the definition of Collateral but is not a Bonded Contract or is not specifically described in Section 6 of the Underwriting Agreement;
      (iii) I express no opinion as to any Collateral (A) that consists of accounts receivable which are or will be due from the United States of America or any agency or department thereof or from any state government or agency or department thereof or (B) that consists of commingled goods, letter-of-credit rights, money, deposit accounts, electronic chattel paper, investment property, letter of credit rights, electronic documents or insurance proceeds or which is or may become a fixture or a commercial tort claim;
      (iv) I have assumed: (A) the existence of the Collateral and that each Indemnitor has rights in the Collateral; (B) that there is no agreement between the Indemnitors and the Surety which postpones the attachment of the security interest in the Collateral; (C) that reasonably equivalent value has been given for all security interests created pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement; and (D) that each Financing Statement correctly sets forth the name and address of the secured party noted therein from which information about the security interests may be obtained and correctly sets forth the address of the applicable debtor noted therein;
      (v) I express no opinion as to the priority of any lien or security interest granted pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement;
 
      (vi) in the case of nonidentifiable cash proceeds, continuation of perfection of the security interests of the Surety is limited to the extent set forth in the UCC as enacted in each applicable state;
      (vii) I express no opinion as to the continuation of a security interest in property which has been sold, transferred, assigned, exchanged or otherwise disposed of or as to the continuation or preservation of perfected security interests;
      (viii) I express no opinion as to the validity, perfection or enforceability of any security interest in, or any collateral assignment of, any contract right which by its terms may not be assigned or subjected to a security interest; and
      (ix) I have assumed that all filings will be timely made and duly filed as necessary (A) in the event of a change in the name, identity or corporate structure of any Indemnitor, (B) in the event of a change in the location of any Indemnitor and (C) to continue to maintain the effectiveness of the original filings and, for informational purposes only, I call your attention to the fact that the perfection of any security interest perfected by the filing of the Financing Statements may lapse or terminate (X) if the effectiveness of any filed Financing Statement lapses due to any secured party's failure to file a properly completed continuation statement under the UCC as enacted in the applicable state within the time period required thereunder, (Y) by a change in the jurisdiction of incorporation of any Indemnitor listed on any Financing Statement or (Z) as to any Collateral acquired by any Indemnitor more than four months after such Indemnitor changes its name, identity or corporate structure so as to make any Financing Statement as to such Indemnitor seriously misleading, unless new appropriate financing statements containing the new name of the Indemnitor are properly filed before the expiration of such four month period.
      (d) My opinion in paragraph (5) is further subject to: (i) the limitations on perfection of security interests in proceeds resulting from the operation of Section 9-315 of the UCC; (ii) the limitations with respect to buyers in the ordinary course of business imposed by Sections 9-318 and 9-320 of the UCC; (iii) the limitations with respect to documents, instruments and securities imposed by Sections 8-302, 9-312 and 9-331 of the UCC; (iv) the provisions of Section 9-203 of the UCC relating to the time of attachment; and (v) Section 552 of Title 11 of the United States Code (the "Bankruptcy Code") with respect to any Collateral acquired by the Indemnitor subsequent to the commencement of a case against or by the Indemnitor under the Bankruptcy Code.
      The opinions expressed herein are limited to the laws of the State of Texas, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, the corporation laws of the States of California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, New York, North Carolina, Virginia, Washington, the Massachusetts Business Corporation Act, and the federal laws of the United States; , as to the corporation laws of the States of California,
provided
that
 
Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, New York, North Carolina, Virginia, Washington, and the Massachusetts Business Corporation Act, I have assumed that such laws are identical to the corporation laws of the State of Delaware. I express no opinion with respect to the laws of any other jurisdiction, whether applicable directly or through the foregoing laws, and I have assumed, with your permission and without independent verification, that the laws of the state of incorporation or organization of each Subsidiary or Affiliate of the Company identified on Schedule I hereto that is not incorporated or organized in the State of Texas or the State of Delaware are identical to those of the State of Texas.
 
      The opinions expressed herein are rendered solely for Surety's benefit in connection with the transactions described herein. Those opinions may not be used or relied upon by any other person, nor may this letter or any copies hereof be furnished to a third party, filed with a governmental agency, quoted, cited or otherwise referred to, without my prior written consent.
Very truly yours,

We have also assumed, with respect to each Indemnitor other than the Company, (i) the valid existence of such Indemnitor, (ii) that such Indemnitor has the requisite corporate or other power and authority to enter into and perform each Specified Document to which it is party and (iii) the due authorization, execution and delivery by such Indemnitor of each Specified Document to which such Indemnitor is party. We have also assumed that each of the Specified Documents has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the parties thereto other than the Indemnitors and constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of such other parties, enforceable against such other parties in accordance with its terms. As used herein, "of which we are aware" or similar phrase means the conscious awareness of facts or other information by any lawyer in our firm actively involved in the transactions contemplated by the Specified Documents.
      Based on the foregoing, and subject to the qualifications stated herein, we are of the opinion that:
            1. Each of the Company and Underground Construction is a corporation validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware. The Ryan Company is a corporation validly existing and in good corporate standing under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Trans Tech is validly existing under the laws of the State of Texas.
            2. The Company and each of the WIP Entities has all requisite corporate power and authority to execute and deliver the Specified Documents and to perform its obligations thereunder.
            3. The execution, delivery and performance of the Specified Documents by the Company have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company and the WIP Entities.
            4. Each of the Specified Documents has been duly and validly executed and delivered by the Company and the WIP Entities.
            5. Each of the Specified Documents constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of each of the Indemnitors signatory thereto, enforceable against each such Indemnitor
 
Federal Insurance Company March 14, 2005 Page 3
in accordance with its terms, except (a) as the foregoing may be limited by (i) applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance or transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws affecting creditors' rights and remedies generally and (ii) general principles of equity, including principles of commercial reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding at law or in equity), (b) that rights to indemnification and contribution thereunder may be limited by federal or state securities laws and the public policy relating thereto, (c) that we express no opinion (except as specifically provided in paragraph (8) below) as to the attachment, perfection or priority of any liens granted pursuant to any Specified Document and (d) that certain remedial provisions of the Specified Documents are or may be unenforceable in whole or in part under the laws of the State of New York, but the inclusion of such remedial provisions does not affect the validity of the Specified Documents, and the Specified Documents contain adequate provisions for the practical realization of the rights and benefits afforded thereby.
            6. (a) The execution and delivery by the Company of the Specified Documents and the performance by the Company of its obligations thereunder will not conflict with, constitute a default under or violate (a) any of the terms, conditions or provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of the Company, (b) any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any agreement listed on Schedule II hereto, (c) any New York law, the Delaware General Corporation Law or any federal law or regulation (other than federal and state securities or blue sky laws, as to which we express no opinion, and state trust fund laws, as to which we express no opinion) that we are aware is binding on the Company or applicable to its business, properties or assets or (d) any judgment, writ, injunction, decree, order or ruling of any court or governmental authority binding on the Company of which we are aware.
                  (b) The execution and delivery by Underground Construction of the Specified Documents and the performance by Underground Construction of its obligations thereunder will not conflict with, constitute a default under or violate (a) any of the terms, conditions or provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of Underground Construction, (b) any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any agreement listed on Schedule II hereto, or (c) any Delaware General Corporation Law or any federal law or regulation (other than federal and state securities or blue sky laws, as to which we express no opinion, and state trust fund laws, as to which we express no opinion) that we are aware is binding on Underground Construction or applicable to its business, properties or assets or (d) any judgment, writ, injunction, decree, order or ruling of any court or governmental authority binding on Underground Construction of which we are aware.
                  (c) The execution and delivery by The Ryan Company of the Specified Documents and the performance by The Ryan Company of its obligations thereunder will not conflict with, constitute a default under or violate (a) any of the terms, conditions or provisions of the Articles of Organization, as amended, or Bylaws of The Ryan Company, (b)
 
Federal Insurance Company March 14, 2005 Page 4
any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any agreement listed on Schedule II hereto, or (c) the Massachusetts Business Corporation Act or any federal law or regulation (other than federal and state securities or blue sky laws, as to which we express no opinion, and state trust fund laws, as to which we express no opinion) that we are aware is binding on The Ryan Company or applicable to its business, properties or assets or (d) any judgment, writ, injunction, decree, order or ruling of any court or governmental authority binding on The Ryan Company of which we are aware.
                  (d) The execution and delivery by Trans Tech of the Specified Documents and the performance by Trans Tech of its obligations thereunder will not conflict with, constitute a default under or violate (a) any of the terms, conditions or provisions of its limited partnership agreement, (b) any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any agreement listed on Schedule II hereto, or (c) any Texas limited liability partnership law or any federal law or regulation (other than federal and state securities or blue sky laws, as to which we express no opinion, and state trust fund laws, as to which we express no opinion) that we are aware is binding on Trans Tech or applicable to its business, properties or assets or (d) any judgment, writ, injunction, decree, order or ruling of any court or governmental authority binding on Trans Tech of which we are aware.

            7. The execution and delivery by the Indemnitors (other than the Company) of the Specified Documents and the performance by such Indemnitors of their respective obligations thereunder will not conflict with, constitute a default under or violate any New York law or federal law or regulation (other than federal and state securities or blue sky laws, as to which we express no opinion, and state trust fund laws, as to which we express no opinion) that we are aware is binding on such Indemnitor or applicable to its business, properties or assets.
            8. The execution and delivery of the Underwriting Agreement by the Indemnitors creates a valid security interest in the Collateral (as defined in the Underwriting Agreement) in favor of the Surety, as security for any Surety Loss (as defined in the Underwriting Agreement) to the extent that Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect in the State of New York (together with the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect in the States of Delaware and Texas, and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the "UCC") is applicable to the creation of such security interest. Except as provided in UCC Section 9-109, "accounts," "equipment" and "inventory," as each such term is defined in the applicable UCC, are types of collateral to which the respective UCC is applicable in determining the creation of a security interest. Assuming the filing and proper indexing of the Financing Statements and the payment of appropriate filing fees with the Secretary of State of the respective State set forth on Schedule III, such security interest will be perfected, to the extent a security interest in the
 
Federal Insurance Company March 14, 2005 Page 5
Collateral of such Indemnitors may be perfected by the filing of a financing statement under the applicable UCC in effect in the respective States set forth on Schedule III (but excluding copyrights, tradenames, trademarks, service marks and patent rights). Except as provided in UCC Sections 9-109 and 9-311, "accounts," "equipment" and "inventory," as each such term is defined in the applicable UCC, are types of collateral in which a security interest may be perfected by the filing of a financing statement under the applicable UCC in effect in the respective States set forth on Schedule III.
                  The foregoing opinions are subject to the following qualifications:
                  (a) In rendering the opinion set forth in paragraph (5) above, we express no opinion with respect to:
      (i) any provision of any of the Specified Documents insofar as it provides for the payment or reimbursement of costs and expenses or indemnification or contribution (A) for claims, losses or liabilities in excess of a reasonable amount determined by a court or other tribunal or attributable to the indemnified party's negligence or (B) otherwise under circumstances where such payment, reimbursement, or indemnification or contribution is contrary to public policy;
      (ii) the ability of any party to collect attorneys' fees and costs in an action involving any of the Specified Documents if such party is not the prevailing party in such action or to the extent such fees and costs are greater than such fees and costs as may be determined to be reasonable by a court or other tribunal;
      (iii) the right of any person to declare a default, accelerate obligations of any other person, or exercise remedies based on non-material breaches of any of the Specified Documents or without notice;
      (iv) the ability of any person to obtain specific performance, injunctive relief, liquidated damages, rescission or any similar remedy in any proceeding;
      (v) whether a court other than a court of the State of New York would give effect to a choice of New York law;
      (vi) any provisions contained in the Specified Documents which purport to negate or limit liabilities, duties and obligations of the Surety (including, without limitation, those with respect to the care, maintenance, disposition, preservation or protection of the Collateral and duties that are imposed upon Surety by the UCC); or
 
Federal Insurance Company March 14, 2005 Page 6
      (vii) (A) any right of setoff under the Underwriting Agreement, (B) Section 15 of the Underwriting Agreement (titled "Bankruptcy Court Approval"), (C) Section 17 of the Underwriting Agreement (titled "Use of Cash Collateral"), (D) the third sentence of Section 23 of the Underwriting Agreement (titled "Indemnitors' Knowing Consent to Agreement"), (E) the first two sentences of Section 30 of the Underwriting Agreement (titled "Right of Surety to Settle Claims"), (F) the first sentence of Section 32 of the Underwriting Agreement (titled "Authority of Surety to Amend Bond"), (G) the last sentence of the last paragraph of Section 33 of the Underwriting Agreement (titled "Rights and Remedies on Default") or (H) Section 53 of the Underwriting Agreement (titled "Power of Attorney").
                  (b) In rendering the opinion set forth in paragraph (5) above, we express no opinion with respect to any provision of any of the Specified Documents providing for:
      (i) the establishment or waiver of measures of damages or methods of proof;
      (ii) any right to obtain possession of any property or to exercise self-help remedies or other remedies without judicial process or in any manner other than peaceably and by reason of the peaceable surrender of such possession by any Indemnitor;
      (iii) any waiver or limitation concerning mitigation of damages;
      (iv) confession of judgment;
      (v) any waiver of any course of dealing or delay in action by any party or of any rights arising from any such course of dealing or delay;
      (vi) any waiver of a right to interpose a defense, counterclaim or setoff or to recover special or consequential damages;
      (vii) the consent to or establishment of jurisdiction or venue;
      (viii) any waiver of the right to raise a claim of an inconvenient forum with respect to any judicial proceedings;
      (ix) the exculpation of the Surety from liability for its action or inaction, to the extent such exculpation is contrary to public policy or law;
      (x) any waiver of statutes of limitations;
 
Federal Insurance Company March 14, 2005 Page 7
      (xi) prejudgment attachment against any Indemnitor;
      (xii) the right of the Surety to institute judicial proceedings or institute or enforce any other extraordinary remedy without first giving notice to Indemnitors; or
      (xiii) any waiver of various defenses and rights on the part of Indemnitors which arise as a result of actions taken by the Surety in the enforcement of remedies or as a result of a bankruptcy filing by or against any Indemnitor.
                  (c) We have assumed that each of the parties to the Specified Documents other than the Indemnitors will seek to enforce its rights thereunder in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner.
                  (d) In rendering the opinion set forth in paragraph (8) above:
      (i) we express no opinion with respect to any Collateral as to which the creation or perfection of a security interest is governed by the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware, Texas or New York or the Commonwealth of Massachusetts;
      (ii) we express no opinion as to any Collateral that may be included within the definition of Collateral but is not a Bonded Contract or is not specifically described in Section 6 of the Underwriting Agreement;
      (iii) we express no opinion as to any Collateral (A) that consists of accounts receivable which are or will be due from the United States of America or any agency or department thereof or from any state government or agency or department thereof or (B) that consists of commingled goods, letter-of-credit rights, money, deposit accounts, electronic chattel paper, investment property, letter of credit rights, electronic documents or insurance proceeds or which is or may become a fixture or a commercial tort claim;
      (iv) we have assumed: (A) the existence of the Collateral and that each Indemnitor has rights in the Collateral; (B) that there is no agreement between the Indemnitors and the Surety which postpones the attachment of the security interest in the Collateral; (C) that reasonably equivalent value has been given for all security interests created pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement; and (D) that each Financing Statement correctly sets forth the address of the secured party noted therein from which information about the security interests may be obtained
 
Federal Insurance Company March 14, 2005 Page 8
and correctly sets forth the name and address of the applicable debtor noted therein;
      (v) we express no opinion as to the priority of any lien or security interest granted pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement;
      (vi) in the case of nonidentifiable cash proceeds, continuation of perfection of the security interests of the Surety is limited to the extent set forth in the UCC as enacted in each applicable state;
      (vii) we express no opinion as to the continuation of a security interest in property which has been sold, transferred, assigned, exchanged or otherwise disposed of or as to the continuation or preservation of perfected security interests;
      (viii) we express no opinion as to the validity, perfection or enforceability of any security interest in, or any collateral assignment of, any contract right which by its terms may not be assigned or subjected to a security interest; and
      (ix) we have assumed that all filings will be timely made and duly filed as necessary (A) in the event of a change in the name, identity or corporate structure of any Indemnitor, (B) in the event of a change in the location of any Indemnitor and (C) to continue to maintain the effectiveness of the original filings and, for informational purposes only, we call your attention to the fact that the perfection of any security interest perfected by the filing of the Financing Statements may lapse or terminate (X) if the effectiveness of any filed Financing Statement lapses due to any secured party's failure to file a properly completed continuation statement under the UCC as enacted in the applicable state within the time period required thereunder, (Y) by a change in the jurisdiction of incorporation of any Indemnitor listed on any Financing Statement or (Z) as to any Collateral acquired by any Indemnitor more than four months after such Indemnitor changes its name, identity or corporate structure so as to make any Financing Statement as to such Indemnitor seriously misleading, unless new appropriate financing statements containing the new name of the Indemnitor are properly filed before the expiration of such four month period.
                  (e) Our opinion in paragraph (8) is further subject to: (i) the limitations on perfection of security interests in proceeds resulting from the operation of Section 9-315 of the UCC; (ii) the limitations with respect to buyers in the ordinary course of business imposed by Sections 9-318 and 9-320 of the UCC; (iii) the limitations with respect to documents,
 
Federal Insurance Company March 14, 2005 Page 9
instruments and securities imposed by Sections 8-302, 9-312 and 9-331 of the UCC; (iv) the provisions of Section 9-203 of the UCC relating to the time of attachment; and (v) Section 552 of Title 11 of the United States Code (the "Bankruptcy Code") with respect to any Collateral acquired by the Indemnitor subsequent to the commencement of a case against or by the Indemnitor under the Bankruptcy Code.
                  (f) Our opinions expressed herein are limited to the matters expressly stated herein and no opinion is implied or may be inferred beyond the matters expressly stated.
                  (g) Our opinions expressed herein are rendered as of the date hereof and are based on existing law which is subject to change.

We do not undertake to advise you of any changes in the opinions expressed herein from matters that may hereafter arise or be brought to our attention or to revise or supplement such opinions should the present laws of any jurisdiction be changed by legislative action, judicial decision or otherwise.
                  The opinions expressed herein are limited to the laws of the State of New York, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, Article 9 of the UCC as in effect in each of the State of New York, the State of Delaware, and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Chapter 9 of the UCC as in effect in the State of Texas and the federal laws of the United States, and we express no opinion with respect to the laws of any other jurisdiction, whether applicable directly or through the foregoing laws.
