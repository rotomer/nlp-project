Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 07-03
 Quanta Services, Inc. (NYSE: PWR) today announced results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2006.
HOUSTON  February 22, 2007
     Revenues in the fourth quarter of 2006 were a record high of $592.0 million, compared to revenues of $523.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2005. After recording a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $56.6 million, net of tax, or $0.46 per diluted share, the net loss for the fourth quarter of 2006 was $30.5 million, or a loss per diluted share of $0.26, compared to net income of $18.5 million, or earnings per diluted share of $0.15 in the fourth quarter of 2005. For the three months ended December 31, 2006, adjusted net income, excluding the non-cash goodwill impairment charge, was $26.1 million or $0.20 per diluted share.
     Revenues for the twelve months of 2006 were a record high of $2.13 billion, compared to $1.86 billion for the twelve months of 2005. For the twelve months of 2006, the company reported net income of $17.5 million, or earnings per diluted share of $0.15, compared to net income of $29.6 million, or earnings per diluted share of $0.25 for twelve months of 2005. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2006, adjusted net income, excluding the non-cash goodwill impairment charge, was $74.1 million or $0.58 per diluted share. The adjusted net income and earnings per diluted share for the fourth quarter and full year 2006 are non-GAAP measures.
     "This was a year of strength for Quanta. For 2006, we achieved internal revenue growth of 15 percent, increased operating income by 94 percent excluding the goodwill impairment charge, and reached record backlog for the third consecutive quarter," said John Colson, chairman and chief executive officer of Quanta Services. "This signifies the high demand for our services as the industries we serve focus on enhancing and expanding infrastructure to meet the growing demand for power and telecommunications services."
 
     The non-cash goodwill impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2006 was associated with one of the company's operating units that has historically served the cable TV industry. This charge is a result of the annual impairment evaluation of the company's goodwill balances as required by SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets."
     The non-GAAP measures in this press release are provided to enable investors to evaluate quarterly and annual performance excluding the effects of the non-cash goodwill impairment charge that management believes impact the comparability of operating results between reporting periods.

This press release contains forward-looking statements intended to qualify for the "safe harbor" from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements relating to projected revenues and earnings per share and other projections of financial and operating results, capital expenditures, growth in particular markets, benefits of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, strategies and plans, as well as statements reflecting expectations, intentions, assumptions or beliefs about future events, and other statements that do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Although Quanta's management believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct. These statements can be affected by inaccurate assumptions and by a variety of risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict or beyond our control, including, among others, quarterly variations in operating results; adverse changes in economic conditions and trends in relevant markets; the ability to effectively compete for market share; potential failure of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to result in increased spending on the electrical power transmission infrastructure; the ability to successfully identify, complete and integrate acquisitions; estimates and assumptions in determining financial results; the financial distress of Quanta's casualty insurance carrier that may require payment for losses that would otherwise be insured; potential exposure to environmental liabilities; liabilities for claims that are self-insured or for claims that Quanta's casualty insurance carrier fails to pay; potential liabilities relating to occupational health and safety matters; estimates relating to the use of percentage-of-completion accounting; dependence on fixed price contracts and potential to incur losses with respect to these contracts; beliefs and assumptions about the collectibility of receivables; the inability of customers to pay for services; rapid technological and structural changes that could reduce the demand for services; the ability to obtain performance bonds; cancellation provisions within contracts and the risk that contracts are not renewed or are replaced on less favorable terms; the ability to attract skilled labor and retention of key personnel and qualified employees; the impact of a unionized workforce on operations and the ability to complete future acquisitions; potential shortage of skilled employees; growth outpacing infrastructure; potential exposure to environmental liabilities; risks associated with operating in international markets; requirements relating to governmental regulation and changes thereto; the ability to continue to meet the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002; the cost of borrowing, availability of credit, debt covenant compliance and other factors affecting financing activities; the ability to generate internal growth; the adverse impact of goodwill impairments; the potential conversion of outstanding convertible subordinated notes; and other risks detailed in Quanta's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2005, Quanta's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2006 and any other reports of Quanta filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Should one or more of these risks materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which are current only as of this date. Quanta does not undertake and expressly disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. For a discussion of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, investors are urged to refer to Quanta's reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
