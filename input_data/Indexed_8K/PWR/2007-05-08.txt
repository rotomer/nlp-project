Forward-Looking Statements
     Statements in this press release regarding the proposed transaction between Quanta and InfraSource, including the expected timing for completion of the transaction, (other than historical facts) are forward-looking statements intended to qualify for the "safe harbor" from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements rely on a number of assumptions concerning future events and are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict or outside Quanta's and InfraSource's control, which could cause actual results to differ materially from such statements. These assumptions, risks and uncertainties include, among other things, the possibility that the pending acquisition of InfraSource may not close on the terms or timetable described in this release, or at all, as a result of the failure to satisfy the closing conditions of the pending merger as contemplated by the merger agreement, including the failure to obtain stockholder or regulatory approvals, or otherwise. These forward-looking statements are also affected by the risk factors, forward-looking statements and assumptions, challenges and uncertainties described in the joint proxy statement/prospectus filed by Quanta and InfraSource and in Quanta's and InfraSouce's other filings with the SEC, which are available free of charge on the SEC's web site at http://www.sec.gov and through Quanta's and InfraSource's websites at www.quantaservices.com and www.infrasourceinc.com, respectively. Quanta and InfraSource expressly disclaim any intention or obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.
