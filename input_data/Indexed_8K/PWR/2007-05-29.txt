Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
     At the annual meeting of stockholders of Quanta Services, Inc. (Quanta) held on May 24, 2007, the stockholders approved the adoption of the Quanta Services, Inc. 2007 Stock Incentive Plan (the Plan), which was previously approved, subject to stockholder approval, by Quanta's Board of Directors. The Plan provides for the award of incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options and restricted stock. Quanta's employees, including executive officers, non-employee directors and certain consultants and advisors are eligible to receive awards under the Plan. A total of 4,000,000 shares of Quanta's common stock are reserved and available for issuance pursuant to awards granted under the Plan. Concurrent with stockholder approval of the Plan, the Quanta Services, Inc. 2001 Stock Incentive Plan (as amended and restated March 13, 2003) was terminated (except outstanding awards will continue to be governed by such plan), and accordingly, no further awards will be made thereunder. As awards under the Plan to executive officers are made at the discretion of Quanta's Compensation Committee, amounts payable to Quanta's Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and other named executive officers are not presently determinable.
     A summary of the Plan was included in Quanta's definitive proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 20, 2007 (the Proxy Statement). This summary, which is incorporated herein by reference, appears in the section entitled "Summary Description of the 2007 Plan" which begins on page 37 of the Proxy Statement. The summary of the Plan in the Proxy Statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Plan, which is filed as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.
     In connection with stockholder approval of the Plan, Quanta's Compensation Committee approved the form of restricted stock agreement to employees/consultants and the form of restricted stock agreement to non-employee directors, filed as Exhibit 99.2 and Exhibit 99.3 to this report, respectively, pursuant to which awards under the Plan will be made.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF OPTIONS

.
Form of Option Grant
 
(b)   The date of grant of an Option shall be the date on which the Committees make the determination to grant such Option unless otherwise specified by the Committees.

(d)   Options shall be exercisable within the time or times or upon the event or events determined by the Committees and set forth in the Option Agreement; provided, however, that no Option shall be exercisable later than the day prior to the expiration of ten (10) years from the date of grant of the Option, and provided further, that no Incentive Stock Option granted to a Ten Percent Stockholder shall be exercisable after the expiration of five (5) years from the date of grant of the Option.

Limitations on Incentive Stock Options
 
(within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code) granted under any other incentive stock option plan of the Company or an Affiliate shall not exceed $100,000. If the Fair Market Value of stock with respect to which all incentive stock options described in the preceding sentence held by any one Optionee are exercisable for the first time by such Optionee during any calendar year exceeds $100,000, the Options (that are intended to be Incentive Stock Options on the date of grant thereof) for the first $100,000 worth of shares of Common Stock to become exercisable in such year shall be deemed to constitute incentive stock options within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code and the Options (that are intended to be Incentive Stock Options on the date of grant thereof) for the shares of Common Stock in the amount in excess of $100,000 that become exercisable in that calendar year shall be treated as Non-Qualified Stock Options. If the Code is amended after the Effective Date to provide for a different limit than the one described in this Section 8(e), such different limit shall be incorporated herein and shall apply to any Options granted after the effective date of such amendment.
 
(f)   Options granted under the Plan, and any interest therein, shall not be transferable or assignable by the Optionee, and may not be made subject to execution, attachment or similar process, otherwise than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, and shall be exercisable during the lifetime of the Optionee only by the Optionee; provided, that the Optionee may, however, designate persons who or which may exercise his Options following his death. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, Non-Qualified Stock Options may be transferred to such family members, family member trusts, family limited partnerships and other family member entities as the Committee, in its sole discretion, may provide for in the Optionee's Option Agreement and approve prior to any such transfer. No such transfer will be approved by the Committee if the Common Stock issuable under such transferred Option would not be eligible to be registered on promulgated under the Securities Act.

Such assumption shall be permissible if the holder of the assumed option would have been eligible to be granted an Option hereunder if the other entity had applied the rules of the Plan to such grant. The Committee also may grant Options under the Plan in settlement of or substitution for outstanding options or obligations to grant future options in connection with the Company or an Affiliate acquiring another entity, an interest in another entity or an additional interest in an Affiliate, whether by merger, stock purchase, asset purchase or other form of transaction.

EXERCISE OF OPTIONS
 
(a)   Options may be exercised only by delivery to the Company of a written exercise notice approved by the Committees (which need not be the same for each Optionee), stating the number of shares of Common Stock being purchased, the method of payment, and such other matters as may be deemed appropriate by the Company in connection with the issuance of shares of Common Stock upon exercise of the Option, together with payment in full of the exercise price for the number of shares of Common Stock being purchased. Such exercise notice may be part of an Optionee's Option Agreement.
.
Notice
 
(b)   An Option Agreement may, but need not, include a provision that permits the Optionee to elect at any time while an Employee, Officer, Director or Consultant, to exercise any part or all of the Option prior to full vesting of the Option. Any unvested shares of Common Stock received pursuant to such exercise may be subject to a repurchase right in favor of the Company or an Affiliate or to any other restriction the Committees determine to be appropriate.

Early Exercise
 
(c)   Payment for the shares of Common Stock to be purchased upon exercise of an Option may be made in cash (by check) or, if elected by the Optionee and approved by the Committees, in any of the following methods which must be stated in the Option Agreement (at the date of grant with respect to any Option granted as an Incentive Stock Option) and where permitted by law: (i) if a public market for the

Payment
 
Common Stock exists, through a "same day sale" arrangement between the Optionee and a broker-dealer that is a member of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (an "") whereby the Optionee elects to exercise the Option and to sell a portion of the shares of Common Stock so purchased to pay for the exercise price and whereby the NASD Dealer commits upon receipt of such shares of Common Stock to forward the exercise price directly to the Company; (ii) if a public market for the Common Stock exists, through a "margin" commitment from the Optionee and an NASD Dealer whereby the Optionee elects to exercise the Option and to pledge the shares of Common Stock so purchased to the NASD Dealer in a margin account as security for a loan from the NASD Dealer in the amount of the exercise price, and whereby the NASD Dealer commits upon receipt of such shares of Common Stock to forward the exercise price directly to the Company; (iii) by surrender to the Company for cancellation of shares of Common Stock owned by the Optionee having an aggregate Fair Market Value on the date of exercise equal to (or, to avoid the cancellation of fractional shares of Common Stock, less than) the aggregate exercise price of the shares of Common Stock being purchased upon such exercise; provided, that such surrendered shares are not subject to any pledge or other security interest and have or meet such other requirements, if any, as the Committees may determine necessary in order to avoid an accounting earnings charge in respect of the Option being exercised; (iv) where approved by the Committees at the time of exercise, by delivery of the Optionee's promissory note with such recourse, interest, security, redemption and other provisions as the Committees may require, provided that the par value of each of the shares of Common Stock to be purchased is paid for in cash; (v) by a "net exercise" method whereby the Company withholds from the delivery of shares of Common Stock subject to the Option (or the portion thereof that is being exercised) that number of whole shares having an aggregate Fair Market Value on the date of exercise equal to (or, to avoid the issuance of fractional shares of Common Stock, less than) the aggregate exercise price of the shares of Common Stock being purchased upon such exercise; or (vi) by any combination of the foregoing, including a cash payment. No shares of Common Stock may be issued until full payment of the purchase price therefor has been made.
NASD Dealer
 
(d)   The Committee may establish such rules and procedures as it considers desirable in order to satisfy any obligation of the Company to withhold the statutory prescribed minimum amount of federal or state income taxes or other taxes with respect to the exercise of any Option granted under the Plan, including (if the Committee so permits) procedures for an Optionee to have shares of Common Stock withheld from the total number of shares of Common Stock to be purchased on exercise of an Option. Prior to issuance of the shares of Common Stock upon exercise of an Option, the Optionee shall pay or make adequate provision acceptable to the Committee for the satisfaction of the statutory minimum prescribed amount of any federal or state income or other tax withholding obligations of the Company, if applicable. Upon exercise of an Option, the Company shall withhold or collect from the Optionee an amount sufficient to satisfy such tax withholding obligations.
