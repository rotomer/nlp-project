HOUSTON  Oct. 8, 2008  Quanta Services, Inc. today announced that, following the issuance on Aug. 27, 2008 of its notice to redeem all of its outstanding 4.5% convertible subordinated notes due 2023, the registered holders of approximately 99.9%, or $269.8 million aggregate principal amount, of the notes elected to convert their notes into shares of Quanta Services common stock prior to the redemption date of Oct. 8, 2008.
In accordance with the terms of the indenture governing the 4.5% convertible subordinated notes, each $1,000 principal amount of the notes were convertible into 89.7989 shares, which is equivalent to a price of $11.14 per share.

Payment of the repurchase and redemption price was made by Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee. The notes were originally issued on Oct. 17, 2003, in the aggregate principal amount of $270 million and, as a result of this and prior conversions of certain of the notes, no notes remain outstanding.
