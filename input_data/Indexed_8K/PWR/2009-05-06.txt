Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
09-08
 Quanta Services, Inc. (NYSE: PWR) today announced results for the three months ended March 31, 2009.
HOUSTON  May 6, 2009
     Revenues in the first quarter of 2009 were $738.5 million compared to revenues of $844.4 million in the first quarter of 2008. For the first quarter of 2009, net income attributable to common stock was $21.4 million or $0.11 per diluted share as compared to $21.5 million or $0.13 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2008. For the first quarter of 2009, cash earnings per diluted share (a non-GAAP measure) were $0.14 as compared to cash earnings per diluted share of $0.18 for the first quarter of 2008. Cash earnings per diluted share are GAAP earnings per diluted share before amortization of intangible assets, non-cash interest expense and non-cash compensation expense, all net of tax. See the attached table for a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the reported GAAP measures. Also see Note (a) to the attached Consolidated Statement of Operations for an explanation of 2008 amounts that have been retrospectively restated as a result of the adoption of new accounting pronouncements effective Jan. 1, 2009.
     "Electric transmission and renewable energy projects are the growth engines that will allow us to thrive throughout a challenging economic environment for the next several months," said John R. Colson, chairman and CEO of Quanta Services, Inc. "We are optimistic that the second half of 2009 will see increased spending by our customers and, because of our higher total backlog, the beginning of a full recovery and growth in our markets in 2010 and beyond."
 
RECENT HIGHLIGHTS
 
OUTLOOK
     Quanta recognizes that it and its customers continue to operate in a challenging business environment with an economic downturn and weak capital markets. Therefore, management cannot predict the timing or extent of the impact these conditions may have on demand for Quanta's services, particularly in the near term. The following forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and actual results may differ materially.
     Quanta expects revenues for the second quarter of 2009 to range between $850 million and $890 million and diluted earnings per share to be between $0.14 and $0.15. Quanta expects cash earnings per diluted share (a non-GAAP measure) for the second quarter of 2009 to range from $0.17 to $0.18. Amortization of intangibles, non-cash stock compensation expense and non-cash interest expense are forecasted to be approximately $11.2 million for the second quarter of 2009.

Forward-Looking Statements
This press release (and oral statements regarding the subject matter of this release, including those made on the conference call and webcast announced herein) contains forward-looking statements intended to qualify for the "safe harbor" from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, projected revenues and earnings per share and other projections of financial and operating results and capital expenditures; growth or opportunities in particular markets; the impact of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, renewable energy initiatives, the recently enacted economic stimulus package and other potential legislative actions on future spending by customers; the expected value of, and the scope, services, term and results of any related projects awarded under, agreements for services to be provided by Quanta, including those agreements mentioned in this release; statements relating to the business plans or financial condition of utilities and our other customers; and Quanta's strategies and plans, as well as statements reflecting expectations, intentions, assumptions or beliefs about future events, and other statements that do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Although Quanta's management believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct. These statements can be affected by inaccurate assumptions and by a variety of risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict or beyond our control, including, among others, quarterly variations in operating results; continuing declines in economic and financial conditions, including the recent volatility in the capital markets; trends in relevant markets; delays, reductions in scope or cancellations of existing projects, including as a result of capital constraints that may impact our customers; dependence on fixed price contracts and the potential to incur losses with respect to these contracts; estimates relating to the use of percentage-of-completion accounting; the successful negotiation, execution, performance and completion of pending and existing contracts, including those referenced in this release; the ability to generate internal growth; the ability to effectively compete for new projects and market share; the failure of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, renewable energy initiatives, the recently enacted economic stimulus package or other potential legislative actions to result in increased demand for Quanta's services; cancellation provisions within contracts and the risk that contracts are not renewed or are replaced on less favorable terms; the inability of customers to pay for services; the failure to recover on payment claims against project owners or to obtain adequate compensation for customer-requested change orders; the ability to attract skilled labor and retain key personnel and qualified employees; potential shortage of skilled employees; estimates and assumptions in determining financial results and backlog; the ability to realize backlog; the ability to successfully identify, complete and integrate acquisitions; the adverse impact of goodwill or other intangible asset impairments; growth outpacing infrastructure; unexpected costs or liabilities that may arise from lawsuits or indemnity claims related to the services Quanta performs; liabilities for claims that are self-insured; risks associated with the implementation of an information technology solution; potential liabilities relating to occupational health and safety matters; risks associated with operating in international markets; risks associated with our dependence on suppliers, subcontractors and equipment manufacturers; risks associated with Quanta's dark fiber leasing business, including regulatory changes and the potential inability to realize a return on capital investments; beliefs and assumptions about the collectability of receivables; the cost of borrowing, availability of credit, fluctuations in the price and volume of Quanta's common stock, debt covenant compliance, interest rate fluctuations and other factors affecting financing and investment activities; the ability to obtain performance bonds; the impact of a unionized workforce on operations and the ability to complete future acquisitions; the ability to continue to meet the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002; potential exposure to environmental liabilities; requirements relating to governmental regulation and changes thereto; rapid technological and structural changes that could reduce the demand for services; the ability to access sufficient funding to finance desired growth and operations; the potential conversion of Quanta's outstanding convertible subordinated notes; provisions of our corporate governing documents could make an acquisition of our company more difficult; and other risks detailed in Quanta's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008, and any other documents that Quanta files with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Should one or more of these risks materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which are current only as of this date. Quanta does not undertake and expressly disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. For a discussion of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, investors are urged to refer to Quanta's documents filed with the SEC that are available through the company's Web site at or through the SEC's Electronic Data Gathering and Analysis Retrieval System (EDGAR) at .
