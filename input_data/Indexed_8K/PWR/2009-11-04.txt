Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
09-16
Quanta Services, Inc. (NYSE: PWR) today announced results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2009.
HOUSTON  Nov. 4, 2009 
     Revenues in the third quarter of 2009 were $780.8 million compared to revenues of $1.05 billion in the third quarter of 2008. For the third quarter of 2009, net income attributable to common stock was $63.4 million or $0.32 per diluted share, as compared to $51.9 million or $0.28 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2008. Included in net income attributable to common stock for the third quarter of 2009 is $22.4 million of income, or a benefit of $0.11 per diluted share, from the release of income tax contingencies due to the expiration of various statutes of limitations related to federal and state tax returns. Adjusted diluted earnings per share (a non-GAAP measure) was $0.25 for the third quarter of 2009 compared to $0.32 for the third quarter of 2008. Adjusted diluted earnings per share is GAAP diluted earnings per share before the impact of tax contingency releases and certain non-cash items such as amortization of intangible assets, non-cash interest expense and non-cash compensation expense, all net of tax. See the attached table for a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the reported GAAP measures.
     "The slow economy continues to negatively affect the industries we serve and our revenues. However, our gross margins improved 130 basis points over the third quarter of 2008, a quarter during which we achieved $110 million more in higher margin emergency restoration service revenues. This gross margin improvement reflects our successful strategy of not pursuing lower margin work for the sake of revenues," said John R. Colson, chairman and CEO of Quanta Services. "We believe the most significant effects of the recession are behind us. While the first quarter of 2010 may be challenging, we expect a meaningful recovery in the second half of next year as spending by our customers returns."
 
     Revenues for the first nine months of 2009 were $2.33 billion compared to $2.86 billion for the first nine months of 2008. For the first nine months of 2009, Quanta reported net income attributable to common stock of $118.2 million or $0.59 per diluted share, compared to $111.1 million or $0.63 per diluted share for the first nine months of last year. Included in net income attributable to common stock for the first nine months of 2009 is the previously discussed release of income tax contingencies in the third quarter of 2009. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.59 for the first nine months of 2009 as compared to $0.76 for the first nine months of 2008. See the attached table for a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the reported GAAP measures.
     See Note (a) to the attached Consolidated Statements of Operations for an explanation of 2008 amounts that have been retrospectively restated as a result of the adoption of new accounting pronouncements effective Jan. 1, 2009.
     
RECENT HIGHLIGHTS
 
OUTLOOK
     Quanta and its customers continue to operate in a challenging business environment with the economic downturn and weak capital markets. Therefore, management cannot predict the timing or extent of the impact that these conditions may have on demand for Quanta's services, particularly in the near term. The following forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and actual results may differ materially.
     Quanta expects revenues for the fourth quarter of 2009 to range between $900 million and $950 million. This estimate includes a forecast of emergency restoration service revenues of $11 million versus approximately $47 million in emergency restoration service revenues being earned in the fourth quarter of 2008. It also includes an estimate of the results of Price Gregory for the full quarter. Diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2009 are estimated to be between $0.16 and $0.17. Quanta expects adjusted diluted earnings per share (a non-GAAP measure calculated on the same basis as the historical adjusted earnings per diluted share presented in this release) for the fourth quarter of 2009 to range from $0.26 to $0.27. Amortization of intangibles, non-cash interest expense and non-cash stock compensation expenses are forecasted to be approximately $34 million for the fourth quarter of 2009.

Forward-Looking Statements
This press release (and oral statements regarding the subject matter of this release, including those made on the conference call and webcast announced herein) contains forward-looking statements intended to qualify for the "safe harbor" from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, projected revenues and earnings per share and other projections of financial and operating results and capital expenditures; growth or opportunities in particular markets; the impact of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, renewable energy initiatives, the recently enacted economic stimulus package and other potential legislative actions on future spending by customers; the potential benefits from acquisitions, including Price Gregory; the expected value of, and the scope, services, term and results of any related projects awarded under, agreements for services to be provided by Quanta; statements relating to the business plans or financial condition of utilities and our other customers; and Quanta's strategies and plans, as well as statements reflecting expectations, intentions, assumptions or beliefs about future events, and other statements that do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Although Quanta's management believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct. These statements can be affected by inaccurate assumptions and by a variety of risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict or beyond our control, including, among others, quarterly variations in operating results; continuing declines in economic and financial conditions, including volatility in the capital markets; trends and growth opportunities in relevant markets; delays, reductions in scope or cancellations of existing projects, including as a result of capital constraints that may impact our customers; dependence on fixed price contracts and the potential to incur losses with respect to these contracts; estimates relating to the use of percentage-of-completion accounting; the successful negotiation, execution, performance and completion of pending and existing contracts; the ability to generate internal growth; the effect of natural gas and oil prices on Quanta's operations and growth opportunities; the ability to effectively compete for new projects and market share; the failure of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, renewable energy initiatives, the recently enacted economic stimulus package or other potential legislative actions to result in increased demand for Quanta's services; cancellation provisions within contracts and the risk that contracts are not renewed or are replaced on less favorable terms; the inability of customers to pay for services; the failure to recover on payment claims against project owners or to obtain adequate compensation for customer-requested change orders; the failure to effectively integrate Price Gregory and its operations or to realize potential synergies, such as cross-selling opportunities, from the acquisition; the ability to attract skilled labor and retain key personnel and qualified employees; potential shortage of skilled employees; estimates and assumptions in determining financial results and backlog; the ability to realize backlog; the ability to successfully identify, complete and integrate acquisitions; the potential adverse impact resulting from uncertainty surrounding acquisitions, including the ability to retain key personnel from the acquired businesses and the potential increase in risks already existing in Quanta's operations; the adverse impact of goodwill or other intangible asset impairments; growth outpacing infrastructure; unexpected costs or liabilities that may arise from lawsuits or indemnity claims related to the services Quanta performs; liabilities for claims that are self-insured; risks associated with the implementation of an information technology solution; potential liabilities relating to occupational health and safety matters; the potential that participation in joint ventures exposes us to liability and/or harm to our reputation for failures of our partners; risks associated with operating in international markets; risks associated with our dependence on suppliers, subcontractors and equipment manufacturers; risks associated with Quanta's fiber optic licensing business, including regulatory changes and the potential inability to realize a return on capital investments; beliefs and assumptions about the collectability of receivables; the cost of borrowing, availability of credit, fluctuations in the price and volume of Quanta's common stock, debt covenant compliance, interest rate fluctuations and other factors affecting financing and investment activities; the ability to obtain performance bonds; the impact of a unionized workforce on operations and the ability to complete future acquisitions; the ability to continue to meet the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002; potential exposure to environmental liabilities; requirements relating to governmental regulation and changes thereto; rapid technological and structural changes that could reduce the demand for services; the ability to access sufficient funding to finance desired growth and operations; the potential conversion of Quanta's outstanding convertible subordinated notes; provisions of our corporate governing documents could make an acquisition of our company more difficult; and other risks detailed in Quanta's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008, Quanta's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for each of the quarters in 2009, and any other documents that Quanta files with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Should one or more of these risks materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which are current only as of this date. Quanta does not undertake and expressly disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. For a discussion of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, investors are urged to refer to Quanta's documents filed with the SEC that are available through the company's Web site at www.quantaservices.com or through the SEC's Electronic Data Gathering and Analysis Retrieval System (EDGAR) at .

The non-GAAP measures in this press release are provided to enable investors to evaluate quarterly performance excluding the effects of items that management believes impact the comparability of operating results between periods. More particularly, in addition to the adjustments in the third quarter of 2009 relating to certain tax benefits described in Note (2) above and acquisition costs, (i) amortization of intangible assets is impacted by Quanta's acquisition activity, which can cause the amortization expense to vary period-to-period; (ii) non-cash interest expense results from the requirements of FSP APB 14-1 (FASB ASC 470-20) (see Note (a) to the Consolidated Statements of Operations) and varies from period-to-period depending on the amount of the convertible subordinated notes outstanding during the period, and (iii) non-cash compensation expense may vary due to acquisition activity and factors influencing the estimated fair value of performance-based awards.
