     On April 12, 2010, Quanta Services, Inc. ("Quanta") issued a notice of redemption to redeem all of its outstanding 3.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2026 (the "Notes"), which were issued pursuant to an Indenture dated as of May 3, 2006 (the "Indenture") between Quanta and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee. The aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes is $143.75 million. The Notes will be redeemed on May 14, 2010 (the "Redemption Date") at a redemption price of 101.607% of the principal amount of the Notes (the "Redemption Price"), plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the Redemption Date.
     Pursuant to the terms of the Indenture and instead of receiving the Redemption Price, each of the holders of the Notes have the right, at its option, to convert all or a portion of the principal amount of the Notes into shares of Quanta's common stock ("Common Stock") at a conversion rate of 44.6229 shares of Common Stock for each $1,000 principal amount of Notes converted, which is equivalent to a conversion price of $22.41 per share. If a holder of the Notes elects to exercise this option, the holder must deliver a conversion notice to the trustee before 5:00 pm CDT on May 12, 2010. In accordance with the terms of the Indenture, Quanta has elected to satisfy the amount due to a holder upon conversion in cash up to the amount of $1,000 per $1,000 principal amount of the Notes converted with the remaining amount due, if any, satisfied in Common Stock. The aggregate Redemption Price, plus accrued and unpaid interest, and the applicable cash portion of any conversion obligation will be paid by Quanta using cash on hand.
     Quanta expects to recognize a loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately $2.4 million to $4.4 million, net of tax, in connection with the redemption or conversion, as applicable, of all of the outstanding Notes. This amount includes a write-off of deferred financing costs associated with the Notes of approximately $1.1 million, net of tax, and an estimated charge related to the extinguishment of the interest-bearing component of the Notes. The actual amount of this charge will be determined based on the difference between (i) the calculated fair market value of the interest-bearing component of the Notes on the redemption date and (ii) the net carrying value of the interest-bearing component of the Notes on the redemption date. At March 31, 2010, the Notes had a net carrying value of approximately $128.0 million, which is derived from the aggregate principal amount of the Notes of $143.75 million less a net unamortized debt discount of approximately $16.0 million. Upon redemption or conversion, as applicable, of all of the outstanding Notes, the net remaining debt discount will be reclassified into the Company's additional paid-in capital account.
     Prospectively, the redemption or conversion, as applicable, of all of the outstanding Notes is expected to result in the elimination of approximately $6.5 million in aggregate annual cash and non-cash interest expense, net of tax. Because some or all of the Notes may be converted following the notice of redemption, Quanta cannot determine the principal amount of the Notes that will be redeemed for cash or, to the extent any of the Notes are converted, the amount of cash that may be paid or the number of shares that may be issued upon conversion of the Notes. As a result, Quanta cannot determine at this time the impact of the redemption or conversion of the Notes on its diluted share count or diluted earnings per share.
     On April 12, 2010, Quanta issued a press release announcing its issuance of the notice of redemption of the Notes. A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein by reference.

Exhibit 99.1
PRESS RELEASE
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
10-04
Quanta Services, Inc. (NYSE: PWR) today announced that it has notified the registered holders of its 3.75 percent convertible subordinated notes due 2026 that it will redeem all of the notes outstanding on May 14, 2010. The notes will be redeemed at a price equal to 101.607 percent of the principal amount of the notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the redemption date. The notes were originally issued May 3, 2006, in the aggregate principal amount of $143.75 million, all of which notes remain outstanding. Payment of the redemption price will be made by Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as paying agent, upon presentation and surrender of the notes on or after the redemption date by hand or by mail at the address for the paying agent set forth in the redemption notice.
HOUSTON  April 12, 2010 
Instead of receiving the cash redemption price, each holder of the 3.75 percent convertible subordinated notes has the right, at its option, to convert the principal amount of the notes or any portion of such principal amount which is a multiple of $1,000 into Quanta's common stock at a conversion rate of 44.6229 shares of common stock for each $1,000 principal amount of notes converted. The conversion rate is equivalent to a price of $22.41 per share. Quanta has elected to satisfy the amount due to the holder upon conversion of a note in cash up to the amount of $1,000 per $1,000 principal amount of each note with the remaining amount due, if any, paid in common stock. The holders may deliver a conversion notice to Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as conversion agent, at any time before 5:00 p.m. CDT on May 12, 2010.
Quanta will pay cash to the holders in lieu of the delivery of any fractional shares of common stock issuable upon conversion. Upon conversion of a note, accrued and unpaid interest on the note will be deemed to be paid in full to the holder through delivery of the common stock and the holder will not receive any interest on the note, unless the conversion occurs after 5:00 p.m. CDT on April 15, 2010 (the Regular Record Date) and prior to 5:00 p.m. CDT on April 29, 2010. The holder of a note at 5:00 p.m. CDT on April 15, 2010 will receive payment of the interest payable on April 30, 2010 notwithstanding the conversion of the note at any time after 5:00 p.m. CDT April 15, 2010, but any note
 
surrendered for conversion by a holder after 5:00 p.m. CDT on April 15, 2010 and prior to 5:00 p.m. CDT on April 29, 2010 must be accompanied by payment of an amount equal to the interest payment that is due on the note on April 30, 2010.
