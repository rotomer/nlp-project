Exchangeable Shares
Special Voting Share
     The number of Quanta Shares and Exchangeable Shares included in the Stock Consideration is determined using a fixed price of $19.5275 per share of Quanta common stock, converted to Canadian dollars using an agreed exchange rate of 1.0263 Canadian dollars for each U.S. dollar. The Exchangeable Shares are not transferable without Quanta's consent, and the Quanta Shares, the Exchangeable Shares and any shares of Quanta common stock issued upon the exchange of the Exchangeable Shares are subject to a contractual lock-up of one year from the date of closing for 100% of all such shares and two years from the date of closing for 50% of all such shares. The Quanta Shares, the Exchangeable Shares and the shares of Quanta common stock issuable upon exchange of the Exchangeable Shares will not be registered for resale and, therefore, will be subject to the rights and restrictions of Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
     The Exchangeable Shares issued by Exchangeco have no rights with respect to Exchangeco, other than the right to exchange into shares of Quanta common stock. This right requires Exchangeco to redeem Exchangeable Shares upon the request of the holder for a redemption price equal to one share of Quanta common stock for each Exchangeable Share redeemed, plus any unpaid dividends. The Shareholders receiving the Exchangeable Shares will

     The representations and warranties that the parties made to each other in the Purchase Agreement are as of specific dates. Except for its status as a contractual document that establishes and governs the legal relations among the parties to the Purchase Agreement, the Purchase Agreement is not intended to be a source of factual, business or operational information about any of the parties thereto. The representations and warranties contained in the Purchase Agreement were made only for purposes of such Purchase Agreement, are solely for the benefit of the parties to such Purchase Agreement, and may be subject to limitations agreed between those parties, including being qualified by disclosures between those parties.
     The representations and warranties in the Purchase Agreement may have been made to allocate risks among the parties thereto, including where the parties do not have complete knowledge of all facts, instead of establishing matters as facts. Furthermore, those representations and warranties may be subject to standards of materiality applicable to the contracting parties that differ from those applicable to investors. Accordingly, investors and securityholders should not rely on such representations and warranties as characterizations of the actual state of facts or circumstances. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of such representations and warranties may change after the date of the Purchase Agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in Quanta's public disclosures.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF
 
The Class A Non-Voting Exchangeable common shares of the Corporation shall have attached thereto, as a class, the following rights, privileges, restrictions, and conditions:
1.1 For the purposes of these Share Provisions:
 
 
 
 
 
2.1 The Exchangeable Shares shall not be entitled to a preference over the Common Shares.
3.1 The Board of Directors shall, subject to applicable law, on each Quanta Dividend Declaration Date, declare a dividend on each Exchangeable Share as follows:
          Such dividends shall be paid out of money, assets or property of the Corporation properly applicable to the payment of dividends, or out of authorized but unissued Exchangeable Shares of the Corporation, as applicable.
3.2 Cheques of the Corporation payable at par at any branch of the bankers of the Corporation shall be issued in respect of any cash dividends contemplated by Section 3.1(a) hereof and the sending of such a cheque to each holder of an Exchangeable Share shall satisfy the cash dividend represented thereby unless the cheque is not paid on presentation. Certificates registered in the name of the registered holder of Exchangeable Shares shall be issued or transferred in respect of any stock dividends contemplated by Section 3.1(b) hereof and the sending of such a certificate to each holder of an Exchangeable Share shall satisfy the stock dividend represented thereby. Such other type and amount of property in respect of any dividends contemplated by Section 3.1(c) hereof shall be issued, distributed or transferred by the Corporation in such manner as it shall determine and the issuance, distribution or transfer thereof by the Corporation to each holder of an Exchangeable Share
 
shall satisfy the dividend represented thereby. No holder of an Exchangeable Share shall be entitled to recover by action or other legal process against the Corporation any dividend that is represented by a cheque that has not been duly presented to the Corporation's bankers for payment or that otherwise remains unclaimed for a period of six years from the date on which such dividend was payable.
3.3 The record date for the determination of the holders of Exchangeable Shares entitled to receive payment of, and the payment date for, any dividend declared on the Exchangeable Shares under Section 3.1 hereof shall be the same dates as the record date and payment date, respectively, for the corresponding dividend declared on the Quanta Shares.
3.4 If on any payment date for any dividends declared on the Exchangeable Shares under Section 3.1 hereof the dividends are not paid in full on all of the Exchangeable Shares then outstanding, any such dividends that remain unpaid shall be paid on a subsequent date or dates determined by the Board of Directors on which the Corporation shall have sufficient moneys, assets or property properly applicable to the payment of such dividends.

Income Tax Act
Income Tax Act
4.1 In the event of a Liquidation Distribution, subject to the exercise by Callco of the Liquidation Call Right and to the terms and conditions of this Section 4, a holder of Exchangeable Shares shall be entitled, subject to applicable law, to receive from the assets of the Corporation in respect of each Exchangeable Share held by such holder on the effective date (the "") of the Liquidation Distribution, an amount per Exchangeable Share (the "") equal to (i) the Current Market Price of a Quanta Share on the last Business Day prior to the Liquidation Date (which amount shall be satisfied in full by the Corporation causing to be delivered to such holder one Quanta Share for each Exchangeable Share presented and surrendered by the holder), plus (ii) the Unpaid Dividend Amount, if any, on any Exchangeable Share held by such holder. For greater certainty, the Liquidation Price for each such Exchangeable Share held by such holder on the Liquidation Date may be satisfied only by the Corporation causing the issuance and delivery to such holder of one Quanta Share and a cheque for the balance, if any, of the Liquidation Price without interest, less any amounts withheld on account of tax required to be deducted and withheld therefrom.
Liquidation Date
Liquidation Price
4.2 The Corporation shall notify the holders of the Exchangeable Shares (by way of notice to the Transfer Agent, if any) and Callco of any proposed liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Corporation, at least 30 days before the Liquidation Date in the case of a voluntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Corporation, and promptly upon
 
receiving notice of or becoming aware of any claim, suit, petition or other proceeding with respect to an involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Corporation.
4.3 On or promptly after the Liquidation Date and provided that the Liquidation Call Right has not been exercised by Callco, the Corporation shall cause to be delivered to the holders of the Exchangeable Shares the Liquidation Price for each such Exchangeable Share upon presentation and surrender at the registered office of the Corporation (or at any office of the Transfer Agent as may be specified by the Corporation by notice to the holders of the Exchangeable Shares) of the certificates representing such Exchangeable Shares, free and clear of all liens, claims and encumbrances, together with such other documents and instruments as may be required to effect a transfer of Exchangeable Shares under the Act and the articles of the Corporation and such additional documents and instruments as the Corporation, Transfer Agent, Quanta or Callco may reasonably require, at the registered office of the Corporation (or at any office of the Transfer Agent as may be specified by the Corporation by notice to the holders of the Exchangeable Shares). Payment of the total Liquidation Price for such Exchangeable Shares shall be made by delivery to each holder, at the address of the holder recorded in the securities register of the Corporation for the Exchangeable Shares or by holding for pick-up by the holder at the registered office of the Corporation or at any office of the Transfer Agent as may be specified by the Corporation by notice to the holders of Exchangeable Shares, on behalf of the Corporation of certificates representing Quanta Shares (which shares shall be duly issued as fully paid and non-assessable and shall be free and clear of all liens, claims and encumbrances) together with an undertaking to make payment in respect of the Unpaid Dividend Amount on the date on which such dividends would have been paid if the Liquidation Distribution had not been made (in each case less any amounts withheld on account of tax required to be deducted and withheld therefrom). On and after the Liquidation Date, the holders of the Exchangeable Shares shall cease to be holders of such Exchangeable Shares and shall not be entitled to exercise any of the rights of holders in respect thereof, other than the right to receive their proportionate part of the total Liquidation Price, unless no deposit has been made as described below and payment of the total Liquidation Price for such Exchangeable Shares shall not be made upon presentation and surrender of share certificates in accordance with the foregoing provisions, in which case the rights of the holders shall remain unaffected until the total Liquidation Price has been paid in the manner hereinbefore provided. The Corporation shall have the right at any time to deposit or cause to be deposited the total Liquidation Price, or the portion of the total Liquidation Price for such Exchangeable Shares represented by certificates that have not at the Liquidation Date been surrendered by the holders thereof in connection therewith, in a custodial account with any chartered bank or trust company in Canada less any amounts withheld on account of tax required to be deducted and withheld therefrom. Upon the later of such deposit being made and the Liquidation Date, the rights of the holders of Exchangeable Shares shall be limited to receiving their proportionate part of the total Liquidation Price (in each case less such amounts withheld on account of tax required to be deducted and withheld therefrom) for such Exchangeable Shares, against presentation and surrender of the said certificates held by them, respectively, in accordance with the foregoing provisions. Upon such payment or deposit of the total Liquidation Price, the holders of the Exchangeable Shares shall thereafter be considered and deemed for all purposes to be holders of the Quanta Shares delivered to them or any custodian on their behalf.
 
4.4 After the Corporation has satisfied its obligations to pay the Liquidation Price per Exchangeable Share, the holders of the Exchangeable Shares shall not be entitled to share in any further distribution of the assets of the Corporation.
5.1 A holder of Exchangeable Shares shall be entitled at any time but not more than once in any calendar quarter, subject to the exercise by Callco of the Retraction Call Right and to the terms and conditions of this Section 5, to require the Corporation to redeem any or all of the Exchangeable Shares registered in the name of such holder for an amount per Exchangeable Share (the "") equal to (i) the Current Market Price of a Quanta Share on the last Business Day prior to the Retraction Date (which amount shall be satisfied in full by the Corporation causing to be delivered to such holder one Quanta Share for each Exchangeable Share presented and surrendered by the holder), plus (ii) the Unpaid Dividend Amount, if any, on any such Exchangeable Share held by such holder, provided that the minimum number of Exchangeable Shares to be redeemed at any time shall be the lesser of (A) 50,000 Exchangeable Shares and (B) the number of Exchangeable Shares registered in the name of such holder on the date of the Retraction Request. For greater certainty, the Retraction Price for each such Exchangeable Share held by such holder on the Retraction Date may be satisfied only by the Corporation causing the issuance and delivery to such holder of one Quanta Share and a cheque for the balance, if any, of the Retraction Price without interest, less any amounts withheld on account of tax required to be deducted and withheld therefrom. To effect such redemption, the holder shall present and surrender at the registered office of the Corporation (or at any office of the Transfer Agent as may be specified by the Corporation by notice to the holders of Exchangeable Shares) the certificate or certificates representing the Exchangeable Shares which the holder desires to have the Corporation redeem, free and clear of all liens, claims and encumbrances, together with such other documents and instruments as may be required to effect a transfer of Exchangeable Shares under the Act and the articles of the Corporation and such additional documents and instruments as the Corporation, the Transfer Agent, or Quanta may reasonably require, and together with a duly executed retraction request (the "") in the form attached hereto as Appendix 1, or in such other form as may be acceptable to the Corporation:
Retraction Price
Retraction Request
 
5.2 Subject to the exercise by Callco of the Retraction Call Right, upon receipt by the Corporation or the Transfer Agent in the manner specified in Section 5.1 hereof of a certificate or certificates representing the number of Exchangeable Shares which the holder desires to have the Corporation redeem and a Retraction Request, and provided that the Retraction Request is not revoked by the holder in the manner specified in Section 5.7 hereof, the Corporation shall redeem the Retracted Shares effective at the close of business (Vancouver time) on the Retraction Date and shall cause to be delivered to such holder the total Retraction Price with respect to such shares, together with an undertaking to make payment in respect of the Unpaid Dividend Amount on the date on which such dividends would have been paid if the Retraction Request had not been made (in each case less any amounts withheld on account of tax required to be deducted and withheld therefrom). If only a part of the Exchangeable Shares represented by any certificate is redeemed, a new certificate for the balance of such Exchangeable Shares shall be issued to the holder at the expense of the Corporation.
5.3 Upon receipt by the Corporation of a Retraction Request, the Corporation shall immediately provide notice thereof to Callco. In order to exercise the Retraction Call Right, Callco must notify the Corporation of its determination to do so (the "") within five Business Days of notification to Callco by the Corporation of the receipt by the Corporation of the Retraction Request. If Callco does not so notify the Corporation within such five Business Day period, the Corporation will notify the holder as soon as possible thereafter that Callco will not exercise the Retraction Call Right. If Callco delivers the Callco Call Notice within such five Business Day period, and provided that the Retraction Request is not revoked by the holder in the manner specified in Section 5.7, the Retraction Request shall thereupon be deemed to be an offer by the holder to sell the Retracted Shares to Callco in accordance with the Retraction Call Right. In such event, the Corporation shall not redeem the Retracted Shares and Callco shall purchase from such holder and such holder shall sell to Callco on the Retraction Date the Retracted Shares, free and clear of all liens, claims and encumbrances, for an amount per Retracted Share (the "") equal to the Retraction Price. For the purposes of completing a purchase pursuant to the Retraction Call Right, Callco shall deposit with the Transfer Agent, on or before the Retraction Date, certificates representing Quanta Shares and a cheque or cheques of Callco payable at par at any branch of the bankers of Callco representing the Unpaid Dividend Amount, if any, less any amounts withheld on account of tax required to be deducted and withheld therefrom. The closing of the purchase and sale of the Retracted Shares pursuant to the Retraction Call Right shall be deemed to have occurred as at the close of business on the Retraction Date and, for greater certainty, no redemption by the Corporation of such Retracted Shares shall take place on the Retraction Date. In the
Callco Call Notice
Retraction Call Purchase Price
 
event that Callco does not deliver a Callco Call Notice within such five (5) Business Day period, and provided that the Retraction Request is not revoked by the holder in the manner specified in Section 5.7 hereof, the Corporation shall redeem the Retracted Shares on the Retraction Date and in the manner otherwise contemplated in this Section 5. As a condition to such purchase, the holder shall deliver such other documents and instruments as may be required to effect a transfer of Exchangeable Shares under the Act and the articles of the Corporation and such additional documents and instruments as the Corporation, the Transfer Agent, or Quanta may reasonably require, at the registered office of the Corporation or Quanta (or at any office of the Transfer Agent as may be specified by the Corporation by notice to the holders of the Exchangeable Shares).
5.4 The Corporation or Callco, as the case may be, shall deliver, or cause the Transfer Agent to deliver, to the relevant holder of the Retracted Shares, at the address of the holder recorded in the securities register of the Corporation for the Exchangeable Shares or at the address specified in the holder's Retraction Request or by holding for pick-up by the holder at the registered office of the Corporation (or at any office of the Transfer Agent as may be specified by the Corporation by notice to the holders of Exchangeable Shares), certificates representing the Quanta Shares (which shares shall be duly issued as fully paid and non-assessable and shall be free and clear of all liens, claims and encumbrances) registered in the name of the holder or in such other name as the holder may request, and, if applicable, an undertaking to make payment in respect of the Unpaid Dividend Amount on the date on which such dividends would have been paid if the Retraction Request had not been made, in payment of the total Retraction Price or the total Retraction Call Purchase Price, as the case may be, in each case less any amounts withheld on account of tax required to be deducted and withheld therefrom, and such deliveries by or on behalf of the Corporation or Callco, as the case may be, or by the Transfer Agent shall be deemed to be payment of and shall satisfy and discharge all liability for the total Retraction Price or the total Retraction Call Purchase Price, as the case may be.
5.5 On and after the Retraction Date, the holder of the Retracted Shares shall cease to be a holder of such Retracted Shares and shall not be entitled to exercise any of the rights of a holder in respect thereof, other than the right to receive his proportionate part of the total Retraction Price or the total Retraction Call Purchase Price, as the case may be, unless upon presentation and surrender of certificates in accordance with the foregoing provisions, payment of the total Retraction Price or the total Retraction Call Purchase Price, as the case may be, shall not be made as provided in Section 5.4, in which case the rights of such holder shall remain unaffected until the total Retraction Price or the total Retraction Call Purchase Price, as the case may be, has been paid in the manner hereinbefore provided. On and after the Retraction Date, provided that presentation and surrender of certificates and payment of the total Retraction Price or the total Retraction Call Purchase Price, as the case may be, has been made in accordance with the foregoing provisions, the holder of the Retracted Shares so redeemed by the Corporation or purchased by Callco shall thereafter be considered and deemed for all purposes to be a holder of the Quanta Shares so delivered.
5.6 Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 5, the Corporation shall not be obligated to redeem Retracted Shares specified by a holder in a Retraction Request to the extent that such redemption of Retracted Shares would be contrary to applicable law,
 
including solvency requirements. If the Corporation believes that on any Retraction Date it would not be permitted for such reason to redeem the Retracted Shares tendered for redemption on such date, and provided that Callco shall not have exercised the Retraction Call Right with respect to the Retracted Shares, the Corporation shall only be obligated to redeem Retracted Shares specified by a holder in a Retraction Request to the extent of the maximum number that may be so redeemed (rounded down to a whole number of shares) as would not be contrary to applicable law and shall notify the holder at least two Business Days prior to the Retraction Date as to the number of Retracted Shares which will not be redeemed by the Corporation. In any case in which the redemption by the Corporation of Retracted Shares would be contrary to applicable law, the Corporation shall redeem Retracted Shares in accordance with Section 5.2 of these Share Provisions on a basis and shall issue to each holder of Retracted Shares a new certificate, at the expense of the Corporation, representing the Retracted Shares not redeemed by the Corporation pursuant to Section 5.2 hereof. Provided that the Retraction Request is not revoked by the holder in the manner specified in Section 5.7 hereof, and provided that Callco shall not have exercised the Retraction Call Right with respect to the Retracted Shares, the holder of any such Retracted Shares not redeemed by the Corporation pursuant to Section 5.2 hereof as a result of applicable law shall be deemed by giving the Retraction Request to require Quanta to purchase such Retracted Shares from such holder on the Retraction Date or as soon as practicable thereafter on payment by Quanta to such holder of the Retraction Call Purchase Price for such Retracted Share, all as more specifically provided in the Voting and Exchange Rights Agreement (the "").
pro rata
Exchange Right
5.7 A holder of Retracted Shares may withdraw the Retraction Request by notice in writing given by the holder to the Corporation before the close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding the Retraction Date, in which event such Retraction Request shall be null and void and, for greater certainty, the revocable offer constituted by the Retraction Request to sell the Retracted Shares to the Corporation or Callco, as the case may be, shall be deemed to have been revoked.
5.8 Callco shall at any time be entitled to assign all of its rights in this Section 5 to Quanta or an Affiliate of Quanta provided that such company assumes all of Callco's obligations under this Section.
6.1 Subject to applicable law and to the terms and conditions of this Section 6, and provided Callco has not exercised the Redemption Call Right, the Corporation shall on the Redemption Date redeem all but not less than all of the then outstanding Exchangeable Shares for an amount per Exchangeable Share (the "") equal to (i) the Current Market Price of a Quanta Share on the last Business Day prior to the Redemption Date (which amount shall be satisfied in full by the Corporation causing to be delivered to each holder of Exchangeable Shares one Quanta Share for each Exchangeable Share presented and surrendered by the holder), plus (ii) the Unpaid Dividend Amount, if any, on each such Exchangeable Share held by such holder. For greater certainty, the Redemption Price for each such Exchangeable Share held by such holder on the Redemption Date may be
Redemption Price
 
satisfied only by the Corporation causing the issuance and delivery to such holder of one Quanta Share and a cheque for the balance, if any, of the Redemption Price without interest, less any amounts withheld on account of tax required to be deducted and withheld therefrom.
6.2 In any case of a redemption of Exchangeable Shares under this Section 6, the Corporation shall send or cause to be sent to each holder of Exchangeable Shares a notice in writing of the redemption by the Corporation or the purchase by Callco under the Redemption Call Right, as the case may be, of the Exchangeable Shares held by such holder. In the case of a Redemption Date established in connection with a Quanta Control Transaction, the written notice of redemption by the Corporation or the purchase by Callco under the Redemption Call Right will be sent on or before the Redemption Date on as many days prior written notice as may be determined by the Board of Directors to be reasonably practicable in the circumstances, and in all other cases such notice shall be sent at least 30 days before the Redemption Date. In any such case, such notice shall set out the formula for determining the Redemption Price or the Redemption Call Purchase Price, as the case may be, the Redemption Date and, if applicable, particulars of the Redemption Call Right.
6.3 On or after the Redemption Date and subject to the exercise by Callco of the Redemption Call Right, the Corporation shall cause to be delivered to the holders of the Exchangeable Shares to be redeemed the Redemption Price for each such Exchangeable Share, upon presentation and surrender at the registered office of the Corporation (or at any office of the Transfer Agent as may be specified by the Corporation in such notice) of the certificates representing such Exchangeable Shares, free and clear of all liens, claims and encumbrances, together with such other documents and instruments as may be required to effect a transfer of Exchangeable Shares under the Act and the articles of the Corporation and such additional documents and instruments as the Transfer Agent, the Corporation or Callco may reasonably require. Payment of the total Redemption Price for such Exchangeable Shares shall be made on behalf of the Corporation by delivery to each holder, at the address of the holder recorded in the securities register of the Corporation or by holding for pick-up by the holder at the registered office of the Corporation (or at any office of the Transfer Agent as may be specified by the Corporation in such notice), of certificates representing Quanta Shares (which shares shall be duly issued as fully paid and non-assessable and shall be free and clear of all liens, claims and encumbrances) and, if applicable, an undertaking to make payment in respect of the Unpaid Dividend Amount on the date on which such dividends would have been paid if the redemption had not been made, in each case less any amounts withheld on account of tax required to be deducted and withheld therefrom. On and after the Redemption Date, the holders of the Exchangeable Shares called for redemption shall cease to be holders of such Exchangeable Shares and shall not be entitled to exercise any of the rights of holders in respect thereof, other than the right to receive their proportionate part of the total Redemption Price, unless no deposit has been made as described below and payment of the total Redemption Price for such Exchangeable Shares shall not be made upon presentation and surrender of certificates in accordance with the foregoing provisions, in which case the rights of the holders shall remain unaffected until the total Redemption Price has been paid in the manner hereinbefore provided. The Corporation shall have the right at any time after the sending of notice of its intention to redeem the Exchangeable Shares as aforesaid to deposit or cause to be deposited the total Redemption Price for the Exchangeable Shares so called for redemption, or of such of the said
 
Exchangeable Shares represented by certificates that have not at the date of such deposit been surrendered by the holders thereof in connection with such redemption, in a custodial account with any chartered bank or trustee named in such notice, less any amounts withheld on account of tax required to be deducted and withheld therefrom. Upon the later of such deposit being made and the Redemption Date, the Exchangeable Shares in respect whereof such deposit shall have been made shall be deemed to have been redeemed and the rights of the holders thereof after such deposit or Redemption Date, as the case may be, shall be limited to receiving their proportionate part of the total Redemption Price for such Exchangeable Shares, against presentation and surrender of the said certificates held by them, respectively, in accordance with the foregoing provisions. Upon such payment or deposit of the total Redemption, less any amounts withheld on account of tax required to be deducted and withheld therefrom, the holders of the Exchangeable Shares shall thereafter be considered and deemed for all purposes to be holders of the Quanta Shares delivered to them or the custodian on their behalf.

Callco Redemption Call Right
 
 
8.1 Subject to applicable law and the articles of the Corporation, the Corporation may at any time and from time to time offer to purchase for cancellation all or any part of the outstanding Exchangeable Shares by tender to all the holders of record (other than Quanta, Callco or the Corporation) of Exchangeable Shares then outstanding of an amount per Exchangeable Share equal to (i) the Current Market Price of a Quanta Share on the last Business Day prior to the date fixed for such purchase (which amount may be satisfied in full by the Corporation causing to be delivered to such holder one Quanta Share for each Exchangeable Share presented and surrendered by the holder), plus (ii) the Unpaid Dividend Amount, if any, on any Exchangeable Share held by such holder. If in response to an invitation for tender under the provisions of this Section 8, more Exchangeable Shares are tendered at a price or prices acceptable to the Corporation than the Corporation is prepared to purchase, the Exchangeable Shares to be purchased by the Corporation shall be purchased as nearly as may be pro rata according to the number of shares tendered by each holder who submits a tender to the Corporation. The holders of Exchangeable Shares desiring to sell hereunder shall surrender to the Transfer Agent a certificate or certificates representing Exchangeable Shares, free and clear of all liens, claims and encumbrances, together with such other documents and instruments as may be required to effect a transfer of Exchangeable Shares under the Act and the articles of the Corporation and such additional documents and instruments as the Transfer Agent, the Corporation or Quanta may reasonably require. If only part of the Exchangeable Shares represented by any certificate shall be purchased, a new certificate for the balance of such shares shall be issued at the expense of the Corporation. All payments to be made under this Section 8 may be subject to withholdings on account of tax required to be deducted and withheld therefrom.
8.2 The Corporation shall at any time be entitled to assign all of its rights in this Section 8 to Quanta or an Affiliate of Quanta provided that such company assumes all of the Corporation's obligations under this Section.

11.1 The Corporation will take all such actions and do all such things as shall be reasonably necessary or advisable to perform and comply with and to ensure performance and compliance by Quanta, Callco and the Corporation with all provisions of the Support Agreement, Voting and Exchange Rights Agreement and the Share Provisions applicable to Quanta, Callco, the Corporation and the holders of the Exchangeable Shares in accordance with the terms thereof including taking all such actions and doing all such things as shall be reasonably necessary or advisable to enforce, to the fullest extent possible for the direct benefit of the Corporation and the holders of the Exchangeable Shares, all rights and benefits in favour of the Corporation and the holders of the Exchangeable Shares under or pursuant to such agreement.
11.2 The Corporation shall not propose, agree to or otherwise give effect to any amendment to, or waiver or forgiveness of, its rights or obligations under, the Support Agreement or Voting and Exchange Rights Agreement without the approval of the holders of the Exchangeable Shares given in accordance with Section 10.2 of these Share Provisions, other than such amendments, waivers and/or forgiveness as may be necessary or advisable for the purposes of:

12.3 Notwithstanding any other provision set forth herein, no Quanta Shares shall be issued to the holders of Exchangeable Shares hereunder unless the Corporation or Quanta has determined in its sole discretion (after receiving such necessary representations and warranties from such holders of Exchangeable Shares), at its sole cost and in a timely manner so as not to prejudice any rights of the holders of Exchangeable Shares hereunder, that the issuance of Quanta Shares as contemplated herein would comply with applicable securities laws and no registration is required under the securities laws of the United States or of Canada.
12.4 Neither the Exchangeable Shares nor any interest therein shall be transferable except upon the prior written consent of the Corporation, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. Any purported transfer in violation of this section shall be null and void.
 
12.5 No fractional Quanta Shares shall be issued pursuant to these share provisions, and each holder of Exchangeable Shares shall be entitled to receive the nearest whole share of Quanta Shares rounded upwards.

Exhibit 99.1
 Quanta Services, Inc. (NYSE: PWR) today announced that on Oct. 22, 2010, it signed a definitive agreement to acquire Valard Construction, one of Canada's largest electric power line contractors. The transaction, which is expected to close today, is valued at approximately US$219 million, which is inclusive of any debt repaid at closing. The acquisition strategically expands Quanta's Canadian service offering and provides Valard's diverse customer base with access to Quanta's extensive energy infrastructure resources.
HOUSTON  Oct. 25, 2010
The purchase price for Valard will be paid through a combination of cash, Quanta common shares and exchangeable shares of a Canadian subsidiary of Quanta Services that are substantially equivalent to, and exchangeable on, a one-for-one basis for Quanta Services common shares. In connection with the acquisition, the stockholders of Valard will receive approximately $118.9 million in cash and an aggregate of approximately 4.5 million in common and exchangeable shares.
"Canada, as the world's second largest exporter of electricity, presents significant emerging and long-term opportunities to expand and upgrade the electric transmission infrastructure," said John R. Colson, chairman and CEO of Quanta Services. "We expect Valard's revenue to be between $225 million and $250 million in 2011 and the transaction to be accretive to EPS in 2011 and beyond."
Valard, based out of Edmonton, Alberta, will operate as a platform operating unit of Quanta, with Victor Budzinski as CEO and Adam Budzinski as president. Valard's workforce of more than 700 employees delivers full engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) services and turnkey solutions to the Canadian power industry. In addition to high-voltage transmission lines, Valard builds distribution infrastructure, provides EPC services for substations and installs fiber optic systems.
"For more than 30 years, Valard has been safely building and maintaining electric power infrastructure across some of Canada's most challenging, rugged terrain, often in arctic conditions," Colson continued. "The expertise of their team is a welcome addition to our company and upholds our commitment to deliver value to our stockholders, our customers and our employees."
"As part of the Quanta team, we believe Valard will be able to deliver additional services through access to a much larger workforce and vast equipment resources," said Adam Budzinski, president of Valard. "It is a logical combination of resources that builds upon our strong foundation of safety, value and efficiency to meet the evolving needs of our customers."
