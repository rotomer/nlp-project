     (b) and (c) On March 24, 2011, John R. Colson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Quanta Services Inc. (the "Company"), advised the Board of Directors (the "Board") that he will serve in the role of Executive Chairman of the Board, effective upon election by the stockholders as a director at the upcoming annual meeting of stockholders, currently scheduled for May 19, 2011. After that time, Mr. Colson will no longer serve as the Company's chief executive officer.
     The Board has determined that James F. O'Neil III, the Company's current President and Chief Operating Officer, will be appointed as Chief Executive Officer of the Company to succeed Mr. Colson, effective May 19, 2011 following the upcoming annual meeting of stockholders. Mr. O'Neil will continue to hold the position of President. Mr. O'Neil, 52, has served as the Company's President and Chief Operating Officer since October 2008, as Senior Vice President of Operations Integration and Audit from December 2002 until October 2008, and as Vice President of Operations Integration from August 1999 until December 2002. Mr. O'Neil holds a Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering degree.
     There are no arrangements or understandings between Mr. Colson or Mr. O'Neil and any other person pursuant to which they were selected as officers. Neither Mr. Colson nor Mr. O'Neil has any family relationship with any director, executive officer, or person nominated or chosen by the Company to become a director or executive officer. There are no transactions in which Mr. Colson or Mr. O'Neil has an interest requiring disclosure under Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K.
     The information set forth under (e) below is hereby incorporated herein by reference.
     (e) In connection with their new roles and responsibilities, the Company entered into new Employment Agreements dated March 24, 2011 (each, an "Agreement") with each of Messrs. Colson and O'Neil. These Agreements will be effective as of May 19, 2011, following the upcoming annual meeting of stockholders, and will supersede existing employment agreements between the Company and Messrs. Colson and O'Neil.
     Each Agreement has an initial term of two years that will subsequently renew automatically for a one-year term unless the Company or the executive provides at least six months prior written notice of non-renewal. Pursuant to the Agreements, Mr. Colson will receive an annual base salary of $874,100, and Mr. O'Neil will receive an annual base salary of $750,000, subject in each case to review by the Board on no less than an annual basis. In connection with Mr. O'Neil's promotion, the Compensation Committee of the Board authorized a restricted stock award to be granted to Mr. O'Neil on May 19, 2011, consisting of the number of shares of the Company's common stock having a fair market value as of the close of business on such date equal to $250,000.
     Each Agreement generally terminates upon the executive's termination of employment due to (i) death, (ii) disability, (iii) "cause" (as defined in the Agreement), (iv) "good reason" following a "change in control" (each as defined in the Agreement), or (v) circumstances without cause. If the executive's employment is terminated due to disability, the executive will be entitled to a lump-sum payment equal to one year of his annual base salary, subject to execution of a waiver and release agreement. If the executive's employment is terminated without cause (other than within 12 months following a change in control), the executive will be entitled to a lump-sum payment equal to two years of his annual base salary, subject to execution of a waiver and release agreement. If within 12 months following a change in control (as defined in the Agreement), the executive terminates his employment for good reason or his employment is terminated other than for cause, the executive will be entitled to severance benefits equal to (i) a lump-sum payment equal to three times the sum of (x) his annual base salary at the rate then in effect and (y) the higher of (1) the highest annual cash bonus paid (or earned, if not yet paid) to him under the Company's annual incentive plan for the past three fiscal years or (2) his target annual cash bonus payable for the current fiscal year (or if such target bonus has not yet been determined, for the most recently completed fiscal year), and (ii) continued medical, dental and vision benefits for the executive and his dependents for three years after termination. No severance is payable upon the termination of employment due to death, termination with cause, or a voluntary termination by the executive without good reason.
 
     Each Agreement contains customary non-competition covenants restricting the ability of the executive to compete with the Company during the term of his employment and for a period of two years thereafter, prohibiting solicitation of customers and employees for the same period, and prohibiting him from disclosing confidential information and trade secrets. However, if the Company notifies the executive that the Company will not renew the Agreement and the executive remains employed through the end of the employment term, the covenants restricting competition and solicitation of customers and employees apply for a period of one year following the notice of non-renewal.
     The foregoing description of the Agreements is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text thereof, copies of which are filed as Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2 to this report.
     On March 24, 2011, the Company issued a press release announcing that John R. Colson will assume the role of Executive Chairman in May 2011 and that James F.

Section 1.409A-3(i)(5) or pursuant to a fixed schedule or specified date pursuant to 26 C.F.R. Section 1.409A-3(a), and the provisions of this Agreement will be administered, interpreted and construed accordingly. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Employer makes no representation or warranty and shall have no liability to Employee or any other person if any provisions of this Agreement are determined to constitute deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code and do not satisfy an exemption from, or the conditions of, Section 409A of the Code.
     For all purposes of this Agreement, Employee shall be considered to have terminated employment with Employer when Employee incurs a "separation from service" with the Employer Group within the meaning of Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(i) of the Code.
     If the Committee determines that severance payments due under this Agreement on account of termination of Employee's employment constitute "deferred compensation" subject to Section 409A of the Code, and that Employee is a "specified employee" as defined in Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code and 26 C.F.R. Section 1.409A-1(i), then such severance payments shall commence on the first payroll date of the seventh month following the month in which Employee's termination occurs (with the first such payment being a lump sum equal to the aggregate severance payments Employee would have received during the prior six-month period if no such delay had been imposed). For purposes of this Agreement, whether Employee is a "specified employee" will be determined in accordance with the written procedures adopted by the Committee which are incorporated by reference herein.
     All reimbursements and in-kind benefits provided under this Agreement shall be made or provided in accordance with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and the regulations to the extent that such reimbursements or in-kind benefits are not excepted from Section 409A of the Code, including where applicable, the requirement that (i) any reimbursement is for expenses incurred during Employee's lifetime (or during a shorter period of time specified in the Agreement); (ii) the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement during the calendar year may not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement in any other calendar year; (iii) the reimbursement of an eligible expense will be made on or before the last day of the calendar year following the year in which the expense is incurred; and (iv) the right to reimbursement is not subject to set off or liquidation or exchange for any other benefit.
     I. . Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, if Employee has not delivered to Employer an executed Confidential Severance Agreement and Release (the "") on or before the fiftieth (50th) day after the Date of Termination, or if Employee revokes such executed Release prior to the sixtieth (60th) day after the Date of Termination, Employee shall forfeit all of the payments and benefits described in Section IV.F.2 or Section IV.F.4, as applicable; provided, however, that Employee shall not forfeit such amounts if Employer has not delivered to Employee the required form of Release on or before the 25th day following the Date of Termination. A form of Release is attached as hereto. Employee acknowledges that Employer retains the right to modify the required form of the Release as Employer deems necessary in order to effectuate a full and complete release of claims against the Employer Group and its affiliates, officers and directors.

Employee shall make himself available for interviews, depositions and testimony relating to any said Inventions and Developments. These obligations shall survive the termination of Employee's employment with Employer, provided that Employer shall compensate Employee at a reasonable rate after such termination for time actually spent by Employee at Employer's requests on such assistance. In the event Employer is unable for any reason whatsoever to secure Employee's signature to any document reasonably necessary or appropriate for any of the foregoing purposes including, but not limited to, renewals, extensions, continuations, divisions or continuations in part, in a timely manner, Employee irrevocably designates and appoints Employer and its duly authorized officers and agents as his agents and attorneys-in-fact to act for Employee and on his behalf, but only for purposes of executing and filing any such document and doing all other lawfully permitted acts to accomplish the foregoing purposes with the same legal force and effect as if executed by Employee.

               a. . Employee agrees that during the Covenant Period (as defined below), he shall not, without Employer's written consent, directly or indirectly, for himself or on behalf of or in conjunction with any other person, persons, company, partnership, corporation or business venture of any nature:

               e. . Employee acknowledges that the restrictions set forth in Section VI.B.5 of this Agreement are intended to protect the Employer Group's legitimate business interests and its Proprietary and Confidential Information and established relationships and good will. Employee acknowledges that the time, geographic and scope of activity limitations set forth herein are reasonable and necessary to protect the Employer Group's legitimate business interests. However, if in any judicial proceeding, a court shall refuse to enforce this Agreement as written, whether because the time limitation is too long or because the restrictions contained herein are more extensive (whether as to geographic area, scope of activity or otherwise) than is necessary to protect the legitimate business interests of the Employer Group, it is expressly understood and agreed between the parties hereto that this Agreement is deemed modified to the extent necessary to permit this Agreement to be enforced in any such proceedings.
Reasonableness of Restrictions
               f. . Employee acknowledges that (1) in the event of the termination of his employment with Employer (whether voluntary or involuntary), Employee's knowledge, experience and capabilities are such that Employee can obtain employment in business activities which are of a different and non-competing nature than those performed in the course of his employment with Employer or in the geographic areas outside of the Territory and (2) the enforcement of a remedy hereunder including, but not limited to, injunctive relief, will not prevent Employee from earning a reasonable livelihood.
Ability to Obtain Other Employment
               g. . Employee acknowledges that compliance with Section VI.B of this Agreement is necessary to protect the good will and other legitimate business interests of the Employer Group and that a breach of any or all of these provisions will give rise to irreparable and continuing injury to the Employer Group that is not adequately compensable in monetary damages or at law. Accordingly, Employee agrees that Employer, its successors and assigns, may obtain injunctive relief against the breach or threatened breach of any or all of these provisions, in addition to any other legal or equitable remedies which may be available to the Employer Group at law or in equity or under this Agreement. Because Employee further acknowledges that it would be difficult to measure any damages caused to the Employer Group that might result from any breach by Employee of any promises set forth in this Agreement, Employee agrees that Employer shall be entitled to an injunction or other appropriate equitable relief to restrain any such breach without showing or proving any actual damage to the Employer Group, as well as to be relieved of any obligation to provide further payment or benefits to Employee or Employee's dependents.
Injunctive Relief
               h. . If Employee violates and/or breaches this Agreement, Employer shall be entitled to an accounting and repayment of all lost profits, compensation, commissions, remuneration or benefits that Employee directly or indirectly has realized or may realize as a result of any such violation or breach. Employer shall also be entitled to recover for all lost sales, profits, commissions, good will and customers caused by Employee's improper acts, in addition to and not in limitation of any injunctive relief or other
Other Remedies
 
rights or remedies that Employer is or may be entitled to at law or in equity or under this Agreement.
               i. . Employee acknowledges that should it become necessary for Employer to file suit to enforce the provisions contained herein, and any court of competent jurisdiction awards the Employer Group any damages and/or an injunction due to the acts of Employee, then Employer shall be entitled to recover its reasonable costs incurred in conducting the suit including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses.
Costs
               j. . For purposes of this Section VI.B.5, the Covenant Period shall mean the period from and during the Term of this Agreement and ending on the date that is two (2) years after Employee's employment with Employer terminates, whether voluntary or involuntary; provided, however, that if Employer delivers to Employee a Renewal Termination Notice, as provided in Section III.B, and Employee remains employed with Employer through the expiration of the Term (and this Agreement), then the Covenant Period shall end on the date that is one (1) year after the date of such Renewal Termination Notice. For purposes of clarity, in the event that Employee's employment with Employer terminates for any reason, whether voluntary or involuntary, after Employee receives a Renewal Termination Notice and before the end of the Term, the Covenant Period shall end on the date that is two (2) years after the termination of Employee's employment.
Covenant Period
          6. . Employee acknowledges and agrees that both during and after his employment with Employer, whether such termination is voluntary or involuntary, Employee shall not disparage, denigrate or comment negatively upon, either orally or in writing, the Employer Group or any of their respective officers, directors, employees or representatives, to or in the presence of any person or entity unless compelled to act by a valid subpoena or other legal mandate; provided, however, if Employee receives such a valid subpoena or legal mandate, he shall provide Employer with written notice of the same at least five (5) business days prior to the date on which Employee is required to make the disclosure.

For a period of two (2) years after the termination of Employee's employment with Employer, whether voluntary or involuntary, Employee agrees to inform each new employer, prior to accepting employment, of the existence of this Agreement and provide that employer with a copy of this Agreement.
Agreement to Inform Subsequent Employers
               e. . Employee acknowledges that the restrictions set forth in Section VI.B.5 of this Agreement are intended to protect the Employer Group's legitimate business interests and its Proprietary and Confidential Information and established relationships and good will. Employee acknowledges that the time, geographic and scope of activity limitations set forth herein are reasonable and necessary to protect the Employer Group's legitimate business interests. However, if in any judicial proceeding, a court shall refuse to enforce this Agreement as written, whether because the time limitation is too long or because the restrictions contained herein are more extensive (whether as to geographic area, scope of activity or otherwise) than is necessary to protect the legitimate business interests of the Employer Group, it is expressly understood and agreed between the parties hereto that this Agreement is deemed modified to the extent necessary to permit this Agreement to be enforced in any such proceedings.
Reasonableness of Restrictions
               f. . Employee acknowledges that (1) in the event of the termination of his employment with Employer (whether voluntary or involuntary), Employee's knowledge, experience and capabilities are such that Employee can obtain employment in business activities which are of a different and non-competing nature than those performed in the course of his employment with Employer or in the geographic areas outside of the Territory and (2) the enforcement of a remedy hereunder including, but not limited to, injunctive relief, will not prevent Employee from earning a reasonable livelihood.
Ability to Obtain Other Employment
               g. . Employee acknowledges that compliance with Section VI.B of this Agreement is necessary to protect the good will and other legitimate business interests of the Employer Group and that a breach of any or all of these provisions will give rise to irreparable and continuing injury to the Employer Group that is not adequately compensable in monetary damages or at law. Accordingly, Employee agrees that Employer, its successors and assigns, may obtain injunctive relief against the breach or threatened breach of any or all of these provisions, in addition to any other legal or equitable remedies which may be available to the Employer Group at law or in equity or under this Agreement. Because Employee further acknowledges that it would be difficult to measure any damages caused to the Employer Group that might result from any breach by Employee of any promises set forth in this Agreement, Employee agrees that Employer shall be entitled to an injunction or other appropriate equitable relief to restrain any such breach without showing or proving any actual damage to the Employer Group, as well as to be relieved of any obligation to provide further payment or benefits to Employee or Employee's dependents.
Injunctive Relief
               h. . If Employee violates and/or breaches this Agreement, Employer shall be entitled to an accounting and repayment of all lost profits, compensation, commissions, remuneration or benefits that Employee directly or indirectly has realized or may realize as a result of any such violation or breach. Employer shall also be entitled to recover for all lost sales, profits, commissions, good will and customers caused by Employee's improper acts, in addition to and not in limitation of any injunctive relief or other
Other Remedies
 
rights or remedies that Employer is or may be entitled to at law or in equity or under this Agreement.
               i. . Employee acknowledges that should it become necessary for Employer to file suit to enforce the provisions contained herein, and any court of competent jurisdiction awards the Employer Group any damages and/or an injunction due to the acts of Employee, then Employer shall be entitled to recover its reasonable costs incurred in conducting the suit including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses.
Costs
               j. . For purposes of this Section VI.B.5, the Covenant Period shall mean the period from and during the Term of this Agreement and ending on the date that is two (2) years after Employee's employment with Employer terminates, whether voluntary or involuntary; provided, however, that if Employer delivers to Employee a Renewal Termination Notice, as provided in Section III.B, and Employee remains employed with Employer through the expiration of the Term (and this Agreement), then the Covenant Period shall end on the date that is one (1) year after the date of such Renewal Termination Notice. For purposes of clarity, in the event that Employee's employment with Employer terminates for any reason, whether voluntary or involuntary, after Employee receives a Renewal Termination Notice and before the end of the Term, the Covenant Period shall end on the date that is two (2) years after the termination of Employee's employment.
Covenant Period
          6. . Employee acknowledges and agrees that both during and after his employment with Employer, whether such termination is voluntary or involuntary, Employee shall not disparage, denigrate or comment negatively upon, either orally or in writing, the Employer Group or any of their respective officers, directors, employees or representatives, to or in the presence of any person or entity unless compelled to act by a valid subpoena or other legal mandate; provided, however, if Employee receives such a valid subpoena or legal mandate, he shall provide Employer with written notice of the same at least five (5) business days prior to the date on which Employee is required to make the disclosure.

In that regard, Employer and Employee waive, to the fullest extent allowed, any objection that Employer or Employee may have to the venue of any such proceeding being brought in the Texas Courts, and any claim that any such action or proceeding brought in the Texas Courts has been brought in an inconvenient forum. In addition, Employer and Employee irrevocably and unconditionally submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Texas Courts in any such suit, action or proceeding. Employer and Employee acknowledge and agree that a judgment in any suit, action or proceeding brought in the Texas Courts shall be conclusive and binding on each and may be enforced in any other courts to whose jurisdiction Employer or Employee is or may be subject to, by suit upon such judgment.
Texas Courts
     In the event Employee obtains a final judgment in his favor by a court of competent jurisdiction with respect to any dispute regarding Employer's failure to pay Employee on a timely basis the amounts to which he is entitled under this Agreement or as a result of any other breach of this Agreement by Employer, Employer shall pay all amounts and damages to which Employee may be entitled as a result of such breach, including interest thereon and all reasonable legal fees and expense and other costs incurred by Employee to enforce Employee's rights hereunder.
