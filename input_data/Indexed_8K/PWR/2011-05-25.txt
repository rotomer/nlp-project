Business transacted at all special meetings will be confined to the purpose stated in the notice of the meeting. The Board of Directors or, in the absence of action by the Board of Directors, the Chairman of the Board shall have the sole power to determine the date, time and place for any special meeting of stockholders. Following such determination, it shall be the duty of the Secretary to cause notice to be given to the stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting, that a meeting will be held at the place, time and date and in accordance with the record date determined by the Board of Directors or the Chairman of the Board.

     Except as otherwise provided by any statute, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, the holders of a majority of all outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of any business at such meeting. Shares of its own stock belonging to the Corporation or to another corporation, if a majority of the shares entitled to vote in the election of directors of such other corporation is held, directly or indirectly, by the Corporation, shall neither be entitled to vote nor be counted for quorum purposes; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not limit the right of the Corporation or any subsidiary of the Corporation to vote stock, including but not limited to its own stock, held by it in a fiduciary capacity. The chair of the meeting shall have the power and duty to determine whether a quorum is present at any stockholder meeting.
Section 2.6 Quorum of Stockholders.
     Meetings of stockholders shall be presided over by the Chairman or by another chair designated by the Board. The date and time of the opening and the closing of the polls for each matter upon which the stockholders will vote at a meeting shall

be determined by the chair of the meeting and announced at the meeting. The Board may adopt by resolution such rules and regulations for the conduct of the meeting of stockholders as it shall deem appropriate. Except to the extent inconsistent with such rules and regulations as adopted by the Board, the chair of any meeting of stockholders shall have the exclusive right and authority to prescribe such rules, regulations and procedures and to do all such acts as, in the judgment of such chair, are appropriate for the proper conduct of the meeting. Such rules, regulations or procedures, whether adopted by the Board or prescribed by the chair of the meeting, may include, without limitation, the following: (i) the establishment of an agenda or order of business for the meeting; (ii) rules and procedures for maintaining order at the meeting and the safety of those present; (iii) limitations on attendance at or participation in the meeting to stockholders of record of the Corporation, their duly authorized and constituted proxies or such other persons as the chair of the meeting shall determine; (iv) restrictions on entry to the meeting after the time fixed for the commencement thereof; and (v) limitations on the time allotted to questions or comments by participants. Unless and to the extent determined by the Board or the chair of the meeting, meetings of stockholders shall not be required to be held in accordance with the rules of parliamentary procedure.
     Any meeting of stockholders, annual or special, may be adjourned solely by the chair of the meeting from time to time to reconvene at the same or some other time, date and place. The stockholders present at a meeting shall not have authority to adjourn the meeting. Notice need not be given of any such adjourned meeting if the time, date and place, if any, thereof and the means of remote communications, if any, by which the stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such adjourned meeting are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken. If the time, date and place of the adjourned meeting are not announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken, if the adjournment is for more than 30 days or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, then the Secretary shall give notice of the adjourned meeting as provided in Section 2.5, not less than ten (10) days prior to the date of the adjourned meeting.
Section 2.8 Adjournment of Meeting.
     When a quorum is present at any meeting of the Corporation's stockholders, the vote of the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote on any matter will decide any questions brought before such meeting, unless the question is one upon which, by express provision of law, the Certificate of Incorporation, or these Bylaws, the rules or regulations of any stock exchange applicable to the Corporation or pursuant to any regulation applicable to the Corporation or its securities, a different vote is required, in which case such express provision will govern and control the decision of such question. The stockholders present in person or by proxy at a duly organized meeting may continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough stockholders to leave less than a quorum.
Section 2.9 Voting.
     Each outstanding share of the Corporation's capital stock, regardless of class, will be entitled to one vote on each matter submitted to a vote at a meeting of stockholders, except to the extent that the voting rights of the shares of any class or classes are limited or denied by the Certificate of Incorporation, as amended from time to time. At any meeting of the stockholders, every stockholder having the right to vote will be entitled to
Section 2.10 Method of Voting.
 
vote in person or by proxy. Each proxy will be revocable unless expressly provided therein to be irrevocable and if, and only as long as, it is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power. A proxy may be made irrevocable regardless of whether the interest with which it is coupled is an interest in the stock itself or an interest in the Corporation generally. Voting at meetings of stockholders need not be by written ballot.
     In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action other than stockholder action by written consent, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and which record date: (i) in the case of determination of stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders or adjournment thereof, shall, unless otherwise required by law, not be more than sixty (60) nor less than ten (10) days before the date of such meeting, and (ii) in the case of any other lawful action other than stockholder action by written consent, shall not be more than sixty days prior to such other action. If no record date is fixed by the Board of Directors: (i) the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held, and (ii) the record date for determining stockholders for any other purpose (other than stockholder action by written consent) shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.

     (a) .
Annual Meetings of Stockholders
     (1) Annual Meetings of Stockholders.

     (2) For nominations or other business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder pursuant to clause (c) of paragraph (A)(1) of this Section 2.12, the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of the Corporation and any such proposed business other than the nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors must constitute a proper matter for stockholder action. To be timely, a stockholder's notice shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than the close of business on the ninetieth day nor earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth day prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting (provided, however, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is more than thirty days before or more than seventy days after such anniversary date, notice by the stockholder must be so delivered not earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the ninetieth day prior to such annual meeting or the tenth day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made by the Corporation). In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a stockholder's notice as described above. Such stockholder's notice shall set forth: (a) as to each person whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for election or re-election as a director all information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors in an election contest, or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") (along with (y) such person's written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected and (z) a statement whether such person intends to comply with the Corporation's Corporate Governance Guidelines regarding tendering a resignation in connection with future director elections); (b) as to any other business that the stockholder proposes to bring before the meeting, a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the meeting, the text of the proposal or business (including the text of any resolutions proposed for consideration and in the event that such business includes a proposal to amend the Bylaws of the Corporation, the language of the proposed amendment), the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting and any material interest in such business of such stockholder and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made; and (c) as to the stockholder giving the notice and the beneficial
 
owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made (i) the name and address of such stockholder, as they appear on the Corporation's books, and of such beneficial owner, (ii) the class and number of shares of capital stock of the Corporation which are owned beneficially and of record by such stockholder and such beneficial owner, (iii) a representation that the stockholder is a holder of record of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote at such meeting and intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to propose such business or nomination, and (iv) a representation whether the stockholder or the beneficial owner, if any, intends or is part of a group which intends (a) to deliver a proxy statement and/or form of proxy to holders of at least the percentage of the Corporation's outstanding capital stock required to approve or adopt the proposal or elect the nominee and/or (b) otherwise to solicit proxies from stockholders in support of such proposal or nomination. The foregoing notice requirements shall be deemed satisfied by a stockholder if the stockholder has notified the Corporation of his or her intention to present a proposal at an annual meeting in compliance with Rule 14a-8 (or any successor thereof) promulgated under the Exchange Act and such stockholder's proposal has been included in a proxy statement that has been prepared by the Corporation to solicit proxies for such annual meeting. The Corporation may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information as it may reasonably require to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as a director of the Corporation.
     (3) Notwithstanding anything in the second sentence of paragraph (A)(2) of this Section 2.12 to the contrary, in the event that the number of directors to be elected to the Board of Directors of the Corporation at an annual meeting is increased and there is no public announcement by the Corporation naming the nominees for the additional directorships at least one hundred days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting, a stockholder's notice required by this Section 2.12 shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for the additional directorships, if it shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than the close of business on the tenth day following the day on which such public announcement is first made by the Corporation.
     (b) . Only such business shall be conducted at a special meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting pursuant to the Corporation's notice of meeting. Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors may be made at a special meeting of stockholders at which directors are to be elected pursuant to the Corporation's
Special Meetings of Stockholders
 
notice of meeting (1) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (2) provided that the Board of Directors has determined that directors shall be elected at such meeting, by any stockholder of the Corporation who is a stockholder of record at the time the notice provided for in this Section 2.12 is delivered to the Secretary of the Corporation, who is entitled to vote at the meeting and upon such election and who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 2.12. In the event the Corporation calls a special meeting of stockholders for the purpose of electing one or more directors to the Board of Directors, any such stockholder entitled to vote in such election of directors may nominate a person or persons (as the case may be) for election to such position(s) as specified in the Corporation's notice of meeting, if the stockholder's notice required by paragraph (A)(2) of this Section 2.12 shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth day prior to such special meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the ninetieth day prior to such special meeting or the tenth day following the day on which public announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the Board of Directors to be elected at such meeting. In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of a special meeting commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a stockholder's notice as described above.
     (c) .
General
     (1) Only such persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.12 shall be eligible to be elected at an annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Corporation to serve as directors and only such business shall be conducted at a meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.12. Except as otherwise provided by law, the chairman of the meeting shall have the power and duty (a) to determine whether a nomination or any business proposed to be brought before the meeting was made or proposed, as the case may be, in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.12 (including whether the stockholder or beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made solicited (or is part of a group which solicited) or did not so solicit, as the case may be, proxies in support of such stockholder's nominee or proposal in compliance with such stockholder's representation as required by clause (A)(2)(c)(iv) of this Section 2.12) and (b) if any proposed nomination or business was not made or proposed in compliance with this Section 2.12, to declare that such nomination shall be disregarded or that such proposed business shall not be transacted. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.12, if the stockholder (or a qualified
 
representative of the stockholder) does not appear at the annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Corporation to present a nomination or business, such nomination shall be disregarded and such proposed business shall not be transacted, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote may have been received by the Corporation.
     (2) For purposes of this Section 2.12, "public announcement" shall include disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service, Associated Press or comparable national news service or in a document publicly filed by the Corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.
     (3) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.12, a stockholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set forth in this Section 2.12. Nothing in this Section 2.12 shall be deemed to affect any rights (a) of stockholders to request inclusion of proposals in the Corporation's proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act or (b) of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock to elect directors pursuant to any applicable provisions of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation.
     Before any meeting of stockholders, the Board of Directors may, and if required by law shall, appoint one or more persons to act as inspectors of election as such meeting or any adjournment thereof. If any person appointed as inspector fails to appear or fails or refuses to act, the chairman of the meeting may, and if required by law or requested by any stockholder entitled to vote or his proxy shall, appoint a substitute inspector. If no inspectors are appointed by the Board of Directors, the chairman of the meeting may, and if required by law or requested by any stockholder entitled to vote or his proxy shall, appoint one or more inspectors at the meeting. Notwithstanding the foregoing, inspectors shall be appointed consistent with Section 231 of the DGCL. Inspectors may include individuals who serve the Corporation in other capacities (including as officers, employees, agents or representatives); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no Director or candidate for the office of Director shall act as an inspector. Inspectors need not be stockholders. The inspectors shall (i) determine the number of shares of capital stock of the Corporation outstanding and the voting power of each, the number of shares represented at the meeting, and the validity and effect of proxies and (ii) receive votes or ballots, hear and determine all challenges and questions arising in connection with the right to vote, count and tabulate all votes and ballots, determine the results and do such acts as are proper to conduct the election or vote with fairness to all stockholders.

The inspectors shall have such other duties as may be prescribed by Section 231 of the DGCL.

Section 3.1 Management.
     None of the Directors need be a stockholder of the Corporation or a resident of the State of Delaware. Directors shall be elected at the annual meeting of the stockholders and each director shall be elected to serve until his successor shall be elected and shall qualify. A nominee for director shall be elected to the Board of Directors if the votes cast for such nominee's election exceed the votes cast against such nominee's election; provided, however, that directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast at any meeting of stockholders if, on the tenth day before the Corporation first mails its notice of meeting for such meeting to the stockholders, the number of nominees for director exceed the number of directors to be elected at such meeting. If directors are to be elected by a plurality of the votes cast, stockholders shall not be permitted to vote against a nominee.

The purpose or purposes of any special meeting will be specified in the notice relating thereto.
Section 3.9 Special Meetings.
     At all meetings of the Board of Directors the presence of a majority of the number of Directors fixed by these Bylaws will be necessary and sufficient to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, and the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the Directors present at any meeting at which there is a quorum will be the act of the Board of Directors, except as may be otherwise specifically provided by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws. If a quorum is not present at any meeting of the Board of Directors, the Directors present thereat may adjourn the meeting from time to time without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum is present.
Section 3.10 Quorum.
     The Board of Directors may designate committees, each committee to consist of one or more Directors of the Corporation. Any such committee, to the extent permitted by law and to the extent provided in the resolution of the Board of Directors, shall have and may exercise all the powers and authority of the Board of Directors in the management of the business and affairs of the corporation. Such committee or committees will have such name or names as may be designated by the Board and will keep regular minutes of their proceedings and report the same to the Board of Directors when required. The Board of Directors may designate one or more directors as alternate members of any committee, who may replace any absent or disqualified member at any meeting of the committee. In the absence or disqualification of a member of the committee, the member or members thereof present at any meeting and not disqualified from voting, whether or not he or they constitute a quorum, may unanimously appoint another member of the Board of Directors to act at the meeting in place of any such absent or disqualified member.
Section 3.11 Committees.

Any notice required or permitted to be given by mail will be deemed to be given at the time the same is deposited in the United States mails.

Notice to directors may be given by telegram, telecopier, telephone or other means of electronic transmission.
Section 4.1 Form of Notice.
     Whenever any notice is required to be given to any stockholder or Director of the Corporation as required by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, a waiver thereof in writing signed by the person or persons entitled to such notice or a waiver of notice by electronic transmission, whether before or after the time stated in such notice, will be equivalent to the giving of such notice. Attendance of a stockholder or Director at a meeting will constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except where such a stockholder or Director attends for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business on the ground that the meeting has not been lawfully called or convened.
Section 4.2 Waiver.
     The officers of the Corporation will consist of a Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Secretary and such other officers as shall be elected by the Board of Directors or appointed by the Chief Executive Officer (except the Board of Directors alone shall have authority to elect a Chief Executive Officer or President). Any two or more offices may be held by the same person.
Section 5.1 In General.
 
     The Board of Directors, at its first meeting after each annual meeting of stockholders, will elect the officers, none of whom need be a member of the Board of Directors.

Section 5.3 Other Officers and Agents.
     The compensation of all officers and agents of the Corporation will be fixed by the Board of Directors or any committee of the Board, if so authorized by the Board.
Section 5.4 Compensation.
     Each officer of the Corporation will hold office until his death, his resignation or removal from office, or the election and qualification of his successor, whichever occurs first. Any officer or agent elected or appointed by the Board of Directors or the Chief Executive Officer may be removed at any time, for or without cause, by the affirmative vote of a majority of the entire Board of Directors or at the discretion of the Chief Executive Officer (without regard to how the agent or officer was elected), but such removal will not prejudice the contract rights, if any, of the person so removed. If the office of any officer becomes vacant for any reason, the vacancy may be filled by the Board of Directors or, in the case of a vacancy in the office of officer other than Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer, such vacancy may be filled by the Chief Executive Officer.
Section 5.5 Term of Office and Removal.
     The Board of Directors may authorize any officer or officers or agent or agents to enter into any contract or execute and deliver any instrument in the name or on behalf of the Corporation, and such authority may be general or confined to specific instances.

Nothing herein will limit the authority of the Board of Directors to authorize employment contracts for shorter terms.

Such certificates will be consecutively numbered and will be entered in the stock book of the Corporation as they are issued.

Section 7.1 Indemnification of Directors and Officers.
     (a) The Corporation (i) shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the Corporation) by reason of the fact that such person is or was, at any time prior to or during which this Article VII is in effect, a director or officer of the Corporation, or, while a director or officer of the Corporation, is or was, at any time prior to or during which this Article VII is in effect, serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, other enterprises or employee benefit plan and (ii) upon a determination by the Board of Directors that indemnification is appropriate, the Corporation may indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceedings, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the Corporation) by reason of the fact that such person is or was, at any time prior to or during which this Article VII is in effect, an employee or agent of the Corporation or, while an employee or agent of the Corporation, at the request of the Corporation was serving as a director, officer, employee or agent of any other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, other enterprise or employee benefit plan, in the case of (i) and (ii) against reasonable expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, penalties, amounts paid in settlement and other liabilities actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if such person acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that such person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the
 
Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful.
     (b) The Corporation (i) shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that such person is or was, at any time prior to or during which this Article VII is in effect, a director or officer of the Corporation, or while a director or officer of the Corporation, is or was, at any time prior to or during which this Article VII is in effect, serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise and (ii) upon a determination by the Board of Directors that indemnification is appropriate, the Corporation may indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that such person is or was, at any time prior to or during which this Article VII is in effect, an employee or agent of the Corporation or while an employee or agent of the Corporation at the request of the Corporation was serving as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, in the case of (i) and (ii) against expenses (including attorneys' fees), actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if such person acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation; provided, that no indemnification shall be made under this subsection (b) in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Corporation unless and only to the extent that the Delaware Court of Chancery, or other court of appropriate jurisdiction, shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity of such expenses which the Delaware Court of Chancery, or other court of appropriate jurisdiction, shall deem proper.
     (c) Any indemnification under subsections (a) and (b) (unless ordered by the Delaware Court of Chancery or other court of appropriate jurisdiction) shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of such person is proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in subsections (a) and (b). Such determination shall be made (1) by a majority vote of directors who are not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, even though less than a quorum; or (2) by a committee of such directors designated by majority vote of such directors, even though less than a quorum; or (3) if there are no such directors, or if such directors so direct, by independent legal counsel, in written opinion; or (4) by the stockholders. In the event a determination is made under this subsection (c) that the director, officer, employee or agent has met the applicable standard of
 
conduct as to some matters but not as to others, amounts to be indemnified may be reasonably prorated.
     (d) Expenses incurred by a person who is or was a director or officer of the Corporation in appearing at, participating in or defending any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, shall be paid by the Corporation at reasonable intervals in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the director or officer to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized by this Article VII. In addition, the Corporation shall pay or reimburse expenses incurred by any person who is or was a director or officer of the Corporation in connection with such person's appearance as a witness or other participant in a proceeding in which such person or the Corporation is not a named party to such proceeding, provided that such appearance or participation is on behalf of the Corporation or by reason of his capacity as a director or officer, or former director or officer of the Corporation.
     (e) If in a suit or proceeding for indemnification required under this Article VII of a director or officer, or former director or officer, of the Corporation of any of its affiliates, a court of competent jurisdiction determines that such person is entitled to indemnification under this Article VII, the court shall award, and the Corporation shall pay, to such person the expenses incurred in securing such judicial determination.
     (f) It is the intention of the Corporation to indemnify the persons referred to in this Article VII to the fullest extent permitted by law and with respect to any action, suit or proceeding arising from events which occur at any time prior to or during which this Article VII is in effect. The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by this Article VII shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be or become entitled under any law, the Certificate of Incorporation, these Bylaws, agreement, the vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, or under any policy or policies of insurance purchased and maintained by the Corporation on behalf of any such person, both as to action in his official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office, and shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such person.
     (g) Notwithstanding the foregoing, but subject to the immediately succeeding sentence, the Corporation shall be required to indemnify a person in connection with an action, suit or proceeding (or part thereof) commenced by such person only if the commencement of such action, suit or proceeding (or part thereof) by the person was authorized by the Board. If a claim for indemnification or advancement of expenses under this Article VII is not paid in
 
full within thirty (30) days after a written claim therefor by the person seeking indemnification or reimbursement or advancement of expenses has been received by the Corporation, the person may file suit to recover the unpaid amount of such claim and, if successful in whole or in part, shall be entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting such claim. In any such action the Corporation shall have the burden of proving that the person seeking indemnification or reimbursement or advancement of expenses is not entitled to the requested indemnification, reimbursement or advancement of expenses under applicable law.
     (h) The Corporation's obligation, if any, to indemnify or to advance expenses to any person who was serving at its request as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, enterprise or nonprofit entity shall be reduced by any amount such person may collect as indemnification or advancement of expenses from such other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, enterprise or non-profit enterprise.
     (i) The indemnification provided by this Article VII shall be subject to all valid and applicable laws, and, in the event this Article VII or any other provisions hereof or the indemnification contemplated hereby are found to be inconsistent with or contrary to any such valid laws, the latter shall be deemed to control and this Article VII shall be regarded as modified accordingly, and, as so modified, to continue in full force and effect.
