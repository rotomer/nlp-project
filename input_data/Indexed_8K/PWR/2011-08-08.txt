Company
Credit Agreement
The Credit Agreement provides for a $700.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility maturing on August 2, 2016. The entire amount of the facility is available for the issuance of letters of credit, and up to $25.0 million of the facility is available for swing line loans. Up to $100.0 million of the facility is available for revolving loans and letters of credit in certain alternative currencies in addition to the U.S. dollar. In addition, subject to the conditions specified in the Credit Agreement, the Company has the option to increase the revolving commitments under the Credit Agreement by up to an additional $300.0 million from time to time upon receipt of additional commitments from new or existing lenders. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement are to be used to refinance existing indebtedness and for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes.
As of the closing of the credit facility on August 2, 2011, the Company had approximately $195.0 million of letters of credit issued under the Credit Agreement, all of which were denominated in U.S. dollars, and no outstanding revolving loans. The remaining $505.0 million was available for revolving loans or issuing new letters of credit. Amounts borrowed under the Credit Agreement in U.S. dollars bear interest, at the Company's option, at a rate equal to either (a) the Eurocurrency Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus 1.25% to 2.50%, as determined based on the Company's Consolidated Leverage Ratio (as described below), plus, if applicable, any Mandatory Cost (as defined in the Credit Agreement) required to compensate lenders for the cost of compliance with certain European regulatory requirements, or (b) the Base Rate (as described below) plus 0.25% to 1.50%, as determined based on the Company's Consolidated Leverage Ratio. Amounts borrowed under the Credit Agreement in any currency other than U.S. dollars bear interest at a rate equal to the Eurocurrency Rate plus 1.25% to 2.50%, as determined based on the Company's Consolidated Leverage Ratio, plus, if applicable, any Mandatory Cost. Standby letters of credit issued under the Credit Agreement are subject to a letter of credit fee of 1.25% to 2.50%, based on the Company's Consolidated Leverage Ratio, and Performance Letters of Credit (as defined in the Credit Agreement) issued under the Credit Agreement in support of certain contractual obligations are subject to a letter of credit fee of 0.75% to 1.50%, based on the Company's Consolidated Leverage Ratio. The Company is also subject to a commitment fee of 0.20% to 0.45%, based on the Company's Consolidated Leverage Ratio, on any unused availability under the Credit Agreement. The Consolidated Leverage Ratio is the ratio of the Company's total funded debt to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement). For purposes of calculating both the Consolidated Leverage Ratio and the maximum senior debt to Consolidated EBITDA ratio discussed below, total funded debt and total senior debt are reduced by all cash and Cash Equivalents (as defined in the Credit Agreement) held by the Company in excess of $25.0 million. The Base Rate equals the highest of (i) the Federal Funds Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus 1/2 of 1%, (ii) Bank of America's prime rate and (iii) the Eurocurrency Rate plus 1.00%.
The Company and its subsidiaries party to the Credit Agreement entered into a Second Amended and Restated Security Agreement (the "") and a Second Amended and Restated Pledge Agreement (the "") in connection with the Credit Agreement. Subject to certain exceptions, the Credit Agreement is secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company and its wholly owned U.S. subsidiaries and by a pledge of all of the capital stock of the Company's wholly owned U.S. subsidiaries and 65% of the capital stock of the direct foreign subsidiaries of the Company or its wholly owned U.S. subsidiaries. The Company's wholly owned U.S. subsidiaries also guarantee the repayment of all amounts due under the Credit Agreement. Subject to certain conditions, at any time the Company maintains a corporate credit rating that is BBB- (stable) or higher by Standard & Poor's Rating Services and a corporate family rating that is Baa3 (stable) or higher by Moody's Investors Services, all collateral will automatically be released from the liens created by the Security Agreement and the Pledge Agreement.
Security Agreement
Pledge Agreement
 
The Credit Agreement contains certain covenants, including a maximum Consolidated Leverage Ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio, in each case as specified in the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement also contains a maximum senior debt to Consolidated EBITDA ratio, as specified in the Credit Agreement, that will be in effect at any time that the collateral securing the Credit Agreement has been and remains released. The Credit Agreement limits certain acquisitions, mergers and consolidations, indebtedness, capital expenditures, asset sales and prepayments of indebtedness and, subject to certain exceptions, prohibits liens on assets. The Credit Agreement also includes limits on the payment of dividends and stock repurchase programs in any fiscal year except those payments or other distributions payable solely in capital stock.
The Credit Agreement provides for customary events of default and carries cross-default provisions with the Company's Underwriting, Continuing Indemnity and Security Agreement with its sureties and all of the Company's other debt instruments exceeding $30.0 million in borrowings or availability. If an Event of Default (as defined in the Credit Agreement) occurs and is continuing, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Credit Agreement, amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement may be accelerated and may become or be declared immediately due and payable.
Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, which acted as Joint Lead Arrangers and Joint Book Managers for the Credit Agreement, and some of the other lenders under the Credit Agreement and their respective affiliates, have provided financial advisory and investment banking services to the Company and its subsidiaries for which they have received customary fees.

Each Lender that purchases a participation pursuant to this Section shall from and after such purchase have the right to give all notices, requests, demands, directions and other communications under this Agreement with respect to the portion of the Obligations purchased to the same extent as though the purchasing Lender were the original owner of the Obligations purchased.

Miscellaneous Indebtedness existing on the books of the Borrower's Subsidiaries consisting primarily of capital leases and financed equipment and, with respect to certain Foreign Subsidiaries, Indebtedness under two revolving credit facilities which such Foreign Subsidiaries plan to terminate post-Closing, with the aggregate amount of all such Indebtedness not exceeding $5.0 million as of the Closing Date.
The Borrower has entered into an indemnity agreement with each of its directors and executive officers. The indemnity agreements generally provide that the Borrower will, to the extent permitted by applicable law, indemnify and hold harmless each indemnitee that is, or is threatened to be made, a party to any civil, criminal or administrative proceeding against all expenses, judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by the indemnitee in connection with any such proceeding. The indemnity agreements provide the indemnitee with indemnification rights in connection with third-party proceedings and proceedings brought by or in the right of the Borrower. In addition, the indemnity agreements provide for the advancement of expenses incurred by the indemnitee in connection with any covered proceeding to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. The indemnity agreements also provide that if the indemnification rights provided for therein are unavailable for any reason, the Borrower will pay, in the first instance, the entire amount incurred by the indemnitee in connection with any covered proceeding and waive and relinquish any right of contribution the Borrower may have against the indemnitee. Upon any "potential change in control" (as defined in the indemnity agreements) of the Borrower, the indemnitee has the right to cause the Borrower to create a trust and to fund the trust with an amount sufficient to satisfy any indemnifiable expenses expected to be incurred by the indemnitee. The indemnity agreements will continue as long as the director or executive officer is subject to any potential proceeding in his or her capacity as such, regardless of when the individual's service to the Borrower ends.
The Borrower enters into an employment agreement with each of its executive officers. The principal terms of the employment agreements with the Borrower's named executive officers are described in reports filed by the Borrower with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
From time to time, the Borrower or a Subsidiary may enter into agreements to the extent permitted by this Agreement (other than this Section 8.08) with and/or take a minority ownership position in companies owned or controlled by family members of officers of such Person for purposes of obtaining benefits available in connection with governmental programs, organizations or incentives (including, by way of illustration and without limitation, such programs or incentives relating to small businesses or transactions with women- or minority-owned businesses).
From time to time and as part of the arms-length negotiation of the acquisition of Subsidiaries, Borrower or its Subsidiaries may have entered into transactions with certain officers of its Subsidiaries (including, by way of illustration and without limitation, leases or rental agreements with such officers) that, when taken outside the context of the acquisition as a whole, may not be viewed as being substantially as favorable to Borrower as would be obtainable by it in an arms-length transaction with a different third-party.
From time to time, Borrower or its Subsidiaries have entered into and may enter into transactions with certain officers of Borrower or its Subsidiaries or with certain individuals or entities related to or affiliated with officers of Borrower or its Subsidiaries (including, by way of illustration and without limitation, facilities leases, equipment rental agreements, or catering services contracts), subject to appropriate approvals pursuant to Borrower's related party transactions policy.

Except as permitted by the Credit Agreement, none of the Debtors shall create, permit, or suffer to exist, and each of the Debtors shall defend the Collateral against, any Lien on the Collateral except the pledge and security interest of the Administrative Agent hereunder and except for Permitted Liens, and shall defend the Debtors' rights in the Collateral and the Administrative Agent's security interest in the Collateral against the claims of all persons and entities (other than any person or entity claiming by, through or under the Administrative Agent or any obligee of the Secured Obligations).
Encumbrances
4.2 . None of the Debtors shall sell, assign, or otherwise dispose of the Collateral or any part thereof except as permitted by the Credit Agreement.
Sale of Collateral
4.3 . Each Debtor shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent such agreements, assignments or instruments (including affidavits, notices, reaffirmations and amendments and restatements of existing documents, as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request) and do all such other things as the Administrative Agent may reasonably deem necessary (i) to assure to the Administrative Agent the effectiveness and priority of its security interests hereunder, including (A) such instruments as the Administrative Agent may from time to time reasonably request in order to perfect and maintain the security interests granted hereunder in accordance with the UCC, (B) with regard to Copyrights, a Notice of Grant of Security Interest in Copyrights for filing with the United States Copyright Office in the form of attached hereto, (C) with regard to Patents, a Notice of Grant of Security Interest in Patents for filing with the United States Patent and Trademark Office in the form of attached hereto and (D) with regard to Trademarks registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and all applications for Trademarks filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, a Notice of Grant of Security Interest in Trademarks for filing with the United States Patent and Trademark Office in the form of attached hereto, (ii) to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and (iii) to otherwise protect and assure the Administrative Agent of its rights and interests hereunder.

In the event for any reason the Law of any jurisdiction other than New York becomes or is applicable to the Collateral of any Debtor or any part thereof, or to any of the Secured Obligations, such Debtor agrees to execute and deliver all such instruments and to do all such other things as the Administrative Agent reasonably deems necessary to preserve, protect and enforce the security interests of the Administrative Agent granted hereunder under the Law of such other jurisdiction (and, if a Debtor shall fail to do so promptly upon the request of the Administrative Agent, then the Administrative Agent may execute any and all such requested documents on behalf of such Debtor pursuant to the power of attorney granted hereinabove). If any Collateral is in the possession or control of a Debtor's agents and the Administrative Agent so requests, such Debtor agrees to notify such agents in writing of the Administrative Agent's security interest therein and, upon the Administrative Agent's request, instruct them to hold all such Collateral for the account of the Secured Parties and subject to the Administrative Agent's instructions.

SECTION 5.
Rights of the Administrative Agent and Debtors
5.1 . Each of the Debtors hereby irrevocably and with the power of substitution constitutes and appoints the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Secured Parties and any officer or agent thereof, with full power of substitution, as its true and lawful attorney-in-fact with full irrevocable power and authority in the place and stead and in the name of such Debtor or in its own name, from time to time in the Administrative Agent's discretion during the continuance of an Event of Default and prior to the Collateral Termination Date, to take any and all action and to execute any and all documents and instruments which may be necessary or desirable to accomplish the purposes of this Agreement and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, hereby gives the Administrative Agent the power and right on behalf of such Debtor and in its own name to do any of the following after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default and to the extent permitted by applicable Laws, without notice to or the consent of the Debtor:
Power of Attorney
 
 
 
 
This power of attorney is a power coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable. The Administrative Agent shall be under no duty to exercise or withhold the exercise of any of the rights, powers, privileges, and options expressly or implicitly granted to the Administrative Agent in this Agreement, and shall not be liable for any failure to do so or any delay in doing so. The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any act or omission or for any error of judgment or any mistake of fact or Law in its individual capacity or in its capacity as attorney-in-fact except acts or omissions constituting or resulting from its willful misconduct or gross negligence. This power of attorney is conferred on the Administrative Agent solely to protect, preserve, and realize upon its security interest in the Collateral.
5.2 . On failure of any Debtor to perform any of the covenants and agreements contained herein, the Administrative Agent may, at its sole option and in its sole discretion, upon notice to the Debtors, perform the same and in so doing may expend such sums as the Administrative Agent may reasonably deem advisable in the performance thereof, including, without limitation, the payment of any insurance premiums, the payment of any taxes, a payment to obtain a release of a Lien or potential Lien, expenditures made in defending against any adverse claim and all other expenditures that the Administrative Agent may reasonably make for the protection of the security hereof or that it may be compelled to make by operation of Law. All such sums and amounts so expended shall be repayable by the Debtors on a joint and several basis (subject to Section 7.16 hereof) promptly upon timely notice thereof and demand therefor, shall constitute additional Secured Obligations and shall bear interest from the date said amounts are expended at the Default Rate. No such performance of any covenant or agreement by the Administrative Agent on behalf of any Debtor, and no such advance or expenditure therefor, shall relieve the Debtors of any default under the terms of this Security Agreement, the other Loan Documents or any other documents relating to the Secured Obligations. The Administrative Agent may make any payment hereby authorized in accordance with any bill, statement or estimate procured from the appropriate public office or holder of the claim to be discharged without inquiry into the accuracy of such bill, statement or estimate or into the validity of any tax assessment, sale, forfeiture, tax lien, title or claim except to the extent such payment is being contested in good faith by a Debtor in appropriate proceedings and against which adequate reserves are being maintained in accordance with GAAP.
Performance by the Administrative Agent of the Debtors' Secured Obligations
5.3 . Other than the exercise of reasonable care in the physical custody of the Collateral while held by the Administrative Agent hereunder, the Administrative Agent shall have no responsibility for or obligation or duty with respect to all or any part of the Collateral or any matter or proceeding arising out of or relating thereto, including, without limitation, any obligation or duty to collect any sums due in respect thereof or to protect or preserve any rights against prior parties or any other rights pertaining thereto, it being understood and agreed that the
The Administrative Agent's Duty of Care
 
Debtors shall be responsible for preservation of all rights in the Collateral. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent shall be conclusively deemed to have exercised reasonable care in the custody of the Collateral if the Administrative Agent takes such action, for purposes of preserving rights in the Collateral, as any of the Debtors may reasonably request in writing, but no failure or omission or delay by the Administrative Agent in complying with any such request by such Debtor, and no refusal by the Administrative Agent to comply with any such request by such Debtor, shall of itself be deemed to be a failure to exercise reasonable care.
5.4 .
Rights of Debtors; Debtors Remain Liable
(a) Any term of this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, until written notice shall be given to any of the Debtors that the Administrative Agent is exercising its rights under this Section 5, such Debtor shall have the right, subject to the prohibitions contained in the Credit Agreement to possess, retain, enjoy and use the Collateral, to give consents, waivers or notifications with respect to the Collateral, to exercise its rights, powers and privileges under the Collateral, to agree to any modification of any of the terms of the Collateral, to dispose of any of the Collateral (it being agreed that the Lien of this Agreement shall attach to the proceeds thereof), and otherwise to act with respect to the Collateral in the ordinary course of business, in each case other than with respect to any Cash Collateral held by the Administrative Agent.
(b) Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, (i) each of the Debtors shall remain liable under the contracts and agreements included in the Collateral to the extent set forth therein (and subject to any defenses thereto), to perform all of its duties and obligations thereunder to the same extent as if this Agreement had not been executed, (ii) the exercise by the Administrative Agent of any of the rights hereunder shall not release any of the Debtors from any of its duties or obligations under the contracts and agreements included in the Collateral, and (iii) the Administrative Agent shall not have any obligation or liability under the contracts and agreements included in the Collateral solely by reason of this Agreement, nor shall the Administrative Agent be obligated to perform any of the obligations or duties of the Debtors thereunder or to take any action to collect or enforce any claim for payment assigned hereunder, in each case, solely by reason of this Agreement.

No waiver hereunder shall be effective unless it is in writing, signed by the party against whom such waiver is sought to be enforced and then only to the extent specifically stated, which in the case of the Administrative Agent or the holders of the Secured Obligations shall only be granted as provided herein. To the extent permitted by Law, neither the Administrative Agent, the holders of the Secured Obligations, nor any party acting as attorney for the Administrative Agent or the holders of the Secured Obligations, shall be liable hereunder for any acts or omissions or for any error of judgment or mistake of fact or Law other than their gross negligence or willful misconduct hereunder. The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent and the holders of the Secured Obligations under this Agreement shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any other right or remedy that the Administrative Agent or the holders of the Secured Obligations may have.
Nonexclusive Nature of Remedies
 
6.5 .

Retention of Collateral
6.6 . Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default, any payments in respect of the Secured Obligations and any proceeds of the Collateral, when received by the Administrative Agent or any of the Secured Parties in cash or its equivalent, will be applied in reduction of the Secured Obligations in the order set forth in the Credit Agreement.

SECTION 7.

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws, the rights, powers, privilege and remedies provided for in this Agreement are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights and remedies provided by Law.

Power of Attorney
 
 
 
This power of attorney is a power coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable. The Administrative Agent shall be under no duty to exercise or withhold the exercise of any of the rights, powers, privileges, and options expressly or implicitly granted to the Administrative Agent in this Agreement, and shall not
 
be liable for any failure to do so or any delay in doing so. The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any act or omission or for any error of judgment or any mistake of fact or Law in its individual capacity or in its capacity as attorney-in-fact except acts or omissions constituting or resulting from its willful misconduct or gross negligence. This power of attorney is conferred on the Administrative Agent solely to protect, preserve, and realize upon its security interest in the Collateral.
5.2 . Until written notice shall be given to the Pledgors in accordance with Section 6.2(d) that the Administrative Agent has exercised its rights under Section 6.2(d) to vote the Collateral (provided, however, if the Administrative Agent is prevented from providing such notice as a result of Section 362 of the United States Bankruptcy Code or similar Law the Pledgors shall be entitled to exercise such rights so long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing), a Pledgor shall be entitled to exercise any and all voting and other rights relating or pertaining to the Collateral or any part thereof and the Administrative Agent shall execute and deliver (or cause to be executed and delivered) to such Pledgor all such proxies and other instruments as such Pledgor may reasonably request for the purpose of enabling such Pledgor to exercise the voting and other rights which it is entitled to exercise pursuant to this sentence.
Voting Rights

Because of applicable securities Laws, including without limitation, the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and other applicable state securities Laws, there may be legal restrictions or limitations affecting attempts of the Administrative Agent to dispose of the Collateral in the enforcement of its rights and remedies hereunder, the Administrative Agent is hereby authorized by the Pledgors, but not obligated, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, to sell all or any part of the Collateral at private sale, subject to investment letters or in any other manner which will not require the Collateral or any part thereof, to be registered in accordance with the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any other applicable securities Law or regulation. The Pledgors specifically agree that under these circumstances, such a sale is a commercially reasonable method of disposition of the Collateral. The Administrative Agent is also hereby authorized by the Pledgors, but not obligated, to take such actions, give such notices, obtain such rulings and consents, and do such other things as the Administrative Agent may deem appropriate in the event of such a sale or disposition of any of the Collateral. The Pledgors acknowledge that the Administrative Agent may, in its reasonable discretion, approach a restricted number of potential purchasers and that a sale under such circumstances may yield a lower price for the Collateral or any part or parts thereof than would otherwise be obtainable if the same were registered and sold in the open market, the Pledgors agrees that such private sale shall constitute a commercially reasonable method of disposing of the Collateral in view of the time, expense, and potential liability to the parties of such transactions of registration of the Collateral in accordance with applicable securities Laws.
6.3 . Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default, any payments in respect of the Secured Obligations and any proceeds of the Collateral, when received by the Administrative Agent or any of the Secured Parties in cash or its equivalent, will be applied in reduction of the Secured Obligations in the order set forth in the Credit Agreement.
