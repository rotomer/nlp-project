This Current Report on Form 8-K/A is filed as an amendment to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed on May 25, 2011 (the "Original Report") by Quanta Services, Inc. (the "Company"). The sole purpose of this amendment is to disclose the Company's decision regarding how frequently it will conduct future advisory votes on executive compensation. No other changes are being made to the Original Report.
 
At the Company's 2011 Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on May 19, 2011, the Company's stockholders voted on, among other matters, a proposal regarding the frequency of holding advisory votes on executive compensation. As previously reported in the Original Report, the stockholders approved, on an advisory basis, an annual advisory vote on executive compensation.
On August 18, 2011, after considering the results of the stockholder advisory vote and other factors, the Company's Board of Directors determined that the Company will hold an advisory vote on executive compensation every year until the next stockholder advisory vote on the frequency of future advisory votes on executive compensation, which, in accordance with applicable law, will occur no later than the Company's annual meeting of stockholders in 2017.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
