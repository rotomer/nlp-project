Indemnity Agreements
The Indemnity Agreements generally provide that Quanta will, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, indemnify and hold harmless each indemnitee that, by reason of the fact that the indemnitee is or was a director or officer of Quanta, is or is threatened to be made a party to or a participant in any civil, criminal, administrative or investigative proceeding against all expenses, judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by the indemnitee in connection with any such proceeding. The Indemnity Agreements provide the indemnitee with indemnification rights in connection with third-party proceedings and proceedings brought by or in the right of Quanta. In addition, the Indemnity Agreements provide for the advancement of expenses incurred by the indemnitee in connection with any covered proceeding to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. The Indemnity Agreements also provide that if the indemnification rights provided for therein are unavailable for any reason, Quanta will pay, in the first instance, the entire amount incurred by the indemnitee in connection with any covered proceeding and waives and relinquishes any right of contribution Quanta may have against the indemnitee.
The rights provided by the Indemnity Agreements are in addition to any other rights to indemnification or advancement of expenses to which the indemnitee may be entitled under applicable law, Quanta's Restated Certificate of Incorporation or Amended and Restated Bylaws, or otherwise.
The foregoing summary of some of the terms of the Indemnity Agreements is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the form of such agreement, a copy of which is filed as an exhibit to this report and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 
 

Exhibit 10.1
This [Amended and Restated] Indemnity Agreement ("Agreement") is made as of             by and between Quanta Services, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and             ("Indemnitee").
WHEREAS, highly competent persons have become more reluctant to serve publicly-held corporations as directors or in other capacities unless they are provided with adequate protection through insurance or adequate indemnification against inordinate risks of claims and actions against them arising out of their service to and activities on behalf of the corporation.
WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") has determined that, in order to attract and retain qualified individuals, the Company will attempt to maintain on an ongoing basis, at its sole expense, liability insurance to protect persons serving the Company and its subsidiaries from certain liabilities. Although the furnishing of such insurance has been a customary and widespread practice among United States-based corporations and other business enterprises, the Company believes that, given current market conditions and trends, such insurance may be available to it in the future only at higher premiums and with more exclusions. At the same time, directors, officers and other persons in service to corporations or business enterprises are being increasingly subjected to expensive and time-consuming litigation relating to, among other things, matters that traditionally would have been brought only against the Company or business enterprise itself. The Bylaws of the Company (the "Bylaws") require indemnification of the officers and directors of the Company. Indemnitee may also be entitled to indemnification pursuant to applicable provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law ("DGCL"). The Bylaws and the DGCL expressly provide that the indemnification provisions set forth therein are not exclusive, and thereby contemplate that contracts may be entered into between the Company and members of the Board, officers and other persons with respect to indemnification, hold harmless, advancement and reimbursement rights.
WHEREAS, Plaintiffs often seek damages in such large amounts and the costs of litigation may be so great (whether or not the case is meritorious), that the defense and/or settlement of such litigation is usually beyond the personal resources of directors and officers.
WHEREAS, the Board has determined that the increased difficulty in attracting and retaining such persons is detrimental to the best interests of the Company's stockholders and that the Company should act to assure such persons that there will be increased certainty of such protection in the future.
WHEREAS, it is reasonable, prudent and necessary for the Company contractually to obligate itself to indemnify and hold harmless and to advance expenses on behalf of, such persons to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, regardless of any amendment or revocation of the Bylaws, so that they will serve or continue to serve the Company free from undue concern that they will not be so protected against liabilities.
WHEREAS, this Agreement is a supplement to and in furtherance of the Bylaws and any resolutions adopted pursuant thereto, and shall not be deemed a substitute therefor, nor to diminish or abrogate any rights of Indemnitee thereunder.
WHEREAS, Indemnitee does not regard the protection available under the Bylaws and insurance as adequate in the present circumstances, and may not be willing to serve as an officer or director without adequate protection, and the Company desires Indemnitee to serve in such capacity. Indemnitee is willing to serve, continue to serve and to take on additional service for or on behalf of the Company on the condition that he be so indemnified.
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the covenants contained herein, the Company and Indemnitee do hereby covenant and agree as follows:
. . Indemnitee will serve or continue to serve as an officer, director or key employee of the Company for so long as Indemnitee is duly elected or appointed or until Indemnitee tenders his resignation. This Agreement shall not be deemed an employment contract between the Company (or any of its Subsidiaries or any Enterprise) and Indemnitee. The foregoing notwithstanding, this Agreement shall continue in force after Indemnitee has ceased to serve as a director, officer or key employee of the Company.

(c) The Company hereby agrees to fully indemnify Indemnitee from any claims for contribution which may be brought by officers, directors or employees of the Company other than Indemnitee who may be jointly liable with Indemnitee.
. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company shall not be obligated under this Agreement to make any indemnification or hold harmless payment in connection with any of the following:
9.
Exclusions
(a) a claim made against Indemnitee for which payment has actually been received by or on behalf of Indemnitee under any director or officer liability insurance policy or other indemnity provision between Indemnitee and the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any Enterprise, except with respect to any excess beyond the amount actually received under any such insurance policy or other indemnity provision; or
(b) a claim made against Indemnitee for an accounting of profits made from the purchase and sale (or sale and purchase) by Indemnitee of securities of the Company within the meaning of Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act or similar provisions of state statutory law or common law;
(c) except as otherwise provided in Sections 14(e)-(f) hereof, prior to a Change in Control, in connection with any Proceeding (or any part of any Proceeding) initiated voluntarily by Indemnitee and not by way of defense, including any Proceeding (or any part of any Proceeding) initiated by Indemnitee against the Company or its directors, officers, employees or other indemnitees, unless (i) the Board authorized the Proceeding (or any part of any Proceeding) prior to its initiation or (ii) the Company provides the indemnification, advancement or hold harmless payment, in its sole discretion, pursuant to the powers vested in the Company under applicable law.
 
10. Advances Of Expenses; Defense Of Claim.
(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Company shall advance the Expenses incurred by Indemnitee in connection with any Proceeding as soon as practicable but in any event not more than ten (10) days after the receipt by the Company of a statement or statements requesting such advances (which shall include invoices received by Indemnitee in connection with such Expenses but, in the case of invoices in connection with legal services, any references to legal work performed or to expenditures made that would cause Indemnitee to waive any privilege accorded by applicable law shall not be included with the invoice) from time to time, whether prior to or after final disposition of any Proceeding. Advances shall be unsecured and interest free. Advances shall be made without regard to Indemnitee's ability to repay the Expenses and without regard to Indemnitee's ultimate entitlement to be indemnified or held harmless under the other provisions of this Agreement. Indemnitee shall qualify for advances, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law solely upon the execution and delivery to the Company of this Agreement which shall constitute an undertaking providing that Indemnitee undertakes to the fullest extent required by applicable law to repay the advance if and to the extent that it is ultimately determined by the Delaware Court or other court of competent jurisdiction in a final judgment not subject to appeal that Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified by the Company under the provisions of this Agreement, the Bylaws, applicable law or otherwise. This Section 10(a) shall not apply to any claim made by Indemnitee for which an indemnification or hold harmless payment is excluded pursuant to Section 9(b) or 9(c) or for which payment of advancement has actually been received by or on behalf of Indemnitee under any director or officer liability insurance policy or other advancement provision between Indemnitee and the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any Enterprise. The right to advances under this paragraph shall in all events continue until final disposition of any Proceeding, including any appeal therein. Nothing in this Section 10 shall limit Indemnitee's right to advancement pursuant to Section 14(e) of this Agreement.
(b) If a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the Expenses to be advanced to Indemnitee under this Agreement must be reasonable or reasonably incurred to be payable, the Company shall bear the burden of proving the Expenses incurred by or on behalf of Indemnitee are not reasonable. To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Company agrees that, in any proceeding for an advancement of Expenses, it will not assert or make any claim that any Expenses (including without limitation attorneys' fees and expert witness or consultant fees) incurred by or on behalf of Indemnitee are not reasonable if counsel for Indemnitee certifies his or her belief that such Expenses were prudent and appropriate in the good faith judgment of such counsel; provided that, following the final disposition of the Proceeding for which Expenses are advanced, the Company may seek to recover any Expenses that it establishes are not reasonable in an action brought to enforce the undertaking granted by Indemnitee in the preceding paragraph.
(c) The Company will be entitled to participate in the Proceeding at its own expense.
 
(d) The Company shall not settle any action, claim or Proceeding (in whole or in part) which would impose any Expense, judgment, fine, penalty or limitation on Indemnitee without Indemnitee's prior written consent.
11. Procedure For Notification And Application For Indemnification.
(a) Indemnitee agrees to notify promptly the Company in writing upon being served with any summons, citation, subpoena, complaint, indictment, inquiry, information or other document relating to any Proceeding or matter which may be subject to indemnification or hold harmless rights, or advancement of Expenses covered hereunder. The failure of Indemnitee to so notify the Company shall not relieve the Company of any obligation which it may have to Indemnitee under this Agreement, or otherwise.
(b) To obtain indemnification under this Agreement, Indemnitee shall submit to the Company a written request therefor and, if Indemnitee so chooses pursuant to Section 12 of this Agreement, such written request shall also include a request for Indemnitee to have the right to indemnification determined by Independent Counsel. Following such a written request for indemnification by Indemnitee, Indemnitee's entitlement to indemnification shall be determined according to Section 12(a) of this Agreement.
12. Procedure Upon Application For Indemnification.
(a) Upon a written request by Indemnitee for indemnification pursuant to Section 11(b), a determination, if such determination is required by applicable law, with respect to Indemnitee's entitlement to indemnification shall be made in the specific case: (i) by Independent Counsel in a written opinion to the Board if Indemnitee so requests in such written request for indemnification pursuant to Section 11(b), or (ii) by the Company in accordance with applicable law if Indemnitee does not so request such determination be made by Independent Counsel. In the case that such determination is made by Independent Counsel, a copy of Independent Counsel's written opinion shall be delivered to Indemnitee. The Company promptly will advise Indemnitee in writing with respect to any determination that Indemnitee is or is not entitled to indemnification, including a description of any reason or basis for which indemnification has been denied. If it is so determined that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, payment to Indemnitee shall be made as soon as practicable but in no event more than ten (10) days after such determination. Indemnitee shall reasonably cooperate with Independent Counsel or the Company, as applicable, making such determination with respect to Indemnitee's entitlement to indemnification, including providing to such counsel or the Company upon reasonable advance request any documentation or information which is not privileged or otherwise protected from disclosure and which is reasonably available to Indemnitee and reasonably necessary to such determination. Any costs or expenses (including attorneys' fees and disbursements) incurred by Indemnitee in so cooperating with the Independent Counsel or the Company making such determination shall be borne by the Company (irrespective of the determination as to Indemnitee's entitlement to indemnification) and the Company hereby indemnifies and agrees to hold Indemnitee harmless therefrom.
 
(b) In the event the determination of entitlement to indemnification is to be made by Independent Counsel pursuant to Section 12(a) hereof, the Independent Counsel shall be selected as provided in this Section 12(b). The Independent Counsel shall be selected by Indemnitee (unless Indemnitee shall request that such selection be made by the Board), and Indemnitee shall give written notice to the Company advising it of the identity of the Independent Counsel so selected and certifying that the Independent Counsel so selected meets the requirements of "Independent Counsel" as defined in Section 2 of this Agreement. If the Independent Counsel is selected by the Board, the Company shall give written notice to Indemnitee advising him of the identity of the Independent Counsel so selected and certifying that the Independent Counsel so selected meets the requirements of "Independent Counsel" as defined in Section 2 of this Agreement. In either event, Indemnitee or the Company, as the case may be, may, within ten (10) days after such written notice of selection shall have been received, deliver to the Company or to Indemnitee, as the case may be, a written objection to such selection; , , that such objection may be asserted only on the ground that the Independent Counsel so selected does not meet the requirements of "Independent Counsel" as defined in Section 2 of this Agreement, and the objection shall set forth with particularity the factual basis of such assertion. Absent a proper and timely objection, the Person so selected shall act as Independent Counsel. If such written objection is so made and substantiated, the Independent Counsel so selected may not serve as Independent Counsel unless and until such objection is withdrawn or a court of competent jurisdiction has determined that such objection is without merit. If, within twenty (20) days after the later of (i) the submission by Indemnitee of a written request for indemnification and Independent Counsel pursuant to Sections 11(b) and 12(b) hereof, respectively, and (ii) the final disposition of the Proceeding, including any appeal therein, no Independent Counsel shall have been selected and not objected to, either the Company or Indemnitee may petition the Delaware Court for resolution of any objection which shall have been made by the Company or Indemnitee to the other's selection of Independent Counsel and/or for the appointment as Independent Counsel of a Person selected by the Delaware Court or by such other Person as the Delaware Court shall designate. The Person with respect to whom all objections are so resolved or the Person so appointed shall act as Independent Counsel under Section 12(a) hereof. Upon the due commencement of any judicial proceeding or arbitration pursuant to Section 14(a) of this Agreement, Independent Counsel shall be discharged and relieved of any further responsibility in such capacity (subject to the applicable standards of professional conduct then prevailing).
provided
however
(c) The Company agrees to pay the reasonable fees and expenses of Independent Counsel and to fully indemnify and hold harmless such Independent Counsel against any and all expenses, claims, liabilities and damages arising out of or relating to this Agreement or its engagement pursuant hereto.

(a) In making a determination with respect to entitlement to indemnification hereunder, the person, persons or entity (including without limitation the Company) making such determination shall presume that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification under this Agreement if Indemnitee has submitted a request for indemnification in accordance with Section 11(b) of
 
this Agreement, and the Company shall have the burden of proof to overcome that presumption in connection with the making by any person, persons or entity of any determination contrary to that presumption. Neither the failure of the Company (including by its directors or Independent Counsel) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of any action pursuant to this Agreement that indemnification is proper in the circumstances because Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct, nor an actual determination by the Company (including by its directors or Independent Counsel) that Indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that Indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct.
(b) If the person, persons or entity (including without limitation the Company) empowered or selected under Section 12 of this Agreement to determine whether Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification shall not have made a determination within sixty (60) days after receipt by the Company of the request therefor, the requisite determination of entitlement to indemnification shall be deemed to have been made and Indemnitee shall be entitled to such indemnification, absent (i) a misstatement by Indemnitee of a material fact, or an omission of a material fact necessary to make Indemnitee's statement not materially misleading, in connection with the request for indemnification, or (ii) a final judicial determination that any or all such indemnification is expressly prohibited under applicable law; , , that such 60-day period may be extended for a reasonable time, not to exceed an additional fifteen (15) days, if the person, persons or entity making the determination with respect to entitlement to indemnification in good faith requires such additional time for the obtaining or evaluating of documentation and/or information relating thereto.
provided
however
(c) The termination of any Proceeding or of any claim, issue or matter therein, by judgment, order, settlement or conviction, or upon a plea of guilty, or its equivalent, shall not (except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement) of itself adversely affect the right of Indemnitee to indemnification or create a presumption that Indemnitee did not meet any applicable standard of conduct.
nolo
contendere
(d) The knowledge and/or actions, or failure to act, of any other director, officer, trustee, partner, managing member, fiduciary, agent or employee of the Company or any Enterprise shall not be imputed to Indemnitee for purposes of determining the right to indemnification under this Agreement.
(e) For purposes of any determination of good faith, Indemnitee shall be deemed to have acted in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company if Indemnitee's action is based on the records or books of account of the Enterprise, including financial statements, or on information, opinions, reports or statements supplied to Indemnitee by the directors or officers of the Enterprise in the course of their duties, or on the advice of legal counsel for the Enterprise or on information or records given or reports made to the Enterprise by an independent certified public accountant or by an appraiser or other expert selected by the Enterprise. The provisions of this Section 13(e) shall not be deemed to be exclusive or to limit in any way the other circumstances in which Indemnitee may be deemed or found to have met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in this Agreement.
 
14. Remedies Of Indemnitee.
(a) Subject to Section 14(g), in the event that (i) a determination is made pursuant to Section 12 of this Agreement that Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification under this Agreement, (ii) advancement of Expenses is not timely made pursuant to Section 10 of this Agreement, (iii) no determination of entitlement to indemnification shall have been made pursuant to Section 12(a) of this Agreement within sixty (60) days after receipt by the Company of the request for indemnification, (iv) payment of indemnification is not made pursuant to Section 5 or 6, or the last sentence of Section 12(a) of this Agreement within ten (10) days after receipt by the Company of a written request therefor, (v) payment of indemnification pursuant to Section 3, 4 or 7 of this Agreement is not made within ten (10) days after a determination has been made that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, or (vi) payment to Indemnitee pursuant to any contribution rights under this Agreement or otherwise is not made within the later of (1) ten (10) days after receipt by the Company of a written request therefor and (2) the date that Indemnitee is entitled to seek an adjudication by the Delaware Court in accordance with this paragraph for a claim for indemnification with respect to any Proceeding giving rise to a right to contribution, Indemnitee shall be entitled to an adjudication by the Delaware Court to such indemnification, hold harmless, contribution or advancement rights. Alternatively, Indemnitee, at his option, may seek an award in arbitration to be conducted by a single arbitrator pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association. Except as set forth herein, the provisions of Delaware law (without regard to its conflict of laws rules) shall apply to any such arbitration. The Company shall not oppose Indemnitee's right to seek any such adjudication or award in arbitration.
(b) In the event that a determination shall have been made pursuant to Section 12(a) of this Agreement that Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification, any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this Section 14 shall be conducted in all respects as a trial, or arbitration, on the merits and Indemnitee shall not be prejudiced by reason of that adverse determination. In any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this Section 14, Indemnitee shall be presumed to be entitled to be indemnified and held harmless and to receive advances of Expenses under this Agreement and the Company shall have the burden of proving Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified and held harmless and to receive advances of Expenses, as the case may be, and the Company may not refer to or introduce into evidence any determination pursuant to Section 12(a) of this Agreement adverse to Indemnitee for any purpose. If Indemnitee commences a judicial proceeding or arbitration pursuant to this Section 14, Indemnitee shall not be required to reimburse the Company for any advances pursuant to Section 10 until a final determination is made with respect to Indemnitee's entitlement to indemnification (as to which all rights of appeal have been exhausted or lapsed).
de
novo
(c) If a determination shall have been made pursuant to Section 12(a) of this Agreement that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, the Company shall be bound by such determination in any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this Section 14, absent a misstatement by Indemnitee of a material fact, or an omission of a material fact necessary to make Indemnitee's statement not materially misleading, in connection with the request for indemnification.
 
(d) The Company shall be precluded from asserting in any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this Section 14 that the procedures and presumptions of this Agreement are not valid, binding and enforceable and shall stipulate in any such court or before any such arbitrator that the Company is bound by all the provisions of this Agreement.
(e) The Company shall indemnify and hold harmless Indemnitee to the fullest extent permitted by law against all Expenses and, if requested by Indemnitee, shall (within ten (10) days after the Company's receipt of such written request) advance to Indemnitee, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, such Expenses which are incurred by Indemnitee in connection with any judicial proceeding or arbitration, or part thereof, (i) to enforce his rights under, or to recover damages for breach of, this Agreement or any other indemnification, hold harmless, advancement or contribution agreement or provision of the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company (the "Charter"), or the Bylaws now or hereafter in effect; (ii) to defend against any claim brought by the Company to recover an advancement of Expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking; or (iii) for recovery or advances under any insurance policy maintained by any Person or the Company for the benefit of Indemnitee. Unless prohibited by applicable law, such indemnification and advancement shall be paid regardless of whether Indemnitee ultimately is determined to be entitled to such indemnification, advance, contribution or insurance recovery, as the case may be, in the suit for which indemnification, contribution or advancement is being sought.
(f) Interest shall be paid by the Company to Indemnitee, compounded quarterly, at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge), as established from time to time during the period that interest accrues, for amounts which the Company owes Indemnitee pursuant to any right of Indemnitee under this Agreement (including any right to indemnity, advancement of Expenses and any hold harmless right). Such interest shall accrue until such amounts are paid, and shall begin to accrue as follows: (i) except for amounts payable pursuant to the preceding Section 14(e), interest shall begin to accrue on the first date on which Indemnitee is entitled to commence a proceeding against the Company for failure to pay such amounts (regardless of whether Indemnitee commences a proceeding on such date) and (ii) in the case of any amounts payable pursuant to the preceding Section 14(e), interest shall begin to accrue on the 31
st
day after an invoice for such amount is submitted to the Company.
(g) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no determination as to entitlement to indemnification under this Agreement shall be required to be made prior to the final disposition of the Proceeding, including any appeal therein.
In the event of a Potential Change in Control, the Company shall, upon written request by Indemnitee, create a "Trust" for the benefit of Indemnitee and from time to time upon written request of Indemnitee shall fund such Trust in an amount sufficient to satisfy any and all Expenses reasonably anticipated at the time of each such
15. Establishment Of Trust.
 
request to be incurred in connection with investigating, preparing for, participating in or defending any Proceedings, and any and all judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement (including all interest, assessments and other charges paid or payable in connection with or in respect of such judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement) in connection with any and all Proceedings from time to time actually paid or claimed, reasonably anticipated or proposed to be paid. The trustee of the Trust (the "Trustee") shall be a bank or trust company or other individual or entity chosen by Indemnitee and reasonably acceptable to the Company. Nothing in this Section 15 shall relieve the Company of any of its obligations under this Agreement. The amount or amounts to be deposited in the Trust pursuant to the foregoing funding obligation shall be determined by mutual agreement of Indemnitee and the Company or, if the Company and Indemnitee are unable to reach such an agreement, by Independent Counsel selected in accordance with Section 12(b) of this Agreement. The terms of the Trust shall provide that, except upon the consent of both Indemnitee and the Company, upon a Change in Control: (a) the Trust shall not be revoked or the principal thereof invaded, without the written consent of Indemnitee; (b) the Trustee shall advance, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Expenses with respect to which Indemnitee would be entitled under this Agreement within ten (10) business days of a request by Indemnitee for advancement; (c) the Trust shall continue to be funded by the Company in accordance with the funding obligations set forth above; (d) the Trustee shall promptly pay to Indemnitee all amounts for which Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification, or to be held harmless pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise; and (e) all unexpended funds in such Trust shall revert to the Company upon mutual agreement by Indemnitee and the Company or, if Indemnitee and the Company are unable to reach such an agreement, by Independent Counsel selected in accordance with Section 12(b) of this Agreement, that Indemnitee has been fully indemnified and held harmless under the terms of this Agreement. The Trust shall be governed by Delaware law (without regard to its conflicts of laws rules) and the Trustee shall consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware Court in accordance with Section 25 of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, to the extent requested by Indemnitee and approved by the Board, the Company may at any time and from time to time provide security to Indemnitee for the Company's obligations hereunder through an irrevocable bank line of credit, funded trust or other collateral. Any such security, once provided to Indemnitee, may not be revoked or released without the prior written consent of Indemnitee.
16.
Security.
17. Non-Exclusivity; Survival Of Rights; Insurance; Subrogation.
(a) The rights of Indemnitee as provided by this Agreement shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which Indemnitee may at any time be entitled under applicable law, the Charter, the Bylaws, any agreement, a vote of stockholders or a resolution of directors, or otherwise. No amendment, alteration or repeal of this Agreement or of any provision hereof shall limit or restrict any right of Indemnitee under this Agreement in respect of any action taken or omitted by such Indemnitee in his Corporate Status prior to such amendment, alteration or repeal. To the extent that a change in applicable law, whether by statute or judicial decision, permits greater indemnification, hold harmless rights or advancement of Expenses than would be afforded currently under the Bylaws or this Agreement, it is the intent of the parties hereto that
 
Indemnitee shall enjoy by this Agreement the greater benefits so afforded by such change. No right or remedy herein conferred is intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every other right and remedy shall be cumulative and in addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise. The assertion or employment of any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any other right or remedy.
(b) The DGCL and the Bylaws permit the Company to purchase and maintain insurance or furnish similar protection or make other arrangements including, but not limited to, providing a trust fund, letter of credit, or surety bond ("Indemnification Arrangements") on behalf of Indemnitee against any liability asserted against him or incurred by or on behalf of him or in such capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company, or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the Company would have the power to indemnify him against such liability under the provisions of this Agreement or under the DGCL, as it may then be in effect. The purchase, establishment, and maintenance of any such Indemnification Arrangement shall not in any way limit or affect the rights and obligations of the Company or of Indemnitee under this Agreement except as expressly provided herein, and the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company and Indemnitee shall not in any way limit or affect the rights and obligations of the Company or the other party or parties thereto under any such Indemnification Arrangement.
(c) To the extent that the Company maintains an insurance policy or policies providing liability insurance for directors, officers, trustees, partners, managing members, fiduciaries, employees, or agents of the Company or of any other Enterprise which such Person serves at the request of the Company, Indemnitee shall be covered by such policy or policies in accordance with its or their terms to the maximum extent of the coverage available for any such director, officer, trustee, partner, managing member, fiduciary, employee or agent under such policy or policies. If, at the time the Company receives notice from any source of a Proceeding as to which Indemnitee is a party or a participant (as a witness or otherwise), the Company has director and officer liability insurance in effect, the Company shall give prompt notice of such Proceeding to the insurers in accordance with the procedures set forth in the respective policies. The Company shall thereafter take all necessary or desirable action to cause such insurers to pay, on behalf of Indemnitee, all amounts payable as a result of such Proceeding in accordance with the terms of such policies.
(d) In the event of any payment under this Agreement, the Company shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to all of the rights of recovery of Indemnitee, who shall execute all papers required and take all action necessary to secure such rights, including execution of such documents as are necessary to enable the Company to bring suit to enforce such rights.
(e) The Company's obligation to indemnify, hold harmless or advance Expenses hereunder to Indemnitee who is or was serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, trustee, partner, managing member, fiduciary, employee or agent of any other Enterprise shall be reduced by any amount Indemnitee has actually received as indemnification or hold harmless payments or advancement of expenses from such Enterprise.
 
All agreements and obligations of the Company contained herein shall continue during the period Indemnitee serves as a director or officer of the Company or as a director, officer, trustee, partner, managing member, fiduciary, employee or agent of any other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other Enterprise which Indemnitee serves at the request of the Company and shall continue thereafter so long as Indemnitee shall be subject to any possible Proceeding (including any rights of appeal thereto and any Proceeding commenced by Indemnitee pursuant to Section 14 of this Agreement) by reason of his Corporate Status, whether or not he is acting in any such capacity at the time any liability or expense is incurred for which indemnification can be provided under this Agreement.
18. Duration Of Agreement.
No legal action shall be brought and no cause of action shall be asserted by or in the right of the Company against Indemnitee, Indemnitee's spouse, heirs, executors or personal or legal representatives after the expiration of two years from the date of accrual of such cause of action, and any claim or cause of action of the Company shall be extinguished and deemed released unless asserted by the timely filing of a legal action within such two-year period; provided, however, that if any shorter period of limitations is otherwise applicable to any such cause of action such shorter period shall govern.
19. Period of Limitations.
If any provision or provisions of this Agreement shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason whatsoever: (a) the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement (including, without limitation, each portion of any Section, paragraph or sentence of this Agreement containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that is not itself invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby and shall remain enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law; (b) such provision or provisions shall be deemed reformed to the extent necessary to conform to applicable law and to give the maximum effect to the intent of the parties hereto; and (c) to the fullest extent possible, the provisions of this Agreement (including, without limitation, each portion of any Section, paragraph or sentence of this Agreement containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that is not itself invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall be construed so as to give effect to the intent manifested thereby.
20. Severability.
If for the validation of any of the provisions in this Agreement any act, resolution, approval or other procedure is required, the Company undertakes to cause such act, resolution, approval or other procedure to be affected or adopted in a manner that will enable the Company to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement.
21.
Additional Acts.
22. Enforcement And Binding Effect.
(a) The Company expressly confirms and agrees that it has entered into this Agreement and assumed the obligations imposed on it hereby in order to induce Indemnitee to serve as a director, officer or key employee of the Company, and the Company acknowledges that Indemnitee is relying upon this Agreement in serving as a director, officer or key employee of the Company.
 
(b) Without limiting any of the rights of Indemnitee under the Bylaws of the Company as they may be amended from time to time, this Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, oral, written and implied, between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof.
(c) The indemnification, hold harmless and advancement of expenses rights provided by or granted pursuant to this Agreement shall be binding upon and be enforceable by the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns (including any direct or indirect successor by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise to all or substantially all of the business or assets of the Company), shall continue as to an Indemnitee who has ceased to be a director, officer, trustee, general partner, managing member, fiduciary, employee or agent of the Company or of any other Enterprise at the Company's request, and shall inure to the benefit of Indemnitee and his or her spouse, assigns, heirs, devisees, executors and administrators and other legal representatives.
(d) The Company shall require and cause any successor (whether direct or indirect by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all, substantially all or a substantial part, of the business and/or assets of the Company, by written agreement in form and substance satisfactory to Indemnitee, expressly to assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform if no such succession had taken place.
(e) The Company and Indemnitee agree herein that a monetary remedy for breach of this Agreement, at some later date, may be inadequate, impracticable and difficult of proof, and further agree that such breach may cause Indemnitee irreparable harm. Accordingly, the parties hereto agree that Indemnitee may enforce this Agreement by seeking, among other things, injunctive relief and/or specific performance hereof, without any necessity of showing actual damage or irreparable harm and that by seeking injunctive relief and/or specific performance, Indemnitee shall not be precluded from seeking or obtaining any other relief to which he may be entitled. The Company and Indemnitee further agree that Indemnitee shall be entitled to such specific performance and injunctive relief, including temporary restraining orders, preliminary injunctions and permanent injunctions, without the necessity of posting bonds or other undertaking in connection therewith. The Company acknowledges that in the absence of a waiver, a bond or undertaking may be required of Indemnitee by the Court, and the Company hereby waives any such requirement of such a bond or undertaking.
No supplement, modification, amendment or waiver of this Agreement shall be binding unless executed in writing by the parties hereto. No waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed or shall constitute a waiver of any other provisions of this Agreement nor shall any waiver constitute a continuing waiver. No amendment, alteration or repeal of this Agreement or any provision hereof shall limit or restrict the right of Indemnitee under this Agreement in respect of any action taken or omitted by such Indemnitee prior to such amendment, alteration or repeal.
