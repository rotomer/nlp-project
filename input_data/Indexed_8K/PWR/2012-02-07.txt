Exhibit 99.1
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
12-03
 
 Feb. 7, 2012  Quanta Services, Inc. (NYSE: PWR) today announced that its 2011 fourth quarter results will include a pre-tax charge to earnings of $32.6 million due to the withdrawal from the Central States Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Plan (Central States Plan) by certain Quanta subsidiaries. In addition, Quanta expects to record a tax benefit of between $10 million and $11 million primarily related to the release of income tax contingencies in the fourth quarter of 2011 as a result of the expiration of various federal and state statutes of limitations and audit settlements. Quanta estimates that the net effect of these items will negatively impact the company's diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter and full year by approximately $0.04 to $0.05. If the net effect of these items are excluded, Quanta currently expects its fourth quarter 2011 diluted earnings per share to be within its previously announced range of $0.32 to $0.36.
HOUSTON
The recognition of the partial withdrawal liability in the fourth quarter of 2011 resulted from the withdrawal from the Central States Plan by certain Quanta subsidiaries following an amendment to a collective bargaining agreement with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters that eliminated obligations to contribute to the Central States Plan. The Central States Plan's obligations for vested benefits are significantly underfunded, and Quanta believes that withdrawal from the Central States Plan was advantageous because it limited Quanta's exposure to increased liabilities from a future withdrawal if the underfunding status of the Central States Plan deteriorates further. The Quanta subsidiaries and other members of the Pipe Line Contractors Association (PLCA) that withdrew from the Central States Plan will contribute to a new multiemployer pension plan on behalf of affected Teamster employees, with contributions currently being made to an escrow fund until the new plan is established.
The partial withdrawal liability recognized in the fourth quarter is based on the most recent estimates received from the Central States Plan. Quanta expects the Central States Plan to issue a formal assessment of the partial withdrawal liability, which is anticipated to occur no earlier than 2013 and may differ from the amount recognized in
the fourth quarter, and Quanta may seek to challenge and further negotiate the assessment at that time. The Central States Plan has asserted that the PLCA members did not effect a withdrawal in 2011, although Quanta believes that a legally effective withdrawal occurred in the fourth quarter of 2011 and has recorded the partial withdrawal liability on this basis. If, however, the Central States Plan were to prevail in its assertions and a withdrawal of the Quanta subsidiaries was deemed to occur after 2011, the amount of any withdrawal liability could increase substantially. Certain other Quanta subsidiaries also continue to participate in the Central States Plan. Quanta is evaluating the possibility of withdrawal of these subsidiaries from the plan, which will depend on various factors, including the collective bargaining agreements under which the subsidiaries participate and whether exemptions from withdrawal liability applicable to construction industry employers will be available. Given the unknown nature of some of these factors, the amount or timing of any liability upon withdrawal of the subsidiaries remaining in the Central States Plan is uncertain. However, Quanta currently does not expect the liability upon withdrawal of the subsidiaries remaining in the Central States Plan to be material.

Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, estimates regarding Quanta's partial withdrawal liability and factors that may affect the amount of the liability in the future, the materiality of the amount of any withdrawal liability for Quanta's subsidiaries remaining in the Central States Fund, Quanta's beliefs regarding the advantages of withdrawal from the Central States Plan, projected revenues and earnings per share and other projections of financial and operating results; growth or opportunities in particular markets; and Quanta's strategies and plans, as well as statements reflecting expectations, intentions, assumptions or beliefs about future events, and other statements that do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Although Quanta's management believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct. These statements can be affected by inaccurate assumptions and by a variety of risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict or beyond our control, including, among others, the amount of the future assessments from the Central States Plan and Quanta's opportunity to challenge and negotiate the assessed amount; the success of any legal challenges to the effectiveness or timing of the withdrawal from the Central States Plan; factors affecting whether the Quanta subsidiaries remaining in the Central States Plan withdraw and the amount of any applicable withdrawal liability that may be assessed; future financial performance of assets held by the Central States Plan; quarterly variations in operating results, including as a result of weather, site conditions, project schedules, regulatory and environmental restrictions, bidding and spending patterns and other factors that may affect the timing or productivity on projects; adverse economic and financial conditions, including weakness in the capital markets; trends and growth opportunities in relevant markets; delays, reductions in scope or cancellations of anticipated, existing or pending projects, including as a result of weather, regulatory or environmental processes or capital constraints that may impact our customers; the successful negotiation, execution, performance and completion of anticipated, pending and existing contracts; dependence on fixed price contracts and the potential to incur losses with respect to these contracts; estimates relating to the use of percentage-of-completion accounting; the ability to generate internal growth; the ability to effectively compete for new projects and market share; the failure of renewable energy initiatives, the economic stimulus package or other existing or potential legislative actions to result in increased demand for Quanta's services; unexpected costs or liabilities that may arise from lawsuits or indemnity claims related to the services Quanta performs; liabilities for claims that are self-insured; potential additional risk exposure resulting from any unavailability or cancellation of third party insurance coverage; cancellation provisions within contracts and the risk that contracts are not renewed or are replaced on less favorable terms; the potential that participation in joint ventures exposes us to liability and/or harm to our reputation for actions or omissions by our partners; our failure to comply with the terms of our contracts, which may result in unexcused delays, warranty claims, damages or contract terminations; the effect of natural gas and oil prices on Quanta's operations and growth opportunities; the inability of customers to pay for services; the failure to recover on payment claims against project owners or to obtain adequate compensation for customer-requested change orders; the failure of our customers to comply with regulatory requirements applicable to their projects, including those related to awards of
