(e) On March 2, 2012, the Compensation Committee of the Board adopted the Quanta Services, Inc. 2012 Incentive Bonus Plan (the "Incentive Plan"). Under the Incentive Plan, the Company's corporate and operating unit executive officers and/or key management employees are eligible to receive annual bonus awards payable in cash and restricted stock. All restricted stock awards earned under the Incentive Plan, if any, will be made pursuant to the Quanta Services, Inc. 2011 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan or other plans that may be approved from time to time by the Board or by stockholders as required. Certain of the awards under the Incentive Plan are based on the achievement of certain performance goals. For 2012, performance goals for operating unit executives are based on achievement of operating income targets, modified return on asset targets, individual strategic goals and various safety statistics and safety leadership at the operating unit level. Performance goals under the Incentive Plan for corporate management employees are based on achievement of operating income targets, return on equity targets and individual strategic goals in 2012. The Incentive Plan also provides for additional discretionary awards in cash and/or restricted stock for both corporate and operating unit executive officers and key management employees. The Compensation Committee, based on recommendations of management, establishes specific target amounts for the participants under the Incentive Plan. In addition, all future awards under the Incentive Plan are subject to approval by the Compensation Committee prior to the date any such awards are granted.
