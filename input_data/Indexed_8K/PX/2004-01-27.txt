Exhibit 99.1 Praxair Fourth-Quarter EPS up 9.3% to 47 Cents DANBURY, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 27, 2004--Praxair, Inc. (NYSE: PX) reported record net income of $155 million for the fourth quarter of 2003, and diluted earnings per share of 47 cents, compared to $140 million and 43 cents per diluted share in the 2002 fourth quarter, adjusted to reflect the two-for-one stock split which occurred on December 15, 2003. Growth in net income was due to higher sales, higher operating profit and lower interest expense, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate. Sales for the quarter of $1,461 million grew 13% from 2002 as a result of volume growth in all geographic regions, higher overall pricing and stronger currencies in Europe and South America. Operating profit was $244 million, up 7% from $227 million in the prior year, driven by strong revenue growth. For the full year 2003, Praxair reported net income of $585 million, and diluted earnings per share of $1.77, an increase of 7% from $548 million(a) and $1.66(a), adjusted for the stock split. Full-year sales were $5,613 million, an increase of 9% from 2002. Full-year operating profit was $922 million compared to $923 million in 2002. Excluding the effects of net income hedges in both years, and a litigation settlement gain in 2002, operating profit grew 4%. Commenting on the results, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Dennis H. Reilley said, "Our strong performance during the economic downturn validates that our business strategy is robust, and demonstrates our ability to execute well in the marketplace. During 2003, we won significant new business and we are well on our way to implementing our growth strategies in refinery hydrogen, healthcare, electronics and China." In the fourth quarter, sales in North America of $923 million grew 8% from the prior year. The growth in sales came from new business and higher pricing. On-site, merchant and packaged gases volumes were higher than the prior year, and grew sequentially from the third quarter. Operating profit was $141 million, comparable to the prior year, as higher energy costs offset some of the volume gains. In Europe, sales rose 22% to $191 million. Excluding the effect of the stronger Euro and a divestiture, sales grew 6% from higher price and volumes across the region. Operating profit grew 21% to $47 million, in line with sales growth. In South America, sales of $188 million grew 38%, or 18% excluding the effect of currency appreciation. Sales grew as a result of higher pricing and higher volumes. Operating profit was $30 million, 15% above the prior year. Sales in Asia grew 25% to $110 million, primarily from strong volume demand, particularly in China. Excluding the effect of a business consolidation, sales grew 19%. Operating profit grew to $19 million from $14 million a year ago. Praxair Surface Technologies' sales for the quarter were $104 million, and operating profit was $7 million, compared to $97 million and $6 million in 2002. Sales reflect the stronger Euro and relatively flat volumes in global coatings and aviation markets compared to the previous year. Cash flow from operations for the quarter and full year were $387 million and $1,137 million, respectively. Capital expenditures during the quarter were $199 million, reflecting increased investment in the U.S. Gulf Coast hydrogen complex. Full-year capital expenditures were $644 million, excluding the purchase of leased assets. At year-end, Praxair's debt-to-capital ratio was reduced to 46.2%(b), and in the fourth quarter its after-tax return-on-capital ratio improved to 12.5%(b). For the first quarter of 2004, Praxair expects sales to grow 8% to 12%, and operating profit to grow 10% to 14% versus the first quarter of 2003. Diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of 43 cents to 47 cents, an increase of 10% to 20% from the prior year. This reflects an effective tax rate of 25%, slightly higher than the tax rate in 2003. For the full year of 2004, Praxair expects sales growth in the range of 6% to 10%, and operating profit growth of 8% to 14% from 2003. Guidance for earnings per share is $1.90 to $2.05, reflecting growth of 8% to 15%, and assuming a higher effective tax rate of 25%. Full-year capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $700 million, anticipating additional investment in hydrogen infrastructure, significant investment in China to supply new contracts awarded in 2003, and business won in North America. "2003 started on a very weak note, but business around the world began to pick up in the third and fourth quarters. We achieved record results by gaining new business around the world and by continuing to focus on productivity," said Reilley. "As we begin 2004, we remain cautiously optimistic. Business conditions are much improved versus this time last year, particularly in the United States. However, we are concerned about whether the level of economic stimulus that was required to ignite the U.S. economy can be maintained. Nonetheless, our focus on productivity improvements in our base business, and disciplined capital investment will drive strong cash flow and higher returns on capital in 2004."

AND SUBSIDIARIES APPENDIX NON-GAAP MEASURES (Dollar amounts in millions) (UNAUDITED) Definitions of the following non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similar definitions used by other companies. Praxair believes that its debt-to-capital ratio is appropriate for measuring its financial leverage. The Company believes that its after-tax return on invested capital ratio is an appropriate measure for judging performance as it reflects the approximate after-tax profit earned as a percentage of investments by all parties in the business (debt, minority interest, preferred stock, and shareholders' equity). 2003 ---------------------------- Q4(a) Q3(a) Q2(b) Q1 TOTAL CAPITAL - ------------- Total debt $2,816 $2,958 $2,952 $2,742 Minority interests 195 181 168 160 Preferred stock - - - - Shareholders' equity 3,088 2,874 2,880 2,477 ---------------------------- Total Capital $6,099 $6,013 $6,000 $5,379 ============================ DEBT-TO-CAPITAL RATIO 46.2% 49.2% 49.2% 51.0% - --------------------- ============================ AFTER-TAX RETURN ON CAPITAL (ROC) - --------------------------------- Operating profit $244 $240 $223 $215 Less: reported taxes (49) (49) (35) (41) Less: tax benefit on interest expense (9) (9) (8) (10) Add: income from equity investments 3 3 3 3 ---------------------------- Net operating profit after- tax (NOPAT) $189 $185 $183 $167 Beginning capital $6,013 $6,000 $5,379 $5,252 Ending capital $6,099 $6,013 $6,000 $5,379 Average capital $6,056 $6,007 $5,690 $5,316 ROC % 3.1% 3.1% 3.2% 3.1% ROC % (annualized) 12.5% 12.3% 12.9% 12.6% ============================ 2002 ---------------------------- Q4 Q3(c) Q2(d) Q1 TOTAL CAPITAL - ------------- Total debt $2,748 $2,875 $3,022 $3,009 Minority interests 164 152 155 148 Preferred stock - - 20 20 Shareholders' equity 2,340 2,204 2,329 2,428 ---------------------------- Total Capital $5,252 $5,231 $5,526 $5,605 ============================ DEBT-TO-CAPITAL RATIO 52.3% 55.0% 54.7% 53.7% - --------------------- ============================ AFTER-TAX RETURN ON CAPITAL (ROC) - --------------------------------- Operating profit $227 $235 $244 $217 Less: reported taxes (40) (38) (43) (37) Less: tax benefit on interest expense (10) (14) (11) (11) Add: income from equity investments 3 2 2 2 ---------------------------- Net operating profit after- tax (NOPAT) $180 $185 $192 $171 Beginning capital $5,231 $5,526 $5,605 $5,627 Ending capital $5,252 $5,231 $5,526 $5,605 Average capital $5,242 $5,379 $5,566 $5,616 ROC % 3.4% 3.4% 3.4% 3.0% ROC % (annualized) 13.7% 13.8% 13.8% 12.2% ============================ (a) ROC for the 2003 third and fourth quarter was reduced by 0.8% on an annualized basis due to the additional debt from the purchase of leased assets in the 2nd quarter of 2003.
