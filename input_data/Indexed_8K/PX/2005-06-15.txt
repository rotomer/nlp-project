Exhibit (99.1):        Press Release, dated June 15, 2005

Exhibit 99.1
 
DANBURY, Conn., JUNE 15, 2005 -- Praxair, Inc. (NYSE: PX) today announced it is notifying its industrial gas customers in the U.S. and Canada of the following price increases, effective June 14, 2005, except as otherwise provided by the terms and conditions of customer contracts:
 
      Up to 20 percent increase for bulk and cylinder argon
 - 
      10 percent increase for bulk and gas helium
 - 
      Discounts on helium tube trailer rental rates are being reduced in varying amounts
 - 
 
The argon price increase is primarily due to higher production and distribution costs. The helium price increase is primarily driven by increasing manufacturing costs related to rising costs of crude helium gas and refined liquid purchases.
 
The discounts on helium tube trailer rental rates are being reduced, in part, because of rising manufacturing costs for tube trailers.
