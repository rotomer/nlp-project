Exhibit 99.1 Praxair Reports Third-Quarter EPS of 75 Cents; Raises Guidance DANBURY, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 25, 2006--Praxair, Inc. (NYSE: PX) announced third-quarter diluted earnings per share of 75 cents, up 27% on a comparable basis.* Net income rose to $247 million in the quarter. Sales in the third quarter rose 11% to $2,099 million, compared to $1,890 million in the 2005 quarter. Operating profit grew 28% to $392 million from $307 million in the prior-year quarter on a comparable basis. Higher operating profit was due to strong volume growth across most end markets and geographic regions, higher prices, productivity improvements, and a gain from divestitures. "Activity in the industrial economy has continued to be strong, and we have not seen any meaningful decline in demand from our customers," said Dennis H. Reilley, chairman and chief executive officer. In North America, third-quarter sales of $1,187 million rose 9% from the year-ago quarter, and 11% excluding the effects of lower natural gas prices, due to higher volumes and higher prices. Sales grew in all major end-market segments. Operating profit grew to $204 million, up 28% from $159 million in the prior-year period on a comparable basis. In Europe, sales in the quarter of $293 million were 14% above the prior period, and increased 10% excluding currency effects. Underlying sales growth was primarily attributed to volume growth in Spain and Italy. On a comparable basis, operating profit rose 11% to $69 million. In South America, third-quarter sales of $340 million grew 16% versus the prior year, and 10% excluding currency effects, primarily due to strong volume growth in the energy sector. Operating profit rose to $69 million, an increase of 35% versus last year's quarter on a comparable basis, due to higher volumes and productivity programs. Sales in Asia grew 21% to $165 million in the quarter, from $136 million in the year-ago period, led by robust electronics sales. Operating profit increased to $27 million, from $23 million in the prior-year period on a comparable basis. Praxair Surface Technologies' sales in the quarter were $114 million, 3% below the prior year. Excluding the effects of a divestiture and currency, organic sales growth was 9%, due primarily to strong coatings demand in aerospace and higher pricing. Operating profit increased to $23 million, a result of higher volumes, productivity, and a gain on sale. Cash flow from operations rose to a record $554 million in the third quarter from higher earnings and effective working capital management. Capital expenditures were $274 million. The company's after-tax return-on-capital ratio* was 14.3% for the quarter. For the fourth quarter of 2006, Praxair expects diluted earnings per share in the range of 75 cents to 78 cents, 15% to 20% above the fourth quarter of 2005, on a comparable basis. For the full year of 2006, Praxair expects year-over-year sales growth of about 10%. Raising its earnings guidance, Praxair expects diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.93 to $2.96, representing 21% to 22% growth versus the prior year on a comparable basis. Full-year capital expenditures are expected to be $1.05 billion to $1.10 billion, supporting a growing backlog of new projects across all geographic regions, which will come on-stream in 2007 and 2008. Commenting on Praxair's business outlook Reilley said, "Looking forward, we expect U.S. macro-economic growth to moderate. However, we expect growth in our business to outpace the economy, due to a steadily increasing backlog of projects related to energy production, infrastructure building in emerging markets, and new applications technologies." Praxair is the largest industrial gases company in North and South America, and one of the largest worldwide, with 2005 sales of $7.7 billion. The company produces, sells and distributes atmospheric and process gases, and high-performance surface coatings. Praxair products, services and technologies bring productivity and environmental benefits to a wide variety of industries, including aerospace, chemicals, food and beverage, electronics, energy, healthcare, manufacturing, metals and others.

AND SUBSIDIARIES APPENDIX NON-GAAP MEASURES (Dollar amounts in millions) (UNAUDITED) Definitions of the following non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similar definitions used by other companies. Praxair believes that (i) its debt-to-capital ratio is appropriate for measuring its financial leverage; (ii) its after-tax return on invested capital ratio is an appropriate measure for judging performance as it reflects the approximate after-tax profit earned as a percentage of investments by all parties in the business (debt, minority interests and shareholders' equity) and the adjusted ROC amount will help investors understand underlying performance on a comparable basis; and (iii) operating profit, net income and diluted EPS amounts that include pro-forma stock option expense in 2005 periods, help investors understand underlying performance on a comparable basis. 2006 2005 ---------------------- ---------------------------- Q3 Q2 Q1 Q4 Q3 Q2 Q1 Total Capital - ------------------- Total debt $3,174 $3,454 $3,408 $3,447 $3,272 $3,327 $3,449 Minority interests 209 203 207 202 225 225 221 Shareholders' equity 4,494 4,269 4,125 3,902 3,873 3,821 3,651 --------------------- ---------------------------- Total Capital $7,877 $7,926 $7,740 $7,551 $7,370 $7,373 $7,321 ===================== ============================ Debt-to-Capital Ratio 40.3% 43.6% 44.0% 45.6% 44.4% 45.1% 47.1% - ------------------- ===================== ============================ After-Tax Return on Capital (ROC) - ------------------- Adjusted operating profit (a,c) $ 392 $ 382 $ 352 $ 335 $ 307 $ 311 $ 300 Less: adjusted taxes (a,b) (101) (90) (83) (76) (68) (60) (66) Less: tax benefit on interest expense (10) (11) (10) (10) (10) (11) (11) Add: income from equity investments 1 3 2 4 2 5 4 --------------------- ---------------------------- Net operating profit after-tax (NOPAT) $ 282 $ 284 $ 261 $ 253 $ 231 $ 245 $ 227 Beginning capital $7,926 $7,740 $7,551 $7,370 $7,373 $7,321 $7,358 Ending capital $7,877 $7,926 $7,740 $7,551 $7,370 $7,373 $7,321 Average capital $7,902 $7,833 $7,646 $7,461 $7,372 $7,347 $7,340 ROC % 3.6% 3.6% 3.4% 3.4% 3.1% 3.3% 3.1% ROC % (annualized) 14.3% 14.5% 13.7% 13.6% 12.5% 13.4% 12.4% ===================== ============================ (a) Reported 2006 operating profit and taxes include the effect of expensing stock options while 2005 reported amounts do not. The 2005 operating profit and reported tax amounts have been adjusted to include the pro-forma impact of expensing stock options and are comparable to the 2006 presentation. See the following section "2005 FAS 123R Revised," for the calculation of these non-GAAP measures. (b) The third quarter 2005 excludes the impact of a $92 million income tax charge for the repatriation of foreign earnings and other tax adjustments. (c) The second quarter 2006 includes the impact of a $15 million benefit related to insurance recoveries which increased annualized ROC by 0.5% for that quarter. PRAXAIR, INC.
