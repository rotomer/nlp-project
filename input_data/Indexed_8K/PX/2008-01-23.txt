Exhibit 99.1
Praxair Fourth-Quarter EPS 98 Cents; Full-Year 2007 EPS $3.62
DANBURY, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Praxair, Inc. (NYSE: PX) reported record sales and earnings in the fourth quarter and full year of 2007. Fourth-quarter and full-year diluted earnings per share grew 20% and 21% to 98 cents and $3.62, respectively.
Sales in the fourth quarter were $2,523 million, and for the year were $9,402 million, the highest in the companys history. Sales growth was 19% in the fourth quarter and 13% for the full year. Praxair achieved strong sales growth in every geographic region from new business and new plant start-ups.
Operating profit of $484 million grew 23% in the fourth quarter. Full-year operating profit of $1,786 million increased 18% from the prior year. The strong operating leverage was achieved from new business, improved pricing and cost savings from productivity initiatives.
For the full year, cash flow from operations was $1,958 million. Capital expenditures were $1,376 million, which funded a significant number of new on-site supply systems under contract with customers. The company invested $476 million in acquisitions of core industrial gas businesses in North America and Scandinavia, and spent $636 million repurchasing stock, net of issuances. $545 million of stock repurchases have been completed under the $1 billion repurchase program which the company announced in July, 2007. As a result, Praxairs debt-to-capital ratio* was 43.4% at year-end. After-tax return-on-capital ratio* was 15.3% for the year, compared to 14.6% in 2006.
In North America, fourth-quarter and full-year sales reached $1,381 million and $5,185 million, respectively. Sales grew in all major end markets, led by energy and general manufacturing. Overall sales in North America grew 17% in the fourth quarter and 10% for the full year. Operating profit grew 26% in the fourth quarter and 15% for the full year, compared to the prior-year periods.
In Europe, sales in the fourth quarter of $354 million grew 16%. Currency effects contributed 12% to sales growth. For the year, sales reached $1,345 million, up 16% including currency effects of 9%. Underlying sales growth came primarily from new business in Spain and Germany. Fourth-quarter operating profit of $86 million and full-year operating profit of $315 million both rose 18% from the prior-year period.
In South America, fourth-quarter sales of $444 million grew 26% versus the prior year quarter due to favorable currency effects of 17% and higher prices and volumes. Full-year sales were $1,604 million, up 19%, including 10% from currency appreciation. Higher sales to metals and healthcare markets, new project start-ups, and growth from new applications technologies in food and manufacturing drove the underlying sales growth. Operating profit rose 25% to $85 million in the quarter, and 23% to $311 million for the year.
Sales in Asia grew 24% to $210 million in the quarter, and grew 17% to $746 million for the year. Sales to electronics, metals and manufacturing markets continued to be strong in China, India, and Korea. Operating profit in the quarter grew to $34 million from the prior-year period. Full-year operating profit was $121 million versus $111 million in 2006.
Praxair Surface Technologies had fourth-quarter sales of $134 million and sales of $522 million for the year. Strong coatings sales to aerospace customers and growing demand for industrial gas turbine coatings primarily drove sales growth. Fourth-quarter sales rose 17%, and full-year sales grew 16%, excluding the effect of a business divestiture. Operating profit increased 50% to $24 million from the 2006 quarter, and the operating margin improved to 17.9%. For the full year, operating profit grew to $92 million, up 35% over 2006.
For the first quarter of 2008, Praxair expects diluted earnings per share in the range of 93 cents to 96 cents*, excluding the effect of a pension plan settlement charge, which is anticipated to be 3 cents. This represents underlying earnings growth of 15% to 19% above the first quarter of 2007.
For the full year of 2008, Praxair expects year-over-year sales growth in the range of 10% to 14%. The company expects diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $4.00 to $4.20*, excluding the effect of the first quarter pension settlement charge, which represents 10% to 16% growth from 2007. The high end of the guidance range assumes that the U.S. economy remains consistent with 2007. The lower end of the range assumes an economic slowdown in the U.S., which is widely anticipated. Guidance also assumes no significant changes in currency exchange rates. Full-year capital expenditures are expected to be about $1.4 billion, largely supporting on-site production plants which will start up over the next three years across all geographic segments and provide strong revenue and earnings growth through 2010.
Commenting on the years results and business outlook, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Steve Angel said, We finished an outstanding year with a strong fourth quarter. Sales growth was robust globally, led by South America and Asia. We leveraged sales growth into record earnings due to our intensive focus on pricing, productivity, and capital and operational discipline. Demand for new energy supplies, tightening environmental regulations, and infrastructure development in emerging markets will continue to drive significant new business opportunities for Praxair globally. Our record project backlog and our focus on operational excellence in our base business will allow us to continue to produce sustainable earnings growth and strong cash flow. The 25% increase in our dividend which we announced this morning, demonstrates our confidence in our ability to continue to grow free cash flow throughout the economic cycle.
