Exhibit 99.1
Praxair Raises Prices for Silane
DANBURY, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Praxair, Inc. (NYSE: PX) is notifying customers worldwide of a price increase for silane in the range of 20% to 30%, effective immediately or as contracts permit.
This action is being implemented in response to escalating costs for raw materials, energy, packaging and distribution. Growth in the demand for silane is outpacing supply, particularly in the rapidly growing solar cell and liquid-crystal display (LCD) markets. Silane is a key process gas used in the production of semiconductors, thin-film transistor, LCD panels and thin-film solar cells.
This action will allow Praxair to continue to invest in supply and distribution capabilities around the world to meet our customers need for reliable silane supply, said Ray Roberge, president of Praxair Electronics. The company recently commissioned a new silane transfill operation in South Korea.
