Exhibit 99.1
Praxair Distribution Announces Price Actions
DANBURY, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Praxair Distribution, Inc., a subsidiary of Praxair, Inc. (NYSE: PX), announced discount reductions and price increases for its industrial, medical and specialty gas cylinder customers in the U.S. and Canada effective immediately or as otherwise permitted by customer contracts.
Increases will be up to:
30% for helium, fuel gases and rare gases
15% for argon, hydrogen and carbon dioxide/dry ice
10% for oxygen, USP oxygen, nitrogen and nitrous oxide
15% for cylinder rental and facility fees
In some circumstances, price adjustments may be higher or lower than these percentages, depending on product and supply conditions.
These price increases are due in part to escalating labor, energy and fuel costs and reflect the limited global availability of raw materials for certain products, particularly helium.

The company produces, sells and distributes atmospheric and process gases, and high-performance surface coatings.
