Exhibit 99.1
Praxair Reports Record First Quarter; Raises Full-Year Guidance
Adjusted diluted EPS of 99 cents up 22% versus prior year excluding 3 cent pension settlement charge*
Sales growth of 22% versus 2007
Operating cash flow of $379 million; return on capital of 14.8%*
DANBURY, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Praxair, Inc. (NYSE: PX) reported first quarter net income of $307 million and diluted earnings per share of 96 cents, including the impact of a $17 million or 3 cent pension settlement charge. Excluding the pension charge, net income was $318 million and diluted earnings per share was 99 cents, compared to $265 million and 81 cents, respectively, in the prior-year quarter. This represents net income and earnings per share growth of 20% and 22%, respectively, versus the prior-year quarter.*
Sales in the first quarter were a record $2,663 million, up 22% versus $2,175 in the first quarter of 2007. Praxair achieved strong sales growth in every geographic region. Growth came primarily from new business, plant start-ups, and strong pricing trends.
Operating profit, excluding the pension settlement charge, was $499 million, 24% above $403 million in the prior-year quarter.* Improved pricing and cost savings from productivity programs contributed to the strong operating leverage.
Cash flow from operations was $379 million. Capital expenditures were $344 million, which funded primarily new, contracted on-site supply systems for customers. The company invested $40 million in acquisitions, primarily industrial packaged gas businesses in North America, and spent $227 million repurchasing stock, net of issuances. $838 million of stock repurchases have been completed under the $1 billion repurchase program which the company announced in July 2007. Praxairs debt-to-capital ratio was 45.2% at the end of the quarter. After-tax return-on-capital ratio was 14.8%, and return-on-equity was 24.6%*.
In North America, first-quarter sales reached $1,454 million, 21% above the prior year. Sales grew in all major end markets, led by energy and general manufacturing. Operating profit grew 21% to $262 million.
In Europe, sales in the first quarter of $390 million grew 18%. Currency effects contributed 13% to sales growth. Underlying sales growth came primarily from growth in merchant and packaged gases volumes in Spain, Italy, and Germany. First-quarter operating profit of $87 million rose 21% from the prior-year period.
In South America, first-quarter sales of $466 million grew 34% versus the prior year quarter due to higher prices and volumes, and favorable currency effects of 19%. Sales growth came primarily from higher sales to metals and manufacturing markets, and new plant start-ups. Operating profit rose 35% to $89 million in the quarter.
Sales in Asia grew 26% to $211 million in the quarter primarily attributable to strong volume growth. Sales in China, India, and Korea increased to electronics, chemicals and manufacturing markets. Operating profit in the quarter grew 37% to $37 million from the prior-year period, and the operating margin increased to 17.5%.
Praxair Surface Technologies had first-quarter sales of $142 million, 14% above the prior-year quarter. Higher sales to energy markets primarily drove sales growth. Operating profit grew 14% to $24 million from the 2007 quarter.
For the second quarter of 2008, Praxair expects diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.02 to $1.06. This represents earnings growth of 15% to 19% above the second quarter of 2007.
For the full year of 2008, Praxair expects year-over-year sales growth in the range of 13% to 16%. The company expects diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $4.10 to $4.25, excluding the effect of the first-quarter pension settlement charge. This represents 13% to 17% growth from 2007*. Full-year capital expenditures are expected to be about $1.5 billion, supporting an increasing number of contracts for on-site production plants globally which will come on-stream over the next three years and generate strong revenue and earnings growth.
Commenting on the results and business outlook, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Steve Angel said, We had a very strong first quarter. Our results show solid organic sales growth in all our major end markets and geographic regions, led by South America and Asia. We are continuing to see strength in energy markets and emerging economies. Demand for industrial gases for environmental applications is growing. As a result, the size of our project backlog is unprecedented. Therefore, we have a positive outlook in a mixed global economy, and expect that our results will continue to reflect strong year-over-year growth in sales and earnings.
