Exhibit 99.1
Praxair Distribution Announces Price Increases Effective September 1, 2008
DANBURY, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Praxair Distribution, Inc., a subsidiary of Praxair, Inc. (NYSE: PX), is notifying its industrial, medical and specialty gas cylinder customers in the U.S. and Canada of price increases effective September 1, 2008 or as otherwise permitted by customer contracts.

15% for cylinder rental and facility fees
5% for equipment and consumables
In some circumstances, price adjustments may be higher or lower than these percentages.
These actions are being implemented in response to rapidly escalating energy, fuel and other operational costs, current supply/demand imbalances and increases in the cost of capital goods required to support product supply to customers.
