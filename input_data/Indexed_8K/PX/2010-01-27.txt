On January 25, 2010, the Compensation and Management Development Committee of the Board of Directors of Praxair, Inc. established 2010 performance goals for determining performance-based annual variable compensation cash awards that may be paid to executive officers and other high level executives under the 2002 Praxair, Inc. Variable Compensation Plan, as amended (the "Plan"). The Plan, as amended and restated effective January 1, 2008, was filed as Exhibit 10.03 to the Company's 2008 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The financial goals are principally sales, net income and working capital as a percentage of sales, subject to certain adjustments that may be made. The non-financial goals include safety and environmental performance, audit and compliance, productivity, strategic positioning of the business for long term performance, consideration of external factors and performance relative to peer companies, and employee engagement and people development.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
