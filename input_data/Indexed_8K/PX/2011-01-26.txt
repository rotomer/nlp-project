DANBURY, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--January 26, 2011--Praxair, Inc. (NYSE: PX) reported fourth-quarter net income and diluted earnings per share of $133 million and 43 cents, respectively. These results were reduced by $255 million, or 82 cents of diluted earnings per share, related primarily to the previously announced Spanish income tax settlement. Excluding this impact, adjusted net income and diluted earnings per share were $388 million and $1.25, 14% and 15% above the prior-year quarter, respectively.*
Sales in the fourth quarter were $2,623 million, up 9% from $2,407 million in the previous years quarter, due to 8% volume growth. Sales increased across all geographic regions due primarily to electronics, manufacturing, energy and metals markets. Sales rose 3% sequentially from the third quarter due to higher volumes and positive currency effects. Reported operating profit in the fourth quarter was $505 million. Adjusted operating profit of $563 million was 10% above the prior-year quarter due to higher volumes and cost reduction.*
For the full year of 2010, reported net income was $1,195 million. Reported diluted earnings per share was $3.84. Adjusted net income was $1,476 million, up 18% from adjusted 2009 net income. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $4.74, 19% above the adjusted diluted earnings per share of the prior year.*
Full-year sales were $10,116 million, up 13% due primarily to higher volumes. Reported operating profit was $2,082 million. Adjusted operating profit of $2,167 million was 15% above 2009, largely due to volumes and continued leverage from productivity and cost reduction programs.*
For the full year, cash flow from operations was $1,905 million, including the Spanish income tax settlement payment of $481 million. Capital expenditures were $1,388 million. Acquisition expenditures were $148 million, related primarily to the acquisition of an ownership interest in industrial gas businesses in the Middle East. The company paid $551 million of dividends and repurchased $404 million of stock, net of issuances.
Commenting on the financial results and business outlook, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Steve Angel said, Our global business turned in a strong performance in 2010. We achieved record operating profit by leveraging the strong recovery in volumes and new plant start-ups along with ongoing productivity and cost reduction. We continued to invest in capital projects for future growth and established a presence in two growing geographies, Russia and the Middle East.
As we look forward, we expect our project backlog to grow as a result of the significant number of opportunities we are seeing in energy and emerging markets. We continue to augment our base business growth with application technologies that improve our customers processes. We will maintain our intense focus on productivity, project execution and capital discipline. We expect to continue to generate strong cash flow which will fund new projects around the world and return cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.
For the first quarter of 2011, Praxair expects diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.23 to $1.28.

In Europe, fourth-quarter sales were $339 million. Excluding negative currency effects, sales were 6% above the prior year due primarily to higher volumes. Operating profit was $68 million in the quarter, compared to $76 million in the prior-year due to currency effects partially offset by higher volumes.
