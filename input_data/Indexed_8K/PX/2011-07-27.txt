Diluted EPS of $1.38, up 16%
Record project backlog of $2.7 billion

DANBURY, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 27, 2011--Praxair, Inc. (NYSE: PX) reported second-quarter net income and diluted earnings per share of $425 million and $1.38, 15% and 16% above the prior-year quarter, respectively.
Second-quarter sales were $2,858 million, 13% above the previous-year quarter. Sales increased across all geographic regions with continued strong growth from manufacturing, metals and chemicals markets. Sales rose 6% sequentially from the first quarter due primarily to higher volumes and price.
Operating profit in the second quarter was $627 million, up 15% from the prior-year quarter, reflecting higher volumes, higher price and cost savings from productivity programs.
The company generated cash flow from operations in the quarter of $573 million. Capital expenditures, primarily for new production plants under long-term contracts with customers, were $433 million. The company paid dividends of $151 million and purchased $205 million of stock, net of issuances. The after-tax return-on-capital ratio and return on equity for the quarter were 14.7% and 27.1%, respectively.
Commenting on the financial results and business outlook, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Steve Angel said, Our second-quarter results reflect continued strong growth in Asia and South America and moderate growth in North America. Our backlog of new projects under contract and construction reached a record level of $2.7 billion reflecting strong growth in energy markets and emerging economies. Earnings growth continues to outpace sales growth due to our unrelenting focus on pricing and productivity.
Based on a continued, albeit modest, recovery in the second half of the year, we are increasing our guidance to $5.40 to $5.50.
For the full year of 2011, Praxair expects sales in the area of $11.2 billion. Full-year capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $1.8 billion, and the effective tax rate is forecasted to be about 28%.
For the third quarter of 2011, Praxair expects diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.35 to $1.40.
Following is additional detail on second-quarter 2011 results by segment.
In North America, second-quarter sales were $1,371 million, up 7% from the prior-year quarter, due primarily to organic growth. Sales growth was strongest to manufacturing, chemicals and metals markets. Operating profit of $336 million grew 14% from the prior year due primarily to productivity, price and higher volumes.
In Europe, second-quarter sales were $367 million, up 10% from the prior year, primarily due to positive currency effects. Operating profit declined 5% from the prior-year quarter to $69 million due to lower volumes in packaged gases and margin pressures.
In South America, second-quarter sales of $611 million grew 25% versus the prior-year quarter. Excluding currency effects, sales grew 14% due primarily to higher on-site, merchant and packaged gas sales to manufacturing, metals and food and beverage markets and higher pricing. Operating profit was $139 million, 22% above the prior-year quarter, due to higher volumes, price, productivity and currency effects.
Sales in Asia were $341 million in the quarter, up 22% from the prior year driven by strong growth in China, India and Korea. Sales growth came from electronics, metals and chemical customers. Operating profit was $56 million, 27% above the prior-year quarter, due primarily to higher volumes and price.
Praxair Surface Technologies had second-quarter sales of $168 million, up 19% from the prior-year quarter. Sales growth came from higher industrial and aviation coatings volumes. Operating profit of $27 million in the quarter was 23% above the prior-year period due primarily to higher volumes.
