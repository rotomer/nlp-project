Praxair Reports Third-Quarter 2011 Results
Sales of $2.9 billion, 14% above prior-year quarter
Diluted EPS of $1.40, up 16%
Strong pipeline of growth projects in energy and emerging economies
Full-year 2011 diluted EPS guidance of $5.40  $5.45. Fourth-quarter diluted EPS guidance of $1.33  $1.38
DANBURY, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--October 26, 2011--Praxair, Inc. (NYSE: PX) reported third-quarter net income and diluted earnings per share of $429 million and $1.40, 14% and 16% above the prior-year quarter, respectively.
Third-quarter sales were $2,896 million, 14% above the previous-year quarter. Sales increased across all geographic regions with strong growth from manufacturing, metals, energy and chemicals markets. Sales rose 1% sequentially from the second quarter due primarily to higher volumes.
Operating profit in the third quarter was $632 million, up 15% from the prior-year quarter, reflecting higher volumes and prices combined with cost savings from productivity programs.
The company generated strong cash flow from operations in the quarter of $732 million. Operating cash flow funded $458 million of capital expenditures, primarily for new production plants under long-term contracts with customers. The company paid dividends of $150 million and purchased $251 million of stock, net of issuances. The after-tax return-on-capital ratio and return on equity for the quarter both increased, to 14.8% and 28.3%, respectively.*
Commenting on the business outlook, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Steve Angel said, We are continuing to see solid growth in all geographies with the exception of Europe. Proposal activity remains at healthy levels and our backlog of large customer projects under construction is at a record $2.7 billion, 25% above 2010 levels. Most importantly, we remain confident in our ability to bring growth to the bottom line through our commitment to productivity and flawless execution.
For the fourth quarter of 2011, Praxair expects diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.33 to $1.38. This guidance anticipates a headwind from weaker overseas currencies of about 5 cents relative to the third quarter of 2011.
For the full year of 2011, Praxair expects sales in the area of $11.2 billion and diluted earnings per share in the range of $5.40 to $5.45. Excluding the fourth-quarter currency headwinds, this guidance remains at the upper end of prior guidance. Full-year capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $1.8 billion, and the effective tax rate is forecasted to be about 28%.
Following is additional detail on third-quarter 2011 results by segment.
In North America, third-quarter sales were $1,427 million, up 11% from the prior-year quarter, primarily due to organic growth. Sales growth was strongest to manufacturing, energy, chemicals and metals markets. Operating profit of $350 million grew 11% from the prior year due primarily to higher volumes, price and productivity.
In Europe, third-quarter sales were $358 million, up 11% from the prior year, primarily due to positive currency effects. Operating profit increased 10% from the prior-year quarter to $65 million due to positive currency effects slightly offset by continued margin pressures.
In South America, third-quarter sales of $607 million grew 20% versus the prior-year quarter. Excluding currency effects, sales grew 14% due primarily to higher on-site, merchant and packaged-gas sales to manufacturing, metals and food and beverage markets. Operating profit was $140 million, 20% above the prior-year quarter, due to higher volumes, price, productivity and currency effects.
Sales in Asia were $341 million in the quarter, up 19% from the prior year driven by strong growth in China, India, Korea and Thailand. Sales growth came from metals, electronics and chemical customers. Operating profit was $51 million, 34% above the prior-year quarter, due primarily to higher volumes, price and productivity.
Praxair Surface Technologies had third-quarter sales of $163 million, up 16% from the prior-year quarter. Sales growth came primarily from higher volumes of coatings to energy markets. Operating profit of $26 million in the quarter was 13% above the prior-year period due primarily to higher volumes.
