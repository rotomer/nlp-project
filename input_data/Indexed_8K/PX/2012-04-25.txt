Praxair Reports First-Quarter 2012 Results
Sales of $2.8 billion, 5% above prior-year quarter
Net income of $419 million and diluted EPS of $1.38, up 7% versus prior year
Strong growth in North America
Project development activity remains robust
Diluted EPS guidance: 2012 full-year $5.75 to $5.90 and 2Q12 $1.40 - $1.45
DANBURY, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 25, 2012--Praxair, Inc. (NYSE: PX) reported first-quarter net income and diluted earnings per share of $419 million and $1.38, 5% and 7% above the prior-year quarter, respectively.
Sales in the first quarter were $2,840 million, an increase of 5% compared to $2,702 million in the previous year. Sales grew 8% from the prior-year quarter, excluding negative foreign currency and cost pass-through effects. Sales growth was strongest in North America and Asia in the manufacturing, metals and energy markets. Growth was slower in Europe and South America due to weaker economic conditions in those geographies.
Operating profit in the first quarter was $627 million, up 6% from $591 million in the prior-year quarter. The improvement was driven by higher volumes and prices, partially offset by weaker currencies and cost inflation.
First-quarter cash flow from operations was $402 million and capital spending was $483 million, primarily for new production plants under long-term contracts with customers. The company paid dividends of $164 million and repurchased $102 million of stock, net of issuances. The debt-to-capital ratio was 51.3% and debt to EBITDA was 1.9x.* During the quarter, the company issued $600 million of 10-year notes at 2.45% to refund maturing debt and extend the maturity of its debt profile. The after-tax return-on-capital and return on equity for the quarter were 14.2% and 29.4%, respectively.*
Commenting on the financial results and business outlook, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Steve Angel said, Our first-quarter results demonstrated continued strong growth in North America, where we are well-positioned to continue to grow from greater sales to customers in the chemical, energy and manufacturing industries who are benefiting from low natural gas costs. We expect the South America and Asia businesses to continue to grow as we start up new projects driven by increasing consumer demand and infrastructure investment.
New large-project proposal activity continues to be robust and we remain focused on growing the business at continued high levels of profitability and return on capital.
For the second quarter of 2012, Praxair expects diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.40 to $1.45.
For the full year of 2012, Praxair expects sales in the range of $11.6 to $11.9 billion. The company expects diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $5.75 to $5.90. Full-year capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $2.1 to 2.4 billion and the effective tax rate is forecasted to remain at about 28%.
Following is additional detail on first-quarter 2012 results by segment.
In North America, first-quarter sales were $1,398 million up 6% from the prior-year quarter. Underlying sales, excluding the effects of lower natural gas prices and foreign currency translation, grew 10% from higher volumes and higher price, largely attributable to growth in the manufacturing, metals and energy markets. Operating profit of $361 million grew 16% from the prior year due primarily to higher volumes, price and ongoing productivity initiatives.
In Europe, first-quarter sales were $377 million. Sales were 9% above the prior year quarter due primarily to the acquisition of increased ownership of Yara Praxair in Scandinavia, partially offset by negative currency translation and lower packaged gas sales. Operating profit was steady at $68 million, compared to the prior-year quarter, primarily due to negative currency translation, lower volumes and cost increases not fully recovered through price.
In South America, first-quarter sales were $562 million. Sales grew 6% from the prior-year quarter, excluding a 5% negative currency impact, primarily due to higher price and on-site volumes. Operating profit was $115 million as compared to $133 million in the prior-year period due to negative currency translation and higher power and distribution costs.
Sales in Asia were $334 million in the quarter, up 5% from the prior year driven by volume growth in India, China, Korea and Thailand. Sales growth came primarily from metals and chemicals customers. Operating profit was $57 million, as compared to $53 million in the prior-year.
Praxair Surface Technologies had first-quarter sales of $169 million, up 8%, compared to $157 million in the prior-year quarter. Sales growth was driven by higher coating applications on jet engines as well as increased coating of oil and gas drilling equipment. Operating profit increased to $26 million from $25 million in the prior-year quarter due to volume growth.
