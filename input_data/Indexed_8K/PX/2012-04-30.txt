A.
Number, Tenure and Qualifications of Directors; Removal.
1. The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of a Board of Directors consisting of such number of directors as is determined from time to time by resolution adopted by affirmative vote of a majority of the entire Board of Directors; provided, however, that in no event shall the number of directors be less than three. Each director who is serving as a director as of the date of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation shall hold office until the expiration of the term for which he or she has been elected and until his or her successor shall be elected and shall qualify, subject, however, to prior death, resignation, retirement, disqualification or removal from office. At each annual meeting of stockholders after
 
the date of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, each director who does not have a continuing term as provided in the foregoing sentence (and each director for whom a continuing term has expired) shall be elected and shall hold office until the annual meeting next succeeding his or her election and until his or her successor shall be elected and shall qualify, subject, however, to prior death, resignation, retirement, disqualification or removal from office. Except as otherwise required by law, any vacancy on the Board of Directors that results from an increase in the number of directors and any other vacancy occurring in the Board of Directors shall be filled by a majority of the directors then in office, even if less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director.
2. Any director, or the entire Board of Directors, may be removed from office with or without cause but only by the affirmative vote of not less than a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of all the then outstanding shares of Voting Stock (as defined in Article VII, Section C), voting together as one class; provided, however, that if a proposal to remove a director is made by or on behalf of an Interested Person (as defined in Article VII, Section C) or a director who is not an Independent Director (as defined in Article VII, Section C), then such removal shall require the affirmative vote of not less than a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of all the then outstanding shares of Voting Stock, voting together as one class, excluding Voting Stock beneficially owned by such Interested Person.
3. Notwithstanding the foregoing, whenever the holders of any one or more classes or series of stock issued by the Corporation shall have the right, voting separately by class or series, to elect directors, the election, term of office, filling of vacancies and other features of such directorships shall be governed by the terms of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation applicable thereto, as amended.
B. . In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred by statute, the Board of Directors is expressly authorized:
Additional Authority of Board
1. To make, alter, amend or repeal the By-laws of the Corporation. The holders of shares of Voting Stock shall, to the extent such power is at the time conferred on them by applicable law, also have the power to make, alter, amend or repeal the By-laws of the Corporation, provided that any proposal by or on behalf of an Interested Person or a director who is not an Independent Director to make, alter, amend or repeal the By-laws shall require approval by the affirmative vote described in Article VII, Section A, unless either (a) such action has been approved by a majority of the Board of Directors prior to such Interested Person first becoming an Interested Person or (b) prior to such Interested Person first becoming an Interested Person, a majority of the Board of Directors has approved such Interested Person becoming an Interested Person and, subsequently, a majority of the Independent Directors has approved such action.
 
2. To authorize and cause to be executed mortgages and liens upon the real and personal property of the Corporation.
3. To set apart out of any of the funds of the Corporation available for dividends a reserve or reserves for any proper purpose and to abolish any such reserve in the manner in which it was created.
4. By a majority of the whole Board of Directors, to designate one or more committees, each committee to consist of one or more of the directors of the Corporation. The Board of Directors may designate one or more directors as alternate members of any committee, who may replace any absent or disqualified member at any meeting of the committee. The By-laws may provide that in the absence or disqualification of a member of a committee, the member or members thereof present at any meeting and not disqualified from voting, whether or not he or they constitute a quorum, may unanimously appoint another member of the Board of Directors to act at the meeting in the place of any such absent disqualified member. Any such committee, to the extent provided in the resolution of the Board of Directors, or in the By-laws of the Corporation, shall have and may exercise all the powers and authority of the Board of Directors in the management of the business and affairs of the Corporation, and may authorize the seal of the Corporation to be affixed to all papers which may require it; but no such committee shall have the power or authority in reference to amending the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (except that a committee may, to the extent authorized in the resolution or resolutions providing for the issuance of shares of stock adopted by the Board of Directors as provided in Article IV hereof, fix the designations and any of the preferences or rights of such shares relating to dividends, redemption, dissolution, any distribution of assets of the Corporation or the conversion into, or the exchange of such shares for, shares of any other class or classes or any other series of the same or any other class or classes of stock of the Corporation or fix the number of shares of any series of stock or authorize the increase or decrease of the shares of any series), adopting an agreement of merger or consolidation, recommending to the stockholders the sale, lease or exchange of all or substantially all of the Corporation's property and assets, recommending to the stockholders a dissolution of the Corporation or a revocation of a dissolution, or amending the By-laws of the Corporation; and, unless the resolution or By-laws expressly so provide, no such committee shall have the power or authority to declare a dividend, to authorize the issuance of stock or to adopt a certificate of ownership and merger pursuant to Section 253 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.
 
5. When and as authorized by the stockholders in accordance with statute, to sell, lease or exchange all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Corporation, including its goodwill and its corporate franchises, upon such terms and conditions and for such consideration, which may consist in whole or in part of money or property including shares of stock in, and/or other securities of, any other corporation or corporations, as the Board of Directors shall deem expedient and for the best interests of the Corporation.
C. In addition to any other considerations which the Board of Directors may lawfully take into account, in determining whether to take or to refrain from taking corporate action on any matter, including proposing any matter to the stockholders of the Corporation, the Board of Directors may take into account the long-term as well as the short-term interests of the Corporation and its stockholders (including the possibility that these interests may be best served by the continued independence of the Corporation), customers, employees and other constituencies of the Corporation and its subsidiaries, including the effect upon communities in which the Corporation and its subsidiaries do business. In so evaluating any such determination, the Board of Directors shall be deemed to be performing their duties and acting in good faith and in the best interests of the Corporation within the meaning of Section 145 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, or any successor provision.
D. . Subject to the rights of holders of any class or series of stock having a preference over the Common Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, nominations for the election of directors may be made by the Board of Directors or a committee or person appointed by the Board of Directors or by any stockholder entitled to vote in the election of directors generally. However, any stockholder entitled to vote in the election of directors generally may nominate one or more persons for election as directors at an annual meeting only pursuant to the Corporation's notice of such meeting or if written notice of such stockholder's intent to make such nomination or nominations has been received by the Secretary of the Corporation not less than sixty nor more than ninety days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting; provided, however, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is advanced by more than thirty days or delayed by more than sixty days from such anniversary, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so received not earlier than the ninetieth day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of (1) the sixtieth day prior to such annual meeting or (2) the tenth day following the day on which notice of the date of the annual meeting was mailed or public disclosure thereof was made by the Corporation, whichever first occurs. Each such notice shall set forth: (a) the name and address of the stockholder who intends to make the nomination and of the person or persons to be nominated; (b) a representation that the stockholder is a holder of record of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote at such meeting and intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to nominate the person or persons specified in the notice; (c) a description of all arrangements or understandings between the stockholder and each nominee and any other person or persons (naming such
Nomination and Election of Directors
 
person or persons) relating to the nomination or nominations; (d) the class and number of shares of the Corporation which are beneficially owned by such stockholder and the person to be nominated as of the date of such stockholder's notice and by any other stockholders known by such stockholder to be supporting such nominees as of the date of such stockholder's notice; (e) whether and the extent to which any hedging, derivative or other transaction is in place or has been entered into within the prior six months preceding the date of delivery of the notice by or for the benefit of the stockholder with respect to the Corporation or its subsidiaries or any of their respective securities, debt instruments or credit ratings, the effect or intent of which transaction is to give rise to gain or loss as a result of changes in the trading price of such securities or debt instruments or changes in the credit ratings for the Corporation, its subsidiaries or any of their respective securities or debt instruments (or, more generally, changes in the perceived creditworthiness of the Corporation or its subsidiaries), or to increase or decrease the voting power of the stockholder, and if so, a summary of the material terms thereof; (f) such other information regarding each nominee proposed by such stockholder as would be required to be included in a proxy statement filed pursuant to the proxy rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission; and (g) the consent of each nominee to serve as a director of the Corporation if so elected. The Corporation may require any proposed director nominee to furnish such other information as it may reasonably require to comply with applicable law and to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as a director of the Corporation and whether such proposed nominee would be considered independent as a director or as a member of the audit or any other committee of the Board of Directors under the various rules and standards applicable to the Corporation.
In the event that the Secretary is required to call a special meeting of stockholders pursuant to Article VI, Section A, and the related provisions of the By-laws, a stockholder entitled to vote in the election of directors generally may nominate one or more persons for election as directors at a special meeting to the extent contemplated by Article VI, Section A and such provisions of the By-laws.
In the event that the Board of Directors calls a special meeting of stockholders for the purpose of electing one or more directors, any stockholder entitled to vote in the election of directors generally may nominate one or more persons for election as directors at a special meeting only pursuant to the Corporation's notice of meeting or if written notice of such stockholder's intent to make such nomination or nominations, setting forth the information and complying with the form described in the immediately preceding paragraph, has been received by the Secretary of the Corporation not earlier than the ninetieth day prior to such special meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of (i) the sixtieth day prior to such special meeting or (ii) the tenth day following the day on which notice of the date of the special meeting was mailed or public disclosure thereof was made by the Corporation, whichever comes first.
 
No person shall be eligible for election as a director of the Corporation unless nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Article V, Section D. The presiding officer of the meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that a nomination was not made in accordance with the procedures prescribed by this Article V, Section D, and if he or she should so determine, the defective nomination shall be disregarded.
Elections of directors need not be by written ballot unless the By-laws of the Corporation shall so provide.
A. . Meetings of the stockholders may be held at such date, time and place either within or without the State of Delaware, as the By-laws may provide. Any action required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders of the Corporation must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of such stockholders and may not be effected by a consent in writing by any such holders. Subject to the rights of holders of any class or series of stock having a preference over the Common Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, special meetings of the stockholders of the Corporation may be called by, but only by, (a) the Board of Directors of the Corporation at any time pursuant to a resolution approved by a majority of the entire Board of Directors, or (b) as and to the extent required by the By-laws of the Corporation, by the Secretary of the Corporation upon the written request of the holders of record of not less than twenty-five percent (25%) of the voting power of all outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Corporation that have owned such shares continuously for a period of at least one year, with such voting power and ownership to be calculated and determined in the manner specified, and with any limitations as may be set forth, in the Corporation's By-laws. The books of the Corporation may be kept (subject to any provision contained in the statutes) outside the State of Delaware at such place or places as may be designated from time to time by the Board of Directors or in the By-laws of the Corporation.
Meetings of Stockholders; Books
Except as otherwise required by law, by this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, or, with respect to the vote required for the election of directors, by the By-laws of the Corporation, the holders of not less than a majority in voting power of the shares entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders, present in person or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum, and the act of the holders of a majority in voting power of the shares present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote on the subject matter shall be deemed the act of the stockholders. If a quorum shall fail to attend any meeting, the presiding officer may adjourn the meeting to another place, date or time. If a notice of any adjourned special meeting of stockholders is sent to all stockholders entitled to vote thereat, stating that it will be held with one-third (1/3) in
 
voting power of the shares entitled to vote thereat constituting a quorum, then except as otherwise required by law, one-third (1/3) in voting power of the shares entitled to vote at such adjourned meeting, present in person or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum, and, except as otherwise required by law, by this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, or, with respect to the vote required for the election of directors, by the By-laws of the Corporation, all matters shall be determined by the holders of a majority in voting power of the shares present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote on the subject matter.
B. . At any meeting of the stockholders, only such business shall be conducted as shall have been properly brought before such meeting. To be properly brought before an annual meeting, business must be (1) specified in the notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, (2) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (3) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by a stockholder. For business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder, the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of the Corporation. To be timely, a stockholder's notice must be received not less than sixty days nor more than ninety days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting; provided, however, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is advanced by more than thirty days or delayed by more than sixty days from such anniversary, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so received not earlier than the ninetieth day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of (1) the sixtieth day prior to such annual meeting or (2) the tenth day following the date on which notice of the date of the annual meeting was mailed or public disclosure thereof was made, whichever first occurs. Each such notice shall set forth as to each matter the stockholder proposes to bring before the annual meeting (other than a nomination for election as a director, which shall be governed by the requirements of Article V, Section D): (a) a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the annual meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting, (b) the name and address, as they appear on the Corporation's books, of the stockholder proposing such business, (c) the class, series and number of shares of the Corporation which are beneficially owned by the stockholder, (d) whether and the extent to which any hedging, derivative or other transaction is in place or has been entered into within the prior six months preceding the date of delivery of the notice by or for the benefit of the stockholder with respect to the Corporation or its subsidiaries or any of their respective securities, debt instruments or credit ratings, the effect or intent of which transaction is to give rise to gain or loss as a result of changes in the trading price of such securities or debt instruments or changes in the credit ratings for the Corporation, its subsidiaries or any of their respective securities or debt instruments (or, more generally, changes in the perceived creditworthiness of the Corporation or its subsidiaries), or to increase or decrease the voting power of the stockholder, and if so, a summary of the material terms thereof, and (e) any material interest of the stockholder in such business. To be properly brought
Proposals of Stockholders
 
before a special meeting, business must be (i) specified in the notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or by the Secretary of the Corporation pursuant to the applicable provisions of the By-laws or (ii) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by or at the direction of the Board of Directors.
No business shall be conducted at any meeting of the stockholders except in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Article VI, Section B. The presiding officer of the meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that business was not properly brought before the meeting and in accordance with the provisions of this Article VI, Section B, and if he or she should so determine, any such business not properly brought before the meeting shall not be transacted. Nothing herein shall be deemed to affect any rights of stockholders to request inclusion of proposals in the Corporation's proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act").
A. In addition to any affirmative vote required by law or this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the By-laws of the Corporation, and except as otherwise expressly provided in Section B of this Article VII, a Business Transaction (as hereinafter defined) with, or proposed by or on behalf of, any Interested Person (as hereinafter defined) or any Affiliate (as hereinafter defined) of any Interested Person or any person who thereafter would be an Affiliate of such Interested Person shall require approval by the affirmative vote of not less than two-thirds (2/3) of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of all the then outstanding Voting Stock, voting together as one class, excluding Voting Stock beneficially owned by such Interested Person. Such affirmative vote shall be required notwithstanding the fact that no vote may be required, or that a lesser percentage may be specified, by law or in any agreement with any national securities exchange or otherwise.
B. The provisions of Section A of this Article VII shall not be applicable to any particular Business Transaction, and such Business Transaction shall require only such affirmative vote, if any, as is required by law or by any other provision of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the By-laws of the Corporation, or any agreement with any national securities exchange, if either (1) the Business Transaction shall have been approved by a majority of the Board of Directors prior to such Interested Person first becoming an Interested Person or (2) prior to such Interested Person first becoming an Interested Person, a majority of the Board of Directors shall have approved such Interested Person becoming an Interested Person and, subsequently, a majority of the Independent Directors (as hereinafter defined) shall have approved the Business Transaction.
 
C. The following definitions shall apply with respect to this Article VII:
1. The term "Affiliate" shall mean a person that directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controls, or is controlled by, or is under common control with, a specified person.
2. A person shall be a "beneficial owner" of any Capital Stock (a) which such person or any of its Affiliates beneficially owns, directly or indirectly; (b) which such person or any of its Affiliates has, directly or indirectly, (i) the right to acquire (whether such right is exercisable immediately or subject only to the passage of time or the occurrence of one or more events), pursuant to any agreement, arrangement or understanding or upon the exercise of conversion rights, exchange rights, warrants or options, or otherwise, or (ii) the right to vote pursuant to any agreement, arrangement or understanding; provided, however, that a person shall not be deemed the beneficial owner of any security if the agreement, arrangement or understanding to vote such security arises solely from a revocable proxy or consent solicitation made pursuant to and in accordance with the Exchange Act, and is not also then reportable on Schedule 13D under the Exchange Act (or a comparable or successor report); or (c) which is beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, by any other person with which such person or any of its Affiliates has any agreement, arrangement or understanding for the purpose of acquiring, holding, voting or disposing of any shares of Capital Stock (except to the extent permitted by the proviso of clause (b)(ii) above). For the purposes of determining whether a person is an Interested Person pursuant to paragraph (6) of this Section C, the number of shares of Capital Stock deemed to be outstanding shall include shares deemed beneficially owned by such person through application of this paragraph (2) of Section C, but shall not include any other shares of Capital Stock that may be issuable pursuant to any agreement, arrangement or understanding, or upon exercise of conversion rights, warrants or options, or otherwise.

Exhibit 3.2
Effective as of April 27, 2012
SECTION 1. . The annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation shall be held on such date, at such time and at such place within or without the State of Delaware as may be designated by the Board of Directors, for the purpose of electing Directors and for the transaction of such other business as may be properly brought before the meeting.
Annual Meeting
SECTION 2. . (a) Any special meeting of the stockholders shall be held on such date, at such time and at such place within or without the State of Delaware as the Board of Directors may designate in accordance with this Section 2. Special meetings of stockholders may be called by, but only by, (i) the Board of Directors of the Corporation at any time pursuant to a resolution approved by a majority of the entire Board of Directors or (ii) solely to the extent required by Section 2(b), the Secretary of the Corporation.
Special Meetings
(b) A special meeting of the stockholders shall be called by the Secretary upon the written request of the holders of record of not less than twenty-five percent (25%) of the voting power of all outstanding shares of common stock of the Corporation (the "Requisite Percent") that have owned such shares, of record or beneficially, continuously for a period of at least one year, subject to the following:
(1) In order for a special meeting upon stockholder request (a "Stockholder Requested Special Meeting") to be called by the Secretary, a written request for a special meeting (the "Special Meeting Request") stating the purpose of the special meeting and the matters proposed to be acted upon thereat must be signed and dated by the Requisite Percent of record holders of common stock of the Corporation (or their duly authorized agents), must be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation and must set forth:
(i) in the case of any director nominations proposed to be presented at such Stockholder Requested Special Meeting, the information required by the first paragraph of Section D of Article V of the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation;
(ii) in the case of any matter (other than a director nomination) proposed to be conducted at such Stockholder Requested Special Meeting, the information required by the first paragraph of Section B of Article VI of the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation; and
(iii) an agreement by the requesting stockholder(s) to notify the Corporation immediately in the case of any disposition prior to the record date for the Stockholder Requested Special Meeting of common stock of the Corporation owned of record and an acknowledgement that any such disposition shall be deemed a revocation of such Special Meeting Request to the extent of such disposition, such that the number of shares disposed of shall not be included in determining whether the Requisite Percent has been reached.
The Corporation will provide the requesting stockholder(s) with notice of the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to vote at the Stockholder Requested Special Meeting. Each requesting stockholder is required to update the notice delivered pursuant to this Section not later than ten (10) calendar days after such record date to provide any material changes in the foregoing information as of such record date.
Any requesting stockholder may revoke the Special Meeting Request as it pertains to the stock owned by such stockholder at any time by written revocation delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation. If, following any such revocations (and any deemed revocations pursuant to clause (iii) above), the non-revoking stockholders are record owners in the aggregate of less than the Requisite Percent, there shall be no requirement to hold a special meeting. The date on which the Special Meeting Request shall have been delivered to the Corporation is referred to herein as the "Request Receipt Date".
(2) A Special Meeting Request shall not be valid with respect to a requesting stockholder, and such stockholder's shares of Common Stock shall be disregarded in determining if the Requisite Percent has been reached, unless such stockholder is the holder of record of such shares on the Request Receipt Date and either (a) such stockholder has been the holder of record of such shares continuously for a one-year period prior to the Request Receipt Date or (b) the Special Meeting Request is accompanied by evidence of such stockholder's continuous beneficial ownership (as defined for purposes of Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) of such shares for such one-year period from one or more securities intermediaries in a form acceptable to the Board of Directors or its delegee, acting in good faith.
(3) A Special Meeting Request shall not be valid if:
(i) the Special Meeting Request relates to an item of business that is not a proper subject for stockholder action under applicable law;
(ii) the Request Receipt Date is during the period commencing ninety (90) calendar days prior to the first anniversary of the date of the immediately preceding annual meeting and ending on the date of the next annual meeting;
(iii) an identical or substantially similar item (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, a "Similar Item") was presented at any meeting of stockholders held within one hundred and twenty (120) calendar days prior to the Request Receipt Date (and for purposes of this clause (iii), the nomination, election or removal of directors shall be deemed to be a "Similar Item" with respect to all items of business involving the nomination, election or removal of directors, changing the size of the Board of Directors and filling of vacancies and/or newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized number of directors);
 
(iv) a Similar Item is included in the Corporation's notice as an item of business to be brought before an annual or special stockholder meeting that has been called but not yet held or that is called for a date within ninety (90) calendar days of the Request Receipt Date; or
(v) the Special Meeting Request was made in a manner that involved a violation of Section 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or other applicable law.
(4) A Stockholder Requested Special Meeting shall be held at such date and time as may be fixed by the Board of Directors; provided, however, that the Stockholder Requested Special Meeting shall be called for a date not more than ninety (90) calendar days after the Request Receipt Date.
(5) Business transacted at any Stockholder Requested Special Meeting shall be limited to (i) the purpose(s) stated in the valid Special Meeting Request received from the Requisite Percent of record holders and (ii) any additional matters that the Board of Directors determines to include in the Corporation's notice of the meeting. If none of the stockholders who submitted the Special Meeting Request appears or sends a qualified representative to present the matters to be presented for consideration that were specified in the Stockholder Meeting Request, the Corporation need not present such matters for a vote at such meeting, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such matter may have been received by the Corporation.
(6) For the avoidance of doubt, nothing herein shall be deemed to entitle any stockholder to the reimbursement of expenses for soliciting proxies or any other expenses incurred by such stockholder in connection with any stockholder meeting, which expenses shall be borne by such stockholder and not by the Corporation.
SECTION 3. . Except as otherwise provided in these By-Laws or by law, a written notice of each meeting of the stockholders shall be given not less than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) calendar days before the date of the meeting to each stockholder of the Corporation entitled to vote at such meeting at such stockholder's address as it appears on the records of the Corporation. The notice shall state the place, date and hour of the meeting and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called.
Notice of Meetings
SECTION 4. . When a meeting is adjourned to another time or place, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time and place thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken. At the adjourned meeting the stockholders, or the holders of any class of stock entitled to vote separately as a class, as the case may be, may transact any business which might have been transacted by them at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than thirty (30) calendar days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting.
Adjourned Meetings
SECTION 5. . The Chairman shall act as chairman of all meetings of the stockholders.

Organization
 
The Secretary of the Corporation shall act as secretary of all meetings of the stockholders, but, in the absence of the Secretary, the chairman of the meeting may appoint any person to act as secretary of the meeting. It shall be the duty of the Secretary to prepare and make, at least ten (10) calendar days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting, arranged in alphabetical order and showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. Such list shall be open, either at a place within the city where the meeting is to be held, which place shall be specified in the notice of the meeting, or, if not so specified, at the place where the meeting is to be held, for the ten (10) calendar days next preceding the meeting, to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours, and shall be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof and subject to the inspection of any stockholder who may be present.
SECTION 6. . Except as otherwise provided in the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or by law, each stockholder shall be entitled to one vote for each share of the capital stock of the Corporation registered in the name of such stockholder upon the books of the Corporation. Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders may authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder by proxy, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three (3) years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. When directed by the presiding officer or upon the demand of any stockholder, the vote upon any matter before a meeting of stockholders shall be by ballot. Except as otherwise provided by law or by the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, each Director shall be elected by the vote of the majority of the votes cast (meaning the number of shares voted "for" a nominee must exceed the number of shares voted "against" such nominee) at any meeting for the election of Directors at which a quorum is present, provided that the Directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast (instead of by votes cast for or against a nominee) at any meeting (including, without limitation, a special meeting called by the Secretary pursuant to Section 2(b)) at which a quorum is present if as of a date that is fourteen (14) days in advance of the date the Corporation files its definitive proxy statement relating to such meeting (regardless of whether or not thereafter revised or supplemented) with the Securities and Exchange Commission the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected. Shares of the capital stock of the Corporation belonging to the Corporation or to another corporation, if a majority of the shares entitled to vote in the election of directors of such other corporation is held, directly or indirectly, by the Corporation, shall neither be entitled to vote nor be counted for quorum purposes.
Voting; Required Votes
SECTION 7. . At each meeting of stockholders, the chairman of the meeting shall fix and announce the date and time of the opening and the closing of the polls for each matter upon which the stockholders will vote at the meeting and shall determine the order of business and all other matters of procedure. Except to the extent inconsistent with any such rules and regulations as adopted by the Board of Directors, the chairman of the meeting may establish rules, which need not be in writing, to maintain order and safety and for the conduct of the meeting. Without limiting the foregoing, he or she may:

The Board of Directors by resolution shall, in advance of any meeting of stockholders, appoint one or more inspectors, which inspector or inspectors may include individuals who serve the Corporation in other capacities, including, without limitation, as officers, employees, agents or representatives of the Corporation, to act at the meeting and make a written report thereof. One or more persons may be designated by the Board as alternate inspectors to replace any inspector who fails to act. If no inspector or alternate is able to act at a meeting of stockholders, the chairman of the meeting shall appoint one or more inspectors to act at the meeting. Each inspector, before discharging his or her duties, shall take and sign an oath faithfully to execute the duties of inspector with strict impartiality and according to the best of his or her ability. The inspectors shall have the duties prescribed by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.

The Chairman, the President, one or more Vice Presidents, the Secretary, the Treasurer and the Controller shall be elected by the Board of Directors at its first meeting after each annual meeting of the stockholders.

The officers shall have such authority and shall perform such duties as from time to time may be determined by the Board of Directors, the Chairman, the President or a Vice Chairman or as shall be confirmed or required by law or these By-Laws or as shall be incidental to the office.

In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action, as the case may be, the Board of Directors may fix, in advance, a record date, which shall not be more than sixty (60) calendar days nor less than ten (10) calendar days before the date of such meeting, nor more than sixty (60) calendar days prior to any other action.

Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting at the beginning of the meeting to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened.
