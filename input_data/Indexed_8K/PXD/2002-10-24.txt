EXHIBIT 99.1 NEWS RELEASE Investor Relations Contact: Susan Spratlen (972) 444-9001 Pioneer Reports Third Quarter 2002 Results Dallas, Texas, October 24, 2002 -- Pioneer Natural Resources Company ("Pioneer")(NYSE:PXD) (TSE:PXD) today announced financial and operating results for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2002. Third Quarter Results Pioneer reported a net loss of $.9 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2002. Income as adjusted for several unusual items was $15.0 million, or $0.13 per share. As previously disclosed, third quarter results included an extraordinary charge consisting of $15.6 million associated with the repayment of a 20% interest-bearing capital obligation associated with the West Panhandle acquisition and $3.9 million related to the extinguishment of 9.625% bonds. Third quarter results also included a $3.4 million gain on disposition of assets and a $.2 million noncash gain on the remeasurement of the Company's Argentine peso-denominated net monetary assets. For the same period last year, Pioneer reported net income of $24.6 million, or $0.25 per share. Income for the 2001 third quarter as adjusted for a $1.4 million extraordinary gain related to the early extinguishment of debt was $23.2 million, or $0.24 per share. Cash flow from operations for the 2002 third quarter was $87.7 million compared to $122.9 million for the same period of 2001. Third quarter oil sales averaged 29,611 barrels per day (BPD) and natural gas liquids sales averaged 22,693 BPD. Gas sales in the third quarter averaged 385 million cubic feet per day (MMcfpd). On a barrel oil equivalent (BOE) basis, total sales averaged 116,441 BPD. Realized prices for oil and natural gas liquids for the third quarter were $21.77 and $14.10 per barrel, respectively. The realized price for gas was $2.25 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf), with North American gas prices averaging $2.94 per Mcf. Third quarter production costs were reduced to $4.66 per BOE partially due to cost savings on properties associated with the West Panhandle acquisition. Exploration and abandonment costs of $18.3 million for the quarter included $8.5 million of geologic and geophysical expenses including seismic costs, $2.4 million of noncash leasehold abandonments including expired leases and $7.4 million of exploration costs. For the same quarter last year, Pioneer reported oil sales of 32,920 BPD, natural gas liquids sales of 22,158 BPD and gas sales of 374 MMcfpd. Realized prices for the 2001 third quarter were $25.06 per barrel for oil, $15.01 per barrel for natural gas liquids and $2.66 per Mcf for gas. Nine Month Results For the nine months ended September 30, 2002, Pioneer reported net income of $8.3 million, or $0.07 per diluted share. Excluding a $22.3 million extraordinary charge related to the early extinguishment of debt, a $7.7 million noncash charge for the remeasurement of the Argentine peso-denominated net monetary assets and a gain of $4.4 million on the disposition of assets, income as adjusted was $33.9 million or $0.30 per share. For the same period last year, Pioneer reported net income of $120.9 million, or $1.21 per share. Excluding a gain of $8.7 million on the disposition of assets and a $1.4 million extraordinary gain related to the early extinguishment of debt, income as adjusted was $110.8 million or $1.11 per share. Cash flow from operations for the nine-month period was $228.3 million compared to $390.0 million for the same period in 2001. Nine-month oil sales averaged 31,646 BPD and natural gas liquids sales were 22,007 BPD. Gas sales were 352 MMcfpd. On a BOE basis, total sales averaged 112,301 BPD. Realized liquids prices for the 2002 nine-month period were $22.86 per barrel for oil and $13.17 per barrel for natural gas liquids. The realized price for gas was $2.39 per Mcf, with North American gas prices averaging $2.98 per Mcf. For the first nine months of 2001, Pioneer reported oil sales of 34,172 BPD, natural gas liquids sales of 21,383 BPD and gas sales of 358 MMcfpd. Realized prices for the 2001 nine-month period were $24.95 per barrel for oil, $18.87 per barrel for natural gas liquids and $3.40 per Mcf for gas.
Operational Update In southern Tunisia, Pioneer has successfully tested two additional intervals in the Adam exploration well on the Borj El Khadra permit. As previously announced, the Adam 1 well encountered four oil and gas productive zones in the Silurian Acacus sand at a depth of approximately 3,000 meters. The primary zone tested at approximately 3,500 BPD of 41 degree API oil, while a secondary zone tested at 250 BPD. In two recent tests, a lower Acacus interval flowed up to 13.6 Mmcfpd of gas with 1,320 BPD of condensate, and an upper Acacus interval flowed 899 BPD of oil with 430 Mcfpd of gas. The four intervals tested at a combined total rate of approximately 6,000 BPD of oil and condensate and 16 MMcfpd of gas. Pioneer, through a wholly owned subsidiary, has a 40% interest in the well. AGIP Tunisia BV, a wholly owned subsidiary of Eni, is operator with a 50% interest, and Paladin Expro Limited has the remaining 10% interest. The Tunisian state oil company, ETAP, is carried through the exploration phase of activity and has a right to back in for up to a 50% interest in any development by reimbursing its share of past expenditures from production revenues. The field development plan contemplates connecting production from the Adam 1 well to Eni's existing facilities 12 kilometers southwest of the location, pending partner and government approval. Pioneer is the third largest acreage holder onshore Tunisia with permits covering approximately five million acres. Pioneer today announced that it has signed an agreement with Armstrong Resources to acquire a 70% working interest and operatorship in ten state leases on Alaska's North Slope. The leases cover approximately 14,000 acres between the Kuparuk River unit and Thetis Island where Pioneer expects to drill up to three wells this winter. Pioneer announced first production through the deepwater Canyon Express gathering system on September 20, 2002. As a result of hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico, the ramp-up of production from the project has been delayed and full production is now expected in November. The system is designed to handle up to 500 Mmcfpd. Wells from Aconcagua and Camden Hills are now producing via the multiple-field gas gathering system. The project is expected to increase Pioneer's worldwide daily production by 15% to 20% compared to third quarter 2002 levels when it reaches full production rates. The Company now expects initial production from its Devils Tower field in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico to begin no earlier than late third quarter 2003 as a result of delays in the construction of the truss spar production facilities. First production from the Sable field is now expected in mid-to-late first quarter 2003 as a result of delays in the upgrade of the floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) facilities. As a result of the delays, Pioneer now expects 2003 production from its core producing areas in the U.S., Canada, and Argentina, including the Big 4 projects, to be nearer to the lower end of its previously announced range of 165,000 to 180,000 BOE per day. The Company is currently evaluating several projects for inclusion in its 2003 capital budget that are expected to supplement its 2003 production forecast. Pioneer's recent Adam 1 discovery in Tunisia is expected to impact 2003 production, and the Company plans to drill up to six additional exploration wells on nearby blocks, of which three are scheduled for early 2003. Pioneer plans to expand its North America exploration program in Canada during the coming winter drilling season and plans to begin a multi-well program on the Gulf of Mexico shelf later this year. Pioneer's production forecast does not include the potential for future core area property acquisitions that the Company considers complementary to its development and exploration growth strategy. Development of the Pioneer-operated deepwater Falcon field is progressing on schedule with minimal impact from hurricane evacuations. Pioneer has successfully drilled and is completing the two future production wells in the Falcon development plan. Within 30 days, Pioneer expects to spud its first Falcon Corridor exploration prospect for potential tie-in to the Falcon facilities currently under development. At least one additional prospect is expected to be spud in the area before year end. Onshore, Pioneer is currently running five rigs in the Spraberry field, one in the Pawnee field in South Texas and three in the West Panhandle field. There are two rigs active in the Gulf of Mexico and four rigs running in Argentina. Pioneer will begin its winter-access development drilling program in Canada during the fourth quarter and hopes to spud its first exploration test within 30 days. Scott D. Sheffield, Chairman and CEO stated, "With the start-up of Canyon Express, we have entered a new phase in Pioneer's growth plan. With our other three high-impact projects expected to come on production next year, 2003 should be a great year for Pioneer. When the last of our Big 4 projects is fully
producing, we expect our daily production to be up 50% to 60% from mid-2002 levels. Projects in Gabon, Tunisia and now Alaska give us the running room to meet our 10% to 15% annual production growth targets in 2004 through 2006." Financial Outlook The following statements are estimates based on current expectations. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties which may cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from the following statements. The last paragraph of this release addresses certain of the risks and uncertainties to which the Company is subject. Fourth quarter production is expected to average 118 to 124 MBPD on a BOE basis. Included in the mid-point of the estimate is 70 Mmcfpd net to Pioneer from Canyon Express as the project ramps up during the quarter to full production. Fourth quarter lease operating expenses (including production and ad valorem taxes) are expected to average $4.75 to $5.00 per BOE based on today's NYMEX strip prices for oil and gas. Depreciation, depletion and amortization is expected to average $5.50 to $5.75 per BOE. Total exploration and abandonment expense is expected to be $15 million to $30 million. General and administrative expense is expected to be approximately $13 million. Interest expense is expected to be $23 million to $25 million and income taxes are expected to be $2 million as the Company benefits from the carryforward of prior years' net operating losses in the U.S. and Canada. During the third quarter, Pioneer added to its oil hedge position. Additional volumes of oil were hedged for 2003 and 2004 at oil prices ranging from approximately $24 per barrel to $25 per barrel. The Company's oil and gas hedges are outlined in Item 9 of the Form 8-K filed today with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
