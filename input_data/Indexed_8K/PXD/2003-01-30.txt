Results for 2002 include extraordinary charges of $15.6 million related to the repayment of a capital obligation associated with the West Panhandle acquisition and $6.7 million associated with bond repurchases, a $6.9 million noncash charge for the remeasurement of the Argentine peso-denominated net monetary assets and a gain of $4.4 million on the disposition of assets.

Results for 2001 included a gain of $7.7 million on the disposition of assets, a $7.7 million noncash charge on the remeasurement of the Company's Argentine peso-denominated net monetary assets, a $6.0 million bad debt charge related to derivative contracts with Enron North America Corp. and a $3.8 million extraordinary loss associated with bond repurchases.

In 2001, Pioneer reported oil sales of 34,241 BPD, natural gas liquids sales of 21,370 BPD and gas sales of 350 MMcfpd. Realized prices for 2001 were $24.12 per barrel for oil, $17.14 per barrel for natural gas liquids and $3.23 per Mcf for gas. Operational Update With most of the capital spending on large project facilities having been fulfilled during 2002, a higher percentage of the 2003 capital budget will be directed toward drilling activities. The Company plans to drill approximately 450 wells during 2003, up from 229 in 2002, and plans to resume an aggressive development drilling program in its core areas. Pioneer plans to double its development activity, drilling approximately 150 wells in the Spraberry field, 130 wells in the West Panhandle and Hugoton fields, ten wells in the Gulf Coast area, 60 wells in Argentina and 40 wells in Canada. The Company has an active exploration program planned for the first quarter including continued drilling in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico near its Falcon field, a deep gas test on the Gulf of Mexico shelf, two to three wells in Alaska, two to three wells in Tunisia, a well in South Africa, and up to 20 wells in Canada.
The Company is currently running seven rigs in the Permian area, three rigs in the Gulf Coast area, five rigs in the West Panhandle and Hugoton fields and one rig in the Gulf of Mexico. Three rigs are running in Argentina, and Canada has six rigs active in its winter-access development drilling program. Scott D. Sheffield, Chairman and CEO stated, "We're just starting to see the returns from our significant past investments and the positive impact they will have on Pioneer, especially in today's strong commodity price environment. We are looking forward to significant production growth this year and we have visible growth from existing projects of 10 to 15% through 2004. With the big project investments essentially behind us, we plan to ramp up our core-area development drilling activity, continue to appraise existing discoveries to bring these projects on line, and expand our exploration program in 2003. Our focus is on extending this strong pace of production growth into the middle part of the decade." Financial Outlook The following statements are estimates based on current expectations. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties which may cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from the following statements. The last paragraph of this release addresses certain of the risks and uncertainties to which the Company is subject. First quarter 2003 production is expected to average 120,000 to 128,000 BOEs per day. Included in the mid-point of the estimate is 95 Mmcfpd net to Pioneer from Canyon Express, while current net production from the project is approximately 109 Mmcfpd. First quarter lease operating expenses (including production and ad valorem taxes) are expected to average $5.10 to $5.40 per BOE based on today's higher NYMEX strip prices for oil and gas. Depreciation, depletion and amortization is expected to average $5.75 to $6.00 per BOE. Total exploration and abandonment expense is expected to be $20 million to $50 million, as the Company has several exploration wells planned for the quarter. General and administrative expense is expected to be approximately $16 million to $17 million, $2 to $3 million of which relates to estimated additional performance-based compensation costs. Interest expense is expected to be $24 million to $26 million and income taxes, principally in Argentina, are expected to be approximately $2 million as the Company benefits from the carryforward of net operating losses in the U.S. and Canada. The Company's oil and gas hedges are outlined on the attached schedule.

EXHIBIT 99.3 NEWS RELEASE Investor Relations Contact: Susan Spratlen (972) 444-9001 Pioneer Announces Deepwater Gulf of Mexico Discovery Dallas, Texas, January 30, 2003 -- Pioneer Natural Resources Company ("Pioneer") (NYSE:PXD) today announced a discovery on its Harrier prospect near the Falcon field in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. The well was drilled to a total measured depth of 9,510 feet and encountered over 350 feet of gas bearing sand in a single zone. Pioneer operates the block (East Breaks 759) with a 75% working interest. Pioneer plans to develop the field as a single-well subsea tie-back to its Falcon field and expects first production in nine to 15 months.
