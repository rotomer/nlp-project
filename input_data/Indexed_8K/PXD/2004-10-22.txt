PIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY Item 2.06. Material Impairments On October 19, 2004, the officers of Pioneer Natural Resources Company (the "Company") concluded that a material charge for impairment was required under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets" for its assets in the Gabonese Olowi field as development has been postponed indefinitely. As a result of significant increases in projected field development costs, primarily due to recent increases in steel costs, the project does not offer competitive projected returns. The Company has recorded an associated impairment charge in the third quarter of 2004 with an after-tax effect of approximately $10 million. The impairment charge eliminates the carrying value of the Company's Gabonese Olowi field. Additionally, the Company does not expect to have any material future cash expenditures associated with the Olowi field project. 3
