EXHIBIT 99.1 NEWS RELEASE Investor Relations Contact: Susan Spratlen or Chris Paulsen (972) 444-9001 Pioneer Receives Consents to Amend Evergreen's 5.875% Senior Subordinated Notes Due 2012 Dallas, Texas, November 1, 2004 -- Pioneer Natural Resources Company ("Pioneer") (NYSE:PXD) today announced that it has received consents from holders of a majority of the outstanding 5.875% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2012 (the "Notes"), originally issued by Evergreen Resources, Inc. ("Evergreen") pursuant to the previously announced solicitation of consents (the "Consent Solicitation") to amendments to the Indenture dated March 10, 2004, as amended and supplemented, by and between Pioneer (as successor to Evergreen) and Wachovia Bank, National Association, as trustee, governing the Notes. The amendments will be effective today and will: o eliminate the subordination of the right of payment on the Notes to the payment in full of all existing and future senior indebtedness of Pioneer; o amend restrictive covenants applicable to the Notes so that they are the same as the restrictive covenants in Pioneer's senior notes that were originally issued as high-yield notes; and o amend the provisions of the Notes that suspend the restrictive covenants when the Notes have certain investment grade ratings so that those provisions are the same as the suspension and permanent-elimination provisions in Pioneer's senior notes that were originally issued as high-yield notes. Wachovia Bank, National Association was the tabulation agent for the Consent Solicitation, Credit Suisse First Boston LLC was the financial advisor and D.F. King & Co., Inc. was the information agent.
