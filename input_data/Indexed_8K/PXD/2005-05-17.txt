EXHIBIT 99.1 NEWS RELEASE Company Contacts: Investors: Frank Hopkins or Chris Paulsen Media and Public Affairs: Susan Spratlen (972) 444-9001 Pioneer's Fain Gas Plant Shut In Due to Fire No Injuries Sustained Dallas, Texas, May 17, 2005 -- Pioneer Natural Resources Company (NYSE:PXD) today announced that on Sunday, May 15, a mechanical failure occurred in the inlet area of the Fain Gas Plant resulting in a fire. There were no injuries associated with the incident. Pioneer maintains an Emergency Response Action Plan that is followed in the industry and that meets all governmental requirements. This plan insures that personnel are trained and prepared to respond to an incident such as this. Pioneer's Fain Gas Plant is located in the Texas Panhandle, 25 miles north of Amarillo. It is the primary processing facility for Pioneer's gas production from its West Panhandle gas field. The Company is in the process of inspecting the plant and assessing damage to the facilities. Based upon a preliminary review, Pioneer believes the plant can be restored within 60 to 90 days. In the meantime, Pioneer is exploring alternate marketing arrangements to redirect volumes processed at the plant. Prior to the incident, the Company was producing approximately 17,000 barrels oil equivalent per day from the West Panhandle Field. Pioneer is insured on the physical damage to the plant and maintains business interruption insurance to limit the impact of production interruptions extending beyond 30 days. The Company will provide an update as additional information becomes available. Pioneer is a large independent oil and gas exploration and production company with operations in the United States, Argentina, Canada, Equatorial Guinea, Nigeria, South Africa and Tunisia. Pioneer's headquarters are in Dallas. For more information, visit Pioneer's website at www.pioneernrc.com.
