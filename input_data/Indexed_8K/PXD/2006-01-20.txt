EXHIBIT 99.1 NEWS RELEASE Company Contacts: Investors: Frank Hopkins or Chris Paulsen Media and Public Affairs: Susan Spratlen (972) 444-9001 Pioneer Announces Sale of Argentina Operations for $675 Million Dallas, Texas, January 17, 2006 -- Pioneer Natural Resources Company (NYSE:PXD) announced today that the Company has entered into a purchase and sale agreement with Apache Corporation (NYSE:APA) to sell all of Pioneer's operations in Argentina for cash proceeds of approximately $675 million. The transaction, which broadens Pioneer's previously announced plan to divest its non-operated Tierra del Fuego assets in southern Argentina, is expected to close during the first quarter or early second quarter. The agreement is subject to customary closing conditions. Pioneer expects to utilize the proceeds from the divestiture to reduce short-term debt. Production from the Argentina assets was approximately 32,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day during 2005 and was expected to contribute a similar level in 2006. As of January 1, 2006, the properties' net proved reserves were estimated to be approximately 101 million barrels of oil equivalent. "The sale of our Argentina assets is consistent with the strategic initiatives announced last September to deliver enhanced value to our shareholders," said Scott D. Sheffield, Chairman and CEO. "It will allow us to reallocate capital to high-return North America development opportunities." Pioneer is a large independent oil and gas exploration and production company, headquartered in Dallas, with operations in the United States, Canada and Africa.
