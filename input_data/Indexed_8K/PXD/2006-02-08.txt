Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
(a) Filed herewith.

 
Exhibit 99.1
NEWS RELEASE
 
today announced financial and operating results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2005.
Dallas, Texas, February 8, 2006  Pioneer Natural Resources Company (NYSE:PXD)
For the fourth quarter of 2005, Pioneer reported net income of $141 million, or $1.08 per diluted share, an increase of 38% over net income for the same period last year of $102 million, or $.69 per diluted share. Income from continuing operations was $140 million, or $1.07 per diluted share, compared to income from continuing operations of $98 million, or $.66 per diluted share, for the same period in 2004.
Cash flow from operations for the fourth quarter was $372 million compared to $337 million for the same period in 2004. The increase in operating cash flow is attributable to higher prices for oil, gas and natural gas liquids partially offset by cost increases.
During 2005, Pioneer repurchased 20 million shares under announced share repurchase programs for $940 million, including $641 million of the $650 million share repurchase program announced on September 1 for execution during 2005. A $300 million repurchase program was concluded earlier in the year. An additional $350 million share repurchase program is expected to be initiated if the divestitures of Argentina and deepwater Gulf of Mexico assets are successful.
Fourth quarter oil and gas sales averaged 170,619 barrels oil equivalent per day (BOEPD). Fourth quarter oil sales averaged 44,609 barrels per day (BPD) and natural gas liquids sales averaged 21,421 BPD. Gas sales in the fourth quarter averaged 628 million cubic feet per day (MMcfpd). Fourth quarter reported prices for oil and natural gas liquids were $39.15 and $37.41 per barrel, respectively. The worldwide reported price for gas was $6.72 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf). North American reported gas prices averaged $8.37 per Mcf.
Fourth quarter production costs averaged $7.55 per barrel of oil equivalent (BOE). Exploration and abandonment costs were $83 million for the quarter and included $23 million of dry hole and abandonments associated primarily with an unsuccessful well in the Falcon area of the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and unsuccessful wells in Argentina, $28 million of geologic and geophysical expenses including seismic costs and $32 million of delay rentals, unproved acreage abandonments and other related costs.
For the same quarter last year, adjusted to exclude discontinued operations from asset sales, Pioneer reported oil and gas sales of 185,420 BOEPD, including oil sales of 47,459 BPD, natural gas liquids sales of 21,287 BPD and gas sales of 700 MMcfpd. Reported prices for fourth quarter 2004 were $35.96 per barrel for oil, $30.68 per barrel for natural gas liquids and $4.42 per Mcf for gas. North American gas prices averaged $5.24 per Mcf.
For the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, net income was $535 million, or $3.80 per diluted share, compared to $313 million, or $2.46 per diluted share for the prior year. Income from continuing operations was $424 million, or $3.02 per diluted share, compared to income from continuing operations of $299 million, or $2.35 per diluted share, for the same period in 2004. Cash flow from operations for 2005 was a record $1.3 billion compared to $1.1 billion in 2004.
 
Full year 2005 oil and gas sales averaged 175,571 BOEPD, including oil sales of 44,087 BPD, natural gas liquids sales of 19,729 BPD and gas sales of 671 MMcfpd. Reported prices for 2005 were $37.22 per barrel for oil, $32.22 per barrel for natural gas liquids and $5.66 per Mcf for gas, while North American gas prices averaged $6.88 per Mcf.
Full year 2004 oil and gas sales averaged 177,223 BOEPD, including oil sales of 44,982 BPD, natural gas liquids sales of 21,649 BPD and gas sales of 664 MMcfpd. Reported prices for 2004 were $31.60 per barrel for oil, $25.54 per barrel for natural gas liquids and $4.30 per Mcf for gas, while North American gas prices averaged $5.12 per Mcf.
Pioneer's financial results and oil and gas hedges are outlined on the attached schedules. The Company will defer providing guidance ranges for future oil and gas production and operating and other costs until the results of the Gulf of Mexico asset divestiture are known.
Operations Update
During 2005, Pioneer drilled a total of 820 wells, 87% of which were in North America, and had 157 successful wells in the process of being completed and brought on production at the end of the year.
In 2006, Pioneer will significantly increase its drilling activities onshore North America. Most of the onshore program targets resource plays in the U.S. and Canada and includes development of existing fields as well as several pilots to test new plays. The Company will also be active throughout 2006 on two longer-term development projects approved over the last five months, the South Coast gas project offshore South Africa and the Oooguruk oil field development offshore the North Slope of Alaska. Exploration wells are currently drilling in Alaska and offshore Nigeria, and Pioneer also expects increased activity on its acreage in Tunisia this year.

EBITDAX and discretionary cash flow ("DCF") (as defined below) are presented herein, and reconciled to the generally accepted accounting principle ("GAAP") measures of net income and net cash provided by operating activities because of their wide acceptance by the investment community as financial indicators of a company's ability to internally fund exploration and development activities and to service or incur debt. The Company also views the non-GAAP measures of EBITDAX and DCF as useful tools for comparisons of the Company's financial indicators with those of peer companies that follow the full cost method of accounting. EBITDAX and DCF should not be considered as alternatives to net income or net cash provided by operating activities, as defined by GAAP.
 
 
 
 

 
Exhibit 99.2
NEWS RELEASE
 
today announced that as of December 31, 2005, its total proved oil and gas reserves were 987 million barrels oil equivalent, or 5.9 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) natural gas equivalent, including 429 million barrels of crude oil and natural gas liquids and 3.3 Tcf of natural gas. Proved developed reserves account for approximately 62% of total proved reserves. The estimated present value of Pioneer's proved reserves, utilizing a 10% discount rate, was $10.3 billion. The year-end NYMEX equivalent prices utilized to determine proved reserves were $61.04 per barrel of oil and $10.08 per thousand cubic feet of gas.
Dallas, Texas, February 8, 2006  Pioneer Natural Resources Company (NYSE:PXD)
Costs incurred during 2005 totaled $1.3 billion, including $991 million for development and exploration activities, $270 million for acquisitions and $19 million for asset retirement obligations. Of Pioneer's 2005 development and exploration cost incurred, 63% was invested in development costs, 25% was invested in exploration and extension drilling, and 12% was invested in non-drilling related categories including seismic and other geologic and geophysical activities. Costs incurred on acquisitions included $170 million for proved reserves and $99 million for unproved properties. The majority of the unproved property expenditures were focused on adding significant new acreage in onshore U.S. resource plays.
Pioneer added 80 million barrels oil equivalent (MMBOE) of proved reserves during 2005, replacing 118% of production at a finding and development cost of $15.98 per barrel oil equivalent (BOE). Pioneer acquired 80 MMBOE of proved reserves, predominantly in the Spraberry field in West Texas, and added 47 MMBOE of proved reserves from discoveries and field extensions. Proved reserves added from discoveries and field extensions are primarily attributable to 2005 drilling in the Raton field in the U.S., the Horseshoe Canyon and Chinchaga fields in Canada and the Neuquen Basin in Argentina and the approval to begin the development of gas reserves off the south coast of South Africa.
During 2005, Pioneer also produced 68 MMBOE, sold 48 MMBOE and had downward revisions to prior reserve estimates of 47 MMBOE. Argentine proved reserves were revised downward by 21 MMBOE primarily reflecting the results of wells drilled to develop the Company's deep gas reserves in the Neuquen Basin which indicated that the gas reservoirs are more complex and compartmentalized than expected. U.S. revisions were primarily in the Raton field where additional production decline history on producing wells and unexpected drilling results in certain areas of the field led to downward revisions of 23 MMBOE to proved reserves. A number of wells drilled on the northern rim of the field during the second half of 2005 encountered less coal bed methane reservoir than expected due to non-productive volcanic intrusions into the coal interval.
 
On January 17, Pioneer announced that it had entered into a purchase and sale agreement for the sale of its operations in Argentina. Excluding Argentine operations, Pioneer added 93 MMBOE of proved reserves with costs incurred of $1.15 billion during 2005, replacing 167% of production at a finding and development cost of $12.32 per BOE.
th
Netherland, Sewell and Associates, Inc. (NSA), a top oil and gas reserve engineering firm, audited the proved reserves of significant fields. Excluding the Argentina and Gulf of Mexico fields targeted for divestiture, NSA audited approximately 92% of the present value and approximately 93% of the quantity of Pioneer's proved reserves at year-end 2005. NSA also audited the year-end proved reserves of Pioneer's significant fields for 2003 and 2004.
Year-end proved reserves and costs incurred are detailed in the attached supplemental schedule.
For the three years ending in 2005, Pioneer's finding and development cost averaged $10.62 per BOE. Over the three-year period, Pioneer added 492 MMBOE for total costs incurred of $5.2 billion. Three-year average reserve replacement was 255%. For the five years ending in 2005, Pioneer's finding and development cost averaged $9.55 per BOE. Over the five-year period, Pioneer added 685 MMBOE for total costs incurred of $6.5 billion. Five-year average reserve replacement was 248%.
