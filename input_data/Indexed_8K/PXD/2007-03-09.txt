          (e) The Company shall have furnished to the Representative a certificate of the Company, signed in their representative capacities by the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the Company, dated the Closing Date, to the effect that:
     (i) the representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement are true and correct in all material respects on and as of the Closing Date with the same effect as if made on the Closing Date and the Company has complied with all the agreements and satisfied all the conditions on its part to be performed or satisfied at or prior to the Closing Date;
     (ii) no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or stop order preventing or suspending the use of any prospectus relating to the Securities has been issued and no proceedings for that purpose have been, to the Company's knowledge, instituted or threatened by the Commission; and
     (iii) since the date of the most recent financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Final Prospectus, as amended or supplemented prior to the Execution Time, there has been no material adverse effect on the condition (financial or otherwise), earnings, business or properties of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, whether or not arising from transactions in the ordinary course of business, except as set forth in or contemplated in the Final Prospectus, as amended or supplemented prior to the Execution Time, or as described in such certificate;

          (h) Subsequent to the Execution Time, there shall not have been any decrease in the rating of any of the Company's debt securities by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" (as defined for purposes of Rule 436(g) under the Act) or any notice given of any intended or potential decrease in any such rating or of a possible change in any such rating that does not indicate the direction of the possible change; and

the Underwriters, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters severally through the Representative on demand for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) that shall have been incurred by them in connection with the proposed purchase and sale of the Securities.
          8. . The QIU hereby consents to the references to it as set forth under the caption "Underwriting" in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus and in any amendment or supplement thereto made in accordance with Section 5(a) hereof.
QIU Consent
          9. . (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, the directors, officers, employees and agents of each Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or other federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement as originally filed, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Final Prospectus, the Final Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or in all cases any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; provided, however, that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representative specifically for inclusion therein. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have to any Underwriter or to any officer, employee or controlling person of that Underwriter;
Indemnification and Contribution
          (b) (i) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless Goldman, Sachs & Co., in its capacity as QIU, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which the QIU may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon (x) an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement as originally filed, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Final Prospectus, the Final Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, (y) the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or (z) any act or omission to act or any alleged act or omission to act by Goldman, Sachs & Co. as QIU in connection with any transaction contemplated by this Agreement or undertaken in preparing for the purchase, sale and delivery of the Securities, except as to this clause (z) to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability results from the gross negligence or bad faith of Goldman, Sachs & Co. in performing the services as QIU, and will reimburse the QIU for any legal or other
 
expenses reasonably incurred by the QIU in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred.
     (ii) The obligations of the Company under this Section 9(b) shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls the QIU within the meaning of the Act;
          (c) Each Underwriter severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, its officers, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, but only with reference to written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representative specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which any Underwriter may otherwise have. The Company acknowledges that the statements set forth in the last paragraph of the cover page regarding delivery of the Securities and, under the heading "Underwriting", (i) the names listed in the table included in the first paragraph of the text, (ii) the third paragraph of text concerning concessions, (iii) the sixth paragraph of text concerning confirmation of sales to any account over which the Underwriters exercise discretionary authority, (iv) the third sentence in the seventh paragraph of text concerning market making by the Underwriters and (v) the eighth, ninth and tenth paragraphs of text concerning stabilizing transactions, penalty bids and transactions with the Company or interests in the proceeds of the offering, in any Preliminary Final Prospectus and Final Prospectus constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the several Underwriters for inclusion in any Preliminary Final Prospectus, the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Final Prospectus;
          (d) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 9 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 9, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a), (b) or (c) above unless and to the extent the indemnifying party did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a), (b) or (c) above. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to assume the defense thereof and to appoint counsel of the indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); provided, however, that such counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel, and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel (including local counsel) if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying
 
party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. An indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent (x) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding and (y) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of an indemnified party; and
          (e) In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of this Section 9 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, the Company, the QIU and the Underwriters severally agree to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending same) (collectively "") to which the Company and one or more of the Underwriters or the QIU may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and by the Underwriters or the QIU on the other from the offering of the Securities; provided, however, that in no case shall any Underwriter or the QIU (except as may be provided in any agreement among underwriters relating to the offering of the Securities) be responsible for any amount in excess of the total price at which the Securities underwritten and distributed to the public by such Underwriter or QIU was offered to the public. If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Company, the QIU and the Underwriters severally shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters or the QIU on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Benefits received by the Company shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by it, and benefits received by the Underwriters or the QIU shall be deemed to be equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters with respect to the Securities purchased under this Agreement, or the fee payable to the QIU in Section 2 hereof. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters or the QIU on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Company, the QIU and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any
Losses
 
other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (e), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 9, each person who controls an Underwriter or the QIU within the meaning of the Act and each director, officer, employee and agent of an Underwriter or the QIU shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter or the QIU, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act, each officer of the Company and each director of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (e).
          10. . If any one or more Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Securities agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter or Underwriters hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, then the Representative shall have the right, within 24 hours thereafter, to make arrangements for one or more of the non-defaulting Underwriters, or any other underwriters, to purchase all, but not less than all of the unsold Securities in such amounts as may be agreed upon and upon the terms herein set forth; if, however, the Representative shall not have completed such arrangements within such 24-hour period, then the non-defaulting Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the principal amount of Securities set forth opposite their names in hereto bears to the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth opposite the names of all the non-defaulting Underwriters) the Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Company and any non-defaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder.
Default by an Underwriter

The Company agrees that it will not claim that any Underwriter has rendered advisory services of any nature or respect, or owes a fiduciary or similar duty to the Company, in connection with such transaction or the process leading thereto.
