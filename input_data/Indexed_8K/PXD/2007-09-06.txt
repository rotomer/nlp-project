Mark S. Sexton, a member of the board of directors of Pioneer Natural Resources Company (the "Company"), has adopted a prearranged stock trading plan in accordance with guidelines specified by Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Company's Policy on Insider Trading.
 
Rule 10b5-1 permits the implementation of a plan to prearrange sales of securities if the plan is adopted at a time when the seller is not aware of any material non-public information. The rules allow directors and corporate executives to diversify their investment portfolios and avoid concerns about initializing stock transactions while possibly in possession of material non-public information.
 
The plan adopted by Mr. Sexton provides for the sale of up to 50,000 shares over a two-year period, without further action or oversight by Mr. Sexton.  Sales are subject to various minimum price thresholds set forth in the plan.  The sale of shares pursuant to the plan will be disclosed publicly through Form 4 filings as required by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
