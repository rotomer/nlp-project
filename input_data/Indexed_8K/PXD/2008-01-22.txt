The Company will promptly file all reports required to be filed by it with the Commission pursuant to Section 13(a), 13(c) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act for so long as the delivery of a prospectus is required (including in circumstances where such requirement may be satisfied pursuant to Rule 172 of the Act) in connection with the offering or sale of the Securities, and during such same period will advise the Representative, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time when any amendment to the Registration Statement has been filed or becomes effective or any supplement to the Basic Prospectus or any amended Final Prospectus has been filed with the Commission, of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order or of any order preventing or suspending the use of any prospectus relating to the Securities, of the suspension of the qualification of such Securities for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, of the initiation or threatening, to the knowledge of the Company, of any proceeding for any such purpose, or of any request by the Commission for the amending or supplementing of the Registration Statement, the Final Prospectus or for additional information relating to the Securities; and the Company will use its commercially reasonable best efforts to prevent the issuance of any such stop order or any such order preventing or suspending the use of any prospectus relating to the Securities or the suspension of any such qualification and, in the event of the issuance of any such stop order or of any such order preventing or suspending the use of any prospectus relating to the Securities or suspending any such qualification, to use its commercially reasonable best efforts to obtain the withdrawal of such order as soon as possible;
          (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) above, if, at any time when a prospectus relating to the Securities is required to be delivered under the Act (including in circumstances where such requirement may be satisfied pursuant to Rule 172), any event occurs as a result of which the Final Prospectus, as then amended or supplemented, would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein in the light of the circumstances under which they were made not misleading, or if it shall be necessary to amend the
 
Registration Statement or supplement the Final Prospectus to comply with the Act or the Exchange Act, or the respective rules thereunder, the Company will promptly (i) notify the Representative of such event, (ii) prepare and file with the Commission an amendment or supplement which will correct such statement or omission or effect such compliance and (iii) supply any supplemented Final Prospectus to the Representative in such quantities as it may reasonably request;
          (c) As soon as practicable, the Company will make generally available to its security holders an earnings statement or statements of the Company and its subsidiaries which will satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Act and Rule 158 under the Act;
          (d) The Company will furnish to the Representative and counsel for the Underwriters, without charge, copies of the Registration Statement (including exhibits thereto), and to the Representative for delivery to each other Underwriter a copy of the Registration Statement (without exhibits thereto) and, so long as delivery of a prospectus by an Underwriter or dealer may be required by the Act (including in circumstances where such requirement may be satisfied pursuant to Rule 172), as many copies of each Preliminary Final Prospectus, Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and Final Prospectus and any supplement thereto as the Representative may reasonably request. The Company will pay the expenses of printing or other production of all documents relating to the offering;
          (e) The Company will arrange, if necessary, for the qualification of the Securities for sale under the laws of such jurisdictions in the United States of America as the Representative may designate upon consultation with the Company and will maintain such qualifications in effect so long as required for the distribution of the Securities and will pay any fee of the FINRA, in connection with its review of the offering; provided that in no event shall the Company be obligated to qualify to do business in any jurisdiction where it is not now so qualified or to take any action that would subject it to service of process in suits, other than those arising out of the offering or sale of the Securities, in any jurisdiction where it is not now so subject;
          (f) The Company agrees that, unless it obtains the prior written consent of the Representative, and each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, agrees with the Company that, unless it has obtained or will obtain, as the case may be, the prior written consent of the Company and the Representative, it has not made and will not make any offer relating to the Securities that would constitute an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or that would otherwise constitute a "free writing prospectus" (as defined in Rule 405 under the Act) required to be filed by the Company with the Commission or retained by the Company under Rule 433 under the Act (other than (i) one or more term sheets relating to the Securities containing customary information and conveyed to purchasers of Securities and (ii) the electronic roadshow relating to the Securities); provided that the prior written consent of the parties hereto shall be deemed to have been given in respect of the Free Writing Prospectuses included in hereto. Any such free writing prospectus consented to by the Representative or the Company is hereinafter referred to as a "." The Company agrees that (x) it has treated and will treat, as the case may be, each Permitted Free Writing Prospectus as an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and (y) it has complied and will comply,
Schedule I
Permitted Free Writing Prospectus
 
as the case may be, with the requirements of Rules 164 and 433 under the Act applicable to any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, including in respect of timely filing with the Commission, legending and record keeping;
          (g) For the 60-day period immediately following the date hereof (the ""), the Company will not, directly or indirectly, take any of the following actions with respect to its Securities, the Underlying Shares or any securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for any of its Securities or Underlying Shares (""): (i) offer, sell, issue, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of Lock-Up Securities, (ii) offer, sell, issue, contract to sell, or grant any option, right or warrant to purchase from the Company Lock-Up Securities, (iii) enter into any swap, hedge or any other agreement that transfers, in whole or in part, the economic consequences of ownership of Lock-Up Securities, (iv) establish or increase a put equivalent position or liquidate or decrease a call equivalent position in Lock-Up Securities within the meaning of Section 16 of the Exchange Act or (v) file with the Commission a registration statement under the Act relating to Lock-Up Securities, or publicly disclose the intention to take any such action, without the prior written consent of the Representative, except for the offer and sale of securities pursuant to the Company's director and employee stock plans existing on the date hereof and awards thereunder. The initial Lock-Up Period will commence on the date hereof and continue for 60 days after the date hereof or such earlier date that the Representative consents to in writing; provided, however, that if (1) during the last 17 days of the initial Lock-Up Period, the Company releases earnings results or material news or a material event relating to the Company occurs or (2) prior to the expiration of the initial Lock-Up Period, the Company announces that it will release earnings results during the 16-day period beginning on the last day of the initial Lock-Up Period, then in each case the Lock-Up Period will be extended until the expiration of the 18-day period beginning on the date of release of the earnings results or the occurrence of the materials news or material event, as applicable, unless the Representative waives, in writing, such extension. The Company will provide the Representative with notice of any announcement described in clause (2) of the preceding sentence that gives rise to an extension of the Lock-Up Period;
Lock-Up Period
Lock-Up Securities
          (h) The Company will use the net proceeds received by it from the sale of any Securities in the manner specified in the Final Prospectus and the Disclosure Package under the caption "Use of Proceeds";
          (i) In connection with each offering of Securities, the Company will take such steps as it deems necessary to ascertain promptly whether each Preliminary Final Prospectus that supplements the Basic Prospectus and the Final Prospectus prepared in connection with such offering and transmitted for filing, in each case, was received for filing by the Commission, and, in the event that any such prospectuses were not received for filing, it will promptly file any such prospectus not then received for filing;
          (j) The Company agrees to pay the costs and expenses relating to the following matters: (i) the preparation, printing or reproduction and filing with the Commission of the Registration Statement (including financial statements and exhibits thereto), any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, each Preliminary Final Prospectus and Final Prospectus, and each amendment or supplement to any of them; (ii) the printing (or
 
reproduction) and delivery (including postage, air freight charges and charges for counting and packaging) of such copies of the Registration Statement, each Preliminary Final Prospectus, each Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and Final Prospectus, and all amendments or supplements to any of them, as may, in each case, be reasonably requested for use in connection with the offering and sale of the Securities; (iii) the preparation, printing, authentication, issuance and delivery of certificates for the Securities, including any stamp or transfer taxes in connection with the original issuance and sale of the Securities; (iv) the printing (or reproduction) and delivery of this Agreement and all other agreements or documents printed (or reproduced) and delivered in connection with the offering of the Securities; (v) the transportation and other expenses of the Company's officers and employees in connection with presentations to prospective purchasers of the Securities; (vi) the fees and expenses of the Company's accountants and the fees and expenses of counsel for the Company; (vii) any fees and expenses of the Trustee and any agent of the Trustee and the fees and disbursements of counsel for the Trustee in connection with the Indenture and the Securities; (viii) any fees charged by securities rating services for rating the Securities; and (ix) all other costs and expenses of the Company and its representatives incident to the performance by the Company of its obligations hereunder;
          (k) The Company will not take, directly or indirectly, any action designed to or that would constitute or that might reasonably be expected to cause or result in, under the Exchange Act or otherwise, stabilization or manipulation of the price of any security of the Company to facilitate the sale or resale of the Securities; and
          (m) The Company will prepare a final term sheet relating to the Securities, containing only information that describes the final terms of the Securities and otherwise in a form consented to by the Representative, and will file such final term sheet within the period required by Rule 433(d)(5)(ii) on or following the date such final terms have been established for all classes of the offering of the Securities. Any such final term sheet is an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and a Permitted Free Writing Prospectus for purposes of this Agreement. The Company also consents to the use by any Underwriter of a Free Writing Prospectus that contains only (i)(x) information describing the preliminary terms of the Securities or their offering or (y) information that describes the final terms of the Securities or their offering and that is included in the final term sheet of the Company contemplated in the first sentence of this subsection or (ii) other information that is not "issuer information," as defined in Rule 433, it being understood that any such Free Writing Prospectus referred to in clause (i) or (ii) above shall not be an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus for purposes of this Agreement.
 
          6. . The obligations of the Underwriters to purchase the Firm Securities on the First Closing Date and the Optional Securities to be purchased on each Optional Closing Date shall be subject to the accuracy of the representations and warranties on the part of the Company contained herein as of the Execution Time and the Closing Date, to the accuracy of the statements of the Company made in any certificates pursuant to the provisions of this Section, to the performance by the Company of its obligations hereunder and to the following additional conditions:
Conditions to the Obligations of the Underwriters
          (a) Each Preliminary Final Prospectus that supplements the Basic Prospectus and the Final Prospectus shall have been filed with the Commission, in each case, within the applicable time period prescribed for such filing and in accordance with Section 5(a) hereof; no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or any part thereof shall have been issued and no order preventing or suspending the use of any prospectus relating to the Securities shall have been issued and no proceeding for any such purpose shall have been initiated or threatened by the Commission;
          (b) The Representative shall have received from Vinson & Elkins LLP, counsel for the Company, their opinion, dated the Closing Date and addressed to the Representative, to the effect set forth in hereto;
Annex I
          (c) The Representative shall have received from the General Counsel to the Company, his opinion, dated the Closing Date and addressed to the Representative, to the effect set forth in hereto;
Annex II
          (d) The Representative shall have received from Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy LLP, counsel for the Underwriters, such opinion or opinions, dated the Closing Date and addressed to the Representative, with respect to the issuance and sale of the Securities, the Indenture, the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package, the Final Prospectus (together with any supplement thereto) and other related matters as the Representative may reasonably require, and the Company shall have furnished to such counsel such documents as they reasonably require and request for the purpose of enabling them to pass upon such matters;
          (e) The Company shall have furnished to the Representative a certificate of the Company, signed in their representative capacities by the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the Company, dated the Closing Date, to the effect that:
     (i) the representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement are true and correct in all material respects on and as of the Closing Date with the same effect as if made on the Closing Date and the Company has complied with all the agreements and satisfied all the conditions on its part to be performed or satisfied at or prior to the Closing Date;
     (ii) no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or stop order preventing or suspending the use of any prospectus relating to the Securities has been issued and no proceedings for that purpose have
 
been, to the Company's knowledge, instituted or threatened by the Commission; and
     (iii) since the date of the most recent financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Final Prospectus, as amended or supplemented prior to the Execution Time, there has been no material adverse effect on the condition (financial or otherwise), earnings, business or properties of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, whether or not arising from transactions in the ordinary course of business, except as set forth in or contemplated in the Final Prospectus, as amended or supplemented prior to the Execution Time, or as described in such certificate;
          (f) At the Execution Time and the Closing Date, the Representative shall have received from Ernst & Young LLP a letter or letters dated such date or dates, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Representative, together with signed or reproduced copies of such letter or letters for each of the other Underwriters containing statements and information of the type ordinarily included in accountants' "comfort letters" to underwriters with respect to the financial statements and certain financial information contained in the Registration Statement, the Final Prospectus, the Disclosure Package and any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus;
          (g) Subsequent to the Execution Time or, if earlier, the dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement as amended or supplemented prior to the Execution Time, the Final Prospectus as amended or supplemented prior to the Execution Time or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, there shall not have been (i) any change or decrease specified in the letter or letters referred to in paragraph (f) of this Section 6 or (ii) any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the condition (financial or otherwise), earnings, business or properties of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, whether or not arising from transactions in the ordinary course of business, except as set forth in or contemplated in the Final Prospectus, as amended or supplemented prior to the Execution Time, the effect of which, in any case referred to in clause (i) or (ii) above, is, in the sole judgment of the Representative, so material and adverse as to make it impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or delivery of the Securities as contemplated by the Registration Statement, the Final Prospectus and any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus;
          (h) Subsequent to the Execution Time, there shall not have been any decrease in the rating of any of the Company's debt securities by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" (as defined for purposes of Rule 436(g) under the Act) or any notice given of any intended or potential decrease in any such rating or of a possible change in any such rating that does not indicate the direction of the possible change;
          (i) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall have furnished to the Representative such further information, certificates and documents as the Representative may reasonably request; and
 
          (j) At or prior to the Initial Sale Time, the Representative shall have received from each person who is an executive officer of the Company an agreement substantially in the form of .
Exhibit I
     If any of the conditions specified in this Section 6 shall not have been fulfilled in all material respects when and as provided in this Agreement, or if any of the opinions and certificates mentioned above or elsewhere in this Agreement shall not be in all material respects reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Representative, this Agreement and all obligations of the Underwriters hereunder may be canceled at, or at any time prior to, the Closing Date by the Representative. Notice of such cancellation shall be given to the Company in writing or by telephone or facsimile confirmed in writing. The Representative may in its sole discretion waive on behalf of the Underwriters compliance with any conditions to the obligations of the Underwriters hereunder.
     The documents required to be delivered by this Section 6 shall be delivered to the offices of Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy LLP at One Chase Manhattan Plaza, New York, New York 10005 on the Closing Date or such other place as the Representative shall so instruct.
          7. . If the sale of the Securities provided for herein is not consummated because any condition to the obligations of the Underwriters set forth in Section 6 hereof is not satisfied, or because of any refusal, inability or failure on the part of the Company to perform any agreement herein or comply with any provision hereof other than by reason of a default by any of the Underwriters, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters severally through the Representative on demand for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) that shall have been incurred by them in connection with the proposed purchase and sale of the Securities.
Reimbursement of Underwriters' Expenses
          8. . The QIU hereby consents to the references to it as set forth under the caption "Underwriting" in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus and in any amendment or supplement thereto made in accordance with Section 5(a) hereof.
QIU Consent
          9. . (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, the directors, officers, employees and agents of each Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or other federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement as originally filed, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Final Prospectus, the Final Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Furnished Form 8-K, or in all cases any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any
Indemnification and Contribution
 
legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; provided, however, that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representative specifically for inclusion therein. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have to any Underwriter or to any officer, employee or controlling person of that Underwriter;
          (b) (i) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless Credit Suisse, in its capacity as QIU, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which the QIU may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any act or omission to act or any alleged act or omission to act by Credit Suisse as QIU in connection with any transaction contemplated by this Agreement or undertaken in preparing for the purchase, sale and delivery of the Securities, except to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability results from the gross negligence or bad faith of Credit Suisse in performing the services as QIU, and will reimburse the QIU for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the QIU in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred.
     (ii) The obligations of the Company under this Section 9(b) shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls the QIU within the meaning of the Act;
          (c) Each Underwriter severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, its officers, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, but only with reference to written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representative specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which any Underwriter may otherwise have. The Company acknowledges that the statements set forth in the last paragraph of the cover page regarding delivery of the Securities and, under the heading "Underwriting," (i) the names listed in the table included in the first paragraph of the text, (ii) the first sentence of the fourth paragraph of text concerning concessions, (iii) the third sentence in the sixth paragraph of text concerning market making by the Underwriters, (iv) the tenth and eleventh paragraphs of text concerning stabilizing transactions and penalty and (v) the sixteenth paragraph of text concerning transactions with the Company or interests in the proceeds of the offering, in any Preliminary Final Prospectus and Final Prospectus constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the several Underwriters for inclusion in any Preliminary Final Prospectus, the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Final Prospectus;
          (d) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 9 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in
 
respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 9, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a), (b) or (c) above unless and to the extent the indemnifying party did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a), (b) or (c) above. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to assume the defense thereof and to appoint counsel of the indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); provided, however, that such counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel, and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel (including local counsel) if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. An indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent (x) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding and (y) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of an indemnified party; and
          (e) In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of this Section 9 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, the Company, the QIU and the Underwriters severally agree to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending same) (collectively "") to which the Company and one or more of the Underwriters or the QIU may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and by the Underwriters or the QIU on the other from the offering of the Securities; provided, however, that in no case shall any Underwriter or the QIU (except as may be provided in any agreement among underwriters relating to the offering of the Securities) be responsible for any amount in excess of the total price at
Losses
 
which the Securities underwritten and distributed to the public by such Underwriter or QIU was offered to the public. If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Company, the QIU and the Underwriters severally shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters or the QIU on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Benefits received by the Company shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by it, and benefits received by the Underwriters or the QIU shall be deemed to be equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters with respect to the Securities purchased under this Agreement, or the fee payable to the QIU in Section 2 hereof. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters or the QIU on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Company, the QIU and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (e), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 9, each person who controls an Underwriter or the QIU within the meaning of the Act and each director, officer, employee and agent of an Underwriter or the QIU shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter or the QIU, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act, each officer of the Company and each director of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (e).
          10. . If any one or more Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Securities agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter or Underwriters hereunder on either the First Closing Date or any Optional Closing Date and the aggregate principal amount of Offered Securities that such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase does not exceed 10% of the total principal amount of Offered Securities that the Underwriters are obligated to purchase on such Closing Date and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, then the Representative shall have the right, within 24 hours thereafter, to make arrangements for one or more of the non-defaulting Underwriters, or any other underwriters, to purchase all, but not less than all of the unsold Securities in such amounts as may be agreed upon and upon the terms herein set forth; if, however, the Representative shall not have completed such arrangements within such 24-hour period, then the non-defaulting Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the principal amount of Securities set forth opposite their names in hereto bears to the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth opposite the names of all the non-defaulting Underwriters) the Securities which the defaulting
Default by an Underwriter
Schedule II
 
Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase. If any Underwriter or Underwriters so default and the aggregate principal amount of Offered Securities with respect to which such default or defaults occur exceeds 10% of the total principal amount of Offered Securities that the Underwriters are obligated to purchase on such Closing Date and arrangements satisfactory to the Representative and the Company for the purchase of such Offered Securities by other persons are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement will terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except as provided in Section 12 (provided that if such default occurs with respect to Optional Securities after the First Closing Date, this Agreement will not terminate as to the Firm Securities or any Optional Securities purchased prior to such termination). As used in this Agreement, the term "Underwriter" includes any person substituted for an Underwriter under this Section. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Company and any non-defaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder.
          11. . This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Representative, by notice given to the Company prior to delivery of and payment for the Securities, if at any time prior to such time, (i) trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq National Market shall have been suspended or limited or minimum prices shall have been established on any of such Exchanges, (ii) a banking moratorium shall have been declared either by authorities in the United States or New York state, (iii) there shall have occurred a change or development involving a prospective change in United States taxation affecting the Securities or the transfer thereof or the imposition of exchange controls by the United States, or (iv) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, except as existing with similar severity on the date hereof involving the United States, declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war, or other calamity or crisis, except as existing with similar severity on the date hereof the effect of which on financial markets is such as to make it, in the sole judgment of the Representative, impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or delivery of the Securities as contemplated by the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus.
Termination
          12. . The respective agreements, representations, warranties, indemnities and other statements of the Company or its officers and of the Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or the Company or any of the officers, directors, employees, agents or controlling persons referred to in Section 9 hereof, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Securities. The provisions of Sections 7 and 9 hereof shall survive the termination or cancellation of this Agreement.
Representations and Indemnities to Survive
          13. . All communications hereunder will be in writing and effective only on receipt, and, if sent to the Underwriters or the QIU, will be mailed, delivered or telefaxed and confirmed to the Representative (fax no.: (212) 325-4296) and confirmed to it at Eleven Madison Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10010-3629, Attention: LCD-IBD; or, if sent to the Company, will be mailed, delivered or telefaxed to Pioneer Natural Resources Company (fax no.: (972) 969-3552) and confirmed to it at 5205 N.

The seal of the Company, if any, may be in the form of a facsimile thereof and may be impressed, affixed, imprinted or otherwise reproduced on the Debt Securities and Coupons.
Execution of Debt Securities
     Only such Debt Securities and Coupons as shall bear thereon a certificate of authentication substantially in the form hereinbefore recited, signed manually by the Trustee, shall be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose. Such certificate by the Trustee upon any Debt Security or Coupon executed by the Company shall be conclusive evidence that the Debt Security or Coupon so authenticated has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder.
     In case any officer of the Company who shall have signed any of the Debt Securities or Coupons shall cease to be such officer before the Debt Securities or Coupons so signed shall have been authenticated and delivered by the Trustee, or disposed of by the Company, such Debt Securities or Coupons nevertheless may be authenticated and delivered or disposed of as though the Person who signed such Debt Securities or Coupons had not ceased to be such officer of the Company; and any Debt Security or Coupon may be signed on behalf of the Company by such
 
Persons as, at the actual date of the execution of such Debt Security or Coupon, shall be the proper officers of the Company, although at the date of such Debt Security or Coupon or of the execution of this Indenture any such Person was not such officer.
     Section 2.05 . At any time and from time to time after the execution and delivery of this Indenture, the Company may deliver Debt Securities, with appropriate Coupons, if any, of any series executed by the Company to the Trustee for authentication, and the Trustee shall thereupon authenticate and deliver said Debt Securities and Coupons to or upon a Company Order. In authenticating such Debt Securities and Coupons, and accepting the additional responsibilities under this Indenture in relation to such Debt Securities and Coupons, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive, and (subject to Section 7.01) shall be fully protected in relying upon:
Authentication and Delivery of Debt Securities
          (a) a copy of any resolution or resolutions of the Board of Directors, certified by the Secretary or Assistant Secretary of the Company, authorizing the terms of issuance of any series of Debt Securities and Coupons;
          (b) an executed supplemental Indenture, if any;
          (c) an Officers' Certificate; and
          (d) an Opinion of Counsel prepared in accordance with Section 13.05 which shall also state:
          (i) that the form of such Debt Securities and Coupons has been established by or pursuant to a resolution of the Board of Directors or by a supplemental Indenture as permitted by Section 2.01 in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture;
          (ii) that the terms of such Debt Securities and Coupons have been established by or pursuant to a resolution of the Board of Directors or by a supplemental Indenture as permitted by Section 2.03 in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture;
          (iii) that such Debt Securities and Coupons, when authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and issued by the Company in the manner and subject to any conditions specified in such Opinion of Counsel, will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company, enforceable in accordance with their terms except as (A) the enforceability thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and (B) rights of acceleration and the availability of equitable remedies may be limited by equitable principles of general applicability;
          (iv) that the Company has the corporate power to issue such Debt Securities and Coupons and has duly taken all necessary corporate action with respect to such issuance;
 
          (v) that the issuance of such Debt Securities and Coupons will not contravene the charter or by-laws of the Company or result in any material violation of any of the terms or provisions of any law or regulation or of any indenture, mortgage or other agreement known to such counsel by which the Company is bound;
          (vi) that authentication and delivery of such Debt Securities and Coupons and the execution and delivery of any supplemental Indenture will not violate the terms of this Indenture; and
          (vii) such other matters as the Trustee may reasonably request.
     Such Opinion of Counsel need express no opinion as to whether a court in the United States would render a money judgment in a currency other than that of the United States.
     The Trustee shall have the right to decline to authenticate and deliver any Debt Securities or Coupons under this Section 2.05 if the Trustee, being advised by counsel, determines that such action may not lawfully be taken or if the Trustee in good faith by its board of directors or trustees, executive committee or a trust committee of directors, trustees or vice presidents shall determine that such action would expose the Trustee to personal liability to existing Holders.
     The Trustee may appoint an authenticating agent reasonably acceptable to the Company to authenticate Debt Securities and Coupons, if any, of any series. Unless limited by the terms of such appointment, an authenticating agent may authenticate Debt Securities whenever the Trustee may do so. Each reference in this Indenture to authentication by the Trustee includes authentication by such agent. An authenticating agent has the same rights as any Registrar, paying agent or agent for service of notices and demands.
     Unless otherwise provided in the form of Debt Security for any series, each Debt Security shall be dated the date of its authentication.
     Section 2.06 . Unless otherwise provided in the form of Debt Security for any series, the Debt Securities of each series shall be issuable only as Registered Securities in such denominations as shall be specified or contemplated by Section 2.03. In the absence of any such specification with respect to the Debt Securities of any series, the Debt Securities of such series shall be issuable in denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiple thereof.
Denomination of Debt Securities
     Section 2.07 . (a) The Company shall keep or cause to be kept a register for each series of Registered Securities issued hereunder (hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Debt Security Register"), in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Company shall provide for the registration of Registered Securities and the transfer of Registered Securities as in this Article II provided. At all reasonable times the Debt Security Register shall be open for inspection by the Trustee. Subject to Section 2.15, upon due presentment for registration of transfer of any Registered Security at any office or agency to be maintained by the Company in accordance with the provisions of Section 4.02, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in the

In no event may Registered Securities, including Registered Securities received in exchange for Bearer Securities, be exchanged for Bearer Securities.
     Unless and until otherwise determined by the Company by resolution of the Board of Directors, the register of the Company for the purpose of registration, exchange or registration of transfer of the Registered Securities shall be kept at the corporate trust office of the Trustee and, for this purpose, the Trustee shall be designated "Registrar".
     Registered Securities of any series (other than a Global Security, except as set forth below) may be exchanged for a like aggregate principal amount of Registered Securities of the same series of other authorized denominations. Subject to Section 2.15, Registered Securities to be exchanged shall be surrendered at the office or agency to be maintained by the Company as provided in Section 4.02, and the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor the Registered Security or Registered Securities which the Holder making the exchange shall be entitled to receive.
     At the option of the Holder of Bearer Securities of any series, except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 2.03(h) or 2.03(s) with respect to a Global Security representing Bearer Securities, Bearer Securities of such series may be exchanged for Registered Securities (if the Debt Securities of such series are issuable as Registered Securities) or Bearer Securities of the same series, of any authorized denomination or denominations, of like tenor and aggregate principal amount, upon surrender of the Bearer Securities to be exchanged at the office or agency of the Company maintained for such purpose, with all unmatured Coupons and all matured Coupons in Default thereto appertaining; , , that delivery of a Bearer Security shall occur only outside the United States. If such Holder is unable to produce any such unmatured Coupon or Coupons or matured Coupon or Coupons in Default, such exchange may be effected if such Holder's Bearer Securities are accompanied by payment in funds acceptable to the Company and the Trustee in an amount equal to the face amount of such missing Coupon or Coupons, or the surrender of such missing Coupon or Coupons may be waived by the Company and the Trustee if there be furnished to them such security or indemnity as they may require to save each of them and any paying agent harmless. If thereafter such Holder shall surrender to any paying agent any such missing Coupon in respect of which such a payment shall have been made, such Holder shall be entitled to receive the amount of such payment; , , that, except as otherwise provided in Section 2.12, interest represented by Coupons shall be payable only upon presentation and surrender of those Coupons at an office or agency located outside the United States.

        (b) All Registered Securities presented or surrendered for registration of transfer, exchange or payment shall (if so required by the Company, the Trustee or the Registrar) be duly endorsed or be accompanied by a written instrument or instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the Company, the Trustee and the Registrar, duly executed by the Registered Holder or his attorney duly authorized in writing.
     All Debt Securities issued in exchange for or upon transfer of Debt Securities shall be the valid obligations of the Company, evidencing the same debt, and entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as the Debt Securities surrendered for such exchange or transfer.
     No service charge shall be made for any exchange or registration of transfer of Debt Securities (except as provided by Section 2.09), but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax, fee, assessment or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto, other than those expressly provided in this Indenture to be made at the Company's own expense or without expense or without charge to the Holders.
     The Company shall not be required (i) to issue, register the transfer of or exchange any Debt Securities for a period of 15 days next preceding any mailing of notice of redemption of Debt Securities of such series or (ii) to register the transfer of or exchange any Debt Securities selected, called or being called for redemption; , , that, if specified pursuant to Section 2.03, any Bearer Securities of any series that are exchangeable for Registered Securities and that are called for redemption pursuant to Section 3.02 may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be exchanged for one or more Registered Securities of such series during the period preceding the redemption date therefor.

     Prior to the due presentation for registration of transfer of any Debt Security, the Company, the Trustee, any paying agent or any Registrar may deem and treat the Person in whose name a Debt Security is registered as the absolute owner of such Debt Security for the purpose of receiving payment of principal of, and premium, if any, and interest on, such Debt Security and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not such Debt Security is overdue, and none of the Company, the Trustee, any paying agent or Registrar shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
     None of the Company, the Trustee, any agent of the Trustee, any paying agent or any Registrar will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to, or payments made on account of, beneficial ownership interests of a Global Security or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interests.
     Section 2.08 .

Securities in lieu of which they are issued, in registered form or, if authorized, in bearer form with one or more Coupons or without Coupons, and with such omissions, insertions and variations as may be appropriate for temporary Debt Securities and Coupons, all as may be determined by the Company with the concurrence of the Trustee. Temporary Debt Securities and Coupons may contain such reference to any provisions of this Indenture as may be appropriate. Every temporary Debt Security shall be executed by the Company and be authenticated by the Trustee upon the same conditions and in substantially the same manner, and with like effect, as the definitive Debt Securities.
     If temporary Debt Securities of any series are issued, the Company will cause definitive Debt Securities of such series to be prepared without unreasonable delay. Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 2.03(h)(iii) with respect to a series of Debt Securities issuable as Bearer Securities or as one or more Global Securities representing individual Bearer Securities of the series, (a) after the preparation of definitive Debt Securities of such series, the temporary Debt Securities of such series shall be exchangeable for definitive Debt Securities of such series upon surrender of the temporary Debt Securities of such series at the office or agency of the Company at a Place of Payment for such series, without charge to the Holder thereof, except as provided in Section 2.07 in connection with a transfer and except that a Person receiving definitive Bearer Securities shall bear the cost of insurance, postage, transportation and the like unless otherwise specified pursuant to Section 2.03, and (b) upon surrender for cancellation of any one or more temporary Debt Securities of any series (accompanied by any unmatured Coupons appertaining thereto), the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a like principal amount of definitive Debt Securities of the same series of authorized denominations and of like tenor; , , that no definitive Bearer Security shall be delivered in exchange for a temporary Registered Security; and , , , that delivery of a Global Security representing individual Bearer Securities or a Bearer Security shall occur only outside the United States. Until so exchanged, temporary Debt Securities of any series shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Debt Securities of such series, except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 2.03(h)(ii) with respect to the payment of interest on Global Securities in temporary form.

     Upon any exchange of a portion of a temporary Global Security for a definitive Global Security or for the individual Debt Securities represented thereby pursuant to Section 2.07 or this Section 2.08, the temporary Global Security shall be endorsed by the Trustee to reflect the reduction of the principal amount evidenced thereby, whereupon the principal amount of such temporary Global Security shall be reduced for all purposes by the amount to be exchanged and endorsed.

If (a) any mutilated Debt Security or any mutilated Coupon with the Coupon Security to which it appertains (and all unmatured Coupons attached thereto) is surrendered to the Trustee at its corporate trust office (in the case of Registered Securities) or at its principal London office (in the case of Bearer Securities) or (b) the Company and the Trustee receive evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Debt Security or any Coupon, and there is delivered to the Company and the Trustee such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them and any paying agent harmless, and neither the Company nor the Trustee receives notice that such Debt Security or Coupon has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, then the Company shall execute and, upon a Company Order, the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in exchange for or in lieu of any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Debt Security or in exchange for the Coupon Security to which such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Coupon appertained, a new Debt Security of the same series of like tenor, form, terms and principal amount, bearing a number not contemporaneously Outstanding, and, in the case of a Coupon Security, with such Coupons attached thereto that neither gain nor loss in interest shall result from such exchange or substitution. Upon the issuance of any substituted Debt Security, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax, fee, assessment or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses connected therewith. In case any Debt Security or Coupon which has matured or is about to mature or which has been called for redemption shall become mutilated or be destroyed, lost or stolen, the Company may, instead of issuing a substituted Debt Security or Coupon, pay or authorize the payment of the same (without surrender thereof except in the case of a mutilated Debt Security or Coupon) if the applicant for such payment shall furnish the Company and the Trustee with such security or indemnity as either may require to save it harmless from all risk, however remote, and, in case of destruction, loss or theft, evidence to the satisfaction of the Company and the Trustee of the destruction, loss or theft of such Debt Security or Coupon and of the ownership thereof; , , that payment of principal of, and premium, if any, and interest on, Bearer Securities or Coupons shall, except as otherwise provided in Section 2.12, be payable only at an office or agency located outside the United States.

All Debt Securities and Coupons, if any, shall be held and owned upon the express condition that the foregoing provisions are exclusive with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Debt Securities or Coupons, and shall preclude any and all other rights or remedies, notwithstanding any law or statute existing or hereafter enacted to the contrary with respect to the replacement or payment of negotiable instruments or other securities without their surrender.

All canceled Debt Securities and Coupons held by the Trustee shall be destroyed (subject to the record retention requirements of the Exchange Act) and certification of their destruction delivered to the Company, unless otherwise directed. On request of the Company, the Trustee shall deliver to the Company canceled Debt Securities and Coupons held by the Trustee. If the Company shall acquire any of the Debt Securities or Coupons, however, such acquisition shall not operate as a redemption or satisfaction of the indebtedness represented thereby unless and until the same are delivered or surrendered to the Trustee for cancellation. The Company may not issue new Debt Securities or Coupons to replace Debt Securities or Coupons it has redeemed, paid or delivered to the Trustee for cancellation.
     Section 2.11 . Nothing in this Indenture or in the Debt Securities or Coupons, expressed or implied, shall give or be construed to give to any Person, other than the parties hereto, the Holders or any Registrar or paying agent, any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this Indenture, or under any covenant, condition or provision herein contained; all its covenants, conditions and provisions being for the sole benefit of the parties hereto, the Holders and any Registrar and paying agents.
Provisions of the Indenture and Debt Securities for the Sole Benefit of the Parties and the Holders
     Section 2.12 . (a) Interest on any Registered Security that is payable and is punctually paid or duly provided for on any interest payment date shall be paid to the Person in whose name such Registered Security is registered at the close of business on the regular record date for such interest notwithstanding the cancellation of such Registered Security upon any transfer or exchange subsequent to the regular record date. In case a Coupon Security of any series is surrendered in exchange for a Registered Security of such series after the close of business (at an office or agency in a Place of Payment for such series) on any regular record date and before the opening of business (at such office or agency) on the next succeeding interest payment date, such Coupon Security shall be surrendered without the Coupon relating to such interest payment date and interest will not be payable on such interest payment date in respect of the Registered Security issued in exchange for such Coupon Security, but will be payable only to the Holder of such Coupon when due in accordance with the provisions of this Indenture. Payment of interest on Registered Securities shall be made at the corporate trust office of the Trustee (except as otherwise specified pursuant to Section 2.03), or at the option of the Company, by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address shall appear in the Debt Security Register or, if provided pursuant to Section 2.03 and in accordance with arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee, at the option of the Registered Holder by wire transfer to an account designated by the Registered Holder.
Payment of Interest; Interest Rights Preserved
          (b) No interest shall be payable with respect to a Bearer Security or Coupon unless such certification requirements as are specified pursuant to Section 2.03(h)(iii) are satisfied with respect to such Bearer Security or Coupon. Interest on any Coupon Security that is payable and is punctually paid or duly provided for on any interest payment date shall be paid to
 
the Holder of the Coupon that has matured on such interest payment date upon surrender of such Coupon on such interest payment date at the principal London office of the Trustee or at such other Place of Payment outside the United States specified pursuant to Section 2.03.
     Interest on any Bearer Security (other than a Coupon Security) that is payable and is punctually paid or duly provided for on any interest payment date shall be paid to the Holder of the Bearer Security upon presentation of such Bearer Security and notation thereon on such interest payment date at the principal London office of the Trustee or at such other Place of Payment outside the United States specified pursuant to Section 2.03.

If such payment at the offices of all paying agents outside the United States becomes illegal or is effectively precluded because of the imposition of exchange controls or similar restrictions on the full payment or receipt of such amounts in Dollars, then, to the extent permitted by United States tax law, the Company will appoint an office or agent in the United States at which such payment may be made. Unless otherwise specified pursuant to Section 2.03, at the direction of the Holder of any Bearer Security or Coupon payable in a Foreign Currency, payment on such Bearer Security or Coupon will be made by a check drawn on a bank outside the United States or, in accordance with arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee, by wire transfer to an appropriate account maintained by such Holder outside the United States. Except as provided in this paragraph, no payment on any Bearer Security or Coupon will be made by mail to an address in the United States or by transfer to an account in the United States.
          (c) Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.12 and Section 2.17, each Debt Security of a particular series delivered under this Indenture upon registration of transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of any other Debt Security of the same series shall carry the rights to interest accrued and unpaid, and to accrue, which were carried by such other Debt Security.

          (c) For the purposes of calculating the principal amount of Debt Securities of any series denominated in a Foreign Currency or in units of two or more Foreign Currencies (including European Currency Units) for any purpose under this Indenture, the principal amount
 
of such Debt Securities at any time Outstanding shall be deemed to be the Dollar Equivalent of such principal amount as of the date of any such calculation.
     In the event any Foreign Currency or currencies or units of two or more Currencies in which any payment with respect to any series of Debt Securities may be made ceases to be a freely convertible Currency on United States Currency markets, for any date thereafter on which payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on, the Debt Securities of a series is due, the Company shall select the Currency of payment for use on such date, all as provided in the Debt Securities of such series. In such event, the Company shall, as provided in the Debt Securities of such series, notify the Trustee of the Currency which it has selected to constitute the funds necessary to meet the Company's obligations on such payment date and of the amount of such Currency to be paid. Such amount shall be determined as provided in the Debt Securities of such series.

          (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 2.15 or of Section 2.07 to the contrary, and subject to the provisions of paragraph (c) below, unless the terms of a Global Security expressly permit such Global Security to be exchanged in whole or in part for definitive Debt Securities in registered form, a Global Security may be transferred, in whole but not in part and in the manner provided in Section 2.07, only by the Depositary to a nominee of the Depositary for such Global Security, or by a nominee of the Depositary to the Depositary or another nominee of the Depositary, or by the Depositary or a nominee of the Depositary to a successor Depositary for such Global Security selected or approved by the Company, or to a nominee of such successor Depositary.
          (c) (i) If at any time the Depositary for a Global Security or Securities notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for such Global Security or Securities or if at any time the Depositary for the Debt Securities for such series shall no longer be eligible or in good standing under the Exchange Act or other applicable statute, rule or regulation, the Company shall appoint a successor Depositary with respect to such Global Security or Securities. If a successor Depositary for such Global Security or Securities is not appointed by the Company within 90 days after the Company receives such notice or becomes aware of such ineligibility, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee or its agent, upon receipt of a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of such individual Debt Securities of such series in exchange for such Global Security, will authenticate and deliver, individual Debt Securities of such series of like tenor and terms in definitive form in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Global Security in exchange for such Global Security or Securities.
          (ii) The Company may at any time and in its sole discretion determine that the Debt Securities of any series or portion thereof issued or issuable in the form of one or more Global Securities shall no longer be represented by such Global Security or Securities. In such event the Company will execute, and the Trustee, upon receipt of a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of individual Debt Securities of such series in exchange in whole or in part for such Global Security, will authenticate and deliver individual Debt Securities of such series of like tenor and terms in definitive form in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of such series or portion thereof in exchange for such Global Security or Securities.
          (iii) If specified by the Company pursuant to Sections 2.01 and 2.03 with respect to Debt Securities issued or issuable in the form of a Global Security, the Depositary for such Global Security may surrender such Global Security in exchange in
 
whole or in part for individual Debt Securities of such series of like tenor and terms in definitive form on such terms as are acceptable to the Company, the Trustee and such Depositary. Thereupon the Company shall execute, and the Trustee or its agent upon receipt of a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of definitive Debt Securities of such series shall authenticate and deliver, without service charge, (A) to each Person specified by such Depositary a new Debt Security or Securities of the same series of like tenor and terms and of any authorized denomination as requested by such Person in aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for such Person's beneficial interest in the Global Security; and (B) to such Depositary a new Global Security of like tenor and terms and in an authorized denomination equal to the difference, if any, between the principal amount of the surrendered Global Security and the aggregate principal amount of Debt Securities delivered to Holders thereof.
          (iv) In any exchange provided for in any of the preceding three paragraphs, the Company will execute and the Trustee or its agent will authenticate and deliver individual Debt Securities. In case a Coupon Security of any series is surrendered in exchange for a Registered Security of such series after the close of business (at an office or agency in a Place of Payment for such series) on any special record date and before the opening of business (at such office or agency) on the related proposed date of payment of Defaulted Interest, such Coupon Security shall be surrendered without the Coupon relating to such proposed date of payment and Defaulted Interest will not be payable on such proposed date of payment in respect of the Registered Security issued in exchange for such Coupon Security, but will be payable only to the Holder of such Coupon when due in accordance with the provisions of this Indenture. Upon the exchange of the entire principal amount of a Global Security for individual Debt Securities, such Global Security shall be canceled by the Trustee or its agent. Except as provided in the preceding paragraph, Registered Securities issued in exchange for a Global Security pursuant to this Section 2.15 shall be registered in such names and in such authorized denominations as the Depositary for such Global Security, pursuant to instructions from its direct or indirect participants or otherwise, shall instruct the Trustee or the Registrar. The Trustee or the Registrar shall deliver such Registered Securities to the Persons in whose names such Registered Securities are so registered.
          (v) Payments in respect of the principal of and interest on any Debt Securities registered in the name of the Depositary or its nominee will be payable to the Depositary or such nominee in its capacity as the registered owner of such Global Security. The Company and the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name the Debt Securities, including the Global Security, are registered as the owner thereof for the purpose of receiving such payments and for any and all other purposes whatsoever. None of the Company, the Trustee, any Registrar, the paying agent or any agent of the Company or the Trustee will have any responsibility or liability for (A) any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of the beneficial ownership interests of the Global Security by the Depositary or its nominee or any of the Depositary's direct or indirect participants, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records of the Depositary, its nominee or any of its direct or indirect participants relating to the
 
beneficial ownership interests of the Global Security, (B) the payments to the beneficial owners of the Global Security of amounts paid to the Depositary or its nominee, or (C) any other matter relating to the actions and practices of the Depositary, its nominee or any of its direct or indirect participants. None of the Company, the Trustee or any such agent will be liable for any delay by the Depositary, its nominee, or any of its direct or indirect participants in identifying the beneficial owners of the Debt Securities, and the Company and the Trustee may conclusively rely on, and will be protected in relying on, instructions from the Depositary or its nominee for all purposes (including with respect to the registration and delivery, and the respective principal amounts, of the Debt Securities to be issued).
     The Trustee shall deliver individual Bearer Securities issued in exchange for a Global Security pursuant to this Section 2.15 to the Persons and in such authorized denominations as the Depositary for such Global Security, pursuant to instructions from its direct or indirect participants or otherwise, shall instruct the Trustee; , , that individual Bearer Securities shall be delivered in exchange for a Global Security only in accordance with the procedures as may be specified pursuant to Section 2.03.
provided
however
     Notwithstanding the foregoing, the exchange of Bearer Securities for Registered Securities will be subject to the provisions of United States income tax laws and regulations applicable to debt Securities in effect at the time of such exchange.
     Section 2.16 . Notwithstanding any contrary provision herein, if all Debt Securities of a series are not to be originally issued at one time, it shall not be necessary for the Company to deliver to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate, resolutions of the Board of Directors, supplemental Indenture, Opinion of Counsel or written order or any other document otherwise required pursuant to Section 2.01, 2.03, 2.05 or 13.05 at or prior to the time of authentication of each Debt Security of such series if such documents are delivered to the Trustee or its agent at or prior to the authentication upon original issuance of the first such Debt Security of such series to be issued; , that any subsequent request by the Company to the Trustee to authenticate Debt Securities of such series upon original issuance shall constitute a representation and warranty by the Company that, as of the date of such request, the statements made in the Officers' Certificate delivered pursuant to Section 2.05 or 13.05 shall be true and correct as if made on such date and that the Opinion of Counsel delivered at or prior to such time of authentication of an original issuance of Debt Securities shall specifically state that it shall relate to all subsequent issuances of Debt Securities of such series that are identical to the Debt Securities issued in the first issuance of Debt Securities of such series.
Medium Term Securities
provided
     A Company Order delivered by the Company to the Trustee in the circumstances set forth in the preceding paragraph, may provide that Debt Securities which are the subject thereof will be authenticated and delivered by the Trustee or its agent on original issue from time to time upon the telephonic or written order of Persons designated in such written order (any such telephonic instructions to be promptly confirmed in writing by such Person) and that such Persons are authorized to determine, consistent with the Officers' Certificate, supplemental Indenture or resolution of the Board of Directors relating to such written order, such terms and

Defaulted Interest
          (i) The Company may elect to make payment of any Defaulted Interest to the Persons in whose names the Registered Securities of such series are registered at the close of business on a special record date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest, which shall be fixed in the following manner. The Company shall promptly notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of Defaulted Interest proposed to be paid on each such Registered Security of such series and the date of the proposed payment, and at the same time the Company shall deposit with the Trustee an amount of money equal to the aggregate amount proposed to be paid in respect of such Defaulted Interest or shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for such deposit prior to the date of the proposed payment, such money when deposited to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such Defaulted Interest as in this clause provided. Thereupon the Trustee shall fix a special record date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest which shall be not more than 15 days and not less than 10 days prior to the date of the proposed payment and not less than 10 days after the receipt by the Trustee of the notice of the proposed payment. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company of such special record date and, in the name and at the expense of the Company, shall cause notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the special record date therefor to be mailed, first class postage pre-paid, to each Holder thereof at its address as it appears in the Security Register, not less than 10 days prior to such special record date. Notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the special record date therefor having been so mailed, such Defaulted Interest shall be paid to the Persons in whose names the Registered Securities of such series are registered at the close of business on such special record date. In case a Coupon Security of any such series is surrendered in exchange for a Registered Security of such series after the close of business (at an office or agency in a Place of Payment for such series) on any special record date and before the opening of business (at such office or agency) on the related proposed date of payment of Defaulted Interest, such Coupon Security shall be surrendered without the Coupon relating to such proposed date of payment and Defaulted Interest will not be payable on such proposed date of payment in respect of the Registered Security issued in exchange for such Coupon Security, but will be payable only to the Holder of such Coupon when due in accordance with the provisions of this Indenture.
 
          (ii) The Company may make payment of any Defaulted Interest on the Registered Securities of such series in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Registered Securities of such series may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, if, after notice given by the Company to the Trustee of the proposed payment pursuant to this clause, such manner of payment shall be deemed practicable by the Trustee.
          (b) Any Defaulted Interest payable in respect of Bearer Securities of any series shall be payable pursuant to such procedures as may be satisfactory to the Trustee in such manner that there is no discrimination between the Holders of Registered Securities (if any) and Bearer Securities of such series, and notice of the payment date therefor shall be given by the Trustee, in the name and at the expense of the Company, in the manner provided in Section 13.03 not more than 25 days and not less than 20 days prior to the date of the proposed payment.
     Section 2.18 . The Company may provide pursuant to Section 2.03 for Debt Securities of any series that (a) the obligation, if any, of the Company to pay the principal of, and premium, if any, and interest on, the Debt Securities of any series in a Foreign Currency or Dollars (the "Designated Currency") as may be specified pursuant to Section 2.03 is of the essence and agrees that, to the fullest extent possible under applicable law, judgments in respect of Debt Securities of such series shall be given in the Designated Currency; (b) the obligation of the Company to make payments in the Designated Currency of the principal of, and premium, if any, and interest on, such Debt Securities shall, notwithstanding any payment in any other Currency (whether pursuant to a judgment or otherwise), be discharged only to the extent of the amount in the Designated Currency that the Holder receiving such payment may, in accordance with normal banking procedures, purchase with the sum paid in such other Currency (after any premium and cost of exchange) on the business day in the country of issue of the Designated Currency or in the international banking community (in the case of a composite currency) immediately following the day on which such Holder receives such payment; (c) if the amount in the Designated Currency that may be so purchased for any reason falls short of the amount originally due, the Company shall pay such additional amounts as may be necessary to compensate for such shortfall; and (d) any obligation of the Company not discharged by such payment shall be due as a separate and independent obligation and, until discharged as provided herein, shall continue in full force and effect.
Judgments
     Section 2.19 . The Company in issuing the Securities may use "CUSIP" numbers (if then generally in use), and, if so, the Trustee shall use "CUSIP" numbers in notices of redemption as a convenience to Holders; that any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the accuracy of such numbers either as printed on the Securities or as contained in any notice of a redemption and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the Securities, and any such redemption shall not be affected by any defect in or omission of such numbers. The Company will promptly notify the Trustee of any change in the "CUSIP" numbers.
CUSIP Numbers
provided
 
     Section 3.01 . The provisions of this Article shall be applicable to the Debt Securities of any series which are redeemable before their Stated Maturity except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 2.03 for Debt Securities of such series.
Applicability of Article
     Section 3.02 . (a) Unless otherwise specified pursuant to Section 2.03, Bearer Securities of any series may be redeemed at the option of the Company in whole, but not in part, at any time, on giving not less than 30 or more than 60 days' notice in accordance with Section 3.03 (which notice shall be irrevocable), at the redemption price thereof (calculated without premium), if the Company has or will become obligated to pay additional interest on such Bearer Securities pursuant to Section 4.06 as a result of any change in, or amendment to, the laws (or any regulations or rulings promulgated thereunder) of the United States or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein, or any change in the application or official interpretation of such laws, regulations or rulings, which change or amendment becomes effective on or after the date on which any Person (including any Person acting as underwriter, broker or dealer) agrees to purchase any of such Bearer Securities pursuant to their original issuance, and such obligation cannot be avoided by the Company taking reasonable measures available to it; , that no such notice of redemption shall be given earlier than 90 days prior to the earliest date on which the Company would be obligated to pay such additional interest were a payment in respect of the Bearer Securities of that series then due. Prior to the publication of any notice of redemption pursuant to this Section 3.02(a), the Company shall deliver to the Trustee (i) an Officers' Certificate stating that the Company is entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to the right of the Company so to redeem have occurred and (ii) an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the Company has or will become obligated to pay such additional interest as a result of such change or amendment.
Tax Redemption; Special Tax Redemption
provided
          (b) Unless otherwise specified pursuant to Section 2.03, if the Company shall determine that any payment made outside the United States by the Company or any of its paying agents in respect of any Bearer Security or Coupon would, under any present or future laws or regulations of the United States, be subject to any certification, documentation, information or other reporting requirement of any kind, the effect of which requirement is the disclosure to the Company, any paying agent or any governmental authority of the nationality, residence or identity of a beneficial owner of such Bearer Security or Coupon that is a United States Alien (other than such a requirement (i) that would not be applicable to a payment made by the Company or any one of its paying agents (A) directly to the beneficial owner or (B) to a custodian, nominee or other agent of the beneficial owner, or (ii) that can be satisfied by such custodian, nominee or other agent certifying to the effect that the beneficial owner is a United States Alien; , that, in any case referred to in clause (i)(B) or (ii), payment by the custodian, nominee or agent to the beneficial owner is not otherwise subject to any such requirement), then the Company shall elect either (A) to redeem such Bearer Security or Coupon in whole, but not in part, at the redemption price thereof (calculated without premium) or (B) if
provided
 
the conditions of the next succeeding paragraph are satisfied, to pay the additional interest specified in such paragraph. The Company shall make such determination as soon as practicable and publish prompt notice thereof (the "Determination Notice"), stating the effective date of such certification, documentation, information or other reporting requirement, whether the Company elects to redeem the Bearer Security or Coupon or to pay the additional interest specified in the next succeeding paragraph and (if applicable) the last date by which the redemption of the Bearer Security or Coupon must take place, as provided in the next succeeding sentence. If any Bearer Security or Coupon is to be redeemed pursuant to this paragraph, the redemption shall take place on such date, not later than one year after the publication of the Determination Notice, as the Company shall specify by notice given to the Trustee at least 60 days before the redemption date. Notice of such redemption shall be given by the Company to the Holders of the Bearer Security or Coupon not more than 60 days or less than 30 days prior to the redemption date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not so redeem the Bearer Security or Coupon if the Company shall subsequently determine, not less than 30 days prior to the redemption date, that subsequent payments on the Bearer Security or Coupon would not be subject to any such certification, documentation, information or other reporting requirement, in which case the Company shall publish prompt notice of such subsequent determination, and any earlier redemption notice given pursuant to this paragraph shall be revoked and of no further effect. Prior to the publication of any Determination Notice pursuant to this paragraph, the Company shall deliver to the Trustee (1) an Officers' Certificate stating that the Company is entitled to make such determination and setting forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to the obligation of the Company to redeem the Bearer Security or Coupon or to pay the additional interest specified in the next succeeding paragraph have occurred and (2) an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such conditions have occurred.
     If and so long as the certification, documentation, information or other reporting requirement referred to in the preceding paragraph would be fully satisfied by payment of a backup withholding tax or similar charge, the Company may elect to pay as additional interest such amounts as may be necessary so that every net payment made outside the United States following the effective date of such requirement by the Company or any of its paying agents in respect of any Bearer Security or Coupon of which the beneficial owner is a United States Alien (but without any requirement that the nationality, residence or identity of such beneficial owner be disclosed to the Company, any paying agent or any governmental authority), after deduction or withholding for or on account of such backup withholding tax or similar charge that (x) would not be applicable in the circumstances referred to in the parenthetical clause of the first sentence of the preceding paragraph or (y) is imposed as a result of presentation of any such Bearer Security or Coupon for payment more than 15 days after the date on which such payment became due and payable or on which payment thereof was duly provided for, whichever occurred later), will not be less than the amount provided in any such Bearer Security or Coupon to be then due and payable. If the Company elects to pay additional interest pursuant to this paragraph, the Company shall have the right to redeem the Bearer Security or Coupon at any time in whole, but not in part, at the redemption price thereof (calculated without premium), subject to the provisions of the last three sentences of the immediately preceding paragraph. If the Company elects to pay additional interest pursuant to this paragraph and the condition specified in the first sentence of this paragraph should no longer be satisfied, then the Company
 
shall redeem the Bearer Security or Coupon in whole, but not in part, at the redemption price thereof (calculated without premium), subject to the provisions of the last three sentences of the immediately preceding paragraph. Any redemption payments made by the Company pursuant to the two immediately preceding sentences shall be subject to the continuing obligation of the Company to pay additional interest pursuant to this paragraph. If the Company elects to, or is required to, redeem the Bearer Security or Coupon pursuant to this paragraph, it shall publish prompt notice thereof. If the Bearer Security or Coupon is to be redeemed pursuant to this paragraph, the redemption shall take place on such date, not later than one year after publication of the notice of redemption, as the Company shall specify by notice to the Trustee at least 60 days prior to the redemption date.
     Section 3.03 . In case the Company shall desire to exercise the right to redeem all or, as the case may be, any part of the Debt Securities of any series in accordance with their terms, a resolution of the Board of Directors of the Company or a supplemental Indenture, the Company shall fix a date for redemption and shall give notice of such redemption at least 30 and not more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption to the Holders of Debt Securities of such series so to be redeemed as a whole or in part, in the manner provided in Section 13.03. The notice if given in the manner herein provided shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the Holder receives such notice. In any case, failure to give such notice or any defect in the notice to the Holder of any Debt Security of a series designated for redemption as a whole or in part shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other Debt Security of such series.
Notice of Redemption; Selection of Debt Securities
     Each such notice of redemption shall specify the date fixed for redemption, the redemption price at which Debt Securities of such series are to be redeemed, the Place or Places of Payment that payment will be made upon presentation and surrender of such Debt Securities, that any interest accrued to the date fixed for redemption will be paid as specified in said notice, that the redemption is for a sinking fund payment (if applicable), that, unless otherwise specified in such notice, Coupon Securities of any series, if any, surrendered for redemption must be accompanied by all Coupons maturing subsequent to the date fixed for redemption, failing which the amount of any such missing Coupon or Coupons will be deducted from the redemption price, if the Bearer Securities of any series are to be redeemed and any Registered Securities of such series are not to be redeemed, and if such Bearer Securities may be exchanged for Registered Securities not subject to redemption on the applicable redemption date pursuant to Section 2.15(c) or otherwise, the last date on which such exchanges may be made, that, if the Company defaults in making such redemption payment or if the Debt Securities of that series are subordinated pursuant to the terms of Article XII, the paying agent is prohibited from making such payment pursuant to the terms of this Indenture, that on and after said date any interest thereon or on the portions thereof to be redeemed will cease to accrue, that in the case of Original Issue Discount Securities original issue discount accrued after the date fixed for redemption will cease to accrue, the terms of the Debt Securities of that series pursuant to which the Debt Securities of that series are being redeemed and that no representation is made as to the correctness or accuracy of the CUSIP number, if any, listed in such notice or printed on the Debt Securities of that series. If less than all the Debt Securities of a series are to be redeemed the
 
notice of redemption shall specify the CUSIP numbers of the Debt Securities of that series to be redeemed. In case any Debt Security of a series is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed and shall state that on and after the date fixed for redemption, upon surrender of such Debt Security, a new Debt Security or Debt Securities of that series in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof, and in the case of a Bearer Security with appropriate Coupons, if any, will be issued.
     At least 60 days before the redemption date unless the Trustee consents to a shorter period, the Company shall give notice to the Trustee of the redemption date, the principal amount of Debt Securities to be redeemed and the series and terms of the Debt Securities pursuant to which such redemption will occur. Such notice shall be accompanied by an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel from the Company to the effect that such redemption will comply with the conditions herein. If fewer than all the Debt Securities of a series are to be redeemed, the record date relating to such redemption shall be selected by the Company and given to the Trustee, which record date shall be not less than 15 days after the date of notice to the Trustee.
     On or prior to the redemption date for any Registered Securities, the Company shall deposit with the Trustee or with a paying agent (or, if the Company is acting as its own paying agent, segregate and hold in trust) an amount of money in the Currency in which such Debt Securities are denominated (except as provided pursuant to Section 2.03) sufficient to pay the redemption price of such Registered Securities or any portions thereof that are to be redeemed on that date. In the case of any redemption pertaining to Bearer Securities or Coupon Securities, the Company shall, no later than the business day prior to such redemption date, deposit with the Trustee or with a paying agent (other than the Company) an amount of money in the Currency in which such Debt Securities are denominated (except as provided pursuant to Section 2.03) sufficient to pay the redemption price of such Bearer or Coupon Securities or any portion thereof that are to be redeemed on the redemption date.
     If less than all the Debt Securities of like tenor and terms of a series are to be redeemed (other than pursuant to mandatory sinking fund redemptions) the Trustee shall select, on a pro rata basis, by lot or by such other method as in its sole discretion it shall deem appropriate and fair, the Debt Securities of that series or portions thereof (in multiples of $1,000) to be redeemed. In any case where more than one Registered Security of such series is registered in the same name, the Trustee in its discretion may treat the aggregate principal amount so registered as if it were represented by one Registered Security of such series. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company in writing of the Debt Securities selected for redemption and, in the case of any Debt Securities selected for partial redemption, the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. If any Debt Security called for redemption shall not be so paid upon surrender thereof on such redemption date, the principal, premium, if any, and interest shall bear interest until paid from the redemption date at the rate borne by the Debt Securities of that series. If less than all the Debt Securities of unlike tenor and terms of a series are to be redeemed, the particular Debt Securities to be redeemed shall be selected by the Company. Provisions of this Indenture that apply to Debt Securities called for redemption also apply to portions of Debt Securities called for redemption.
 
     Section 3.04 . If notice of redemption has been given as provided in Section 3.03, the Debt Securities or portions of Debt Securities of the series with respect to which such notice has been given shall become due and payable on the date and at the Place or Places of Payment stated in such notice at the applicable redemption price, together with any interest accrued to the date fixed for redemption, and on and after said date (unless the Company shall default in the payment of such Debt Securities at the applicable redemption price, together with any interest accrued to said date) any interest on the Debt Securities or portions of Debt Securities of any series so called for redemption shall cease to accrue, any original issue discount in the case of Original Issue Discount Securities shall cease to accrue and any Coupons for such interest appertaining to any Coupon Securities to be redeemed, except to the extent described below, shall be void. On presentation and surrender of such Debt Securities at the Place or Places of Payment in said notice specified, the said Debt Securities or the specified portions thereof shall be paid and redeemed by the Company at the applicable redemption price, together with any interest accrued thereon to the date fixed for redemption.
Payment of Debt Securities Called for Redemption
     If any Coupon Security surrendered for redemption shall not be accompanied by all Coupons appertaining thereto maturing on or after the applicable redemption date, the redemption price for such Coupon Security may be reduced by an amount equal to the face amount of all such missing Coupons. If thereafter the Holder of such Coupon shall surrender to any paying agent outside the United States any such missing Coupon in respect of which a deduction shall have been made from the redemption price, such Holder shall be entitled to receive the amount so deducted. The surrender of such missing Coupon or Coupons may be waived by the Company and the Trustee, if there be furnished to them such security or indemnity as they may require to save each of them and any paying agent harmless.
     Any Debt Security that is to be redeemed only in part shall be surrendered at the corporate trust office or such other office or agency of the Company as is specified pursuant to Section 2.03 (in the case of Registered Securities) and at the principal London office of the Trustee or such other office or agency of the Company outside the United States as is specified pursuant to Section 2.03 (in the case of Bearer Securities) with, if the Company, the Registrar or the Trustee so requires, due endorsement by, or a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company, the Registrar and the Trustee duly executed by, the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder of such Debt Security without service charge, a new Debt Security or Debt Securities of the same series, of like tenor and form, of any authorized denomination as requested by such Holder in aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for the unredeemed portion of the principal of the Debt Security so surrendered, and, in the case of a Coupon Security, with appropriate Coupons attached; except that if a Global Security is so surrendered, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Depositary for such Global Security, without service charge, a new Global Security in a denomination equal to and in exchange for the unredeemed portion of the principal of the Global Security so surrendered. In the case of a Debt Security providing appropriate space for such notation, at the option of the Holder thereof, the Trustee, in lieu of delivering a new Debt
 
Security or Debt Securities as aforesaid, may make a notation on such Debt Security of the payment of the redeemed portion thereof.
     Section 3.05 . The minimum amount of any sinking fund payment provided for by the terms of Debt Securities of any series, resolution of the Board of Directors or a supplemental Indenture is herein referred to as a "mandatory sinking fund payment", and any payment in excess of such minimum amount provided for by the terms of Debt Securities of any series, resolution of the Board of Directors or a supplemental Indenture is herein referred to as an "optional sinking fund payment".
Mandatory and Optional Sinking Funds
     In lieu of making all or any part of any mandatory sinking fund payment with respect to any Debt Securities of a series in cash, the Company may at its option (a) deliver to the Trustee Debt Securities of that series (together with the unmatured Coupons, if any, appertaining thereto) theretofore purchased or otherwise acquired by the Company or (b) receive credit for the principal amount of Debt Securities of that series which have been redeemed either at the election of the Company pursuant to the terms of such Debt Securities or through the application of permitted optional sinking fund payments pursuant to the terms of such Debt Securities, resolution or supplemental Indenture; , that such Debt Securities have not been previously so credited. Such Debt Securities shall be received and credited for such purpose by the Trustee at the redemption price specified in such Debt Securities, resolution or supplemental Indenture for redemption through operation of the sinking fund and the amount of such mandatory sinking fund payment shall be reduced accordingly.
provided
     Section 3.06 . Not less than 60 days prior to each sinking fund payment date for any series of Debt Securities, the Company will deliver to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate specifying the amount of the next ensuing sinking fund payment for that series pursuant to the terms of that series, any resolution or supplemental Indenture, the portion thereof, if any, which is to be satisfied by payment of cash in the Currency in which the Debt Securities of such series are denominated (except as provided pursuant to Section 2.03) and the portion thereof, if any, which is to be satisfied by delivering and crediting Debt Securities of that series pursuant to this Section 3.06 (which Debt Securities, if not previously redeemed, will accompany such certificate) and whether the Company intends to exercise its right to make any permitted optional sinking fund payment with respect to such series. Such certificate shall also state that no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing with respect to such series. Such certificate shall be irrevocable and upon its delivery the Company shall be obligated to make the cash payment or payments therein referred to, if any, on or before the next succeeding sinking fund payment date. Failure of the Company to deliver such certificate (or to deliver the Debt Securities and Coupons, if any, specified in this paragraph) shall not constitute a Default, but such failure shall require that the sinking fund payment due on the next succeeding sinking fund payment date for that series shall be paid entirely in cash and shall be sufficient to redeem the principal amount of such Debt Securities subject to a mandatory sinking fund payment without the option to deliver or credit Debt Securities as provided in this Section 3.06 and without the right to make any optional sinking fund payment, if any, with respect to such series.
Redemption of Debt Securities for Sinking Fund

Any sinking fund moneys not so applied or allocated by the Trustee to the redemption of Debt Securities shall be added to the next cash sinking fund payment received by the Trustee for such series and, together with such payment, shall be applied in accordance with the provisions of this Section 3.06. Any and all sinking fund moneys with respect to the Debt Securities of any particular series held by the Trustee on the last sinking fund payment date with respect to Debt Securities of such series and not held for the payment or redemption of particular Debt Securities shall be applied by the Trustee, together with other moneys, if necessary, to be deposited sufficient for the purpose, to the payment of the principal of the Debt Securities of that series at its Stated Maturity.

Such notice having been duly given, the redemption of such Debt Securities shall be made upon the terms and in the manner stated in Section 3.04.
     At least one business day before each sinking fund payment date, the Company shall pay to the Trustee (or, if the Company is acting as its own paying agent, the Company shall segregate and hold in trust) in cash a sum in the Currency in which the Debt Securities of such series are denominated (except as provided pursuant to Section 2.03) equal to any interest accrued to the date fixed for redemption of Debt Securities or portions thereof to be redeemed on such sinking fund payment date pursuant to this Section 3.06.
     The Trustee shall not redeem any Debt Securities of a series with sinking fund moneys or mail any notice of redemption of such Debt Securities by operation of the sinking fund for such series during the continuance of a Default in payment of interest on such Debt Securities or of any Event of Default (other than an Event of Default occurring as a consequence of this paragraph) with respect to such Debt Securities, except that if the notice of redemption of any such Debt Securities shall theretofore have been mailed in accordance with the provisions hereof, the Trustee shall redeem such Debt Securities if cash sufficient for that purpose shall be deposited with the Trustee for that purpose in accordance with the terms of this Article III. Except as aforesaid, any moneys in the sinking fund for such series at the time when any such Default or Event of Default shall occur and any moneys thereafter paid into such sinking fund shall, during the continuance of such Default or Event of Default, be held as security for the payment of such Debt Securities; , , that in case such Event of Default or Default shall have been cured or waived as provided herein, such moneys shall thereafter be

     Section 6.09 . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture, at the Company's election, the sole remedy of Holders under this Indenture for an Event of Default relating to the failure of the Company to comply with its obligations under Section 5.03 will consist exclusively of the right to receive additional interest ("Additional Interest") on the Debt Securities at an annual rate equal to 0.25% of the aggregate principal amount of the Debt Securities for the period beginning on the 91st day after the occurrence of such an Event of Default. In no event will Additional Interest under this Section accrue at a rate exceeding 0.25% per annum. Any such Additional Interest will be payable in the same manner and on the same dates as the stated interest payable on the Debt Securities. If the Company so elects, Additional Interest will accrue on all outstanding Debt Securities from and including the 91st day following the date on which an Event of Default relating to a failure to comply with Section 5.03 first occurs to, but not including, the date on which the Event of Default relating to a failure to comply with Section 5.03 shall have been cured or waived.
Sole Remedy for Failure to Report
     In order to exercise the extension right and elect to pay the Additional Interest as the sole remedy during the period beginning on the 91st day following the occurrence of any Event of Default relating to the failure to comply with the reporting obligations in accordance with this Section 6.09, the Company must notify all Holders of Debt Securities and the Trustee and paying agent of such election prior to the close of business on the 91st day after the date on which such Event of Default occurs, (or, if such date is not a business day, on the first business day thereafter). Upon the Company's failure to timely give such notice, the Debt Securities will be subject to acceleration as provided in this Article VI.

     Section 7.01 . The Trustee, prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default and after the curing or waiving of all Events of Default which may have occurred, undertakes to perform such duties and only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Indenture. In case an Event of Default has occurred (which has not been cured or waived), the Trustee shall exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture, and use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise, as a prudent man would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his own affairs.

          (iii) the Trustee shall not be liable for an error of judgment made in good faith by a responsible officer, unless it shall be proved that the Trustee was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts; and
          (iv) the Trustee shall not be liable with respect to any action taken or omitted to be taken by it with respect to Debt Securities of any series in good faith in
 
accordance with the direction of the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Debt Securities of that series relating to the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred upon the Trustee, under this Indenture with respect to Debt Securities of such series.

          (b) until the Senior Indebtedness is paid in full, any distribution to which Holders of Subordinated Debt Securities would be entitled but for this Article XII shall be made to holders of Senior Indebtedness as their interests may appear, except that such Holders may

Notwithstanding the provisions described in the immediately preceding sentence (but subject to the provisions contained in the first sentence of this Section 12.03), unless the holders of such Designated Senior Indebtedness or the Representative of such holders shall have accelerated the maturity of such Designated Senior Indebtedness, the Company may resume payments on the Subordinated Debt Securities after such Payment Blockage Period. Not more than one Blockage Notice may be given in any consecutive 360-day period, irrespective of the number of defaults with respect to any number of issues of Senior Indebtedness during such period; , , that if any Blockage Notice within such 360-day period is given by or on behalf of any holders of Designated Senior Indebtedness (other than the Bank Indebtedness), the Representative of the Bank Indebtedness may give another Blockage Notice within such period; , , , that in no event may the total number of days during which any Payment Blockage Period or Periods is in effect exceed 179 days in the aggregate during any 360 consecutive day period.

If a distribution is made to Holders of Subordinated Debt Securities that because of this Article XII should not have been made to them, the Holders who receive such distribution shall hold it in trust for holders of Senior Indebtedness and pay it over to them as their interests may appear.
When Distribution Must Be Paid Over
     Section 12.06 . After all Senior Indebtedness is paid in full and until the Subordinated Debt Securities are paid in full, Holders thereof shall be subrogated to the rights of holders of Senior Indebtedness to receive distributions applicable to Senior Indebtedness. A distribution made under this Article XII to holders of Senior Indebtedness which otherwise would have been made to Holders of Subordinated Debt Securities is not, as between the Company and such Holders, a payment by the Company on Senior Indebtedness.
Subrogation
     Section 12.07 . This Article XII defines the relative rights of Holders of Subordinated Debt Securities and holders of Senior Indebtedness. Nothing in this Indenture shall:

          (b) prevent the Trustee or any Holder of either Subordinated Debt Securities or Debt Securities from exercising its available remedies upon a Default, subject to the rights of holders of Senior Indebtedness to receive distributions otherwise payable to Holders of Subordinated Debt Securities.
     Section 12.08 . No right of any holder of Senior Indebtedness to enforce the subordination of the Indebtedness evidenced by the Subordinated Debt Securities shall be impaired by any act or failure to act by the Company or by its failure to comply with this Indenture.

     Section 12.09 . Notwithstanding Section 12.03, the Trustee or any paying agent may continue to make payments on Subordinated Debt Securities and shall not be charged with knowledge of the existence of facts that would prohibit the making of any such payments unless, not less than two business days prior to the date of such payment, a responsible officer of the Trustee receives notice satisfactory to it that payments may not be made under this Article XII. The Company, the Registrar, any paying agent, a Representative or

Article XII Not to Prevent Defaults or Limit Right to Accelerate

Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, payments from money or the proceeds of U.S. Government Obligations held in trust under Article XI by the Trustee for the payment of principal of, and premium, if any, and interest on, the Subordinated Debt Securities or the Debt Securities shall not be subordinated to the prior payment of any Senior Indebtedness or subject to the restrictions set forth in this Article XII, and none of the Holders thereof shall be obligated to pay over any such amount to the Company or any holder of Senior Indebtedness of the Company or any other creditor of the Company.
Trust Moneys Not Subordinated
     Section 12.13 . Upon any payment or distribution pursuant to this Article XII, the Trustee and the Holders shall be entitled to rely (a) upon any order or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction in which any proceedings of the nature referred to in Section 12.02 are pending, (b) upon a certificate of the liquidating trustee or agent or other Person making such payment or distribution to the Trustee or to such Holders or (c) upon the Representatives for the holders of Senior Indebtedness for the purpose of ascertaining the Persons entitled to participate in such payment or distribution, the holders of the Senior Indebtedness and other Indebtedness of the Company, the amount thereof or payable thereon, the amount or amounts paid or distributed thereon and all other facts pertinent thereto or to this Article XII. In the event that the Trustee determines, in good faith, that evidence is required with respect to the right of any Person as a holder of Senior Indebtedness to participate in any payment or distribution pursuant to this Article XII, the Trustee may request such Person to furnish evidence to the reasonable satisfaction of the Trustee as to the amount of Senior Indebtedness held by such Person, the extent to which such Person is entitled to participate in such payment or distribution and other facts pertinent to the rights of such Person under this Article XII, and, if such evidence
Trustee Entitled to Rely

The provisions of Section 7.01 and Section 7.02 shall be applicable to all actions or omissions of actions by the Trustee pursuant to this Article XII.
     Section 12.14 . Each Holder by accepting a Subordinated Debt Security authorizes and directs the Trustee on his behalf to take such action as may be necessary or appropriate to acknowledge or effectuate the subordination between the Holders of Subordinated Debt Securities and the holders of Senior Indebtedness as provided in this Article XII and appoints the Trustee as attorney-in-fact for any and all such purposes.
Trustee to Effectuate Subordination
     Section 12.15 . The Trustee shall not be deemed to owe any fiduciary duty to the holders of Senior Indebtedness and shall not be liable to any such holders if it shall mistakenly pay over or distribute to Holders of Subordinated Debt Securities or the Company or any other Person, money or assets to which any holders of Senior Indebtedness shall be entitled by virtue of this Article XII or otherwise.
Trustee Not Fiduciary for Holders of Senior Indebtedness
     Section 12.16 .

In such event, the Noteholders who do not make such a withdrawal election will receive the applicable Settlement Amount with respect to Notes surrendered for conversion three Trading Days following the later of (i) the end of the applicable Cash Settlement Averaging Period or (ii) the expiration of the 10 Business Day (or longer period if required by law) withdrawal period referred to above.

     (c) The Trustee shall have no obligation to determine the Trading Price of the Notes pursuant to clause (ii) of Section 8.01(a) unless the Company has requested such determination in writing; and the Company shall have no obligation to make such request unless a Noteholder
 
provides the Company with reasonable evidence that the Trading Price per $1,000 principal amount of Notes is reasonably likely to be less than 97% of the product of the Last Reported Sale Price of the Common Stock and the Applicable Daily Conversion Rate then in effect on such date. If a Noteholder provides such evidence or if the Company otherwise elects to require such determination, the Company shall instruct the Trustee to determine the Trading Price of the Notes beginning on the next Trading Day and on each successive Trading Day until the Trading Price of the Notes is greater than or equal to 97% of the product of the Last Reported Sale price of the Common Stock and the Applicable Daily Conversion Rate on such date. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company of its determination on each such day. If the condition set forth in clause (ii) of Section 8.01(a) has been met, the Company shall so notify the Noteholders.

receive such shares of Common Stock as the record holder or holders thereof for all purposes at the close of business on the next succeeding day on which such stock transfer books are open. Upon conversion of Notes, such Person shall no longer be a Noteholder.
     (k) No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued upon conversion of any Note or Notes. Instead of any fractional share of Common Stock that would otherwise be issued upon conversion of any Note or Notes (or specified portions thereof), the Company shall pay a cash adjustment in respect of such fraction (calculated to the nearest one-100th of a share), as determined by the Company, in an amount equal to the same fraction of the average of the Applicable Stock Prices on each Trading Day of the applicable Cash Settlement Averaging Period. If more than one Note shall be surrendered for conversion at one time by the same holder, the number of full shares that shall be issued upon conversion thereof shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes (or specified portions thereof) so surrendered.
     (l) When a Noteholder surrenders Notes for conversion, the Company may direct, in writing, the Conversion Agent to surrender such Notes to a financial institution designated by the Company (the "") for exchange in lieu of conversion. In order to accept any Notes surrendered for conversion, the Designated Institution must agree to deliver, in exchange for such Notes, cash and the number of shares of Common Stock, if any, due upon conversion based upon the Applicable Conversion Rate in full satisfaction of the Conversion Obligation, as determined pursuant to Section 8.02(a). By the close of business on the Scheduled Trading Day immediately preceding the start of the Cash Settlement Averaging Period, the Company will provide written notification to the Noteholder surrendering the Notes for conversion that it has directed the Designated Institution to make an exchange in lieu of conversion. If the Designated Institution accepts any such Notes, it will deliver the cash, and if any, the number of shares of Common Stock due upon conversion to the Conversion Agent, and the Conversion Agent will deliver such cash and shares of Common Stock to the converting Noteholder. Any Notes exchanged by the Designated Institution will remain Outstanding. If the Designated Institution does not accept the Notes for exchange or agrees to accept any Notes for exchange but does not timely deliver the related cash and shares of Common Stock, the Company will, as promptly as practical thereafter (but in any event, no later than the fourth Trading Day immediately following the last Trading Day of the relevant Cash Settlement Averaging Period) convert the Notes as set forth under Section 8.02(a). The Company's designation of a Designated Institution to which the Notes may be submitted for exchange does not require the Designated Institution to accept any Notes. The Company will not pay any consideration to, or otherwise enter into any agreement with, the Designated Institution for or with respect to such designation.

     Section 8.03. . (a) If a Noteholder elects to convert Notes in connection with a Make-Whole Fundamental Change, then the Applicable Conversion Rate of the Notes being converted by such Noteholder shall be increased by an additional number of shares of Common Stock (the "") if any, as described herein. For purposes of this Section 8.03, any conversion of the Notes by a Noteholder will be deemed to be "" such Make-Whole Fundamental Change if it occurs during the period that begins on the Effective Date of such Make-Whole Fundamental Change (or 15 Trading Days prior to the date the Company has

announced as the anticipated Effective Date of such Make-Whole Fundamental Change pursuant to clause (d) below if such event constitutes a Fundamental Change as described under clause (d) of the definition of Fundamental Change) and ends on (and includes) the Business Day prior to the Fundamental Change Repurchase Date relating to such Make-Whole Fundamental Change. In the case of a transaction described in clause (d) of the definition of Fundamental Change, if the Company determines that such transaction will not occur on substantially the terms as anticipated, the Company will not be obligated to increase the Applicable Conversion Rate, regardless of the fact that holders may have elected to convert Notes in anticipation of the effective date of such event, and the Company will issue a press release and notify the holders who have so elected to convert their Notes promptly after the Company determines that the transaction in question will not occur. Each such holder may then elect to withdraw any election to convert by a written notice of withdrawal delivered to the Conversion Agent within 10 Business Days after the Company announces that the transaction will not occur as anticipated (or longer period if required by applicable law).
     The increase in the Applicable Conversion Rate in connection with a Make-Whole Fundamental Change, expressed as a number of Additional Shares, will be determined by the Company by reference to the table and adjustments thereto in Section 8.03(b), based on the Effective Date of the Make-Whole Fundamental Change and the applicable Stock Price.
     (b) The following table sets forth the Effective Date and number of Additional Shares by which the Applicable Conversion Rate will be increased upon a conversion in connection with a Make-Whole Fundamental Change that occurs in the corresponding period to be determined by reference to the Stock Price and Effective Date of the Make-Whole Fundamental Change:
     , however, that:
provided
     (i) if the actual Stock Price of such Make-Whole Fundamental Change is between two Stock Prices listed in the table above under the column titled "Stock Price," or if the actual Effective Date of such Make-Whole Fundamental Change is between two Effective Dates listed in the table above in the row immediately below the title "Effective
 
Date," then the number of Additional Shares for such Make-Whole Fundamental Change shall be determined by the Company by a straight-line interpolation between the number of Additional Shares set forth for such higher and lower Stock Prices, or for such earlier and later Effective Dates based on a 365 day year, as applicable;
     (ii) if the actual Stock Price of such Make-Whole Fundamental Change is greater than $145.00 per share (subject to adjustment in the same manner as the Stock Price as provided in clause (iii) below), or if the actual Stock Price of such Make-Whole Fundamental Change is less than $44.00 per share (subject to adjustment in the same manner as the Stock Price as provided in clause (iii) below), then the number of Additional Shares shall be equal to zero and this Section 8.03 shall not require the Company to increase the Applicable Conversion Rate with respect to such Make-Whole Fundamental Change;
     (iii) if an event occurs that requires, pursuant to Section 8.04, an adjustment to the Base Conversion Rate, then, on the date and at the time such adjustment is so required to be made, each price set forth in the table above under the column titled "Stock Price" shall be adjusted so that such Stock Price, at and after such time, shall be equal to the product of (1) such Stock Price as in effect immediately before such adjustment to such Stock Price and (2) a fraction whose numerator is the Base Conversion Rate in effect immediately before such adjustment to the Base Conversion Rate and whose denominator is the Base Conversion Rate to be in effect, in accordance with Section 8.04, immediately after such adjustment to the Base Conversion Rate; and
     (iv) each number of Additional Shares set forth in the table above shall be adjusted in the same manner in which, and for the same events for which, the Base Conversion Rate is to be adjusted pursuant to Section 8.04.
     In no event will the Applicable Conversion Rate after adjustment described in this Section 8.03(b) exceed 22.7273 per $1,000 principal amount of Notes, subject to adjustments as set forth in Section 8.04.
     (c) For the avoidance of doubt, the increases provided for in Section 8.03 shall only be made with respect to the Notes being converted in connection with such Make-Whole Fundamental Change and shall not be effective as to any Notes not so converted.
     (d) As soon as practicable after the Company determines the anticipated Effective Date of any proposed Make-Whole Fundamental Change and no later than the 15th Scheduled Trading Day prior to the date on which such Make-Whole Fundamental Change is anticipated to become effective, or if later, promptly upon becoming aware of such transaction, the Company shall provide written notice of such anticipated Effective Date to the Trustee and the Conversion Agent and mail a notice to each Noteholder, and shall issue a press release indicating, and publicly announce, through a public medium that is customary for such announcements, and publish on the Company's website, the anticipated Effective Date of such proposed Make-Whole Fundamental Change. Each such notice, press release notice, announcement and publication shall also state that in connection with such Make-Whole Fundamental Change, the Company shall increase, in accordance herewith, the Applicable Conversion Rate applicable to Notes
 
entitled as provided herein to such increase (along with a description of how such increase shall be calculated and the time periods during which Notes must be surrendered in order to be entitled to such increase). No later than the actual Effective Date of each Make-Whole Fundamental Change, the Company shall provide written notice to the Trustee and the Conversion Agent and mail a notice to each Noteholder, and shall issue a press release indicating, and publicly announce, through a public medium that is customary for such announcements, and publish on the Company's website, such Effective Date and the amount by which the Applicable Conversion Rate has been so increased.
     Section 8.04. . The Base Conversion Rate shall be adjusted from time to time by the Company as follows:
Adjustment of Base Conversion Rate
     (a) In case the Company shall issue shares of Common Stock as a dividend or distribution on shares of Common Stock to all holders of the outstanding shares of Common Stock, or if the Company effects a share split or share combination, the Base Conversion Rate will be adjusted based on the following formula:
where,
Such adjustment shall become effective immediately after the open of business on the Ex-Dividend Date for such dividend or distribution, or the effective date for such share split or share combination. If any dividend or distribution of the type described in this Section 8.04(a) is declared but not so paid or made, or any split or combination of the type described in this Section 8.04(a) is announced but the outstanding shares of Common Stock are not split or combined, as the case may be, the new Base Conversion Rate shall be immediately readjusted,
 
effective as of the date the Board of Directors determines not to pay such dividend or distribution, or split or combine the outstanding shares of Common Stock, as the case may be, to the Base Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared or such share split or share combination had not been announced.
     (b) In case the Company shall distribute to all or substantially all holders of its Common Stock any rights or warrants entitling them for a period of not more than 45 calendar days after the Record Date of such distribution to subscribe for or purchase shares of the Common Stock at a price per share less than the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices of the Common Stock on the 10 Trading Days immediately preceding the date that such distribution was first publicly announced, the Base Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula:
where,
Such adjustment shall be successively made whenever any such rights or warrants are distributed and shall become effective immediately after the open of business on the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution. To the extent that shares of the Common Stock are not delivered after the expiration of such rights or warrants, the Base Conversion Rate shall be readjusted to the Base Conversion Rate that would then be in effect had the adjustments made upon the issuance of such rights or warrants been made on the basis of delivery of only the number of shares of Common Stock actually delivered. If such rights or warrants are not so issued, the Base Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Base Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such distribution had not been declared.
 
     In determining whether any rights or warrants entitle the holders to subscribe for or purchase shares of the Common Stock at less than the applicable Last Reported Sale Price of the Common Stock, and in determining the aggregate exercise or conversion price payable for such Common Stock, there shall be taken into account any consideration received by the Company for such rights or warrants and any amount payable upon exercise or conversion thereof, the value of such consideration, if other than cash, to be determined by the Board of Directors. In no event shall the Base Conversion Rate be decreased pursuant to this Section 8.04(b), except for readjustments described above.
     (c) In case the Company shall distribute shares of its Capital Stock, evidences of its indebtedness or other of its assets or property other than (i) dividends or distributions covered by Section 8.04(a) or Section 8.04(b), (ii) dividends or distributions paid exclusively in cash, and (iii) Spin-Offs to which the provisions set forth below in this Section 8.04(c) shall apply (any of such shares of Capital Stock, indebtedness, or other asset or property hereinafter in this Section 8.04(c) called the ""), to all or substantially all holders of its Common Stock, then, in each such case, the Base Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula:
Distributed Property
where,
Such adjustment shall become effective immediately prior to the open of business on the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution; that if "FMV" as set forth above is equal to or greater than "SP0" as set forth above, in lieu of the foregoing adjustment, adequate provision shall be made so that each Noteholder shall receive on the date on which the Distributed Property is distributed to holders of the Common Stock, for each $1,000 principal amount of Notes upon conversion, the amount of Distributed Property such holder would have received had such holder owned a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Applicable Daily Conversion Rate on the Record Date for such distribution. If such distribution is not so paid or made, the Base Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Base Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared. Except as provided below, if the
provided
 
Board of Directors determines "FMV" for purposes of this Section 8.04(c) by reference to the actual or when issued trading market for any securities, it must in doing so consider the prices in such market over the same period used in computing the Last Reported Sale Prices of the Common Stock over the 10 consecutive Trading Days ending on the Trading Day immediately preceding the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution.
     In lieu of the foregoing, with respect to an adjustment pursuant to this Section 8.04(c) where there has been a dividend or other distribution on the Common Stock of shares of Capital Stock of any class or series, or similar equity interest, of or relating to a Subsidiary or other business unit of the Company (a "-"), the Base Conversion Rate in effect immediately before the close of business on the tenth Trading Day immediately following, and including, the effective date of the Spin-Off will be increased based on the following formula:
Spin
Off
where,
The adjustment to the Base Conversion Rate under the preceding paragraph shall become effective immediately prior to the open of business on the day immediately following the tenth Trading Day immediately following, and including, the effective date of the Spin-Off; that, for purposes of determining the Base Conversion Rate, in respect of any conversion during the 10 Trading Days immediately following, and including, the effective date of any Spin-Off, references in the portion of this Section 8.04(c) related to Spin-Offs to 10 Trading Days shall be deemed replaced with such lesser number of Trading Days as have elapsed between the effective date of such Spin-Off and the Conversion Date for such conversion.
provided
 
     (d) If any cash dividend in excess of the Base Dividend Amount in the aggregate in any single Semi-Annual Period is made to all or substantially all holders of its Common Stock, the Base Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula:
where,
Such adjustment shall become effective immediately after the open of business on the Ex-Dividend Date for such dividend or distribution; that if the portion of the cash so distributed applicable to one share of the Common Stock is equal to or greater than SP0 as set forth above, in lieu of the foregoing adjustment, adequate provision shall be made so that each Noteholder shall have the right to receive on the date on which the relevant cash dividend or distribution is distributed to holders of Common Stock, for each $1,000 principal amount of Notes upon conversion, the amount of cash such holder would have received had such holder owned a number of shares equal to the Applicable Daily Conversion Rate on the Record Date for such distribution. If such dividend or distribution is not so paid or made, the Base Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Base Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.
provided
     For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of this Section 8.04(d), in the event of any reclassification of the Common Stock, as a result of which the Notes become convertible into cash and more than one class of Common Stock, if an adjustment to the Base Conversion Rate is required pursuant to this Section 8.04(d), references in this Section to one share of Common Stock or Last Reported Sale Price of one share of Common Stock shall be deemed to refer to a unit or to the price of a unit consisting of an amount of cash and shares equal to the number of shares of each class of Common Stock into which the Notes are then convertible plus the cash issued in respect of one share of Common Stock in such reclassification. The above provisions of this paragraph shall similarly apply to successive reclassifications.
     (e) If the Company or any of its Subsidiaries makes a payment in respect of a tender offer or exchange offer for the Common Stock and the cash and value of any other consideration
 
included in the payment per share of the Common Stock exceeds the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices of the Common Stock over the 10 consecutive Trading Days commencing on, and including, the Trading Day next succeeding the last date on which tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer, the Base Conversion Rate shall be increased based on the following formula:
where,
such adjustment to become effective immediately after the close of business on the day immediately following the tenth Trading Day immediately following, and including, the date such tender or exchange offer expires; that, for purposes of determining the Base Conversion Rate, in respect of any conversion during the 10 Trading Days immediately following, but excluding, the date that any such tender or exchange offer expires, references in this Section 8.04(e) to 10 Trading Days shall be deemed replaced with such lesser number of Trading Days as have elapsed between the date that such tender or exchange offer expires and the Conversion Date for such conversion. If the Company or one of its Subsidiaries is obligated to purchase shares of Common Stock pursuant to any such tender or exchange offer but is permanently prevented by applicable law from effecting any or all or any portion of such
provided
 
purchases or all such purchases are rescinded, the new Base Conversion Rate shall be readjusted to be the Base Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such tender or exchange offer had not been made or had been made only in respect of the purchases that had been effected. In no event shall the Base Conversion Rate be decreased pursuant to this Section 8.04(e), except with respect to readjustment described above.
     (f) For purposes of this Section 8.04, the term "" shall mean, with respect to any dividend, distribution or other transaction or event in which the holders of Common Stock (or other security) have the right to receive any cash, securities or other property or in which the Common Stock (or other applicable security) is exchanged for or converted into any combination of cash, securities or other property, the date fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to receive such cash, securities or other property (whether such date is fixed by the Board of Directors or by statute, contract or otherwise).
Record Date
     (g) Except as stated herein, the Company shall not adjust the Base Conversion Rate for the issuance of shares of its Common Stock or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of its Common Stock or the right to purchase shares of its Common Stock or such convertible or exchangeable securities.
     (h) In addition to those required by clauses Section 8.04(a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) of this Section 8.04, and to the extent permitted by applicable law and subject to the applicable rules of the National Securities Exchange, the Company from time to time may increase the Base Conversion Rate by any amount for a period of at least 20 Business Days if the Board of Directors determines that such increase would be in the Company's best interest. In addition, the Company may also (but is not required to) increase the Base Conversion Rate to avoid or diminish any income tax to holders of Common Stock or rights to purchase Common Stock in connection with any dividend or distribution of shares (or rights to acquire shares) or similar event. Whenever the Base Conversion Rate is increased pursuant to the preceding sentence, the Company shall mail to the holder of each Note at its last address appearing on the Note Register provided for in Section 2.05 a notice of the increase at least 15 calendar days prior to the date the increased Base Conversion Rate takes effect, and such notice shall state the increased Base Conversion Rate and the period during which it will be in effect.
     (i) The Base Conversion Rate will not be adjusted:
     (i) upon the issuance of any shares of the Common Stock pursuant to any present or future plan providing for the reinvestment of dividends or interest payable on the Company's securities and the investment of additional optional amounts in shares of the Common Stock under any plan;
     (ii) upon the issuance of any shares of the Common Stock or restricted stock units or options or rights (including stockholder appreciation rights) to purchase those shares pursuant to any present or future employee, director or consultant benefit plan or program of or assumed by the Company or any of the Company's Subsidiaries;
 
     (iii) upon the issuance of any shares of the Common Stock pursuant to any option, warrant, right or exercisable, exchangeable or convertible security not described in clause (ii) of this subsection and outstanding as of the date the Notes were first issued;
     (iv) upon the repurchase of any of the Common Stock pursuant to an open-market share repurchase program or other buy-back transaction that is not a tender offer or exchange offer of the nature described in this Section 8.04;
     (v) for a change in the par value of the Common Stock;
     (vi) for accrued and unpaid interest; or
     (vii) for any transactions described in this Section 8.04, if Noteholders participate (as a result of holding the Notes, and at the same time as holders of Common Stock participate) in such transactions as if such Noteholders held a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Applicable Daily Conversion Rate at the time such adjustment would be required, the principal amount (expressed in thousands) of Notes held by such Noteholder, without having to convert their Notes.
multiplied by
     (j) All calculations and other determinations under this Article 8 shall be made by the Company and shall be made to the nearest one-ten thousandth (1/10,000th) of a share. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 8.04, the Company will not be required to adjust the Base Conversion Rate unless the adjustment would result in a change of at least 1% of the Base Conversion Rate. However, the Company will carry forward any adjustments that are less than 1% of the Base Conversion Rate and take them into account when determining subsequent adjustments. In addition, the Company will make any carry forward adjustments not otherwise effected (i) upon conversion of the Notes, (ii) upon required repurchases of the Notes in connection with a Fundamental Change, (iii) in connection with a call for redemption and (iv) 25 Scheduled Trading Days prior to the Maturity Date of the Notes. No adjustment to the Base Conversion Rate will be made if it results in a Base Conversion Price that is less than the par value (if any) of Common Stock.
     (k) At any time the Base Conversion Rate is adjusted as described in this Section 8.04, the Incremental Share Factor and Daily Share Cap will be adjusted in the same proportion.
     (l) Whenever the Base Conversion Rate, Incremental Share Factor and Daily Share Cap are adjusted as herein provided, the Company shall promptly file with the Trustee and any Conversion Agent other than the Trustee an Officers' Certificate setting forth the Base Conversion Rate, Incremental Share Factor and Daily Share Cap after such adjustment and setting forth a brief statement of the facts requiring such adjustment. Unless and until a responsible officer of the Trustee shall have received such Officers' Certificate, the Trustee shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any adjustment of the Base Conversion Rate, Incremental Share Factor or Daily Share Cap and may assume without inquiry that the last, Base Conversion Rate, Incremental Share Factor and Daily Share Cap of which it has knowledge is still in effect. Promptly after delivery of such certificate, the Company shall prepare a notice of such adjustment of the Base Conversion Rate, Incremental Share Factor and Daily Share Cap setting
 
forth the adjusted Base Conversion Rate, Incremental Share Factor and Daily Share Cap and the date on which each adjustment becomes effective and shall mail such notice of such adjustment of the Base Conversion Rate, Incremental Share Factor and Daily Share Cap to the holder of each Note at its last address appearing on the Note Register provided for in Section 2.05, within 10 calendar days of the effective date of such adjustment. Failure to deliver such notice shall not affect the legality or validity of any such adjustment.
     (m) For purposes of this Section 8.04, the number of shares of Common Stock at any time outstanding shall not include shares held in the treasury of the Company but shall include shares issuable in respect of scrip certificates issued in lieu of fractions of shares of Common Stock.
     (n) The Board of Directors will make appropriate adjustments, in its good faith determination, to account for any adjustment to the Base Conversion Rate that becomes effective, or any event requiring an adjustment to the Base Conversion Rate where the Ex-Dividend Date of the event occurs, during any consecutive Trading Day period used for the measurement of any adjustment required under this Section 8.04.
     Section 8.05. . The Company shall provide, free from preemptive rights, out of its authorized but unissued shares or shares held in treasury, sufficient shares of Common Stock to provide for conversion of the Notes from time to time as such Notes are presented for conversion.

Effect of Reclassification, Consolidation, Merger or Sale; Treatment of Reference Property
     (a) Upon the occurrence of (i) any reclassification of the Common Stock (other than a change only in par value, or from par value to no par value, or from no par value to par value, or a change as a result of a subdivision or combination of Common Stock), (ii) any consolidation, merger or combination involving the Company, or (iii) any sale or conveyance to another Person of the property and assets of the Company as an entirety or substantially as an entirety, and pursuant to such reclassification, consolidation, merger, combination, sale or conveyance, the Common Stock is converted into or exchanged for stock, other securities, other property or assets (including cash) or any combination thereof (any such event a ""), then the Company, or such successor or surviving, purchasing or transferee Person, as the case may be, shall, as a condition precedent to such Merger Event, execute and deliver to the Trustee a supplemental indenture providing that, at the effective time of the Merger Event, the right to receive shares of the Common Stock upon conversion of a Note, if any, will be changed into the right to receive the kind and amount of shares of stock, other securities or other property or assets (including cash) or any combination thereof that a holder would have been entitled to receive (the "") upon such transaction in respect of such Common Stock. From and after the Effective Time of such transaction, (i) Applicable Conversion Rate will relate to units of such Reference Property (a "unit" of Reference Property being the kind and amount of Reference Property that a holder of one share of the Common Stock would receive in such transaction) and (ii) the Daily Conversion Values will be determined based on the value of one unit of Reference Property determined as provided under the definition of Daily Conversion Value.
Merger Event
Reference Property
 
     In the event the Company shall execute a supplemental indenture pursuant to this Section 8.06, the Company shall promptly give the Trustee an Officers' Certificate briefly stating the reasons therefore, the kind or amount of cash, securities or property or asset that will comprise the Reference Property after any such Merger Event, any adjustment to be made with respect thereto and that all conditions precedent have been complied with, and shall promptly mail notice thereof to all Noteholders. The Company shall cause notice of the execution of such supplemental indenture to be mailed to each Noteholder, at its address appearing on the Note Register provided for in this First Supplemental Indenture, within 20 calendar days after execution thereof. Failure to deliver such notice shall not affect the legality or validity of such supplemental indenture.
     (b) If the Merger Event causes the Common Stock to be converted into the right to receive more than a single type of consideration (determined based in part upon any form of stockholder election), the Reference Property into which the Notes will be convertible will be deemed to be the weighted average of the types and amounts of such consideration received by the holders of Common Stock that affirmatively make such an election.
     (c) None of the foregoing provisions shall affect the right of a Noteholder to convert its Notes in accordance with the provisions of this Article 8 prior to the effective date of such Merger Event. The provisions of this Section 8.06 shall similarly apply to successive Merger Events.
     Section 8.07. .
Certain Covenants
     (a) The Company covenants that all shares of Common Stock issued upon conversion of Notes will be fully paid and non-assessable by the Company and free from all taxes, liens and charges with respect to the issue thereof.
     (b) The Company covenants that, if any shares of Common Stock to be provided for the purpose of conversion of Notes hereunder require registration with or approval of any governmental authority under any federal or state law before such shares may be validly issued upon conversion, the Company shall, to the extent then permitted by the rules and interpretations of the Commission, secure such registration or approval, as the case may be.
     (c) The Company further covenants that if at any time the Common Stock shall be listed on any National Securities Exchange or automated quotation system the Company shall, if permitted and required by the rules of the relevant exchange or automated quotation system, list and keep listed, so long as the Common Stock shall be so listed on such exchange or automated quotation system, any Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes.
     Section 8.08. . The Trustee and any other Conversion Agent shall not at any time be under any duty or responsibility to any Noteholder to determine the Applicable Conversion Rate (or any adjustment thereto) or whether any facts exist that may require any adjustment (including any increase) of the Base Conversion Rate, or with respect to the nature or extent or calculation of any such adjustment when made, or with respect to the method employed, or herein or in any supplemental indenture provided to be employed, in making the same. The Trustee and any other Conversion Agent shall not be accountable with
Responsibility of Trustee
 
respect to the validity or value (or the kind or amount) of any shares of Common Stock, or of any securities, property or cash that may at any time be issued or delivered upon the conversion of any Note; and the Trustee and any other Conversion Agent make no representations with respect thereto. Neither the Trustee nor any Conversion Agent shall be responsible for any failure of the Company to issue, transfer or deliver any shares of Common Stock or stock certificates or other securities or property or cash upon the surrender of any Note for the purpose of conversion or to comply with any of the duties, responsibilities or covenants of the Company contained in this Article. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, neither the Trustee nor any Conversion Agent shall be under any responsibility to determine the correctness of any provisions contained in any supplemental indenture entered into pursuant to Section 8.06 relating either to the kind or amount of shares of stock or securities or property (including cash) receivable by Noteholders upon the conversion of their Notes after any event referred to in such Section 8.06 or to any adjustment to be made with respect thereto, but, subject to the provisions of Section 7.01 of the Original Indenture, may accept (without any independent investigation) as conclusive evidence of the correctness of any such provisions, and shall be protected in relying upon, the Officers' Certificate (which the Company shall be obligated to file with the Trustee prior to the execution of any such supplemental indenture) with respect thereto.
     Section 8.09. . In case:

     (c) of any reclassification of the Common Stock (other than a subdivision or combination of its outstanding Common Stock, or a change in par value, or from par value to no par value, or from no par value to par value), or of any consolidation or merger to which the Company is a party and for which approval of any stockholders of the Company is required, or of the sale or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company; or

reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up.

Stockholder Rights Plans
     (a) The Company has adopted a stockholder rights plan, pursuant to which certain rights (the "") are distributed to the holders of Common Stock.
