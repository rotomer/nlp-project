SECOND AMENDMENT TO THE
PIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY
2006 LONG TERM INCENTIVE PLAN
 
THIS SECOND AMENDMENT (the 
Amendment
) to the Pioneer Natural Resources Company 2006 Long Term Incentive Plan, as amended from time to time (the 
Plan
), is effective May 28, 2009 (the 
Effective Date
), and is made by Pioneer Natural Resources Company (the 
Company
).
W I T N E S S E T H
:
 
WHEREAS
, the Company previously adopted the Plan, under which the Company is authorized to grant equity-based incentive awards to certain employees and service providers of the Company;
WHEREAS
, Section 10(c) of the Plan provides that the Companys board of directors (the 
Board
) may amend the Plan in certain circumstances without the approval of stockholders; and
WHEREAS
, the Board has determined that it is desirable to amend the Plan in the manner contemplated hereby.
NOW, THEREFORE
, the Plan shall be amended as of the Effective Date as set forth below.
 
1.
   
Section 7(b) of the Plan is hereby deleted and replaced in its entirety with the following:
 
(b)       Stand-Alone, Additional, Tandem and Substitute Awards. Awards granted under this Plan may, in the discretion of the Committee, be granted either alone or in addition to, in tandem with, or in substitution or exchange for, any other Award or any award granted under another plan of the Company, any Subsidiary or any business entity to be acquired by the Company or a Subsidiary, or any other right of a Participant to receive payment from the Company or any Subsidiary. Such additional, tandem and substitute or exchange Awards may be granted at any time. If an Award is granted in substitution or exchange for another Award, the Committee shall require the surrender of such other Award in consideration for the grant of a new Award. Notwithstanding the foregoing but subject to Section 9 of the Plan, without the approval of stockholders, the Committee will not (i) exchange or substitute previously granted Options or Stock Appreciation Rights in a transaction that constitutes a repricing as such term is used in Section 303A.08 of the Listed Company Manual of the New York Stock Exchange, as amended from time to time or (ii) cause the Company to offer to purchase or exchange for cash Options or Stock Appreciation Rights if, at the time of such offer, the Fair Market Value of a share of Stock is less than the Exercise Price of such Options or Stock Appreciation Rights. Awards under the
 
Plan may be granted in lieu of cash compensation, including in lieu of cash amounts payable under other plans of the Company or any Subsidiary, in which the value of Stock subject to the Award is equivalent in value to the cash compensation (for example, Restricted Stock Units or Restricted Stock), or in which the exercise price, grant price or purchase price of the Award in the nature of a right that may be exercised is equal to the Fair Market Value of the underlying Stock minus the value of the cash compensation surrendered (for example, Options granted with an exercise price discounted by the amount of the cash compensation surrendered).
 
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF
, the Company has caused the execution of this Amendment by its duly authorized officer, effective as of the Effective Date.
 
PIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY
