Explanatory note:
 
Pioneer Natural Resources Company and its subsidiaries ("Pioneer" or the "Company") presents in this Item 2.02 certain information regarding the impact of changes in the fair values of its derivative instruments on the results of operations for certain prior periods and certain other information regarding its accounting for derivative instruments.
 
It is the Companys current expectation that it will provide similar disclosure following the end of each fiscal quarter going forward.
 
Prior to February 1, 2009, the Company entered into and designated certain commodity and interest rate derivative instruments as cash flow hedges of commodity price risk and interest rate risk in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("GAAP"). Effective February 1, 2009, the Company discontinued hedge accounting on all of its existing derivative instruments, and since that date forward has accounted for derivative instruments using the mark-to-market ("MTM") accounting method.
 
On January 31, 2009, the Company determined the fair value of its derivative hedge instruments and increased the effective portion of its net hedge gains recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income  deferred hedge gains, net of tax ("AOCI"), in the equity portion of its consolidated balance sheet, to $99.3 million. In accordance with GAAP, the Company transfers the net hedge gains included in AOCI to oil, natural gas liquids (NGL) and gas revenues and interest expense in the same periods in which the transactions that they hedged are recognized in earnings. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2009, the Company transferred $26.3 million and $96.2 million, respectively, of net gains from AOCI to oil, NGL and gas revenues and $1.6 million and $5.9 million, respectively, of losses from AOCI to interest expense.
 
Under the mark-to-market accounting method, the Company has accounted for all changes in the fair values of its derivative instruments since February 1, 2009 as gains or losses in the earnings of the periods in which they occurred. The following table summarizes MTM derivative losses, net that Pioneer expects to record in its earnings for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2009:
