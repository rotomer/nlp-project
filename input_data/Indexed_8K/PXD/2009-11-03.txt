News Release
 
Pioneer Natural Resources Reports Third Quarter 2009 Results
 
Dallas, Texas, November 3, 2009 -- Pioneer Natural Resources Company (NYSE:PXD)
today announced financial and operating results for the quarter ended September 30, 2009.
 
Pioneer reported a third quarter net loss attributable to common stockholders of $7 million, or $.06 per diluted share. The loss included a noncash unrealized loss on commodity derivatives of $10 million after tax, or $.08 per diluted share. Without the effect of this item, adjusted income for the third quarter of 2009 would have been $3 million, or $.02 per diluted share.
 
Included in Pioneers third quarter results were net gains of $5 million after tax, or $.05 per diluted share related to unusual items. These after-tax unusual items included:
 
Recent highlights include:
 
Scott Sheffield, Chairman and CEO, stated, Despite a substantial reduction in drilling activity for 2009, our high-quality assets delivered production growth of 7% during the first nine months compared to last year, and we continue to expect full-year production growth of at least 5% per share. We remain committed to a free cash flow model, with excess cash flow being used to reduce debt this year.
 
Improving oil prices and our strong derivative positions support operating cash flow forecasts of approximately $1 billion in 2010 and $1.4 billion in 2011. As a result, we are aggressively ramping up our drilling program in the Spraberry field and will continue our successful oil development program in Alaska. We have also expanded our Eagle Ford Shale drilling program where we hold
 
310,000 gross acres in one of the premier shale plays in the U.S. With this drilling program and the expiration of our 5 MBOEPD volumetric production payment obligation, we expect to once again generate quarterly production growth in 2010, while preserving our free cash flow model.
 
In the Spraberry field, Pioneer increased daily production for the first nine months of 2009 by 8% to 33 MBOEPD as compared to the same period in 2008. This production growth reflects the success of the 2008 drilling program, improved well performance and the Spraberrys low production decline rates. Nine-month results also include inventoried natural gas liquids (NGLs) sold during the first half of 2009 that were produced but not sold in the fourth quarter of 2008 as a result of hurricane damage to third-party fractionation facilities.
 
Pioneer resumed Spraberry drilling activities in August and now has three rigs drilling in the field, which is the largest onshore oil field in the U.S. lower 48 states. Pioneer is the largest producer in the Spraberry field. With a substantial reduction in well costs, Pioneers internal rate of return on Spraberry drilling has improved to approximately 50% before tax, at current strip prices for oil. As a result, the Company is aggressively ramping up Spraberry drilling and expects to have 14 rigs running by January 2010, increasing to 19 rigs by mid-year and 24 rigs by year end.
 
Approximately 425 Spraberry wells are expected to be drilled during 2010, with a continual ramp up in quarterly production anticipated. Fourth quarter production is expected to average approximately 29 MBOEPD during 2009 and increase to approximately 34 MBOEPD in the fourth quarter of 2010. The majority of these wells will include completions in additional zones, including the Wolfcamp and shale/silt intervals. Pioneer will also implement a 7,000-acre waterflood project in 2010.
 
The Company plans to continue to add rigs beyond 2010, and by 2012, Pioneer plans to be operating 40 rigs and drilling 1,000 wells per year. From 2009 through 2013, Spraberry production is expected to double with compounded annual production growth averaging approximately 20%.
 
In South Texas, Pioneers daily production for the first nine months of 2009 rose 4% to 76 MMCFPD versus the prior-year period, benefitting from its strong 2008 Edwards Trend drilling program. The Company also recently announced a significant discovery in the Eagle Ford Shale play where it holds 310,000 gross acres overlaying the Edwards Trend. The Sinor #5 well flowed at an initial rate of approximately 11.3 MMCFEPD of gas (approximately 8.3 MMCFPD of liquids-rich gas and 500 BPD of higher-valued condensate). The liquids-rich gas contains 1,200 British thermal units per cubic foot. Pioneer now plans to continuously operate one rig in the play through 2010 and test the benefits of longer laterals and additional frac stages. The Company is drilling its next well and will evaluate a further rig expansion as additional drilling results are known. Pioneer is also exploring a joint venture strategy to accelerate development of its extensive Eagle Ford acreage position.
 
On the North Slope of Alaska, production from Pioneers Oooguruk field averaged 4 thousand barrels of oil per day (MBOPD) during the first nine months of 2009. Third quarter production averaged 6 MBOPD. Pioneer successfully drilled a total of five horizontal Nuiqsut laterals during the second and third quarters, three fracture-stimulated production wells and two unstimulated water injection wells. During the upcoming winter drilling season, the Company will resume drilling to the Kuparuk zone where the Company has previously drilled two high-rate producing wells.
 
In the Raton and Mid-Continent areas, no wells have been drilled during 2009, but due to the low production decline characteristics of these areas, nine-month production was down only 5% to 188 MMCFPD and 7% to 109 MMCFEPD, respectively, compared to last year. The reduction in Mid-Continent production included the curtailment of approximately 6 MMCFEPD during the second quarter of 2009 due to an unscheduled third-party pipeline repair. Pioneers Mid-Continent
 
 
 
production will increase by approximately 28 MMCFPD on January 1, 2010 with the expiration of the volumetric production payment (VPP) obligation in the Hugoton field.
 
Daily production in Tunisia increased 13% to 7 MBOEPD in the first nine months of 2009 as compared to the same period in 2008. Fourth quarter production is forecasted to average 6 MBOEPD reflecting planned gas pipeline repairs and the planned lifting schedule. Pioneer-operated drilling will recommence in early 2010 with three new prospects identified from new 3-D seismic. The Company is also participating in two non-operated wells being drilled in the Adam Concession during the fourth quarter of 2009.
 
In South Africa, daily production for the first nine months of 2009 increased 51% to 6 MBOEPD compared to the same period in 2008 reflecting the commencement of production from the most prolific well in Pioneers South Coast Gas project during the fourth quarter of 2008. A major maintenance shutdown commenced in late September and is expected to return to full capacity in early November at the Mossel Bay gas-to-liquids plant where the gas production is sold. As a result, fourth quarter forecasted production is expected to be curtailed by approximately 2 MBOEPD and average 4 MBOEPD.
 
Cost Reduction Initiatives
Pioneers asset teams have aggressively implemented initiatives to reduce 2009 lease operating expenses (LOE). Third quarter production costs were 24% lower on a per BOE basis than the same period in 2008. The Company has achieved significant reductions in electricity, water disposal, well servicing, facilities and compression costs. Compared to the second quarter of 2009, production costs were up 11% on a per BOE basis, primarily due to higher production taxes, increased workover and preventive maintenance activity and lower production volumes. The Company did not experience inflation in service costs and other base operating expenses during the quarter.
 
The Company has also worked with service providers to reduce drilling and completion costs. Since the third quarter of 2008 when these costs peaked, Pioneer has reduced drilling and completion costs by more than 30% per well for the majority of its domestic drilling inventory.
 
Financial Review
 
Third quarter sales from continuing operations averaged 112,623 barrels oil equivalent per day (BOEPD), consisting of oil sales averaging 31,663 barrels per day (BPD), NGL sales averaging 18,602 BPD and gas sales averaging 374 MMCFPD.
 
The reported third quarter average price for oil was $78.20 per barrel and included $8.24 per barrel related to deferred revenue from VPPs for which production was not recorded. The reported price for NGLs was $33.13 per barrel. The reported price for gas was $3.64 per thousand cubic feet (MCF) and included $.35 per MCF related to deferred revenue from VPPs for which production was not recorded.
 
Third quarter production costs averaged $11.43 per BOE.
 
Depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) expense averaged $15.69 per BOE for the third quarter. Exploration and abandonment costs were $25 million for the quarter and included $13 million of acreage and unsuccessful drilling costs and $12 million of geologic and geophysical expenses and personnel costs.
 
Cash flow from operating activities for the third quarter was $162 million.
 
 
 
Financial Outlook
 
Fourth quarter production is forecasted to average 105,000 BOEPD to 110,000 BOEPD, reflecting reduced 2009 drilling activity, downtime associated with the gas plant maintenance shutdown in South Africa and gas pipeline repairs and planned lifting schedule in Tunisia.
 
Fourth quarter production costs are expected to average $11.50 to $13.50 per BOE, based on current NYMEX strip prices for oil and gas, including higher production taxes and transportation costs, lower production volumes and increased workover activity. DD&A expense is expected to average $15.50 to $17.00 per BOE based on the new SEC reserve pricing methodology that is expected to be implemented during the fourth quarter of 2009.
 
Total exploration and abandonment expense during the fourth quarter is expected to be $20 million to $30 million, primarily related to exploration wells, including related acreage costs, and seismic and personnel costs.
 
General and administrative expense is expected to be $35 million to $39 million. Interest expense is expected to be $42 million to $45 million. Accretion of discount on asset retirement obligations is expected to be $2 million to $4 million.
 
Noncontrolling interest in consolidated subsidiaries net income is expected to be $8 million to $10 million, primarily reflecting the public ownership in Pioneer Southwest.
 
The Company also expects to recognize $5 million to $10 million of charges in other expense associated with certain drilling rigs stacked as a result of the low price environment.
 
The Companys fourth quarter effective income tax rate is expected to range from 40% to 50% based on current capital spending plans, higher tax rates in Tunisia and no significant mark-to-market changes in the Companys derivative position. Cash taxes are expected to be $10 million to $15 million and are primarily attributable to Tunisia.
 
Pioneer has increased its 2010 and 2011 oil and gas derivative positions to support the Companys free cash flow model and the resumption of oil drilling. In particular, the Company recently added 2,000 BPD of three-way oil collar derivatives in 2010 and 9,000 BPD in 2011, with upside to approximately $87 per barrel and $107 per barrel, respectively. The Company also added 75,000 million British thermal units per day of three-way gas collar derivatives in 2011, with upside to $8.70 per million British thermal units.
 
The Company's financial and mark-to-market results, derivatives for oil, NGL and gas, amortization of net deferred gains on discontinued/terminated commodity hedges and future VPP amortization are outlined on the attached schedules.

UNAUDITED SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
(in thousands)
 
EBITDAX and discretionary cash flow ("DCF") (as defined below) are presented herein, and reconciled to the generally accepted accounting principle ("GAAP") measures of net income (loss) and net cash provided by operating activities because of their wide acceptance by the investment community as financial indicators of a company's ability to internally fund exploration and development activities and to service or incur debt. The Company also views the non-GAAP measures of EBITDAX and DCF as useful tools for comparisons of the Company's financial indicators with those of peer companies that follow the full cost method of accounting. EBITDAX and DCF should not be considered as alternatives to net income (loss) or net cash provided by operating activities, as defined by GAAP.

UNAUDITED SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES (continued)
(in thousands, except per share data)
 
Income adjusted for unrealized mark-to-market derivatives losses, net, as presented in this press release are presented and reconciled to Pioneer's net loss attributable to common stockholders that is determined in accordance with GAAP because Pioneer believes that these non-GAAP financial measure reflects an additional way of viewing aspects of Pioneer's business that, when viewed together with its financial results computed in accordance with GAAP, provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting its historical financial performance and future operating results, greater transparency of underlying trends and greater comparability of results across periods. In addition, management believes that these non-GAAP measures may enhance investors' ability to assess Pioneer's historical and future financial performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to be substitutes for the comparable GAAP measure and should be read only in conjunction with Pioneer's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Unrealized mark-to-market derivative gains and losses will recur in future periods; however, the amount and frequency of each item can vary significantly from period to period. The table below reconciles Pioneer's net loss attributable to common stockholders for the three months ended September 30, 2009, as determined in accordance with GAAP, to the income as adjusted for unrealized mark-to-market derivative losses, net, for that quarter:
