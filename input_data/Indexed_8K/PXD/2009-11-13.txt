Conditions to the Obligations of the Underwriters

          (e) The Company shall have furnished to the Representatives a certificate of the Company, signed in their representative capacities by the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the Company, dated the Closing Date, to the effect that:
     (i) the representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement are true and correct in all material respects on and as of the Closing Date with the same effect as if made on the Closing Date and the Company has complied with all the agreements and satisfied all the conditions on its part to be performed or satisfied at or prior to the Closing Date;
 
     (ii) no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or stop order preventing or suspending the use of any prospectus relating to the Securities has been issued and no proceedings for that purpose have been, to the Company's knowledge, instituted or threatened by the Commission; and
     (iii) since the date of the most recent financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Final Prospectus, as amended or supplemented prior to the Execution Time, there has been no material adverse effect on the condition (financial or otherwise), earnings, business or properties of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, whether or not arising from transactions in the ordinary course of business, except as set forth in or contemplated in the Final Prospectus, as amended or supplemented prior to the Execution Time, or as described in such certificate;
          (f) At the Execution Time and the Closing Date, the Representatives shall have received from Ernst & Young LLP a letter or letters dated such date or dates, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Representatives, together with signed or reproduced copies of such letter or letters for each of the other Underwriters containing statements and information of the type ordinarily included in accountants' "comfort letters" to underwriters with respect to the financial statements and certain financial information contained in the Registration Statement, the Final Prospectus, the Disclosure Package and any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus;

          (i) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall have furnished to the Representatives such further information, certificates and documents as the Representatives may reasonably request.
 
     If any of the conditions specified in this Section 6 shall not have been fulfilled in all material respects when and as provided in this Agreement, or if any of the opinions and certificates mentioned above or elsewhere in this Agreement shall not be in all material respects reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Representatives, this Agreement and all obligations of the Underwriters hereunder may be canceled at, or at any time prior to, the Closing Date by the Representatives. Notice of such cancellation shall be given to the Company in writing or by telephone or facsimile confirmed in writing. The Representatives may in their sole discretion waive on behalf of the Underwriters compliance with any conditions to the obligations of the Underwriters hereunder.

Reimbursement of Underwriters' Expenses
          8. . The QIU hereby consents to the references to it as set forth under the caption "Underwriting" in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus and in any amendment or supplement thereto made in accordance with Section 5(a) hereof.
QIU Consent
          9. . (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, the directors, officers, employees and agents of each Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or other federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement as originally filed, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Final Prospectus, the Final Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or in all cases any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; provided, however, that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written
Indemnification and Contribution
 
information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion therein. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have to any Underwriter or to any officer, employee or controlling person of that Underwriter;
          (a) (i) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, in its capacity as QIU, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which the QIU may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any act or omission to act or any alleged act or omission to act by Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, as QIU, in connection with any transaction contemplated by this Agreement or undertaken in preparing for the purchase, sale and delivery of the Securities, except to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability results from the gross negligence or bad faith of Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC in performing the services as QIU, and will reimburse the QIU for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the QIU in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred.
     (ii) The obligations of the Company under this Section 9(b) shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls the QIU within the meaning of the Act;
          (b) Each Underwriter severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, its officers, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, but only with reference to written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which any Underwriter may otherwise have. The Company acknowledges that the statements set forth (x) in the last paragraph of the cover page regarding delivery of the Securities and (y) under the heading "Underwriting", (i) the names listed in the table included in the first paragraph of the text, (ii) the third paragraph of text concerning concessions, (iii) the sixth paragraph of text concerning confirmation of sales to any account over which the Underwriters exercise discretionary authority, (iv) the third sentence in the seventh paragraph of text concerning market making by the Underwriters and (v) the eighth and ninth paragraphs of text concerning stabilizing transactions and penalty bids, in any Preliminary Final Prospectus and Final Prospectus constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the several Underwriters for inclusion in any Preliminary Final Prospectus, the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Final Prospectus;
          (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 9 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 9, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a), (b) or (c) above unless and to the extent the indemnifying party did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of
 
substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a), (b) or (c) above. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to assume the defense thereof and to appoint counsel of the indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); provided, however, that such counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel, and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel (including local counsel) if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. An indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent (x) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding and (y) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of an indemnified party; and
          (d) In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of this Section 9 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, the Company, the QIU and the Underwriters severally agree to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending same) (collectively "") to which the Company and one or more of the Underwriters or the QIU may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and by the Underwriters or the QIU on the other from the offering of the Securities; provided, however, that in no case shall any Underwriter or the QIU (except as may be provided in any agreement among underwriters relating to the offering of the Securities) be responsible for any amount in excess of the total price at which the Securities underwritten and distributed to the public by such Underwriter or QIU was offered to the public. If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Company, the QIU and the Underwriters severally shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters or the QIU on the other in connection with the statements or omissions
Losses
 
which resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Benefits received by the Company shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by it, and benefits received by the Underwriters or the QIU shall be deemed to be equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters with respect to the Securities purchased under this Agreement, or the fee payable to the QIU in Section 2 hereof. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters or the QIU on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Company, the QIU and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (e), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 9, each person who controls an Underwriter or the QIU within the meaning of the Act and each director, officer, employee and agent of an Underwriter or the QIU shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter or the QIU, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act, each officer of the Company and each director of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (e).
          10. . If any one or more Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Securities agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter or Underwriters hereunder and the aggregate principal amount of Securities that such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase does not exceed 10% of the total principal amount of Securities that the Underwriters are obligated to purchase and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, then the Representatives shall have the right, within 24 hours thereafter, to make arrangements for one or more of the non-defaulting Underwriters, or any other underwriters, to purchase all, but not less than all of the unsold Securities in such amounts as may be agreed upon and upon the terms herein set forth; if, however, the Representatives shall not have completed such arrangements within such 24-hour period, then the non-defaulting Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the principal amount of Securities set forth opposite their names in hereto bears to the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth opposite the names of all the non-defaulting Underwriters) the Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase. If any Underwriter or Underwriters so default and the aggregate principal amount of Securities with respect to which such default or defaults occur exceeds 10% of the total principal amount of Securities that the defaulting Underwriter is obligated to purchase on such Closing Date and arrangements satisfactory to the Representatives and the Company for the purchase of such Securities by other persons are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement will terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except as provided in Section 12. As used in this Agreement, the term "Underwriter" includes any
Default by an Underwriter

person substituted for an Underwriter under this Section. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Company and any non-defaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder.

This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Representatives, by notice given to the Company prior to delivery of and payment for the Securities, if at any time prior to such time, (i) trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq National Market shall have been suspended or limited or minimum prices shall have been established on any of such Exchanges, (ii) a banking moratorium shall have been declared either by authorities in the United States or New York state, (iii) there shall have occurred a change or development involving a prospective change in United States taxation affecting the Securities or the transfer thereof or the imposition of exchange controls by the United States, or (iv) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, except as existing with similar severity on the date hereof involving the United States, declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war, or other calamity or crisis, except as existing with similar severity on the date hereof the effect of which on financial markets is such as to make it, in the sole judgment of the Representatives, impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or delivery of the Securities as contemplated by the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus.

The Company has been advised that the Representatives and their affiliates are engaged in a broad range of transactions which may involve interests that differ from those of the Company and that the Representatives have no obligation to disclose such interests and transactions to the Company by virtue of any fiduciary, advisory or agency relationship.

     (f) The Notes shall be redeemable at any time, at the option of the Company, in whole or from time to time in part, at the price, and otherwise in accordance with the terms and provisions, set forth in Section 2 of this Supplemental Indenture and (to the extent they do not conflict with Section 2 of this Supplemental Indenture) the terms and provisions of Sections 3.03 and 3.04 of the Indenture.

     (k) Article X of the Indenture shall apply to the Notes.
     (l) The Notes shall not be subordinated pursuant to the provisions of Article XII of the Indenture. The Notes shall be senior unsecured obligations of the Company ranking with other existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness of the Company.
pari passu
     (m) The Company shall be subject to all the covenants set forth in Article IV of the Indenture with respect to the Notes.
     (n) To the extent not set forth herein, the provisions of Section 2.03 of the Indenture are not applicable.
     (o) Initially, the Trustee shall act as Paying Agent and Registrar. Interest shall be payable at the office or agency of the Company maintained by the Company for such purposes in the United States, which shall initially be the office of the Paying Agent at Sixth and Marquette, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55479. The Company shall pay interest on any Notes in certificated form by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as it appears in the Debt Security Register (or upon written application by such Person to the Trustee and Paying Agent (if different from the Trustee) not later than the relevant Interest Record Date, by wire transfer in immediately available funds to such Person's account within the United States, if such Person is entitled to interest on an aggregate principal in excess of $1,000,000, which application shall remain in effect until the Holder notifies the Trustee and Paying Agent to the contrary).
     Section 2. . The Notes will be redeemable at any time, at the option of the Company, in whole or from time to time in part, upon not less than 30 and not more than 60 days' notice as provided in the Indenture, on any date prior to maturity (the "Redemption Date") at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the Redemption Date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on any interest payment date that is on or prior to the Redemption Date) plus a Make-Whole Premium, if any (the "Redemption Price"). In no event will a Redemption Price ever be less than 100% of the principal amount of the Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the Redemption Date.
Optional Redemption of Notes
     The amount of the Make-Whole Premium with respect to any of the Notes (or portion thereof) to be redeemed will be equal to the excess, if any, of:
     (a) the sum of the present values, calculated as of the Redemption Date, of:
          (i) each interest payment that, but for such redemption, would have been payable on such Note (or portion thereof) being redeemed on each interest payment date occurring after the Redemption Date (excluding any accrued interest for the period prior to the Redemption Date); and
 
          (ii) the principal amount that, but for such redemption, would have been payable at the final maturity of such Note (or portion thereof) being redeemed; over
     (b) the principal amount of such Note (or portion thereof) being redeemed.
     The present values of interest and principal payments referred to in clause (a) above will be determined in accordance with generally accepted principles of financial analysis. Such present values will be calculated by discounting the amount of each payment of interest or principal from the date that each such payment would have been payable, but for the redemption, to the Redemption Date at a discount rate equal to the Treasury Yield (as defined below) plus 50 basis points.
     The Make-Whole Premium will be calculated by an independent investment banking institution of national standing appointed by the Company; provided that if the Company fails to make such appointment at least 30 business days prior to the Redemption Date, or if the institution so appointed is unwilling or unable to make such calculation, such calculation will be made by an independent investment banking institution of national standing appointed by the Trustee (in any such case, an "Independent Investment Banker").
     For purposes of determining the Make-Whole Premium, "Treasury Yield" means a rate of interest per annum equal to the weekly average yield to maturity of United States Treasury Notes that have a constant maturity that corresponds to the remaining term to maturity of the applicable Notes, calculated to the nearest 1/12th of a year (the "Remaining Term"). The Treasury Yield will be determined as of the third business day immediately preceding the applicable Redemption Date.
     The weekly average yields of United States Treasury Notes will be determined by reference to the most recent statistical release published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and designated "H.15 (519) Selected Interest Rates" or any successor release (the "H.15 Statistical Release"). If the H.15 Statistical Release sets forth a weekly average yield for United States Treasury Notes having a constant maturity that is the same as the Remaining Term, then the Treasury Yield will be equal to such weekly average yield. In all other cases, the Treasury Yield will be calculated by interpolation, on a straight-line basis, between the weekly average yields on the United States Treasury Notes that have a constant maturity closest to and greater than the Remaining Term and the United States Treasury Notes that have a constant maturity closest to and less than the Remaining Term (in each case as set forth in the H.15 Statistical Release). Any weekly average yields so calculated by interpolation will be rounded to the nearest 1/100th of 1%, with any figure of 1/200th of 1% or above being rounded upward. If weekly average yields for United States Treasury Notes are not available in the H.15 Statistical Release or otherwise, then the Treasury Yield will be calculated by interpolation of comparable rates selected by the Independent Investment Banker.
     In the case of any partial redemption, selection of the Notes for redemption will be made by the Trustee on a pro rata basis, by lot or by such other method as the Trustee in its sole discretion shall deem to be fair and appropriate, although no such Note of $1,000 in original principal amount or less shall be redeemed in part. If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption relating to such Note shall state the portion of the principal amount
 
thereof to be redeemed. A new Note in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof will be issued in the name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of the original Note.
     Section 3. .
Offer to Repurchase Upon a Change of Control Repurchase Event
     (a) If a Change of Control Repurchase Event occurs, unless the Company has otherwise exercised its right to redeem the Notes, the Company will make an offer to each Holder of Notes to repurchase all or any portion (equal to $1,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000) of such Holder's Notes at a price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Notes repurchased to the date of repurchase (the "Change of Control Repurchase Event Payment"). Within 30 days following any Change of Control Repurchase Event, the Company will mail a notice (the "Change of Control Repurchase Event Offer") to each holder describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control Repurchase Event and stating:
          (i) that the Change of Control Repurchase Event Offer is being made pursuant to the Change of Control Repurchase Event provisions of the Notes and that all Notes tendered will be accepted for payment;
          (ii) the purchase price and the purchase date, which shall be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed (the "Change of Control Repurchase Event Payment Date");
          (iii) that any Note not tendered will continue to accrue interest;
          (iv) that, unless the Company defaults in the payment of the Change of Control Repurchase Event Payment, all Notes accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Repurchase Event Offer will cease to accrue interest after the Change of Control Repurchase Event Payment Date;
          (v) that Holders electing to have any Notes purchased pursuant to a Change of Control Repurchase Event Offer will be required to surrender the Notes to the paying agent at the address specified in the notice prior to the close of business on the third business day preceding the Change of Control Repurchase Event Payment Date;
          (vi) that Holders will be entitled to withdraw their election if the paying agent receives, not later than the close of business on the second business day preceding the Change of Control Repurchase Event Payment Date, a telegram, telex, facsimile transmission or letter setting forth the name of the Holder, the principal amount of Notes delivered for purchase, and a statement that such Holder is withdrawing his election to have the Notes purchased; and
          (vii) that Holders whose Notes are being purchased only in part will be issued new Notes equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered, which unpurchased portion must be equal to $1,000 in principal amount or an integral multiple thereof.
     The Company will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act, and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes as a result of a Change of Control
 
Repurchase Event. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control Repurchase Event provisions of the Notes, the Company will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control Repurchase Event provisions of the Notes by virtue of such conflict.
     (b) On the Change of Control Repurchase Event Payment Date, the Company will, to the extent lawful:
          (i) accept for payment all Notes or portions of Notes properly tendered pursuant to the Company's offer;
          (ii) deposit with the paying agent an amount equal to the aggregate purchase price in respect of all Notes or portions of Notes properly tendered; and
          (iii) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee the Notes properly accepted, together with an Officers' Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Notes or portions of Notes being purchased by the Company.
     The paying agent will promptly mail to each holder of Notes properly tendered the purchase price for such Notes, and the Trustee will promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book entry) to each holder a new Note equal to the principal amount of any unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered, if any; provided, that each new Note will be issued in denominations of $1,000 or integral multiples of $1,000.
     (c) Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control Repurchase Event, the Indenture does not contain any other provisions that permit the holders of the Notes to require the Company to repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction.

The Company may, without the consent of the Holders of the Notes, increase such aggregate principal amount in the future, on the same terms and conditions and with the same CUSIP numbers as the Notes. The Company shall not issue any such additional Notes unless the additional Notes are fungible with the Notes for United States federal income tax purposes. The Indenture imposes certain limitations (with significant exceptions) on the ability of the Company and its Subsidiaries to create Liens on assets and engage in sale and leaseback transactions. This Indenture also imposes limitations on the ability of the Company to consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of its assets.

If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the Securities may declare all the Securities to be due and payable immediately. Certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency are Events of Default that will result in the Securities being due and payable immediately upon the occurrence of such Events of Default without any action by the Trustee or any Holders.
     Holders may not enforce the Indenture or the Securities except as provided in the Indenture. The Trustee may refuse to enforce the Indenture or the Securities unless it receives reasonable indemnity or security. Subject to certain limitations, Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power. The Trustee may withhold from Holders notice of any continuing Default (except a Default in payment of principal or interest) if it determines that withholding notice is in the interest of the Holders.

     Subject to certain limitations imposed by the Act, the Trustee under the Indenture, in its individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Securities and may otherwise deal with and collect obligations owed to it by the Company or its Affiliates and may otherwise deal with the Company or its Affiliates with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee.
14.
No Recourse Against Others
     An incorporator and any past, present or future director, officer, employee or stockholder, as such, of the Company shall not have any liability for any obligations of the Company under the Securities or the Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of or by reason of such obligations or their creation. By accepting a Security, each Holder waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for the issue of the Securities.
15.

     This Security shall not be valid until an authorized signatory of the Trustee (or an authenticating agent) manually signs the certificate of authentication on the other side of this Security.

     THIS SECURITY SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK BUT WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO APPLICABLE PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAW TO THE EXTENT THAT THE APPLICATION OF THE LAWS OF ANOTHER JURISDICTION WOULD BE REQUIRED THEREBY.
