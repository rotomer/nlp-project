Pioneer Natural Resources Company (the Company) entered into a Rights Agreement dated as of July 20, 2001 (as amended, the "Rights Agreement"), and on July 19, 2001, the Board of Directors of the Company declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase right (a "Right") for each outstanding share of common stock of the Company. Each Right is attached to a share of the Companys common stock and will become exercisable only if a person or group acquires 20% or more of the Companys outstanding voting stock or announces a tender or exchange offer that would result in ownership of 20% or more of the Companys voting stock. Pursuant to the terms of the Rights Agreement, the Rights will expire on July 31, 2011, unless extended or unless the Rights are earlier redeemed by the Company.
 
It is the current intent of the Board of Directors not to renew or extend the Rights Agreement, and thus to permit the Rights to expire by their terms on July 31, 2011.
   Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
Dated: March 10, 2011
