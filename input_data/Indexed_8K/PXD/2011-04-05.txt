Gentlemen:
 
I am the Vice President, Corporate Secretary and Chief Compliance Officer of the Borrower, and have acted as counsel for the Borrower with respect to the execution and delivery of the Credit Agreement and the Notes executed by the Borrower thereunder (the ). This opinion is delivered to you pursuant to the Credit Agreement.  Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Credit Agreement unless otherwise indicated by the context in which such terms are so used.
Subject Documents
 
In connection with the opinions hereinafter expressed, I have (i) investigated such questions of law, (ii) examined such corporate documents and records of Borrower and certificates of public officials, and (iii) received such information from officers and/or other representatives of the Borrower as I have deemed necessary or appropriate for the purposes of the opinions set forth herein.  I have also examined the Subject Documents.
 
In rendering the opinions herein set forth, I have assumed (i) the due execution and delivery of each of the Subject Documents by all parties thereto other than the Borrower, (ii) that each of the Subject Documents is valid, binding and enforceable against the parties thereto other than the Borrower, (iii) the legal capacity of natural persons, (iv) the genuineness of all signatures, (v) the authenticity of all documents submitted to me as originals, and (vi) the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to me as copies.  As to various questions of fact material to my opinions, I have relied upon the representations made in the Subject Documents by, and upon certificates of the officers of, the Borrower.
 
 
 
 
 
Based upon the foregoing and subject to the qualifications set forth herein, I am of the opinion that:
 
A.
 
The Borrower is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware.
 
B.
 
The Borrower has the corporate power and authority to execute and deliver the Credit Agreement and to perform its obligations thereunder.  The execution and delivery by the Borrower of the Credit Agreement and the performance by it of its obligations thereunder have been duly authorized by all requisite corporate action on the part of the Borrower.
 
C.
 
The Credit Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Borrower.
 
D.
 
The execution and delivery by the Borrower of the Credit Agreement do not, and the performance by the Borrower of its obligations under the Credit Agreement will not, (a) breach or result in a default under, or creation or imposition of any lien on any properties of the Borrower pursuant to the terms of, any indenture, credit agreement or other agreement in respect of borrowed money or, to my knowledge, any other material agreement or instrument to which the Borrower is a party or by which it or its properties are bound, or (b) to my knowledge, result in any violation of any order, writ, judgment or decree.
 
E.
 
The Borrower is not an investment company within the meaning of, nor subject to regulation under, the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
 
The opinions set forth above are limited to the matters expressly set forth in such opinions, and no opinion is to be implied or inferred beyond such matters.  The opinions set forth above are limited further by the following:
 
1.           The enforceability of the Subject Documents may be limited or affected by (i) applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance or obligation, rearrangement, moratorium, reorganization, liquidation, conservatorship, or similar debtor relief laws affecting the enforcement of creditors rights generally, (ii) general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforcement is sought in a proceeding in equity or at law), (iii) the rights of the United States of America under the Federal Tax Lien Act of 1996, as amended, (iv) standards of commercial reasonableness and good faith, and (v) other applicable laws, court decisions and constitutional requirements in and of the States of Texas and Delaware or the United States of America, as applicable, limiting or affecting the exercise of remedies, but the remedies provided for in the Subject Documents, as a whole, are adequate for the practical realization of the benefits intended to be conferred by the Subject Documents, except the consequences of any procedural delay that may result therefrom.
 
2.           To the extent that the obligations of the Borrower may be dependent upon such matters, I have assumed that all parties to the Subject Documents other than the Borrower (i) are duly organized, validly existing, and in good standing under the laws of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
their respective jurisdictions of organization, and (ii) have the requisite corporate power and authority to enter into and perform their respective obligations under the Subject Documents.
 
3.           This opinion speaks as to matters existing as of the date hereof and is limited to the matters expressly set forth herein, and no opinion is implied or may be inferred beyond such matters.
 
4.           I express no opinion as to the enforceability of any provisions providing for (i) the waiver of a trial by jury, waiver of venue or forum selection, or waiver of damage claims, (ii) the indemnification or exculpation of any Agent or any Lender (A) in violation of public policy, (B) to the extent precluded by federal or state securities laws, or (C) purporting to indemnify or exculpate any Agent or any Lender from the consequences of its own negligence or strict liability, or (iii) any party's consent to jurisdiction.
 
5.           I have assumed that the Borrower will comply with the provisions of the Credit Agreement relating to the use of proceeds.
 
6.           The term  and other terms of similar import used in this opinion shall mean only my existing actual knowledge and are not intended to imply that I in fact have actual knowledge of the subject matter to which such terms apply; accordingly, except as may be otherwise noted herein, I have not made any independent verification of or inquiry with respect to any facts relevant to such opinion, whether for purposes of rendering this opinion to you or in the general course of my representation of the Borrower; however, in the course of rendering the legal services required in connection with the Subject Documents, no facts or circumstances have come to my attention that any such information is incorrect in any respect.  You are advised that my engagement by the Borrower has been limited to specific matters about which I have been consulted; consequently, there are matters of a legal nature involving the Borrower about which I have not advised or represented them.
to my knowledge
 
The opinions expressed herein are limited to the laws of the State of Texas, the federal law of the United States of America, and the corporate laws of the State of Delaware. The opinions expressed herein are based on present interpretations of presently existing laws and regulations of such jurisdictions, and you should be aware that I am not admitted to the practice of law in the State of Delaware and my opinions expressed herein as to the laws of such state are based solely upon the unofficial compilations of the Delaware General Corporation Law and the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act, and reported court decisions available to me.  The opinions expressed herein also are based on the facts and circumstances related to the substance of the opinions expressed herein as they exist on the date hereof.
 
This opinion is limited in its use to reliance by the Agents and the Lenders in consummating the transactions contemplated by the Subject Documents, and no person or entity other than the Agents and the Lenders and their permitted assignees and participants may rely on it, provided that any such reliance by an assignee or participant must be actual and reasonable under the circumstances existing at the time of assignment or participation, including
 
 
 
 
 
circumstances relating to any change in law or fact or other development known or reasonably knowable by the assignee or participant at such time.  Without my prior written consent, this opinion may not be quoted in whole or in part, or otherwise referred to in any report or document or furnished to any other person or entity, except in accordance with the provisions of Section 9.11 of the Credit Agreement.
 
I disclaim any duty to advise you regarding any changes in, or to otherwise communicate with you with respect to, the matters addressed herein.
