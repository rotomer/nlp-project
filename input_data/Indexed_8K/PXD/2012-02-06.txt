EXHIBIT 99.1
News Release
 
 
 
(Pioneer or the Company) today announced financial and operating results for the quarter ended December 31, 2011.
Dallas, Texas, February 6, 2012 -- Pioneer Natural Resources Company (NYSE:PXD)
Pioneer reported a fourth quarter net loss attributable to common stockholders of $111 million, or $0.93 per diluted share (see attached schedule for a description of the earnings per diluted share calculation).  Without the effect of noncash derivative mark-to-market losses and other unusual items, principally noncash, adjusted income for the fourth quarter was $147 million after tax, or $1.19 per diluted share.
Scott Sheffield, Chairman and CEO, stated, The Company delivered another strong quarter, with production of 140 thousand barrels oil equivalent per day (MBOEPD), an increase of 12 MBOEPD, or 9%, from the third quarter of 2011 (including South Africa, which is being moved to discontinued operations, in both quarters).  Our three core liquids-rich growth assets in Texas, the Spraberry field, the Eagle Ford Shale and the Barnett Shale Combo, were the drivers of this significant increase.  These three assets were also the primary contributors to Pioneers 313% drillbit reserve replacement in 2011 at a drillbit finding and development cost of $13.83 per barrel oil equivalent (BOE).
We are announcing that we plan to sell our South Africa business, the only remaining international asset in Pioneers portfolio, during the first half of 2012.  With this asset removed from continuing operations, production averaged 120 MBOEPD in 2011, an increase of 16% compared to 2010.  Based on our drilling plan for 2012, which high grades liquids-rich drilling to optimize returns in response to low gas prices, we expect the Company to deliver production growth of 23% to 27% compared to 2011.  The capital program for 2012 totals $2.5 billion, with 86% of the spending designated for drilling in the Spraberry field, the horizontal Wolfcamp Shale, the Eagle Ford Shale and the Barnett Shale Combo. Funding for the capital program includes forecasted operating cash flow of $2.2 billion and $0.3 billion of the proceeds from Pioneers recent equity offering.
We expect the Company to achieve a compound annual production growth rate of 20+% through 2014, with liquids increasing from 56% of total production currently to 65% in 2014.  This strong, liquids-focused production growth, coupled with our attractive derivatives position, is forecasted to generate compound annual operating cash flow growth of 25+% over the 2012 through 2014 period.  Revenue from liquids production is expected to grow from 80% of Pioneers total revenue currently to 90% by 2014, assuming commodity prices of $100 per barrel for oil and $3 per thousand cubic feet (MCF) for gas in 2012 and $100 per barrel for oil and $4 per MCF for gas in 2013 and 2014.
We recently completed our second successful horizontal well in the Wolfcamp Shale in Upton County, Texas.  This well is performing similarly to the first well we announced in 2011, with a 24-hour initial production rate of 807 barrels oil equivalent per day (BOEPD) and a peak 30-day average natural flow rate of 677 BOEPD.  The first well continues to flow naturally and produced 45 thousand barrels oil equivalent (MBOE) over its first 90 days of production, which is seven times the production from a Spraberry vertical well over the same time period.  These results, which are above our expectations, coupled with the strong production from other industry players drilling horizontal wells in this interval and Pioneers extensive geologic interpretation of the area, suggest significant horizontal Wolfcamp Shale potential exists within Pioneers acreage.  We are the largest acreage holder
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 in the Wolfcamp Shale play with more than 400,000 prospective acres.  Our current focus is on 200,000 acres in the southern part of the field where we plan to drill 30 to 35 wells by year end.
Sheffield continued, Our deeper vertical drilling program in the Spraberry field continues to successfully add incremental production and proved reserves from completions in the Strawn, Atoka and Mississippian intervals.  Production data now supports an incremental expected ultimate recovery (EUR) of 30 MBOE for wells completed in the Strawn.  This data also suggests that Atoka and Mississippian can potentially deliver incremental EURs of 50 MBOE to 70 MBOE and 15 MBOE to 40 MBOE, respectively.
Owning fracture stimulation fleets continues to enhance the execution of our drilling program and provide significant cash savings versus contracting for these services at market rates.  By mid-2012, our fleet capacity will reach 300,000 in total horsepower.
Pioneer has a strong financial position, with a net debt-to-book capitalization of 26% as of December 31, 2011, and is committed to maintaining net debt-to-book capitalization below 35% and net debt to operating cash flow at less than 1.75 times.  Standard and Poors recently upgraded Pioneer to investment grade.
Mark-to-Market Derivative Losses and Unusual Items Included in Fourth Quarter 2011 Earnings
Pioneers fourth quarter results included unrealized mark-to-market losses on derivatives of $22 million after tax, or $0.18 per diluted share.
Pioneers fourth quarter results also included a net loss of $236 million after tax, or $1.94 per diluted share, related to unusual items.  These unusual items included:
Pioneers fourth quarter results also included income of $15 million after tax, or $0.10 per diluted share, related to unwinding certain oil and gas derivatives.
Operations Update and Drilling Program
In the Spraberry oil field in West Texas, Pioneer is currently operating 44 rigs, of which 41 are drilling vertical wells (including 15 Company-owned rigs) and three are drilling horizontal wells.  The Company drilled 690 wells in 2011 and placed 640 wells on production.   The Company has continued to expand its integrated services to control drilling costs and support the execution of its drilling program. Five Company-owned fracture stimulation fleets totaling 100,000 horsepower are currently operating in the Spraberry field supporting vertical drilling operations.  An additional 10,000 horsepower will be added to these five fleets by mid-year.  Two additional fleets totaling 60,000 horsepower will be added by mid-year 2012 to support Pioneers horizontal drilling program in the Wolfcamp Shale.  The Company also owns other oil field service equipment, including pulling units, fracture stimulation tanks, water transport trucks, hot oilers, blowout preventers, construction equipment and fishing tools.  In addition, the Company has contracted for tubular and pumping unit requirements through 2012 and well cementing services through 2016.
The Company recently completed its second successful horizontal well in the Upper/Middle Wolfcamp Shale in Upton County, Texas with a 30-stage fracture stimulation in a 5,800-foot lateral section.  The XBC Giddings Estate 2073H exhibited a 24-hour initial production rate of 807 BOEPD (602 barrels oil per
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
day, 142 barrels of natural gas liquids (NGLs) per day and 382 thousand cubic feet (MCF) of gas per day) and a peak 30-day average natural flow rate of 677 BOEPD (504 barrels oil per day, 119 barrels NGLs per day and 321 MCF per day).  Pioneers micro-seismic analysis of the completion showed that the entire 800-foot thick target zone was successfully fracture stimulated.  The well continues to flow naturally and is producing to sales.
This well is performing similarly to the Companys first horizontal well in Upton County (XBC Giddings Estate 2041) announced in 2011.  Both had peak 30-day average natural flow rates well above 600 BOEPD.  The first well continues to flow naturally and produced 45 MBOE over its first 90 days of production, which is seven times the production from a Spraberry vertical well (40-acre Lower Wolfcamp well with an EUR of 140 MBOE) over the same time period.
The results of the two Upton County horizontal wells are encouraging, as they are 60 miles northwest of the area where most of the recent successful industry horizontal Wolfcamp Shale drilling has been occurring.  Based on this successful drilling activity and Pioneers extensive geologic interpretation of the Upper/Middle Wolfcamp Shale, the Company believes it has significant horizontal potential within its acreage.  Pioneer is the largest acreage holder in the play with more than 400,000 prospective acres.
The Companys current focus is on 200,000 acres in the southern part of the field to hold expiring acreage.  Pioneer has not been drilling vertical Spraberry wells in this area because the returns are marginal.  Current plans call for drilling 80 to 90 horizontal wells in this area by the end of 2013, with 30 to 35 horizontal wells being drilled in 2012.
The Company has recently increased its horizontal rig count from one to three rigs in the play, with plans to increase to seven rigs by the end of this year and a further increase in 2013.  Two wells are currently being drilled in southern Reagan County and a third has been spud in southern Upton County.  All three wells will be testing longer laterals and additional fracture stimulation stages.
The Company continues to drill vertically to deeper intervals in the Spraberry field below the Wolfcamp interval (40-acre type curve EUR of 140 MBOE).  This deeper drilling includes the Strawn, Atoka and Mississippian intervals.
Pioneer completed 246 vertical wells in the Strawn interval in 2011.  Cumulative production from these wells has increased by more than 25% compared to offset wells that have been drilled only to the Lower Wolfcamp.  This data supports an incremental gross EUR per well from the Strawn interval of 30 MBOE. Pioneer believes this interval is prospective on 50% to 60% of its Spraberry acreage.
The Company completed 18 vertical Atoka wells during 2011.  Early results and offset well data suggest a potential incremental gross EUR of 50 MBOE to 70 MBOE for wells completed in this interval. Based on drilling by other operators, it may be attractive to drill horizontal wells in this interval.  Pioneer believes the Atoka interval is prospective on 25% to 50% of its Spraberry acreage.
Four vertical wells were also completed in the Mississippian interval during 2011.  Early results and offset well data indicate a potential incremental gross EUR per well of 15 MBOE to 40 MBOE.  Pioneer believes the Mississippian interval is prospective in 20% of its Spraberry acreage.
Pioneers 2012 Spraberry vertical drilling program calls for approximately 750 wells to be drilled.  This assumes that Pioneers vertical rig count will decline from 41 rigs currently to 30 rigs by year end as its horizontal rig count in the Wolfcamp Shale increases from 3 rigs currently to 7 rigs by year end.  In approximately 50% of the 750 vertical wells, the Wolfcamp will be the deepest interval completed.  Of the remaining 50% of the wells, 20% will be deepened to the Strawn, 20% to the Atoka and 10% to the Mississippian.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fourth quarter production from the Spraberry field averaged 53 MBOEPD, an increase of 7 MBOEPD from the third quarter.  Based on the vertical and horizontal drilling programs described above, production is forecasted to grow from an average of 45 MBOEPD in 2011 to 61 MBOEPD to 65 MBOEPD in 2012.  Assuming the vertical rig count remains at 30 rigs in 2013 and 2014, and the horizontal rig count increases to 10 rigs during this time period, production is forecasted to further increase to 81 MBOEPD to 87 MBOEPD in 2013 and 96 MBOEPD to 103 MBOEPD in 2014.
 
The current blended Pioneer and third-party well cost for the vertical drilling program averages $1.7 million to $1.8 million per well, ranging from $1.6 million to $1.7 million for a well drilled to the Wolfcamp interval, $1.65 million to $1.75 million to the Strawn interval and $1.9 million to $2.0 million to the Atoka or Mississippian intervals.  Pioneers internal rate of return on its 2012 Spraberry vertical drilling program is expected to be 45% to 50% before tax, based on the drilling program and gross EURs described above, and assuming flat commodity prices of $100 per barrel for oil and $4 per MCF for gas.
The Company continues to test vertical downspacing in the Spraberry field from 40 acres to 20 acres.  Eighteen 20-acre vertical wells were drilled in 2010 and sixteen were added during 2011.  These 20-acre wells were mostly drilled to the Lower Wolfcamp with a few completed in the Strawn.  Results continue to indicate that production from these wells is performing near the type curve for a 40-acre Lower Wolfcamp well (EUR of 140 MBOE).  The Company expects to drill approximately fifty 20-acre wells in its 2012 drilling program.
Water injection was initiated in the third quarter of 2010 on the Companys 7,000-acre waterflood project in the Upper Spraberry interval.  Results continue to be encouraging, as the production decline from 110 producing wells in the surveillance area has flattened and an increasing uptick in production continues to be observed as additional wells respond to water injection.  Cumulative production from the area flooded in the Upper Spraberry has increased by greater than 15% compared to the forecasted base production decline, with further increases and reserve additions expected.
In the liquids-rich Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas, Pioneer and its joint venture partners are currently running 12 rigs.  The Company drilled 111 wells in 2011 and placed 92 wells on production.  To improve the execution of its drilling and completions program and reduce costs, Pioneer is operating two Company-owned fracture stimulation fleets totaling 100,000 horsepower.  The Company is also utilizing a dedicated third-party fracture stimulation fleet, which commenced operating in April 2011 under a two-year contract.
Pioneer plans to continue running 12 rigs in 2012 and drill approximately 125 wells.  The 2012 drilling program will continue to focus on liquids-rich drilling, with only 15% of the wells designated to hold strategic dry gas acreage.  The original plan for 2012 called for an increase to 14 rigs on the assumption that 25% of the program would target dry gas drilling.  However, in response to the current low gas price environment, the increase to 14 rigs has been delayed until 2013.  It is now planned that the rig count will increase to 16 rigs in 2014 and 19 rigs in 2015.
Pioneer increased its Eagle Ford Shale production from 14 MBOEPD in the third quarter to 20 MBOEPD in the fourth quarter.  The Company expects production to increase from an average of 12 MBOEPD in 2011 to 25 MBOEPD to 29 MBOEPD in 2012, 37 MBOEPD to 41 MBOEPD in 2013 and 47 MBOEPD to 53 MBOEPD in 2014.
Pioneers gross well cost in the Eagle Ford Shale ranges from $7 million to $8 million per well.  Using this well cost, estimated EURs, assumed flat commodity prices of $100 per barrel for oil and $4 per MCF for gas and excluding the benefit of the joint-venture drilling carry, the before-tax internal rate of return for the 2012 drilling program is estimated to be 70%.
Pioneer has been testing the use of lower-cost white sand instead of ceramic proppant to fracture stimulate wells drilled in shallower areas of the field.  Twenty-five wells have been tested to date, with a
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
savings of approximately $700 thousand per well.  Early well performance has been similar to direct offset ceramic-stimulated wells.  Pioneer plans to continue to monitor the performance of these wells and plans to use white sand in 50% of its 2012 drilling program.
Eight central gathering plants (CGPs) have been completed as part of the joint ventures Eagle Ford Shale midstream business.  Three additional CGPs are planned for 2012.  Pioneers share of its Eagle Ford Shale joint-venture midstream activities is conducted through a partially-owned, unconsolidated entity.  Funding for ongoing midstream infrastructure build-out costs that are in excess of operating cash flow is provided from external debt sources.  Cash flow from the services provided by the midstream operations is not included in Pioneers forecasted operating cash flow.
In the liquids-rich Barnett Shale Combo play, Pioneer has built a 78,000 net acreage position, representing more than 1,000 drilling locations.  The Company drilled 43 wells in 2011 and placed 42 wells on production.  Pioneer operated two rigs in the play for much of 2011 and plans to remain at this level through 2012.  The Company expects to increase to four rigs in 2013.
Production in the fourth quarter for the Barnett Shale Combo play was 6 MBOEPD, up from 4 MBOEPD in the third quarter.  The Company expects production to increase from an average of 4 MBOEPD in 2011 to 7 MBOEPD to 9 MBOEPD in 2012 under the current two-rig program.  With the expected increase to four rigs in 2013, production is forecasted to grow to 12 MBOEPD to 16 MBOEPD in 2013 and 18 MBOEPD to 23 MBOEPD in 2014. Production is comprised of 60% liquids (oil and NGLs) and 40% gas.
Pioneers internal rate of return in the Barnett Shale Combo play is expected to be 30% before tax.  This assumes a targeted per-well drilling cost of $3.5 million for 5,000-foot lateral wells, a gross EUR of 460 MBOE and flat commodity prices of $100 per barrel for oil and $4 per MCF for gas.  The internal rate of return has been impacted by the low gas price environment.
On the North Slope of Alaska, Pioneer will continue to operate one rig and drill development wells from its island targeting the Kuparuk, Nuiqsut and Torok intervals.  During the current winter drilling season, the Company has contracted a second rig to drill two exploration wells within Pioneers acreage that cannot be reached from the island.  One will be to test the Torok interval, while the second will be to test the deeper Ivishak interval.  The latter is the main producing zone in the Prudhoe Bay field.
2012 Capital Budget
Pioneers capital program for 2012 of $2.5 billion (excludes acquisitions, asset retirement obligations, capitalized interest and geological and geophysical G&A) continues to be focused on liquids-rich drilling.  The following provides a breakdown of the forecasted spending by asset:
2012 Capital Budget Funding and Balance Sheet
The 2012 capital budget is expected to be funded from forecasted operating cash flow of $2.2 billion, assuming commodity prices of $100 per barrel for oil and $3 per MCF for gas and using $0.3 billion of the proceeds from Pioneers recent equity offering.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pioneers year-end 2011 net debt (reduced for cash on Pioneers balance sheet) was $2.0 billion, a reduction from $2.4 billion at year-end 2010.  With Pioneers improving net debt position, net debt-to-book capitalization declined from 37% at year-end 2010 to 26% at year-end 2011.  The Company is committed to keeping its net debt-to-book capitalization below 35% and net debt to operating cash flow below 1.75 times.
Fourth Quarter 2011 Financial Review
The following financial results for the fourth quarter of 2011 reflect continuing operations and exclude the results of operations attributable to South Africa that are included in discontinued operations.
Sales averaged 137 MBOEPD, consisting of oil sales averaging 50 thousand barrels per day (MBPD), NGL sales averaging 26 MBPD and gas sales averaging 362 million cubic feet per day (MMCFPD).
The average reported price for oil was $95.75 per barrel and included $2.45 per barrel related to deferred revenue from volumetric production payments (VPPs) for which production was not recorded.  The average reported price for NGLs was $45.70 per barrel and the average reported price for gas was $3.37 per MCF.
Production costs averaged $13.79 per barrel oil equivalent (BOE).  Depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) expense averaged $14.49 per BOE.
Noncash impairment charges related to dry gas properties in the Companys legacy Edwards trend play in South Texas totaled $354 million for the quarter (no impairment of the Eagle Ford Shale).  The impairment charges resulted from the current low gas price environment.  Exploration and abandonment costs were $64 million for the quarter including unusual items. This included $41 million of acreage abandonments, of which $31 million was associated with unproved dry gas acreage that is not planned to be drilled in the current low gas price environment (unusual item), and $23 million of geologic and geophysical expenses and personnel costs.
First Quarter 2012 Financial Outlook
The Companys first quarter 2012 outlook for certain operating and financial items (excluding discontinued operations in South Africa) is provided below.
Production is forecasted to average 141 MBOEPD to 146 MBOEPD.  Production costs are expected to average $13.00 to $15.00 per BOE, based on current NYMEX strip commodity prices.  DD&A expense is expected to average $13.00 to $15.00 per BOE.  Total exploration and abandonment expense is forecasted to be $35 million to $60 million, including the potential dry hole costs associated with the two exploration wells in Alaska.
General and administrative expense is expected to be $49 million to $54 million, interest expense is expected to be $45 million to $49 million and other expense is expected to be $20 million to $30 million. Accretion of discount on asset retirement obligations is expected to be $2 million to $4 million.
Noncontrolling interest in consolidated subsidiaries income, excluding unrealized derivative mark-to-market adjustments, is expected to be $9 million to $12 million, primarily reflecting the public ownership in Pioneer Southwest Energy Partners L.P.
The Companys effective income tax rate is expected to range from 35% to 40% based on current capital spending plans and the assumption of no significant unrealized derivative mark-to-market changes in the Companys derivative position.  Current income taxes are expected to be $2 million to $5 million and are primarily attributable to state taxes.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Company's financial and derivative mark-to-market results, open derivatives positions for oil, NGL and gas, and future VPP amortization are outlined on the attached schedules.

Forward-looking statements and the business prospects of Pioneer are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause Pioneer's actual results in future periods to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include, among other things, volatility of commodity prices, product supply and demand, competition, the ability to obtain environmental and other permits and the timing thereof, other government regulation or action, the ability to obtain approvals from third parties and negotiate agreements with third parties on mutually acceptable terms, litigation, the costs and results of drilling and operations, availability of equipment, services and personnel required to complete the Companys operating activities, access to and availability of transportation, processing and refining facilities, Pioneer's ability to replace reserves, implement its business plans or complete its development activities as scheduled, access to and cost of capital, the financial strength of counterparties to Pioneers credit facility and derivative contracts and the purchasers of Pioneers oil, NGL and gas production, uncertainties about estimates of reserves and resource potential and the ability to add proved reserves in the future, the assumptions underlying production forecasts, quality of technical data, environmental and weather risks, including the possible impacts of climate change, international operations and acts of war or terrorism. These and other risks are described in Pioneer's 10-K and 10-Q Reports and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, Pioneer may be subject to currently unforeseen risks that may have a materially adverse impact on it. Pioneer undertakes no duty to publicly update these statements except as required by law.
Cautionary Note to U.S. Investors --The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) prohibits oil and gas companies, in their filings with the SEC, from disclosing estimates of oil or gas resources other than reserves, as that term is defined by the SEC.  In this news release, Pioneer includes estimates of quantities of oil and gas using certain terms, such as resource potential, estimated ultimate recovery, EUR or other descriptions of volumes of reserves, which terms include quantities of oil and gas that may not meet the SECs definitions of proved, probable and possible reserves, and which the SEC's guidelines strictly prohibit Pioneer from including in filings with the SEC. These estimates are by their nature more speculative than estimates of proved reserves and accordingly are subject to substantially greater risk of being recovered by Pioneer.  U.S. investors are urged to consider closely the disclosures in the Companys periodic filings with the SEC.  Such filings are available from the Company at 5205 N. O'Connor Blvd., Suite 200, Irving, Texas 75039, Attention: Investor Relations, and the Companys website at www.pxd.com.  These filings also can be obtained from the SEC by calling 1-800-SEC-0330.
Drillbit finding and development cost per BOE, or drillbit F&D cost per BOE, means the summation of exploration and development costs incurred divided by the summation of annual proved reserves, on a BOE basis, attributable to
 
 
 
 
 
 
technical revisions of previous estimates, discoveries and extensions and improved recovery. Consistent with industry practice, future capital costs to develop proved undeveloped reserves are not included in costs incurred.
Reserve replacement is the summation of annual proved reserves, on a BOE basis, attributable to revisions of previous estimates, purchases of minerals-in-place, discoveries and extensions and improved recovery divided by annual production of oil, NGLs and gas, on a BOE basis.
Drillbit reserve replacement is the summation of annual proved reserves, on a BOE basis, attributable to technical revisions of previous estimates, discoveries and extensions and improved recovery divided by annual production of oil, NGLs and gas, on a BOE basis.

The Company uses the two-class method of calculating basic and diluted earnings per share.  Under the two-class method of calculating earnings per share, GAAP provides that share- and unit-based awards with guaranteed dividend or distribution participation rights qualify as "participating securities" during their vesting periods.  The Company's basic net income (loss) per share attributable to common stockholders is computed as (i) net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders, (ii) less participating share- and unit-based basic earnings (iii) divided by weighted average basic shares outstanding. The Company's diluted net income (loss) per share attributable to common stockholders is computed as (i) basic net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders, (ii) plus the reallocation of participating earnings (iii) divided by weighted average diluted shares outstanding. During periods in which the Company realizes a loss from continuing operations attributable to common stockholders, securities or other contracts to issue common stock would be dilutive to loss per share; therefore, conversion into common stock is assumed not to occur.
 
The following table is a reconciliation of the Company's net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders to basic net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders and to diluted net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders for thethree and twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010:
 
The following table is a reconciliation of basic weighted average common shares outstanding to diluted weighted average common shares outstanding for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010:
 
 
 
 
 
 
EBITDAX and discretionary cash flow ("DCF") (as defined below) are presented herein, and reconciled to the generally accepted accounting principle ("GAAP") measures of net income (loss) and net cash provided by operating activities because of their wide acceptance by the investment community as financial indicators of a company's ability to internally fund exploration and development activities and to service or incur debt. The Company also views the non-GAAP measures of EBITDAX and DCF as useful tools for comparisons of the Company's financial indicators with those of peer companies that follow the full cost method of accounting.

Adjusted loss excluding unrealized mark-to-market ("MTM") derivative losses, and loss adjusted for unrealized MTM losses and unusual items, as presented in this press release, are presented and reconciled to Pioneer's net loss attributable to common stockholders that is determined in accordance with GAAP because Pioneer believes that these non-GAAP financial measures reflect additional ways of viewing aspects of Pioneer's business that, when viewed together with its financial results computed in accordance with GAAP, provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting its historical financial performance and future operating results, greater transparency of underlying trends and greater comparability of results across periods.  In addition, management believes that these non-GAAP measures may enhance investors' ability to assess Pioneer's historical and future financial performance.  These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to be substitutes for the comparable GAAP measure and should be read only in conjunction with Pioneer's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.
