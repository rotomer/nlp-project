Execution of Debt Securities
Only such Debt Securities and Coupons as shall bear thereon a certificate of authentication substantially in the form hereinbefore recited, signed manually by the Trustee, shall be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose. Such certificate by the Trustee upon any Debt Security or Coupon executed by the Company shall be conclusive evidence that the Debt Security or Coupon so authenticated has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder.
In case any officer of the Company who shall have signed any of the Debt Securities or Coupons shall cease to be such officer before the Debt Securities or Coupons so signed shall have been authenticated and delivered by the Trustee, or disposed of by the Company, such Debt Securities or Coupons nevertheless may be authenticated and delivered or disposed of as though the Person who signed such Debt Securities or Coupons had not ceased to be such officer of the Company; and any Debt Security or Coupon may be signed on behalf of the Company by such Persons as, at the actual date of the execution of such Debt Security or Coupon, shall be the proper officers of the Company, although at the date of such Debt Security or Coupon or of the execution of this Indenture any such Person was not such officer.
Section 2.05 . At any time and from time to time after the execution and delivery of this Indenture, the Company may deliver Debt Securities, with appropriate Coupons, if any, of any series executed by the Company to the Trustee for authentication, and the Trustee shall thereupon authenticate and deliver said Debt Securities and Coupons to or upon a Company Order. In authenticating such Debt Securities and Coupons, and accepting the additional responsibilities under this Indenture in relation to such Debt Securities and Coupons, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive, and (subject to Section 7.01) shall be fully protected in relying upon:
Authentication and Delivery of Debt Securities
(a) a copy of any resolution or resolutions of the Board of Directors, certified by the Secretary or Assistant Secretary of the Company, authorizing the terms of issuance of any series of Debt Securities and Coupons;
(b) an executed supplemental indenture, if any;
(c) an Officers' Certificate; and
(d) an Opinion of Counsel prepared in accordance with Section 13.06 which shall also state:
(i) that the form of such Debt Securities and Coupons has been established by or pursuant to a resolution of the Board of Directors or by a supplemental indenture as permitted by Section 2.01 in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture;
(ii) that the terms of such Debt Securities and Coupons have been established by or pursuant to a resolution of the Board of Directors or by a supplemental indenture as permitted by Section 2.03 in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture;
(iii) that such Debt Securities and Coupons, when authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and issued by the Company in the manner and subject to any conditions specified in such Opinion of Counsel, will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company, enforceable in accordance with their terms except as (A) the enforceability thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and (B) rights of acceleration and the availability of equitable remedies may be limited by equitable principles of general applicability;
 
(iv) that the Company has the corporate power to issue such Debt Securities and Coupons and has duly taken all necessary corporate action with respect to such issuance;
(v) that the issuance of such Debt Securities and Coupons will not contravene the charter or by-laws of the Company or result in any material violation of any of the terms or provisions of any law or regulation or of any material indenture, mortgage or other agreement known to such counsel by which the Company is bound;
(vi) that authentication and delivery of such Debt Securities and Coupons and the execution and delivery of any supplemental indenture will not violate the terms of this Indenture; and
(vii) such other matters as the Trustee may reasonably request.
Such Opinion of Counsel need express no opinion as to whether a court in the United States would render a money judgment in a currency other than that of the United States.
The Trustee shall have the right to decline to authenticate and deliver any Debt Securities or Coupons under this Section 2.05 if the Trustee, being advised by counsel, determines that such action may not lawfully be taken or if the Trustee in good faith by its board of directors or trustees, executive committee or a trust committee of directors, trustees or vice presidents (or any combination thereof) shall determine that such action would expose the Trustee to personal liability to existing Holders.
The Trustee may appoint an authenticating agent reasonably acceptable to the Company to authenticate Debt Securities and Coupons, if any, of any series. Unless limited by the terms of such appointment, an authenticating agent may authenticate Debt Securities whenever the Trustee may do so. Each reference in this Indenture to authentication by the Trustee includes authentication by such agent. An authenticating agent has the same rights as any Registrar, paying agent or agent for service of notices and demands.
Unless otherwise provided in the form of Debt Security for any series, each Debt Security shall be dated the date of its authentication.
Section 2.06 . Unless otherwise provided in the form of Debt Security for any series, the Debt Securities of each series shall be issuable only as Registered Securities in such denominations as shall be specified or contemplated by Section 2.03. In the absence of any such specification with respect to the Debt Securities of any series, the Debt Securities of such series shall be issuable in denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiple thereof.
Denomination of Debt Securities
Section 2.07 . (a) The Company shall keep or cause to be kept a register for each series of Registered Securities issued hereunder (hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Debt Security Register"), in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Company shall provide for the registration of Registered Securities and the registration of transfer and exchange of Registered Securities as in this Article II provided. At all reasonable times the Debt Security Register shall be open for inspection by the Trustee. Subject to Section 2.15, upon due presentment for registration of transfer of any Registered Security at any office or agency to be maintained by the Company in accordance with the provisions of Section 4.02, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in the name of the transferee or transferees a new Registered Security or Registered Securities of authorized denominations for a like aggregate principal amount. In no event may Registered Securities, including Registered Securities received in exchange for Bearer Securities, be issued as, or exchanged for, Bearer Securities.
Registration of Transfer and Exchange
Unless and until otherwise determined by the Company by resolution of the Board of Directors, the register of the Company for the purpose of registration, exchange or registration of transfer of the Registered Securities shall be kept at the corporate trust office of the Trustee referred to in Section 13.03 and, for this purpose, the Trustee referred to in Section 13.03 shall be designated "Registrar."
 
Registered Securities of any series (other than a Global Security, except as set forth below) may be exchanged for a like aggregate principal amount of Registered Securities of the same series of other authorized denominations. Subject to Section 2.15, Registered Securities to be exchanged shall be surrendered at the office or agency to be maintained by the Company as provided in Section 4.02, and the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor the Registered Security or Registered Securities which the Holder making the exchange shall be entitled to receive.
At the option of the Holder of Bearer Securities of any series, except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 2.03(h) or 2.03(s) with respect to a Global Security representing Bearer Securities, Bearer Securities of such series may be exchanged for Registered Securities (if the Debt Securities of such series are issuable as Registered Securities) or Bearer Securities of the same series, of any authorized denomination or denominations, of like tenor and aggregate principal amount, upon surrender of the Bearer Securities to be exchanged at the office or agency of the Company maintained for such purpose, with all unmatured Coupons and all matured Coupons in Default thereto appertaining; , , that delivery of a Bearer Security shall occur only outside the United States. If such Holder is unable to produce any such unmatured Coupon or Coupons or matured Coupon or Coupons in Default, such exchange may be effected if such Holder's Bearer Securities are accompanied by payment in funds acceptable to the Company and the Trustee in an amount equal to the face amount of such missing Coupon or Coupons, or the surrender of such missing Coupon or Coupons may be waived by the Company and the Trustee if there be furnished to them such security or indemnity as they may require to save each of them and any paying agent harmless. If thereafter such Holder shall surrender to any paying agent any such missing Coupon in respect of which such a payment shall have been made, such Holder shall be entitled to receive the amount of such payment; , , that, except as otherwise provided in Section 2.12, interest represented by Coupons shall be payable only upon presentation and surrender of those Coupons at an office or agency located outside the United States.

Whenever any Debt Securities are so surrendered for exchange, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the Debt Securities that the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the exchange of Bearer Securities for Registered Securities will be subject to the provisions of United States income tax laws and regulations applicable to Debt Securities in effect at the time of such exchange.
(b) All Registered Securities presented or surrendered for registration of transfer, exchange or payment shall (if so required by the Company, the Trustee or the Registrar) be duly endorsed or be accompanied by a written instrument or instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the Company, the Trustee and the Registrar, duly executed by the Registered Holder or his attorney duly authorized in writing.
All Debt Securities issued in exchange for or upon transfer of Debt Securities shall be the valid obligations of the Company, evidencing the same debt, and entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as the Debt Securities surrendered for such exchange or transfer.
No service charge shall be made for any exchange or registration of transfer of Debt Securities (except as provided by Section 2.09), but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax, fee, assessment or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto, other than those expressly provided in this Indenture to be made at the Company's own expense or without expense or without charge to the Holders.
The Company shall not be required (i) to issue, register the transfer of or exchange any Debt Securities for a period of 15 days next preceding any mailing of notice of redemption of Debt Securities
 
of such series or (ii) to register the transfer of or exchange any Debt Securities selected, called or being called for redemption; , , that, if specified pursuant to Section 2.03, any Bearer Securities of any series that are exchangeable for Registered Securities and that are called for redemption pursuant to Section 3.02 may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be exchanged for one or more Registered Securities of such series during the period preceding the redemption date therefor.

Prior to the due presentation for registration of transfer of any Debt Security, the Company, the Trustee, any paying agent or any Registrar may deem and treat the Person in whose name a Debt Security is registered as the absolute owner of such Debt Security for the purpose of receiving payment of or on account of the principal of, and premium, if any, and (subject to Section 2.12) interest on, such Debt Security and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not such Debt Security is overdue, and none of the Company, the Trustee, any paying agent or any Registrar shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
None of the Underwriters, the Company, the Trustee, any agent of the Trustee, any paying agent or any Registrar will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to, or payments made on account of, beneficial ownership interests of a Global Security or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interests.
Section 2.08 . Pending the preparation of definitive Debt Securities of any series, the Company may execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver temporary Debt Securities (printed, lithographed, photocopied, typewritten or otherwise produced) of any authorized denomination, and substantially in the form of the definitive Debt Securities in lieu of which they are issued, in registered form or, if authorized, in bearer form with one or more Coupons or without Coupons, and with such omissions, insertions and variations as may be appropriate for temporary Debt Securities and Coupons, all as may be determined by the Company with the concurrence of the Trustee. Temporary Debt Securities and Coupons may contain such reference to any provisions of this Indenture as may be appropriate. Every temporary Debt Security shall be executed by the Company and be authenticated by the Trustee upon the same conditions and in substantially the same manner, and with like effect, as the definitive Debt Securities.
Temporary Debt Securities
If temporary Debt Securities of any series are issued, the Company will cause definitive Debt Securities of such series to be prepared without unreasonable delay. Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 2.03(h)(iii) with respect to a series of Debt Securities issuable as Bearer Securities or as one or more Global Securities representing individual Bearer Securities of the series, (a) after the preparation of definitive Debt Securities of such series, the temporary Debt Securities of such series shall be exchangeable for definitive Debt Securities of such series upon surrender of the temporary Debt Securities of such series at the office or agency of the Company at a Place of Payment for such series, without charge to the Holder thereof, except as provided in Section 2.07 in connection with a transfer and except that a Person receiving definitive Bearer Securities shall bear the cost of insurance, postage, transportation and the like unless otherwise specified pursuant to Section 2.03, and (b) upon surrender for cancellation of any one or more temporary Debt Securities of any series (accompanied by any unmatured Coupons appertaining thereto), the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a like principal amount of definitive Debt Securities of the same series of authorized denominations and of like tenor; , , that no definitive Bearer Security shall be delivered in exchange for a temporary Registered Security; and , , , that delivery of a Global Security representing individual Bearer Securities or a Bearer Security shall occur only outside the United States.

Unless otherwise specified pursuant to Section 2.03, the Company will execute and deliver each definitive Global Security representing individual Bearer Securities and each Bearer Security to the Trustee at its principal office in London or such other place outside the United States specified pursuant to Section 2.03.
 
Upon any exchange of a portion of a temporary Global Security for a definitive Global Security or for the individual Debt Securities represented thereby pursuant to Section 2.07 or this Section 2.08, the temporary Global Security shall be endorsed by the Trustee to reflect the reduction of the principal amount evidenced thereby, whereupon the principal amount of such temporary Global Security shall be reduced for all purposes by the amount to be exchanged and endorsed.
Section 2.09 . If (a) any mutilated Debt Security or any mutilated Coupon with the Coupon Security to which it appertains (and all unmatured Coupons attached thereto) is surrendered to the Trustee at its corporate trust office (in the case of Registered Securities) or at its principal London office (in the case of Bearer Securities) or (b) the Company and the Trustee receive evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Debt Security or any Coupon, and there is delivered to the Company and the Trustee such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them and any paying agent harmless, and neither the Company nor the Trustee receives notice that such Debt Security or Coupon has been acquired by a protected purchaser, then the Company shall execute and, upon a Company Order, the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in exchange for or in lieu of any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Debt Security or in exchange for the Coupon Security to which such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Coupon appertained, a new Debt Security of the same series of like tenor, form, terms and principal amount, bearing a number not contemporaneously Outstanding, and, in the case of a Coupon Security, with such Coupons attached thereto that neither gain nor loss in interest shall result from such exchange or substitution. Upon the issuance of any substituted Debt Security, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax, fee, assessment or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses connected therewith. In case any Debt Security or Coupon which has matured or is about to mature or which has been called for redemption shall become mutilated or be destroyed, lost or stolen, the Company may, instead of issuing a substituted Debt Security or Coupon, pay or authorize the payment of the same (without surrender thereof except in the case of a mutilated Debt Security or Coupon) if the applicant for such payment shall furnish the Company and the Trustee with such security or indemnity as either may require to save it harmless from all risk, however remote, and, in case of destruction, loss or theft, evidence to the satisfaction of the Company and the Trustee of the destruction, loss or theft of such Debt Security or Coupon and of the ownership thereof; , , that payment of principal of, and premium, if any, and interest on, Bearer Securities or Coupons shall, except as otherwise provided in Section 2.12, be payable only at an office or agency located outside the United States.

Every substituted Debt Security of any series, with its Coupons, if any, issued pursuant to the provisions of this Section 2.09 by virtue of the fact that any Debt Security or Coupon is destroyed, lost or stolen shall constitute an original additional contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Debt Security or Coupon shall be found at any time, and shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Debt Securities of that series and Coupons, if any, duly issued hereunder. All Debt Securities and Coupons, if any, shall be held and owned upon the express condition that the foregoing provisions are exclusive with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Debt Securities or Coupons, and shall preclude any and all other rights or remedies, notwithstanding any law or statute existing or hereafter enacted to the contrary with respect to the replacement or payment of negotiable instruments or other securities without their surrender.
Section 2.10 .

On request of the Company, the Trustee shall deliver to the Company canceled Debt Securities and Coupons held by the Trustee. If the Company shall acquire any of the Debt Securities or Coupons, however, such acquisition shall not operate as a redemption or satisfaction of the indebtedness represented thereby unless and until the same are delivered or surrendered to the Trustee for cancellation. The Company may not issue new Debt Securities or Coupons to replace Debt Securities or Coupons it has redeemed, paid or delivered to the Trustee for cancellation.
Section 2.11 .

(a) Interest on any Registered Security that is payable and is punctually paid or duly provided for on any interest payment date shall be paid to the Person in whose name such Registered Security is registered at the close of business on the regular record date for such interest notwithstanding the cancellation of such Registered Security upon any transfer or exchange subsequent to the regular record date. In case a Coupon Security of any series is surrendered in exchange for a Registered Security of such series after the close of business (at an office or agency in a Place of Payment for such series) on any regular record date and before the opening of business (at such office or agency) on the next succeeding interest payment date, such Coupon Security shall be surrendered without the Coupon relating to such interest payment date and interest will not be payable on such interest payment date in respect of the Registered Security issued in exchange for such Coupon Security, but will be payable only to the Holder of such Coupon when due in accordance with the provisions of this Indenture.

Payment of Interest; Interest Rights Preserved
(b) No interest shall be payable with respect to a Bearer Security or Coupon unless such certification requirements as are specified pursuant to Section 2.03(h)(iii) are satisfied with respect to such Bearer Security or Coupon. Interest on any Coupon Security that is payable and is punctually paid or duly provided for on any interest payment date shall be paid to the Holder of the Coupon that has matured on such interest payment date upon surrender of such Coupon on such interest payment date at the principal London office of the Trustee or at such other Place of Payment outside the United States specified pursuant to Section 2.03.
Interest on any Bearer Security (other than a Coupon Security) that is payable and is punctually paid or duly provided for on any interest payment date shall be paid to the Holder of the Bearer Security upon presentation of such Bearer Security and notation thereon on such interest payment date at the principal London office of the Trustee or at such other Place of Payment outside the United States specified pursuant to Section 2.03.

respect of such Bearer Security or Coupon will be made by check drawn on a bank in New York, New York, or, in accordance with arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee, by wire transfer to a Dollar account maintained by such Holder with a bank outside the United States. If such payment at the offices of all paying agents outside the United States becomes illegal or is effectively precluded because of the imposition of exchange controls or similar restrictions on the full payment or receipt of such amounts in Dollars, then, to the extent permitted by United States tax law, the Company will appoint an office or agent in the United States at which such payment may be made. Unless otherwise specified pursuant to Section 2.03, at the direction of the Holder of any Bearer Security or Coupon payable in a Foreign Currency, payment on such Bearer Security or Coupon will be made by a check drawn on a bank outside the United States or, in accordance with arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee, by wire transfer to an appropriate account maintained by such Holder outside the United States. Except as provided in this paragraph, no payment on any Bearer Security or Coupon will be made by mail to an address in the United States or by transfer to an account in the United States.
(c) Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.12 and Section 2.17, each Debt Security of a particular series delivered under this Indenture upon registration of transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of any other Debt Security of the same series shall carry the rights to interest accrued and unpaid, and to accrue, which were carried by such other Debt Security.

In the event any Foreign Currency or currencies or units of two or more Currencies in which any payment with respect to any series of Debt Securities may be made ceases to be a freely convertible Currency on United States Currency markets, for any date thereafter on which payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on, the Debt Securities of a series is due, the Company shall select the Currency of payment for use on such date, all as provided in the Debt Securities of such series. In such event, the Company shall, as provided in the Debt Securities of such series, notify the Trustee of the Currency which it has selected to constitute the funds necessary to meet the Company's obligations on such payment date and of the amount of such Currency to be paid. Such amount shall be determined as provided in the Debt Securities of such series. The payment to the Trustee with respect to such payment date shall be made by the Company solely in the Currency so selected.

Notice of such redemption shall be given by the Company to the Holders of the Bearer Security or Coupon not more than 60 days or less than 30 days prior to the redemption date.

If and so long as the certification, documentation, information or other reporting requirement referred to in the preceding paragraph would be fully satisfied by payment of a backup withholding tax or similar charge, the Company may elect to pay as additional interest such amounts as may be necessary so that every net payment made outside the United States following the effective date of such requirement by the Company or any of its paying agents in respect of any Bearer Security or Coupon of which the beneficial owner is a United States Alien (but without any requirement that the nationality, residence or identity of such beneficial owner be disclosed to the Company, any paying agent or any governmental authority), after deduction or withholding for or on account of such backup withholding tax or similar charge that (x) would not be applicable in the circumstances referred to in the parenthetical clause of the first sentence of the preceding paragraph or (y) is imposed as a result of presentation of any such Bearer Security or Coupon for payment more than 15 days after the date on which such payment became due and payable or on which payment thereof was duly provided for, whichever occurred later), will not be less than the amount provided in any such Bearer Security or Coupon to be then due and payable. If the Company elects to pay additional interest pursuant to this paragraph, the Company shall have the right to redeem the Bearer Security or Coupon at any time in whole, but not in part, at the redemption price thereof (calculated without premium), subject to the provisions of the last three sentences of the immediately preceding paragraph. If the Company elects to pay additional interest pursuant to this
 
paragraph and the condition specified in the first sentence of this paragraph should no longer be satisfied, then the Company shall redeem the Bearer Security or Coupon in whole, but not in part, at the redemption price thereof (calculated without premium), subject to the provisions of the last three sentences of the immediately preceding paragraph.

The notice if given in the manner herein provided shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the Holder receives such notice. In any case, failure to give such notice or any defect in the notice to the Holder of any Debt Security of a series designated for redemption as a whole or in part shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other Debt Security of such series.
Notice of Redemption; Selection of Debt Securities
Each such notice of redemption shall specify the date fixed for redemption, the redemption price at which Debt Securities of such series are to be redeemed (or the method of calculating such redemption price), the Place or Places of Payment that payment will be made upon presentation and surrender of such Debt Securities, that any interest accrued to the date fixed for redemption will be paid as specified in said notice, that the redemption is for a sinking fund payment (if applicable), that, unless otherwise specified in such notice, Coupon Securities of any series, if any, surrendered for redemption must be accompanied by all Coupons maturing subsequent to the date fixed for redemption, failing which the amount of any such missing Coupon or Coupons will be deducted from the redemption price, if the Bearer Securities of any series are to be redeemed and any Registered Securities of such series are not to be redeemed, and if such Bearer Securities may be exchanged for Registered Securities not subject to redemption on the applicable redemption date pursuant to Section 2.15(c) or otherwise, the last date on which such exchanges may be made, that, if the Company defaults in making such redemption payment or if the Debt Securities of that series are subordinated pursuant to the terms of Article XII, the paying agent is prohibited from making such payment pursuant to the terms of this Indenture, that on and after said date any interest thereon or on the portions thereof to be redeemed will cease to accrue, that in the case of Original Issue Discount Securities original issue discount accrued after the date fixed for redemption will cease to accrue, the terms of the Debt Securities of that series pursuant to which the Debt Securities of that series are being redeemed, and that no representation is made as to the correctness or accuracy of the CUSIP or ISIN number, if any, listed in such notice or printed on the Debt Securities of that series. If less than all the Debt Securities of a series are to be redeemed, the notice of redemption shall specify the CUSIP or ISIN numbers, if any, of the Debt Securities of that series. In case any Debt Security of a series is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed and shall state that on and after the date fixed for redemption, upon surrender of such Debt Security, a new Debt Security or Debt Securities of that series in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof, and in the case of a Bearer Security with appropriate Coupons, if any, will be issued.
At least two business days before the giving of any notice of redemption to Holders, unless the Trustee consents to a shorter period, the Company shall give written notice to the Trustee of the
 
redemption date, the principal amount of Debt Securities to be redeemed and the series and terms of the Debt Securities pursuant to which such redemption will occur. Such notice shall be accompanied by an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel from the Company to the effect that such redemption will comply with the conditions herein, and such notice may be revoked at any time prior to the giving of a notice of redemption to the Holders pursuant to this Section 3.03. If fewer than all the Debt Securities of a series are to be redeemed, the record date relating to such redemption shall be selected by the Company and given in writing to the Trustee, which record date shall be not less than three days after the date of notice to the Trustee.
On or prior to the redemption date for any Registered Securities, the Company shall deposit with the Trustee or with a paying agent (or, if the Company is acting as its own paying agent, segregate and hold in trust) an amount of money in the Currency in which such Debt Securities are denominated (except as provided pursuant to Section 2.03) sufficient to pay the redemption price of such Registered Securities or any portions thereof that are to be redeemed on that date. In the case of any redemption pertaining to Bearer Securities or Coupon Securities, the Company shall, no later than the business day prior to such redemption date, deposit with the Trustee or with a paying agent (other than the Company) an amount of money in the Currency in which such Debt Securities are denominated (except as provided pursuant to Section 2.03) sufficient to pay the redemption price of such Bearer or Coupon Securities or any portion thereof that are to be redeemed on the redemption date.
If less than all the Debt Securities of like tenor and terms of a series are to be redeemed (other than pursuant to mandatory sinking fund redemptions) the Trustee shall select, on a pro rata basis, by lot or by such other method as in its sole discretion it shall deem appropriate and fair, the Debt Securities of that series or portions thereof (in multiples of $1,000) to be redeemed. In any case where more than one Registered Security of such series is registered in the same name, the Trustee in its discretion may treat the aggregate principal amount so registered as if it were represented by one Registered Security of such series. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company in writing of the Debt Securities selected for redemption and, in the case of any Debt Securities selected for partial redemption, the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. If any Debt Security called for redemption shall not be so paid upon surrender thereof on such redemption date, the principal, premium, if any, and interest shall bear interest until paid from the redemption date at the rate borne by the Debt Securities of that series. If less than all the Debt Securities of unlike tenor and terms of a series are to be redeemed, the particular Debt Securities to be redeemed shall be selected by the Company. Provisions of this Indenture that apply to Debt Securities called for redemption also apply to portions of Debt Securities called for redemption.
Section 3.04 . If notice of redemption has been given as provided in Section 3.03, the Debt Securities or portions of Debt Securities of the series with respect to which such notice has been given shall become due and payable on the date and at the Place or Places of Payment stated in such notice at the applicable redemption price, together with any interest accrued to the date fixed for redemption, and on and after said date (unless the Company shall default in the payment of such Debt Securities at the applicable redemption price, together with any interest accrued to said date) any interest on the Debt Securities or portions of Debt Securities of any series so called for redemption shall cease to accrue, any original issue discount in the case of Original Issue Discount Securities shall cease to accrue and any Coupons for such interest appertaining to any Coupon Securities to be redeemed, except to the extent described below, shall be void. On presentation and surrender of such Debt Securities at the Place or Places of Payment in said notice specified, the said Debt Securities or the specified portions thereof shall be paid and redeemed by the Company at the applicable redemption price, together with any interest accrued thereon to the date fixed for redemption.
Payment of Debt Securities Called for Redemption
If any Coupon Security surrendered for redemption shall not be accompanied by all Coupons appertaining thereto maturing on or after the applicable redemption date, the redemption price for such Coupon Security may be reduced by an amount equal to the face amount of all such missing Coupons. If thereafter the Holder of such Coupon shall surrender to any paying agent outside the United States any
 
such missing Coupon in respect of which a deduction shall have been made from the redemption price, such Holder shall be entitled to receive the amount so deducted. The surrender of such missing Coupon or Coupons may be waived by the Company and the Trustee, if there be furnished to them such security or indemnity as they may require to save each of them and any paying agent harmless.
Any Debt Security that is to be redeemed only in part shall be surrendered at the corporate trust office or such other office or agency of the Company as is specified pursuant to Section 2.03 (in the case of Registered Securities) and at the principal London office of the Trustee or such other office or agency of the Company outside the United States as is specified pursuant to Section 2.03 (in the case of Bearer Securities) with, if the Company, the Registrar or the Trustee so requires, due endorsement by, or a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company, the Registrar and the Trustee duly executed by, the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder of such Debt Security without service charge, a new Debt Security or Debt Securities of the same series, of like tenor and form, of any authorized denomination as requested by such Holder in aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for the unredeemed portion of the principal of the Debt Security so surrendered, and, in the case of a Coupon Security, with appropriate Coupons attached; except that if a Global Security is so surrendered, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Depositary for such Global Security, without service charge, a new Global Security in a denomination equal to and in exchange for the unredeemed portion of the principal of the Global Security so surrendered. In the case of a Debt Security providing appropriate space for such notation, at the option of the Holder thereof, the Trustee, in lieu of delivering a new Debt Security or Debt Securities as aforesaid, may make a notation on such Debt Security of the payment of the redeemed portion thereof.
Section 3.05 . The minimum amount of any sinking fund payment provided for by the terms of Debt Securities of any series, resolution of the Board of Directors or a supplemental indenture is herein referred to as a "mandatory sinking fund payment," and any payment in excess of such minimum amount provided for by the terms of Debt Securities of any series, resolution of the Board of Directors or a supplemental indenture is herein referred to as an "optional sinking fund payment."
Mandatory and Optional Sinking Funds
In lieu of making all or any part of any mandatory sinking fund payment with respect to any Debt Securities of a series in cash, the Company may at its option (a) deliver to the Trustee Debt Securities of that series (together with the unmatured Coupons, if any, appertaining thereto) theretofore purchased or otherwise acquired by the Company or (b) receive credit for the principal amount of Debt Securities of that series which have been redeemed either at the election of the Company pursuant to the terms of such Debt Securities or through the application of permitted optional sinking fund payments pursuant to the terms of such Debt Securities, resolution or supplemental indenture; , that such Debt Securities have not been previously so credited.

Such certificate shall also state that no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing with
Redemption of Debt Securities for Sinking Fund

Such certificate shall be irrevocable, and upon its delivery the Company shall be obligated to make the cash payment or payments therein referred to, if any, on or before the next succeeding sinking fund payment date. Failure of the Company to deliver such certificate (or to deliver the Debt Securities and Coupons, if any, specified in this paragraph) shall not constitute a Default, but such failure shall require that the sinking fund payment due on the next succeeding sinking fund payment date for that series shall be paid entirely in cash and shall be sufficient to redeem the principal amount of such Debt Securities subject to a mandatory sinking fund payment without the option to deliver or credit Debt Securities as provided in this Section 3.06 and without the right to make any optional sinking fund payment, if any, with respect to such series.
Any sinking fund payment or payments (mandatory or optional) made in cash plus any unused balance of any preceding sinking fund payments made in cash which shall equal or exceed $100,000 (or a lesser sum if the Company shall so request) with respect to the Debt Securities of any particular series shall be applied by the Trustee on the sinking fund payment date on which such payment is made (or, if such payment is made before a sinking fund payment date, on the sinking fund payment date following the date of such payment) to the redemption of such Debt Securities at the Redemption Price specified in such Debt Securities, resolution or supplemental indenture for operation of the sinking fund together with any accrued interest to the date fixed for redemption. Any sinking fund money not so applied or allocated by the Trustee to the redemption of Debt Securities shall be added to the next cash sinking fund payment received by the Trustee for such series and, together with such payment, shall be applied in accordance with the provisions of this Section 3.06. Any and all sinking fund money with respect to the Debt Securities of any particular series held by the Trustee on the last sinking fund payment date with respect to Debt Securities of such series and not held for the payment or redemption of particular Debt Securities shall be applied by the Trustee, together with other money, if necessary, to be deposited sufficient for the purpose, to the payment of the principal of the Debt Securities of that series at its Stated Maturity.
The Trustee shall select the Debt Securities to be redeemed upon such sinking fund payment date in the manner specified in the last paragraph of Section 3.03 and the Company shall cause notice of the redemption thereof to be given in the manner provided in Section 3.03 except that the notice of redemption shall also state that the Debt Securities are being redeemed by operation of the sinking fund. Such notice having been duly given, the redemption of such Debt Securities shall be made upon the terms and in the manner stated in Section 3.04.
The Trustee shall not redeem any Debt Securities of a series with sinking fund money or mail any notice of redemption of such Debt Securities by operation of the sinking fund for such series during the continuance of a Default in payment of interest on such Debt Securities or of any Event of Default (other than an Event of Default occurring as a consequence of this paragraph) with respect to such Debt Securities, except that if the notice of redemption of any such Debt Securities shall theretofore have been mailed in accordance with the provisions hereof, the Trustee shall redeem such Debt Securities if cash sufficient for that purpose shall be deposited with the Trustee for that purpose in accordance with the terms of this Article III. Except as aforesaid, any money in the sinking fund for such series at the time when any such Default or Event of Default shall occur and any money thereafter paid into such sinking fund shall, during the continuance of such Default or Event of Default, be held as security for the payment of such Debt Securities; , , that in case such Default or Event of Default shall have been cured or waived as provided herein, such money shall thereafter be applied on the next sinking fund payment date for such Debt Securities on which such money may be applied pursuant to the provisions of this Section 3.06.

Section 12.04 . If payment of the Subordinated Debt Securities is accelerated because of an Event of Default, the Company or the Trustee shall promptly notify the holders of the Designated Senior Indebtedness (or their Representatives) of the acceleration.
Acceleration of Payment of Debt Securities
Section 12.05 .

Section 12.06 . After all Senior Indebtedness is paid in full and until the Subordinated Debt Securities are paid in full, Holders thereof shall be subrogated to the rights of holders of Senior Indebtedness to receive distributions applicable to Senior Indebtedness. A distribution made under this Article XII to holders of Senior Indebtedness which otherwise would have been made to Holders of Subordinated Debt Securities is not, as between the Company and such Holders, a payment by the Company on Senior Indebtedness.
Subrogation
Section 12.07 . This Article XII defines the relative rights of Holders of Subordinated Debt Securities and holders of Senior Indebtedness. Nothing in this Indenture shall:
Relative Rights
(a) impair, as between the Company and Holders of either Subordinated Debt Securities or Debt Securities, the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay principal of, and premium, if any, and interest on, the Subordinated Debt Securities and the Debt Securities in accordance with their terms; or
(b) prevent the Trustee or any Holder of either Subordinated Debt Securities or Debt Securities from exercising its available remedies upon a Default, subject to the rights of holders of Senior Indebtedness to receive distributions otherwise payable to Holders of Subordinated Debt Securities.
Section 12.08 . No right of any holder of Senior Indebtedness to enforce the subordination of the Indebtedness evidenced by the Subordinated Debt Securities shall be impaired by any act or failure to act by the Company or by its failure to comply with this Indenture.
Subordination May Not Be Impaired by Company
Section 12.09 . Notwithstanding Section 12.03, the Trustee or any paying agent may continue to make payments on Subordinated Debt Securities and shall not be charged with knowledge of the existence of facts that would prohibit the making of any such payments unless, not less than two business days prior to the date of such payment, a responsible officer of the Trustee receives notice satisfactory to it that payments may not be made under this Article XII. The Company, the Registrar, any paying agent, a Representative or a holder of Senior Indebtedness may give the notice; , , that, if an issue of Senior Indebtedness has a Representative, only the Representative may give the notice.
Rights of Trustee and Paying Agent
provided
however

The Registrar and any paying agent may do the same with like rights. The Trustee shall be entitled to all the rights set forth in this Article XII with respect to any Senior Indebtedness which may at any time be held by it, to the same extent as any other holder of Senior Indebtedness; and nothing in Article VII shall deprive the Trustee of any of its rights as such holder. Nothing in this Article XII shall apply to claims of, or payments to, the Trustee under or pursuant to Section 7.06.
Section 12.10 . Whenever a distribution is to be made or a notice given to holders of Senior Indebtedness, the distribution may be made and the notice given to their Representative (if any).
Distribution or Notice to Representative
Section 12.11 . The failure to make a payment pursuant to the Debt Securities by reason of any provision in this Article XII shall not be construed as preventing the occurrence of a Default.

Article XII Not to Prevent Defaults or Limit Right to Accelerate
Section 12.12 . Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, payments from money or the proceeds of U.S. Government Obligations held in trust under Article XI by the Trustee for the payment of principal of, and premium, if any, and interest on, the Subordinated Debt Securities or the Debt Securities shall not be subordinated to the prior payment of any
Trust Moneys Not Subordinated
 
Senior Indebtedness or subject to the restrictions set forth in this Article XII, and none of the Holders thereof shall be obligated to pay over any such amount to the Company or any holder of Senior Indebtedness of the Company or any other creditor of the Company.
Section 12.13 . Upon any payment or distribution pursuant to this Article XII, the Trustee and the Holders shall be entitled to rely (a) upon any order or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction in which any proceedings of the nature referred to in Section 12.02 are pending, (b) upon a certificate of the liquidating trustee or agent or other Person making such payment or distribution to the Trustee or to such Holders or (c) upon the Representatives for the holders of Senior Indebtedness for the purpose of ascertaining the Persons entitled to participate in such payment or distribution, the holders of the Senior Indebtedness and other Indebtedness of the Company, the amount thereof or payable thereon, the amount or amounts paid or distributed thereon and all other facts pertinent thereto or to this Article XII. In the event that the Trustee determines, in good faith, that evidence is required with respect to the right of any Person as a holder of Senior Indebtedness to participate in any payment or distribution pursuant to this Article XII, the Trustee may request such Person to furnish evidence to the reasonable satisfaction of the Trustee as to the amount of Senior Indebtedness held by such Person, the extent to which such Person is entitled to participate in such payment or distribution and other facts pertinent to the rights of such Person under this Article XII, and, if such evidence is not furnished, the Trustee may defer any payment to such Person pending judicial determination as to the right of such Person to receive such payment. The provisions of Section 7.01 and Section 7.02 shall be applicable to all actions or omissions of actions by the Trustee pursuant to this Article XII.
Trustee Entitled to Rely
Section 12.14 . Each Holder by accepting a Subordinated Debt Security authorizes and directs the Trustee on his behalf to take such action as may be necessary or appropriate to acknowledge or effectuate the subordination between the Holders of Subordinated Debt Securities and the holders of Senior Indebtedness as provided in this Article XII and appoints the Trustee as attorney-in-fact for any and all such purposes.
Trustee to Effectuate Subordination
Section 12.15 . The Trustee shall not be deemed to owe any fiduciary duty to the holders of Senior Indebtedness and shall not be liable to any such holders if it shall mistakenly pay over or distribute to Holders of Subordinated Debt Securities or the Company or any other Person, money or assets to which any holders of Senior Indebtedness shall be entitled by virtue of this Article XII or otherwise.
Trustee Not Fiduciary for Holders of Senior Indebtedness
Section 12.16 . Each Holder by accepting a Subordinated Debt Security acknowledges and agrees that the foregoing subordination provisions are, and are intended to be, an inducement and a consideration to each holder of any Senior Indebtedness, whether such Senior Indebtedness was created or acquired before or after the issuance of the Subordinated Debt Securities, to acquire and continue to hold, or to continue to hold, such Senior Indebtedness and such holder of Senior Indebtedness shall be deemed conclusively to have relied on such subordination provisions in acquiring and continuing to hold, or in continuing to hold, such Senior Indebtedness.

Section 1. . Pursuant to Section 2.03 of the Indenture, the terms and provisions of the Notes are as follows:
Notes
(a) The title of the Notes shall be designated as the "3.95% Senior Notes due 2022."
(b) The Notes shall be initially limited to $600,000,000 aggregate principal amount. The Company may, without the consent of the Holders of the Notes, increase such aggregate principal amount in the future, on the same terms and conditions and with the same CUSIP numbers as the Notes. The Company shall not issue any such additional Notes unless the additional Notes are fungible with the Notes for United States federal income tax purposes.
(c) Except as provided in Section 3 hereof, the Notes shall not require any principal or premium payments prior to maturity on July 15, 2022 (the "Maturity Date").
(d) The rate at which the Notes shall bear interest shall be 3.95 % per annum; interest on the Notes shall accrue from June 26, 2012, for the first interest payment and from the most recent interest payment date thereafter; the interest payment dates on which such interest shall be payable shall be January 15 and July 15, beginning January 15, 2013 (each an "Interest Payment Date"); and the record dates for the determination of the holders of the Notes to whom such interest is payable shall be the immediately preceding January 1 (for January 15 payment dates) and July 1 (for July 15 payment dates) (each an "Interest Record Date"); the rate at which the overdue principal shall bear interest shall be 1% per annum in excess of the rate stated initially in this clause to the extent lawful; and the rate at which overdue installments of interest shall bear interest shall be 1% per annum in excess of the rate stated initially in this clause to the extent lawful.
(e) Payments of principal of and interest on the Notes represented by one or more Global Senior Notes initially registered in the name of The Depository Trust Company (the "Depositary") or its nominee with respect to the Notes shall be made by the Company through the Trustee in immediately available funds to the Depositary or its nominee, as the case may be.
(f) The Notes shall be redeemable at any time, at the option of the Company, in whole or from time to time in part, at the price, and otherwise in accordance with the terms and provisions, set forth in Section 2 of this Supplemental Indenture and (to the extent they do not conflict with Section 2 of this Supplemental Indenture) the terms and provisions of Sections 3.03 and 3.04 of the Indenture.
(g) The Notes shall be represented by one or more Global Senior Notes deposited with the Depositary and registered in the name of the nominee of the Depositary.
(h) There shall be no mandatory sinking fund for the payments of the Notes.

(j) Wells Fargo Bank, National Association shall be the trustee for the Notes under the Indenture.
(k) Article X of the Indenture shall apply to the Notes.
(l) The Notes shall not be subordinated pursuant to the provisions of Article XII of the Indenture. The Notes shall be senior obligations of the Company ranking with other existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness of the Company.
pari passu
(m) The Company shall be subject to all the covenants set forth in Article IV of the Indenture with respect to the Notes.
(n) To the extent not set forth herein, the provisions of Section 2.03 of the Indenture are not applicable.
(o) Initially, the Trustee shall act as Paying Agent and Registrar. Interest shall be payable at the office or agency of the Company maintained by the Company for such purposes in the United States, which shall initially be the office of the Paying Agent at Sixth and Marquette, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55479. The Company shall pay interest on any Notes in certificated form by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as it appears in the Debt Security Register (or upon written application by such Person to the Trustee and Paying Agent (if different from the Trustee) not later than the relevant Interest Record Date, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such Person's account within the United States, if such Person is entitled to interest on an aggregate principal in excess of $1,000,000, which application shall remain in effect until the Holder notifies the Trustee and Paying Agent to the contrary).
Section 2. . The Notes will be redeemable at any time, at the option of the Company, in whole or from time to time in part, upon not less than 30 and not more than 60 days' notice, as provided in the Indenture, on any date prior to maturity (the "Redemption Date"). If the Notes are redeemed before the date that is three months prior to the Maturity Date, the Notes will be redeemed at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the Redemption Date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on any interest payment date that is on or prior to the Redemption Date) plus a Make-Whole Premium, if any (the "Redemption Price"). In the event that the Notes are so redeemed, the Redemption Price will never be less than 100% of the principal amount of the Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the Redemption Date. If the Notes are redeemed on or after the date that is three months prior to the Maturity Date, the Notes will be redeemed at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes then outstanding to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the Redemption Date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on any interest payment date that is on or prior to the Redemption Date).
Optional Redemption of Notes
 
The amount of the Make-Whole Premium with respect to any of the Notes (or portion thereof) to be redeemed before the date that is three months prior to the Maturity Date will be equal to the excess, if any, of:
(a) the sum of the present values, calculated as of the Redemption Date, of:
(i) each interest payment that, but for such redemption, would have been payable on such Note (or portion thereof) being redeemed on each interest payment date occurring after the Redemption Date (excluding any accrued interest for the period prior to the Redemption Date); and
(ii) the principal amount that, but for such redemption, would have been payable at the final maturity of such Note (or portion thereof) being redeemed; over
(b) the principal amount of such Note (or portion thereof) being redeemed.
The present values of interest and principal payments referred to in clause (a) above will be determined in accordance with generally accepted principles of financial analysis. Such present values will be calculated by discounting the amount of each payment of interest or principal from the date that each such payment would have been payable, but for the redemption, to the Redemption Date at a discount rate equal to the Treasury Yield (as defined below) plus 37.5 basis points.
The Make-Whole Premium will be calculated by an independent investment banking institution of national standing appointed by the Company; provided that if the Company fails to make such appointment at least 30 business days prior to the Redemption Date, or if the institution so appointed is unwilling or unable to make such calculation, such calculation will be made by an independent investment banking institution of national standing appointed by the Trustee (in any such case, an "Independent Investment Banker").
For purposes of determining the Make-Whole Premium, "Treasury Yield" means a rate of interest per annum equal to the weekly average yield to maturity of United States Treasury Notes that have a constant maturity that corresponds to the remaining term to maturity of the applicable Notes, calculated to the nearest 1/12th of a year (the "Remaining Term"). The Treasury Yield will be determined as of the third business day immediately preceding the applicable Redemption Date.
The weekly average yields of United States Treasury Notes will be determined by reference to the most recent statistical release published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and designated "H.15 (519) Selected Interest Rates" or any successor release (the "H.15 Statistical Release"). If the H.15 Statistical Release sets forth a weekly average yield for United States Treasury Notes having a constant maturity that is the same as the Remaining Term, then the Treasury Yield will be equal to such weekly average yield. In all other cases, the Treasury Yield will be calculated by interpolation, on a straight-line basis, between the weekly average yields on the United States Treasury Notes that have a constant maturity closest to and greater than the Remaining Term and the United States Treasury Notes that have a constant maturity closest to and less than the Remaining Term (in each case as set forth in the H.15 Statistical Release). Any weekly average yields so calculated by interpolation will be rounded to the
 
nearest 1/100th of 1%, with any figure of 1/200th of 1% or above being rounded upward. If weekly average yields for United States Treasury Notes are not available in the H.15 Statistical Release or otherwise, then the Treasury Yield will be calculated by interpolation of comparable rates selected by the Independent Investment Banker.
In the case of any partial redemption, selection of the Notes for redemption will be made by the Trustee on a pro rata basis, by lot or by such other method as the Trustee in its sole discretion shall deem to be fair and appropriate, although no such Note of $1,000 in original principal amount or less shall be redeemed in part. If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption relating to such Note shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. A new Note in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof will be issued in the name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of the original Note.
Section 3. .
Offer to Repurchase Upon a Change of Control Repurchase Event
(a) If a Change of Control Repurchase Event occurs, unless the Company has otherwise exercised its right to redeem the Notes, the Company will make an offer to each Holder of Notes to repurchase all or any portion (equal to $1,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000) of such Holder's Notes at a price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Notes repurchased to the date of repurchase (the "Change of Control Repurchase Event Payment"). Within 30 days following any Change of Control Repurchase Event, the Company will mail a notice (the "Change of Control Repurchase Event Offer") to each holder describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control Repurchase Event and stating:
(i) that the Change of Control Repurchase Event Offer is being made pursuant to the Change of Control Repurchase Event provisions of the Notes and that all Notes tendered will be accepted for payment;
(ii) the purchase price and the purchase date, which shall be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed (the "Change of Control Repurchase Event Payment Date");
(iii) that any Note not tendered will continue to accrue interest;
(iv) that, unless the Company defaults in the payment of the Change of Control Repurchase Event Payment, all Notes accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Repurchase Event Offer will cease to accrue interest after the Change of Control Repurchase Event Payment Date;
(v) that Holders electing to have any Notes purchased pursuant to a Change of Control Repurchase Event Offer will be required to surrender the Notes to the paying agent at the address specified in the notice prior to the close of business on the third business day preceding the Change of Control Repurchase Event Payment Date;
(vi) that Holders will be entitled to withdraw their election if the paying agent receives, not later than the close of business on the second business day preceding the Change of Control Repurchase Event Payment Date, a telegram, telex, facsimile transmission or letter setting forth the name of the Holder, the principal amount of Notes delivered for purchase, and a statement that such Holder is withdrawing his election to have the Notes purchased; and
 
(vii) that Holders whose Notes are being purchased only in part will be issued new Notes equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered, which unpurchased portion must be equal to $1,000 in principal amount or an integral multiple thereof.
The Company will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act, and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes as a result of a Change of Control Repurchase Event. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control Repurchase Event provisions of the Notes, the Company will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control Repurchase Event provisions of the Notes by virtue of such conflict.

The terms of the Securities include those stated in the Indenture and those made part of the Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 (15 U.S.C.  77aaa-77bbbb) as in effect on the date of the Indenture (the "Act"). Terms defined in the Indenture and not defined herein have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Indenture. The Securities are subject to all such terms, and Holders are referred to the Indenture and the Act for a statement of those terms.
This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of general unsecured obligations of the Company all issued or to be issued under the Indenture. Debt Securities issued under the Indenture may be issued in one or more series, which different series may be issued in various aggregate principal amounts, may mature at different times, may bear interest at different rates, may have different conversion prices (if any), may be subject to different redemption provisions, may be subject to different sinking, purchase or analogous funds, may be subject to different covenants, Events of Default and subordination provisions and may otherwise vary as the Indenture provides. This Security is one of a series designated as 3.95% Senior Notes due 2022 (the "Securities") issued under the Indenture, limited to $600,000,000 aggregate principal amount. The Company may, without the consent of the Holders of the Notes, increase such aggregate principal amount in the future, on the same terms and conditions and with the same CUSIP numbers as the Notes. The Company shall not issue any such additional Notes unless the additional Notes are fungible with the Notes for United States federal income tax purposes. The Indenture imposes certain limitations (with significant exceptions) on the ability of the Company and its Subsidiaries to create Liens on assets and engage in sale and leaseback transactions. This Indenture also imposes limitations on the ability of the Company to consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of its assets.
 
The Guarantor, pursuant to the First Supplemental Indenture, has agreed that, if any of certain other senior notes of the Company hereafter are guaranteed by the Guarantor, then it will at that time unconditionally guarantee (i) the due and punctual payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Securities, whether at the maturity date, by acceleration or otherwise, and of interest on the overdue principal of and interest, if any, on any premium and interest of the Securities and all other obligations of the Company to the Holders or the Trustee under the Indenture or the Securities and (ii) in case of any extension of time of payment or renewal of any Securities or any of such other obligations, that the same will be promptly paid in full when due or performed in accordance with the terms of the extension or renewal, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise.
The obligations of the Guarantor to the Holders and to the Trustee are as expressly set forth in Section 4 of the First Supplemental Indenture and in such other provisions of the Indenture as are applicable to the Guarantor, and reference is hereby made to such Indenture for the precise terms of this obligation to guarantee. The terms of Section 4 of the First Supplemental Indenture and such other provisions of the Indenture as are applicable to the Guarantor are incorporated herein by reference.
 
The Securities will be redeemable at any time, at the option of the Company, in whole or from time to time in part, upon not less than 30 and not more than 60 days' notice as provided in the Indenture, on any date prior to their maturity (the "Redemption Date"). If the Securities are redeemed before the date that is three months prior to their maturity date (prior to April 15, 2022), the Securities will be redeemed at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the Redemption Date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on an interest
payment date that is on or prior to the Redemption Date) plus a Make-Whole Premium, if any, calculated as provided in Section 2 of the First Supplemental Indenture (the "Redemption Price"). In the event that the Securities are so redeemed, the Redemption Price will never be less than 100% of the principal amount of the Securities plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the Redemption Date. If the Securities are redeemed on or after the date that is three months prior to their maturity date (prior to April 15, 2022), the Securities will be redeemed at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Securities then outstanding to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the Redemption Date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on any interest payment date that is on or prior to the Redemption Date).
 
The Securities are in registered form without coupons in denominations of $1,000 and whole multiples of $1,000. A Holder may transfer or exchange Securities only in accordance with the Indenture. The Registrar may require a Holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements or transfer documents and to pay any taxes and fees required by law or permitted by the Indenture.
 
The registered Holder of this Security may be treated as the owner of it for all purposes.
 
If money for the payment of principal or interest remains unclaimed for two years, the Trustee or Paying Agent shall pay the money back to the Company at its request unless an abandoned property law designates another Person. After any such payment, Holders entitled to the money must look only to the Company and not to the Trustee for payment.
 
Subject to certain conditions, the Company at any time may terminate some or all its obligations under the Securities and the Indenture if the Company deposits or causes to be deposited with the Trustee cash or U.S. Government Obligations for the payment of principal and interest on the Securities to redemption or final maturity, as the case may be.
 
Subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Indenture, (i) the Indenture or the Securities may be amended with the written consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount outstanding of the Securities and (ii) any acceleration of principal and interest on the Securities resulting from a default or noncompliance with any provision may be waived with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount outstanding of the Securities. Subject to certain exceptions set forth in Article IX of the Indenture, without the consent of any Holder, the Company and the Trustee may amend the Indenture or the Securities to cure, among other things, any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency, or to evidence the succession of another Person to the Company pursuant to Article X of the Indenture, or to add guarantees with
respect to the Securities or to secure the Securities, or to add additional covenants or surrender rights and powers conferred on the Company, or to limit the applicability of or consequences of breach of any covenant, or to permit the qualification of the Indenture under the Act, or to make any change that does not adversely affect the rights of any Holder, or to provide for the acceptance of a successor or separate Trustee.
 
Under the Indenture, Events of Default include (i) default for 30 days in payment of interest on the Securities; (ii) default in payment of principal or premium on the Securities at maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise; (iii) failure by the Company to comply with other agreements in the Indenture or the Securities, in certain cases subject to notice by Holders and lapse of time; (iv) certain accelerations (including failure to pay within any grace period after final maturity) of other Indebtedness of the Company if the amount accelerated (or so unpaid) exceeds $50,000,000 and continues for 10 days after the required notice to the Company; and (v) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to the Company and any Significant Subsidiary. If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the Securities may declare all the Securities to be due and payable immediately. Certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency are Events of Default that will result in the Securities being due and payable immediately upon the occurrence of such Events of Default without any action by the Trustee or any Holders.
Holders may not enforce the Indenture or the Securities except as provided in the Indenture. The Trustee may refuse to enforce the Indenture or the Securities unless it receives reasonable indemnity or security. Subject to certain limitations, Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power. The Trustee may withhold from Holders notice of any continuing Default (except a Default in payment of principal or interest) if it determines that withholding notice is in the interest of the Holders.
 
Subject to certain limitations imposed by the Act, the Trustee under the Indenture, in its individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Securities and may otherwise deal with and collect obligations owed to it by the Company or its Affiliates and may otherwise deal with the Company or its Affiliates with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee.
 
An incorporator and any past, present or future director, officer, employee or stockholder, as such, of the Company shall not have any liability for any obligations of the Company under the Securities or the Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of or by reason of such obligations or their creation. By accepting a Security, each Holder waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for the issue of the Securities.
This Security shall not be valid until an authorized signatory of the Trustee (or an authenticating agent) manually signs the certificate of authentication on the other side of this Security.
 
Customary abbreviations may be used in the name of a Holder or an assignee, such as TEN COM (=tenants in common), TEN ENT (=tenants by the entireties), JT TEN (=joint tenants with rights of survivorship and not as tenants in common), CUST (=custodian), and U/G/M/A (=Uniform Gift to Minors Act).
 
THIS SECURITY SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK BUT WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO APPLICABLE PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAW TO THE EXTENT THAT THE APPLICATION OF THE LAWS OF ANOTHER JURISDICTION WOULD BE REQUIRED THEREBY.
 
Pursuant to a recommendation promulgated by the Committee on Uniform Security Identification Procedures, the Company has caused CUSIP numbers to be printed on the Securities and has directed the Trustee to use CUSIP numbers in notices of redemption as a convenience to Holders. No representation is made as to the accuracy of such numbers either as printed on the Securities or as contained in any notice of redemption and reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers placed thereon.
The Company shall furnish to any Holder upon written request and without charge to the Holder a copy of the Indenture that has in it the text of this Security. Requests may be made to:
