News Release
Pioneer Natural Resources Provides Production and Financial Update
for the Second Quarter of 2012
Dallas, Texas, July 18, 2012 -- Pioneer Natural Resources Company (NYSE:PXD)
(Pioneer or the Company) today provided updates on the Companys expected production and commodity price realizations for the second quarter of 2012 and the Companys commodity derivative positions for 2014 and 2015.
Second Quarter 2012 Production Update
Pioneers production from continuing operations averaged 150,506 barrels oil equivalent per day (BOEPD) in the second quarter of 2012. The Companys production guidance for the quarter was 149 thousand barrels oil equivalent per day (MBOEPD) to 154 MBOEPD. Production from the Spraberry field in West Texas was negatively impacted by approximately 4,800 BOEPD due to unplanned third-party natural gas liquids (NGL) fractionation downtime and tight industry NGL fractionation capacity at Mont Belvieu, Texas as described below. Had these third-party processing issues not occurred during the second quarter and all of Pioneers NGL volumes could have been fractionated and sold, Pioneers production would have been above the top of the guidance range at approximately 155 MBOEPD.
Despite the unanticipated NGL inventory build in the second quarter and the reduced production resulting
from ethane rejection, Pioneer continues to expect to deliver full-year 2012 production ranging from 148 MBOEPD to 153 MBOEPD, an increase of 23% to 27% compared to full-year 2011.
Second Quarter 2012 Commodity Prices
In the second quarter of 2012, Pioneers oil sales averaged 61 thousand barrels per day (MBPD), NGL sales averaged 27 MBPD and gas sales averaged 373 million cubic feet per day. For the second quarter, Pioneer expects to report an approximate before-tax net gain of $276 million on mark-to-market derivative contracts, of which approximately $119 million is a before-tax noncash net gain and $157 million is a before-tax cash net gain. The Company's derivative mark-to-market results are outlined on the attached schedule.
In the second quarter, the NYMEX West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil price averaged $93.49 per barrel. Pioneer's second quarter oil average realized price per barrel before derivative transactions was $86.87 per barrel. Including the impact of VPPs and all derivatives, the second quarter average oil price was $87.94 per barrel. The NGL average realized price per barrel before derivative transactions was $32.62, or approximately 35% of WTI. Including the impact of all derivatives, the average NGL price was $34.48 per barrel.
In the second quarter, the NYMEX gas price averaged $2.21 per thousand cubic feet (MCF). Pioneer's second quarter average realized gas price before derivative transactions was $2.00 per MCF. Including the impact of all derivatives, the average gas price was $4.43 per MCF.
Commodity Derivative Positions For 2014 and 2015
 
Pioneer has a strong financial position and is committed to maintaining this position. In June and July 2012, Pioneer liquidated swap, collar and three-way collar derivatives for 250,000 million British thermal units per day (MMBTUPD) of 2014 gas production and 80,000 MMBTUPD of 2015 gas production. These liquidated volumes represent 100% and 43% of Pioneers gas derivative positions in 2014 and 2015, respectively. The Company also liquidated 140,000 MMBTUPD of gas basis swaps for 2014. As a result of these liquidations, the Company realized approximately $143 million of net cash proceeds, of which $72 million was realized during June.
The gas derivatives were unwound when gas prices were at low levels to partially offset the reduction in cash flow the Company is now expecting for 2012 resulting from lower price realizations on oil and NGL sales. Despite the monetization of the gas derivatives for 2014 and a portion for 2015, Pioneer continues to have one of the best commodity derivatives positions in the industry. Derivative swap, collar and three-way collar contracts cover approximately 90% of the Companys oil production over the remainder of 2012, 85% in 2013 and 40% in 2014. For gas, swap, collar and three-way collar derivative contracts are in place to cover 90% of Pioneers production over the remainder of 2012, 65% in 2013 and 20% in 2015.
The Company's open derivatives positions are outlined on the attached schedule.

As of June 30, 2012, the Company has diesel derivative swap contracts for 250 notional Bbls per day for 2013 at an average per Bbl fixed price of $111.30.

The Company purchases diesel derivative swap contracts to mitigate fuel price risk.
Interest rate derivatives. 
As of June 30, 2012, the Company had interest rate derivative contracts that lock in a fixed forward annual interest rate of 3.06%, for a 10-year period ending in August 2022, on a notional amount of $200 million.  These derivative contracts mature and settle by their terms during August 2012. The Company also had interest rate derivative contracts that lock in a fixed forward annual interest rate of 3.21%, for a 10-year period ending in December 2025, on a notional amount of $250 million.

Marketing and basis transfer derivatives.
 
Periodically, the Company enters into gas buy and sell marketing arrangements to fulfill firm pipeline transportation commitments.  Associated with these gas marketing arrangements, the Company may enter into gas index swaps to mitigate price risk.
From time to time, the Company also enters into long and short gas swap contracts that transfer gas basis risk from one sales index to another sales index.  The following table presents Pioneers open marketing and basis transfer derivative positions as of July 17, 2012:
