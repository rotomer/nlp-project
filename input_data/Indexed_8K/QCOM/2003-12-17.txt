Item 2. Acquisition or Disposition of Assets
     On December 2, 2003 (the "Closing Date"), Vsper Holding, Ltd ("VHL"), a majority-owned subsidiary of QUALCOMM Incorporated (the "Company"), and QUALCOMM do Brasil Ltda. ("QdB"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, conveyed all of their rights, title and interest in and to the shares of capital stock of Vsper Holding S.A. and Vsper Holding So Paulo S.A. (collectively, the "Brazilian Holding Companies"), constituting all the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of the Brazilian Holding Companies, to Embratel Particpaes S.A. ("Embratel"), pursuant to that certain Share Purchase Agreement (the "SPA") dated as of September 25, 2003 among VHL, QdB and Embratel. In addition to indirectly acquiring the shares of Vsper S.A. and Vsper So Paulo S.A. (the "Vsper Operating Companies") held by the Brazilian Holding Companies, under the SPA Embratel also directly acquired on the Closing Date from VHL all of its rights, title and interest in and to all the remaining shares of capital stock of the Vsper Operating Companies. While the SPA provided for the payment by Embratel of nominal consideration in the total amount of approximately $1 U.S. for the shares of the Brazilian Holding Companies and Vsper Operating Companies, the Company and Embratel have separately agreed that no actual payment thereof was to be made, and no consideration for such shares was received. This price was determined by arms-length negotiations.
     Although under the SPA Embratel directly or indirectly acquired 100% of the shares of the Vsper Operating Companies, the Company has effectively retained, through a new wholly-owned subsidiary ("TowerCo"), ownership and control of the Vsper Operating Companies' 622 existing communication towers and related interests in tower site property leases ("Vsper Towers"). The communication towers had a net book value of approximately $5 million at September 30, 2003. All other assets of the Vsper Operating Companies as of the Closing Date were included in the Embratel sales transaction. Concurrent with the closing of the transaction, the Vsper Operating Companies and TowerCo entered into a 10-year agreement (renewable at the Vsper Operating Companies' option for up to two successive five year terms) whereby the Vsper Operating Companies will pay a monthly fee for use of aerial and ground space on the tower sites. Under this arrangement, the Company preserves the ability, and plans, to sell some or all of its interest in TowerCo and/or the tower sites (with assignment of the associated rights under the usage rights agreement).
     The Company provided approximately $6 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2004 to fund operations of the Vsper Operating Companies and additionally provided approximately $39 million in aggregate funding to or for the benefit of the Vsper Operating Companies on or before the Closing Date to facilitate the transaction. Such facilitation included enabling the Vsper Operating Companies to completely extinguish their existing local bank debt (at an agreed discount) and transfer ownership of the Vsper Towers to TowerCo free and clear of any local bank security interest. All other liabilities of the Vsper Operating Companies as of the Closing Date were included in the Embratel sales transaction. The Company expects to realize an estimated loss of $50 million to $60 million on the Embratel sales transaction in the first quarter of fiscal 2004.
     On November 19, 2002, QdB won bids to acquire personal mobile service ("SMP") licenses in the state of So Paulo (excluding So Paulo metro), the state of Minas Gerais, and in the Northeast region of Brazil. Approximately $8 million of the approximate $82 million purchase price for the SMP licenses was paid in December 2002. The remaining Brazilian real-denominated

obligation was financed by the Brazilian government at an interest rate of 12% per annum, plus an adjustment for inflation, payable in six equal annual installments starting in fiscal 2006. These SMP licenses with a net book value of approximately $103 million and a corresponding liability of approximately $111 million at September 30, 2003 were not included in the Embratel sales transaction. The Company has initiated the waiver and return of the SMP licenses to Anatel, the telecommunications regulatory agency in Brazil. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information does not include the accounting for the return of the SMP licenses.
     Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 46 (FIN 46), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, was issued in January 2003. FIN 46 requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. The provisions of FIN 46 were effective immediately for all arrangements entered into after January 31, 2003. The Company has determined that the Vsper Operating Companies are variable interest entities; however, the Company is not the primary beneficiary of the Vsper Operating Companies. The Vsper Operating Companies will therefore not be consolidated in the Company's consolidated financial statements after the Closing Date. However, numerous implementation issues and questions exist related to the application of FIN 46 and it is expected that the FASB will issue additional guidance that may clarify or revise FIN 46 as issued. The Company will continue to monitor guidance provided by the FASB to determine the effect, if any, FIN 46 will have on this transaction.
     None of the Company, its affiliates, the Company's directors or officers, or any of its directors' or officers' associates has any material relationship with Embratel.
     In addition to the historical information contained herein, this Report contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Such statements can be identified by the use of words such as "expects" or "plans" or similar expressions, and include statements regarding the Company's plans to sell all or part of its interest in TowerCo, the estimated loss regarding the sale transaction that will be reported in the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the first quarter of fiscal 2004 and the estimated loss for the first quarter of fiscal 2004 related to the Vesper Operating Companies through the Closing Date. Actual results may differ substantially from those referred to herein due to a number of factors, including the process of negotiation regarding the sale of the Company's interest in TowerCo, factors affecting the operating results of the Vsper Operating Companies as well as the other risks detailed from time to time in the Company's SEC Reports, including the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 28, 2003 (see Note (a) to unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information).
