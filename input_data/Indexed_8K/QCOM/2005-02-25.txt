Specifically, the Compensation Committee approved the following changes:
     A summary of these changes to the Company's non-employee director compensation is attached as Exhibit 99.1 hereto and is hereby incorporated by reference.
     In addition, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors authorized the preparation and adoption of an amendment to the Company's Executive Retirement Contribution Plan which would provide that non-employee directors are eligible to participate in such plan. This plan, when amended, will provide that eligible participants, including non-employee directors, may elect to defer the receipt of certain cash compensation (including director retainers and meeting fees) otherwise owed to the individual to a future date selected by the participant. This plan, once amended, will be summarized and filed by the Company on a subsequent Form 8-K.
