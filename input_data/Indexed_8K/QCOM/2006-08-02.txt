Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
     On July 31, 2006, Incorporated (the "Company") elected Ms. Barbara Alexander to its Board of Directors. In connection with her election to the Board, the Company granted Ms. Alexander a stock option under the 2006 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "Plan") to purchase 40,000 shares of Company stock at an exercise price of $35.79 per share, which was equal to the fair market value of the Company's stock on July 31, 2006 (the date of grant). The vesting and service requirements for these stock options are identical in all material respects to the terms and conditions of "initial" stock options previously granted to other new non-employee members of the Company's Board of Directors who join the Board between annual meetings. In particular, the options vest and become exercisable over a five year period (twenty percent of the options vest one year after the date of grant and thereafter 1/60th of the total options vest on a monthly basis).
