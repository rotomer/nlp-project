     On November 27, 2006, at a meeting of the Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors of QUALCOMM Incorporated (the "Company"), the Committee approved the terms of the 2007 Annual Bonus Program (the "Bonus Program") applicable to key employees of the Company, including the Company's executive officers. The design of the Bonus Program is similar to the Company's 2006, 2005 and other prior year programs, and all such programs reward achievement at specified levels of financial and individual performance.
     Under the Bonus Program each officer position has an assigned base target bonus level, expressed as a percent of fiscal year-end annual salary.

Two components comprise the fundamental design of the Bonus Program:
