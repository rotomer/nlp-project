Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition
          On April 25, 2007, QUALCOMM Incorporated (the "Company") issued a press release regarding the Company's financial results for its second quarter ended April 1, 2007. The full text of the Company's press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
          The attached press release presents pro forma financial information that is used by management (i) to evaluate, assess and benchmark the Company's operating results on a consistent and comparable basis, (ii) to measure the performance and efficiency of the Company's ongoing core operating businesses, including the QUALCOMM CDMA Technologies, QUALCOMM Technology Licensing and QUALCOMM Wireless & Internet segments, and (iii) to compare the performance and efficiency of these segments against each other and against competitors outside the Company. Pro forma measurements of the following financial data are used by the Company's management: revenues, research and development (R&D) expenses, selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, total operating expenses, operating income, net investment income, income before income taxes, effective tax rate, net income, diluted earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. Management is able to assess what it believes is a more meaningful and comparable set of financial performance measures for the Company and its business segments by eliminating the episodic impact of strategic investments in QSI and items such as acquired in-process R&D, as well as the inherent, non-operational volatility of share-based compensation. As a result, management compensation decisions and the review of executive compensation by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors focus primarily on pro forma financial measures applicable to the Company and its business segments.
          The attached press release presents pro forma information used by management which excludes the QUALCOMM Strategic Initiatives (QSI) segment, certain estimated share-based compensation, certain tax adjustments related to prior years and acquired in-process R&D. The QSI segment is excluded because the Company expects to exit its strategic investments at various times and the effects of fluctuations in the value of such investments are viewed by management as unrelated to the Company's operational performance. Estimated share-based compensation, other than amounts related to share-based awards granted under the executive bonus program, is excluded because management views the valuation of options and other share-based compensation as theoretical and unrelated to the Company's operational performance as the share-based compensation is affected by factors that are subject to change on each grant date, including the Company's stock price, stock market volatility, expected option life, risk-free interest rates and expected dividend payouts in future years. Moreover, it is not an expense that requires or will require cash payment by the Company. Certain tax adjustments related to prior years are excluded in order to provide a clearer understanding of the Company's ongoing tax rate and after tax earnings. Acquired in-process R&D is excluded because such expense is viewed by management as unrelated to the operating activities of the Company's ongoing core businesses.
          The attached press release presents free cash flow, defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, to facilitate an understanding of the amount of cash flow generated that is available to grow the Company's business and to create long-term shareholder value. The Company believes that this presentation is useful in evaluating its operating performance and financial strength. In addition, management uses this measure to evaluate the Company's performance, to value the Company and to compare its operating performance with other companies in the industry.
          The non-GAAP pro forma financial information presented in the attached press release should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). In addition, pro forma is not a term defined by GAAP, and, as a result, the Company's measure of pro forma results might be different than similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliations between total QUALCOMM (GAAP) results and QUALCOMM pro forma results and total QUALCOMM (GAAP) cash flow and QUALCOMM pro forma cash flow are presented in the attached press release.

Total QUALCOMM results are reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).

"We are pleased to report that the 3G CDMA-based market continues to grow at a rapid pace. Our results reflect strong year-over-year growth in CDMA2000 and WCDMA chipsets and handsets driving record revenue and earnings per share," said Dr. Paul E. Jacobs, chief executive officer of QUALCOMM. "Based on our current outlook, thanks primarily to stronger than expected chipset demand across our product portfolio and higher CDMA2000 handset shipments, we are raising our fiscal 2007 revenue and earnings per share guidance."
"Focused execution by QUALCOMM and its partners resulted in many exciting achievements this quarter. The MediaFLO USA service was commercially launched by Verizon Wireless and AT&T/Cingular announced their plan to launch services later this year. The GSM Association selected LG's phone, powered by a QUALCOMM chipset, as the 3G for All' winner to enable feature rich WCDMA handsets at lower prices. In addition, we announced the expansion of our single chip product line to include EV-DO Rev. A, providing a low cost mobile broadband solution. The innovation and competition enabled by our business model continues to provide manufacturers, operators and subscribers compelling devices, applications and services globally."
Cash and Marketable Securities
QUALCOMM's cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled approximately $11.3 billion at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2007, compared to $10.5 billion at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2007 and $10.2 billion a year ago. During the second quarter of fiscal 2007, we

QUALCOMM Announces Second Quarter Fiscal 2007 Results
announced a 17 percent increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.12 to $0.14 per share. A cash dividend of $0.14 per share is payable on June 29, 2007 to stockholders of record at the close of business on June 1, 2007.
Estimated Share-Based Compensation
Total QUALCOMM (GAAP) net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2007 included estimated share-based compensation, net of tax, of $84 million, or $0.05 per share, compared to $78 million, or $0.05 per share in the prior year quarter.
Research and Development
Pro forma R&D expenses increased 23 percent year-over-year, primarily due to additional engineering resources for the development of integrated circuit products and other initiatives to support low-cost phones, multimedia applications, high-speed wireless Internet access and multi-mode, multi-band, multi-network products and technologies. QSI R&D expenses are primarily related to MediaFLO USA.
Selling, General and Administrative
 
Page 4 of 17
QUALCOMM Announces Second Quarter Fiscal 2007 Results
Pro forma selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 60 percent year-over-year, largely attributable to increases in legal fees, employee related expenses and bad debt expense. The year-over-year increase in QSI SG&A expenses is primarily related to MediaFLO USA.
Effective Income Tax Rate
Our fiscal 2007 effective income tax rate is estimated to be 21 percent for total QUALCOMM (GAAP), consistent with our prior estimate. The second quarter tax rate of 22 percent for total QUALCOMM (GAAP) is higher than the estimated annual effective income tax rate due primarily to $33 million of tax benefits recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 related to the retroactive extension of the federal research and development tax credit. Our fiscal 2007 QUALCOMM pro forma effective income tax rate is estimated to be 24 percent, compared to our previous estimate of 25 percent. This decrease in our pro forma estimated annual rate is primarily due to an increase in forecasted earnings taxed at less than the United States federal tax rate.
QUALCOMM Strategic Initiatives
The QSI segment includes our strategic investments, including our MediaFLO USA subsidiary, and related income and expenses. Total QUALCOMM (GAAP) results for the second quarter of fiscal 2007 include $0.01 loss per share for the QSI segment. The second quarter of fiscal 2007 QSI results included $50 million in operating expenses, primarily related to MediaFLO USA.
Business Outlook
The following statements are forward-looking and actual results may differ materially. Please see "Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" at the end of this news release for a description of certain risk factors and QUALCOMM's annual and quarterly reports on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a more complete description of risks. Due to their nature, certain income and expense items, such as realized investment gains or losses in QSI, gains and losses on certain derivative instruments or asset impairments, cannot be accurately forecast. Accordingly, the Company excludes forecasts of such items from its business outlook, and actual results may vary materially from the business outlook if the Company incurs any such income or expense items. Estimated share-based compensation in future periods may vary materially from the business outlook as the methodology used to calculate this estimate is dependent on a variety of assumptions which are subject to market fluctuations and other factors.

QUALCOMM Announces Second Quarter Fiscal 2007 Results
The following table summarizes total QUALCOMM (GAAP) and QUALCOMM pro forma guidance for the third fiscal quarter and fiscal year 2007 based on the current business outlook. The pro forma business outlook provided below is presented consistent with the presentation of pro forma results provided elsewhere herein.
Our third quarter and fiscal 2007 guidance includes the anticipated positive impact to QTL revenue resulting from an arbitration decision in April 2007 in our favor against Ericsson and Sony Ericsson for underpaying royalties to us under the terms of the license agreement with us. Under the arbitration order, we will receive $30 million for subscriber unit sales from 2004 through the first quarter of calendar 2006. In addition, royalty payments from the first quarter of calendar 2006 to the present, and going forward, will be made in accordance with the arbitrators' decision providing a positive impact on revenues and earnings.
We are engaged in multiple disputes with Nokia Corp. including litigation over Nokia's obligation to pay royalties for the use of certain of our patents. As a result, under generally accepted accounting principles, we do not expect to be able to record royalty revenue attributable to Nokia's sales starting in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 until an arbitrator (or court) awards damages or the disputes are otherwise resolved by agreement with Nokia. We had previously estimated the potential impact of non-payment of royalties from Nokia in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 for June quarter shipments to be approximately $0.04 to $0.06 diluted earnings per share. Our current estimate of royalties which we believe will be owed from Nokia in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 for June quarter shipments is approximately $0.04 to $0.05 diluted earnings per share, which we have excluded from our current fiscal 2007 guidance.

Note Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The Company presents pro forma financial information that is used by management (i) to evaluate, assess and benchmark the Company's operating results on a consistent and comparable basis, (ii) to measure the performance and efficiency of the Company's ongoing core operating businesses, including the QUALCOMM CDMA Technologies, QUALCOMM Technology Licensing and QUALCOMM Wireless & Internet segments, and (iii) to compare the performance and efficiency of these segments against each other and against competitors outside the Company. Pro forma measurements of the following financial data are used by the Company's management: revenues, R&D expenses, SG&A expenses, total operating expenses, operating income, net investment income, income before income taxes, effective tax rate, net income, diluted earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow.

operational performance as the share-based compensation is affected by factors that are subject to change on each grant date, including the Company's stock price, stock market volatility, expected option life, risk-free interest rates and expected dividend payouts in future years. Moreover, it is not an expense that requires or will require cash payment by the Company.
