Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers
     (d) On December 6, 2010, QUALCOMM Incorporated (the "Company") appointed Dr. Francisco Ros to its Board of Directors. Dr. Ros was appointed for a term of office that expires at the next Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Other than as set forth herein, there was not and is not any arrangement or understanding between Dr. Ros and any other person pursuant to which Dr. Ros was selected to be a director. Dr. Ros will receive compensation for his services as a non-employee director under our director compensation program. The components of that program were described in the Company's Proxy Statement for the Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on March 2, 2010. Subsequent to that Proxy Statement, the director compensation program was revised to increase the annual cash retainer for directors who are non-U.S. residents to $120,000 in consideration of their increased travel time. The Board has not yet determined whether to name Dr. Ros to any of its committees.
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
