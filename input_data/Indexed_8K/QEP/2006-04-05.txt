Item 7.01   Regulation FD
On March 23, 2006, Questar Exploration and Production and Wexpro Company (collectively the Companies), subsidiaries of Questar Market Resources, filed a declaratory judgment action in the District Court of Sublette County, Wyoming to determine the interest of Doyle Hartman and other alleged stakeholders (collectively the Hartman parties) who claim a 5% net profits interest (NPI) in Pinedale leasehold interests of the Companies. The dispute relates to the scope of the NPI, created by a 1954 contract, to which the defendants are the apparent successors. By its terms the NPI relates to the former Pinedale Unit, a federal exploratory unit, and is computed based on revenues and expenses from unit operations.  The complaint alleges that the Pinedale Unit contracted sig nificantly after the 1954 contract was executed and therefore the NPI, so far as the Companies are concerned, is limited to a 1,000 acre remnant of the contracted Pinedale Unit.
Questar Exploration & Production Company and Wexpro Company v. Doyle Hartman, et al
(Case No. 2006-6839)
On March 31, 2006, the Companies were served with a complaint in litigation filed by the Hartman parties. The action, styled , was filed in the District Court of Sublette County, Wyoming. The complaint seeks declaratory judgment that the NPI affects leases committed to the original Pinedale Unit regardless of whether the leases and lands have been eliminated from the Pinedale Unit by contraction of that unit. The complaint also seeks an accounting, damages for breach of contract, breach of royalty payment obligations, slander of title, breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing and conversion. Questar and Wexpro intend to vigorously defend against the allegations of the Hartman action and are in the process of evaluating the claims asserted in Hartman's complaint and what actions, if any, will be taken in response thereto.
