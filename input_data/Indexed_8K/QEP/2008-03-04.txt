(A)
If the Title Defect results from Sellers having a lesser NRI in such Title Defect Property than the NRI specified therefor on , the Title Defect Amount shall be equal to the product obtained by multiplying the Allocated Value of such Title Defect Property by a fraction, the numerator of which is the reduction in the NRI and the denominator of which is the NRI specified for such Title Defect Property on .

Exhibit "A"
(D)
If the Title Defect results from the existence of a lien, security interest, pledge or collateral assignment upon one or more Subject Properties (or a portion thereof) which is liquidated in amount,  the Title Defect Amount shall be an amount necessary to remove such lien, security interest, pledge or collateral assignment.
(E)
If the Title Defect results from any matter not described in paragraphs (A), (B), (C) or (D) above, the Title Defect Amount shall be an amount equal to the difference between the value of the Title Defect Property affected by such Title Defect with such Title Defect and the value of such Title Defect Property without such Title Defect (taking into account the Allocated Value of such Title Defect Property); that if such Title Defect is reasonably susceptible of being cured, the Title Defect Amount shall be the reasonable cost and expense of curing such Title Defect, if less.

in the computation of Sellers' WI or NRI as set forth on and correction thereof would not be applied to the aggregate value of all Title Defects.  Should such error be found, Purchaser shall be entitled to a reduction in the Purchase Price based on the Allocated Value of the affected Oil and Gas Properties.  Such reduction in the Purchase Price shall not be subject to the Title Defect Threshold.  
Exhibit "A"
(G)
If a Title Defect is not effective or does not affect a Title Defect Property throughout the entire commercially productive life of such Title Defect Property, such fact shall be taken into account in determining the Title Defect Amount.
(H)
The Title Defect Amount with respect to a Title Defect Property shall be determined without duplication of any costs or losses included in another Title Defect Amount hereunder.  For example, but without limitation, if a lien affects more than one Title Defect Property or the curative work with respect to one Title Defect results (or is reasonably expected to result) in the curing of any other Title Defect affecting the same or another Title Defect Property, the amount necessary to discharge such lien or the cost and expense of such curative work shall only be included in the Title Defect Amount for one Title Defect Property and only once in such Title Defect Amount.
(I)
If a Title Defect affects only a portion of a Subject Property (as contrasted with an undivided interest in the entirety of such Subject Property) and an Allocated Value has not been assigned specifically to such portion of a Subject Property, then for purposes of computing the Title Defect Amount, the portion of the Purchase Price allocated to such Subject Property shall be further allocated among the portions of such Subject Property as reasonably determined by Sellers (acting through WDP) and Purchaser.
(J)
The Title Defect Amount attributable to a Title Defect Property or any portion thereof shall not exceed the portion of the Purchase Price allocated to such Title Defect Property.  For example, but without limitation, if Sellers do not own fifty percent (50%) of the NRI specified on for a Title Defect Property and such unowned fifty percent (50%) interest is also burdened by a lien, the Title Defect Amount for such Title Defect Property shall not exceed the portion of the Purchase Price allocable to such fifty percent (50%) interest notwithstanding that it may be affected by multiple Title Defects.

Exhibit 99.1.
SALT LAKE CITY  Questar Corporation (NYSE:STR) today announced that subsidiary Questar Exploration and Production Company (Questar E&P) has closed the previously announced purchase of two significant natural gas development properties in northwest Louisiana, for an aggregate adjusted purchase price of $659 million, subject to customary post-close adjustments. The properties are located in Red River and Bienville Parishes, approximately 10 miles south and east of Questar E&P's existing Elm Grove Field operations.
Questar also revised 2008 earnings and production guidance and underlying assumptions to incorporate the newly acquired properties, the recent increase in natural gas and crude oil prices, and additional natural gas fixed-price hedges.
Revised Earnings Guidance and Assumptions
Questar E&P has now hedged about 78% of forecast natural gas and oil-equivalent production for the remainder of 2008 with fixed-price swaps. Additionally, the company has hedged about 2% of its forecast natural gas production for the remainder of 2008 with basis-only swaps (see table at the end of this release).
The company estimates that a $1.00 per MMBtu change in the average NYMEX price of natural gas for the remainder of 2008 would result in about a $0.02 change in earnings per diluted share.
A $10.00 per bbl change in the average NYMEX price of oil for the remainder of 2008 would result in about a $0.05 change in earnings per diluted share.
"We're now in a position to grow Questar E&P production 14 to 16% in 2008", said Chuck Stanley,  Questar COO and head of the company's exploration and production businesses. "We've also taken advantage of the recent jump in natural gas prices to hedge additional Questar E&P production to lock in attractive returns on invested capital and cash flows, both from the newly acquired properties and from our existing assets."  The company has added 11 Bcf of natural gas fixed-price swaps for the remainder of 2008, 28.1 Bcf for 2009, and 28.4 Bcf for 2010 since it last disclosed hedge positions on February 12, 2008 (See table at end of this release for a detailed summary of current hedge positions).
About Questar
Questar Corp. (NYSE:STR) is a natural gas-focused energy company with an enterprise value of about $11 billion. Questar finds, develops, produces, gathers, processes, transports, stores and distributes natural gas.
