THIS TIME-BASED RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is made effective as of July 1, 2010 (the "Grant Date"), between QEP Resources, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and Keith O. Rattie (the "Grantee").
WHEREAS, the Grantee currently serves as a non-employee director (a "Director") on the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board");
WHEREAS, the Company has established the QEP Resources, Inc., 2010 Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan (the "Plan");

WHEREAS, Section 11(c) of the Plan provides for the issuance of dividend equivalents (payable on a current or deferred basis) in the discretion of the Compensation Committee of the Board (the "Committee");
WHEREAS, the Committee has determined that it would be to the advantage and in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders to grant to the Grantee the Restricted Stock Units and dividend equivalents awards for ordinary quarterly cash dividends as provided for herein as an inducement to the Grantee to remain in the service of the Company as a Director, and has advised the Company thereof and instructed the undersigned officer to issue said Restricted Stock Units and dividend equivalents awards;
WHEREAS, all capitalized terms used herein without definition shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in this Agreement, or, if not defined herein, in the Plan; and
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants herein contained and for other good and valuable consideration, receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto do hereby agree as follows:
Section 1.1
Awards of Restricted Stock Units and Dividend Equivalents
(a)
For good and valuable consideration, on the Grant Date the Company hereby grants to the Grantee Restricted Stock Units for [] shares of Common Stock upon the terms and conditions
1,000,000 divided by the fair market value of QEP stock on the Grant Date
set forth in this Agreement.  Each Restricted Stock Unit represents the right to receive one share of Common Stock at the times and subject to the conditions set forth herein.
(b)
Pursuant to Section 5(d) of the Plan, the Company agrees to make proportionate adjustments to the number of outstanding Restricted Stock Units (including, without limitation, Restricted Stock Units issued in connection with the deemed reinvestment of dividend equivalents) as provided in Section 5(d) of the Plan, it being understood that any such adjustment to the number of outstanding Restricted Stock Units shall be made with respect to any particular outstanding Restricted Stock Unit until such time as such Restricted Stock Unit expires, is forfeited or is actually distributed in shares of Common Stock hereunder.
(c)
Pursuant to Section 11(c) of the Plan, the Company hereby grants to the Grantee a dividend equivalent award with respect to each Restricted Stock Unit granted pursuant to this Agreement for all ordinary quarterly cash dividends which are paid to all or substantially all holders of the outstanding shares of Common Stock between the Grant Date and the date when the Restricted Stock Unit is distributed or paid to the Grantee or forfeited or expires ("Dividend Equivalents").  The Dividend Equivalents award for each Restricted Stock Unit shall be equal to the amount of cash which is paid as a dividend on one share of Common Stock.  All such Dividend Equivalents shall be credited to the Grantee and be deemed to be reinvested in additional Restricted Stock Units as of the date of payment of any such dividend based on the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on such date.  Each addi tional Restricted Stock Unit which results from such deemed reinvestment of Dividend Equivalents granted hereunder shall be subject to the same vesting, distribution or payment, adjustment and other provisions which apply to the underlying Restricted Stock Unit to which such additional Restricted Stock Unit relates.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary anywhere else in this Agreement, the Restricted Stock Units and Dividend Equivalents awards granted under this Agreement are subject to the terms, definitions and provisions of this Agreement and the Plan, which is incorporated herein by reference; , , that in the event of any conflict between the provisions of this Agreement and those of the Plan, the provisions of this Agreement shall control.

The Grantee understands and agrees that the restrictions imposed in these covenants represent a fair balance of the Company's rights to protect its business and the Grantee's right to pursue employment.
(b)
The Grantee shall not, during the period beginning on the Grant Date and ending on the date three (3) years following the Grant Date (the "Non-Compete Period"), directly or indirectly engage in, have any equity interest in, or manage or operate any person, firm, corporation, partnership or business (whether as a director, officer, employee, agent, representative, partner, security holder, consultant or otherwise) that engages in any business which competes with any Business (as defined below) of the Company or any of its affiliates anywhere in the world where the Company conducts Business during the Non-Compete Period; , , that the Grantee shall be permitted to acquire a passive debt or equity interest in such a business provided such business has a class of publicly-traded securities and the securities directly or indirectly beneficially owned by the Grantee do not re present more than three percent (3%) of the outstanding interest in such business; , , that the Grantee shall be permitted to serve as a director on the Board of Directors of Questar Corporation.

(d)
In the event any term of this Section 2.6 shall be determined by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable by reason of its extending for too great a period of time or over too great a geographical area or by reason of its being too extensive in any other respect, it will be interpreted to extend only over the maximum period of time for which it may be enforceable, over the maximum geographical area as to which it may be enforceable, or to the maximum extent in all other respects as to which it may be enforceable, all as determined by such court in such action.

provided
however
(a)
The admission of such shares to listing on all stock exchanges on which such class of stock is then listed;

Section 3.8
Governing Law
This Agreement shall be administered, interpreted and enforced under the internal laws of the State of Delaware without regard to conflicts of laws thereof.
Section 3.9
Unfunded, Unsecured Obligations

The interest of the Grantee or any other person hereunder shall be limited to the right to receive the benefits as set forth herein.  To the extent that the Grantee or any other person acquires a right to receive benefits under the Plan or this Agreement, such rights shall be no greater than the right of an unsecured general creditor of the Company.
