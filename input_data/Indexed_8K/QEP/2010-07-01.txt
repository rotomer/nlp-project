Questar
The Amendment, among other things, amends the applicable margin for LIBOR and base rate borrowings; modifies the definition of change of control; and amends the Company's financial covenants, by adding a leverage ratio covenant and maximum permitted debt covenant.
In connection with the Amendment, the aggregate commitments of the Lenders were also increased from $800 million to $1.0 billion.
The foregoing description of the Amendment does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Amendment, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 hereto and incorporated by reference herein.

The Term Loan Agreement matures 364 days after the initial funding date, which may be extended by the Company for an additional 364-day term. The aggregate commitment of the Term Lenders is $500 million which amount will be automatically reduced by an amount equal to the unused portion of the commitment not utilized by the Company on the initial funding date.
Term Loan Agreement
Term Lenders
Interest accrues on loans under the Term Loan Agreement at a LIBOR rate or a base rate, as selected by the Company, plus an applicable margin. Proceeds of borrowings under the Term Loan Agreement must be used solely to fund the purchase price for any of the Company's outstanding senior notes that are properly tendered pursuant to a change of control offer made by the Company after the Spin-off.
The Term Loan Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, covenants and events of default, including, but not limited to, a (i) total consolidated funded debt to capitalization ratio, (ii) leverage ratio, (iii) maximum allowable debt covenant, and (iv) change of control event of default. During the continuance of an event of default, the Term Lenders may accelerate all outstanding debt and terminate all lending and letter of credit commitments.
The foregoing description of the Term Loan Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Term Loan Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 10.2 hereto and incorporated by reference herein.
In connection with the completion of the Spin-off on June 30, 2010, the Company distributed 100% of the outstanding stock of its wholly-owned subsidiary, Wexpro Company (""), to Questar in accordance with the terms of the separation and distribution agreement entered into on June 14, 2010 by the Company and Questar. Wexpro develops and produces natural gas and oil for Questar Gas Company (a wholly-owned subsidiary of Questar) under the terms of a long-standing agreement with the states of Utah and Wyoming.
Wexpro
Following the Company's completion of the Spin-off, the Company will no longer consolidate Wexpro's financial results, and the historical financial results of Wexpro will be reflected in the Company's consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations. The unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information of the Company (reflecting the distribution of Wexpro) has been previously filed as Exhibit 99.2 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 16, 2010.
 
The information described above under "Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement" is incorporated herein by reference. No borrowings were made on the closing date under the Term Loan Agreement and no new borrowings were made on the closing date under the Amendment.
 
On June 30, 2010, the Company entered into a Preferred Stock Purchase Rights Plan (the "").
Rights Plan
In connection with the Rights Plan, the Board of Directors of the Company declared a dividend of one preferred stock purchase right (individually, a "" and collectively, the "") for each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the ""), of the Company outstanding at the close of business on July 1, 2010 (the ""). Each Right will entitle the registered holder thereof, after the Rights become exercisable and until June 30, 2013 (or the earlier redemption, exchange or termination of the Rights), to purchase from the Company one one-thousandth (1/1,000

) of a share of Preferred Stock, subject to certain anti-dilution adjustments (the ""). Until the earlier to occur of (i) the tenth business day following a public announcement that a person or group of affiliated or associated persons or any person acting in concert therewith has acquired, or obtained the right to acquire, beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the Common Stock (including, without duplication, the number of shares that are synthetically owned pursuant to derivative transactions or ownership of derivative securities, if such person or group owns 5% or more of the Common Stock) (an "") or (ii) the tenth business day (or such later date as may be determined by action of the Board of Directors prior to such time as any person or group of affiliated or associated persons or any person acting in concert therewith becomes an Acquiring Person) following the commencement or announcement of an intention to make a tender offer or exchange offer the consummation of which would result in the beneficial ownership by a person or group of affiliated or associated persons of 15% or more of the Common Stock (the earlier of (i) and (ii) being called the ""), the Rights will be evidenced, with respect to any of the Common Stock certificates outstanding as of the Record Date, by such Common Stock certificates (or, with respect to any shares of Common Stock held in book entry form, by the notation in book entry).
Purchase Price
Acquiring Person
Distribution Date
The Rights will be transferred only with the Common Stock until the Distribution Date or earlier redemption, exchange, termination or expiration of the Rights. As soon as practicable following the Distribution Date, separate certificates evidencing the Rights ("") will be mailed to holders of record of the Common Stock as of the close of business on the Distribution Date and such separate Right Certificates alone will evidence the Rights. The Rights will at no time have any voting rights.
Right Certificates
Each share of Preferred Stock purchasable upon exercise of the Rights will be entitled, when, as and if declared, to a minimum preferential quarterly dividend payment equal to the greater of (a) $1.00 per share or (b) 1,000 times the dividend, if any, declared per share of Common Stock. In the event of liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, the holders of the Preferred Stock will be entitled to a preferential liquidation payment equal to $1,000 per share plus any accrued but unpaid dividends, provided that the holders of the Preferred Stock shall be entitled to 1,000 times the payment made per share of Common Stock. Each share of Preferred Stock will have 1,000 votes and will vote together with the Common Stock. Finally, in the event of any merger, consolidation or other transaction in which the Common Stock is exchanged, each share of Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive 1,000 times the amount received per share of Common Stock. The Preferred Stock will not be redeemable. The Rights are protected by customary anti-dilution provisions. Because of the nature of the Preferred Stock's dividend, liquidation and voting rights, the value of one one-thousandth of a share of Preferred Stock purchasable upon exercise of each Right should approximate the value of one share of Common Stock.
In the event that a person becomes an Acquiring Person or if the Company were the surviving corporation in a merger with an Acquiring Person or any affiliate or associate of or any person acting in concert with an Acquiring Person and the shares of Common Stock were not changed or exchanged, each holder of a Right, other than Rights that are or were acquired or beneficially owned by the Acquiring Person (which Rights will thereafter be void), will thereafter have the right to receive upon exercise that number of shares of Common Stock having a market value of two times the then current Purchase Price of one Right. In the event that, after a person has become an Acquiring Person, the Company were acquired in a merger or other business combination transaction or more than 50% of its assets or earning power were sold, proper provision shall be made so that each holder of a Right shall thereafter have the right to receive, upon the exercise thereof at the then current Purchase Price of the Right, that number of shares of common stock of the acquiring company which at the time of such transaction would have a market value of two times the then current Purchase Price of one Right.
At any time after a person becomes an Acquiring Person and prior to the earlier of one of the events described in the last sentence in the previous paragraph or the acquisition by such Acquiring Person of 50% or more of the then outstanding Common Stock, the Board of Directors may cause the Company to exchange the Rights (other than Rights owned by an Acquiring Person which have become void), in whole or in part, for that number of shares of Common Stock having an aggregate value equal to the Spread (the excess of the value of the Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of a Right over the Purchase Price) per Right (subject to adjustment).
The Rights may be redeemed in whole, but not in part, at a price of $0.01 per Right (the "") by the Board of Directors at any time prior to the time that an Acquiring Person has become such. The redemption of the Rights may be made effective at such time, on such basis and with such conditions as the Board of Directors in its sole discretion may establish. Immediately upon any redemption of the Rights, the right to exercise the Rights will terminate and the only right of the holders of Rights will be to receive the Redemption Price.
Redemption Price
The Rights will expire on June 30, 2013 (unless earlier redeemed, exchanged or terminated). Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. is the Rights Agent.
The Purchase Price payable, and the number of one one-thousandths of a share of Preferred Stock or other securities or property issuable, upon exercise of the Rights are subject to adjustment from time to time to prevent dilution (i) in the event of a stock dividend on, or a subdivision, combination or
reclassification of, the Preferred Stock, (ii) upon the grant to holders of the Preferred Stock of certain rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase Preferred Stock or convertible securities at less than the current market price of the Preferred Stock or (iii) upon the distribution to holders of the Preferred Stock of evidences of indebtedness, cash, securities or assets (excluding regular periodic cash dividends at a rate not in excess of 125% of the rate of the last regular periodic cash dividend theretofore paid or, in case regular periodic cash dividends have not theretofore been paid, at a rate not in excess of 50% of the average net income per share of the Company for the four quarters ended immediately prior to the payment of such dividend, or dividends payable in shares of Preferred Stock (which dividends will be subject to the adjustment described in clause (i) above)) or of subscription rights or warrants (other than those referred to above).
Until a Right is exercised, the holder thereof, as such, will have no rights as a shareholder of the Company beyond those as an existing shareholder, including, without limitation, the right to vote or to receive dividends.
Any of the provisions of the Rights Agreement, dated as of June 30, 2010, between the Company and the Rights Agent (the ""), may be amended by the Board of Directors of the Company for so long as the Rights are then redeemable, and after the Rights are no longer redeemable, the Company may amend or supplement the Rights Agreement in any manner that does not adversely affect the interests of the holders of the Rights.
Rights Agreement
One Right will be distributed to shareholders of the Company for each share of Common Stock owned of record by them on at the close of business on July 1, 2010. As long as the Rights are attached to the Common Stock, the Company will issue one Right with each new share of Common Stock so that all such shares will have attached Rights. The Company has agreed that, from and after the Distribution Date, the Company will reserve 500,000 shares of Preferred Stock initially for issuance upon exercise of the Rights.
The Rights are designed to assure that all of the Company's shareholders receive fair and equal treatment in the event of any proposed takeover of the Company and to guard against partial tender offers, open market accumulations and other abusive or coercive tactics to gain control of the Company without paying all shareholders a control premium. The Rights will cause substantial dilution to a person or group that acquires 15% or more of the Company's stock on terms not approved by the Company's Board of Directors. The Rights should not interfere with any merger or other business combination approved by the Board of Directors at any time prior to the first date that a person or group has become an Acquiring Person.
The Rights Agreement specifying the terms of the Rights is incorporated herein by reference as an exhibit to this Current Report. The foregoing description of the Rights does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Rights Agreement, which has been previously filed as Exhibit 1. to the Company's registration statement on Form 8-A filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 30, 2010.

(b) If any payment to be made by the Borrower shall come due on a day other than a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next following Business Day, and such extension of time shall be reflected in computing interest or fees, as the case may be.
(c) (i) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to 12:00 noon on the proposed date of the Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with and at the time required by and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (A) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the Federal Funds Rate plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Administrative Agent in connection with the foregoing, and (B) in the case of a payment to be made by the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to Base Rate Loans.

promptly remit to the Borrower the amount of such interest paid by the Borrower for such period. If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Borrowing to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender's Loan included in such Borrowing. Any payment by the Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent.
(ii) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender, in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate.
A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or the Borrower with respect to any amount owing under this subsection (c) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.
(d) If any Lender makes available to the Administrative Agent funds for the Loan to be made by such Lender as provided in the foregoing provisions of this , and such funds are not made available to the Borrower by the Administrative Agent because the conditions set forth in are not satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof, the Administrative Agent shall return such funds (in like funds as received from such Lender) to such Lender, without interest.

provided
. If any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund on the Funding Date the Loan, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the LIBO Rate, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent, any obligation of such Lender to continue LIBO Rate Loans or to convert Base Rate Loans to LIBO Rate Loans shall be suspended until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all LIBO Rate Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans, either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such LIBO Rate Loan to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such LIBO Rate Loan. Upon any such prepayment the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid. Each Lender agrees to designate a different Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for such notice and will not, in the good faith judgment of such Lender, otherwise be materially disadvantageous to such Lender.
3.02 Illegality
3.03 Inability to Determine Rates
If the Required Lenders determine that for any reason adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the LIBO Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed LIBO Rate Loan, or that the LIBO Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed LIBO Rate Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and each Lender. Thereafter, the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain LIBO Rate Loans shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent (upon the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a conversion to or continuation of LIBO Rate Loans.
3.04 Increased Cost and Reduced Return; Capital Adequacy; Reserves on Loans.
(a) If any Lender determines that as a result of the introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation of any Law, or such Lender's compliance therewith, there shall be any increase in the cost to such Lender of maintaining LIBO Rate Loans or a reduction in the amount received or receivable by such Lender in connection with the foregoing (excluding for purposes of this subsection (a) any such increased costs or reduction in amount resulting from (i) Taxes or Other Taxes (as to which shall govern), (ii) changes in the basis of taxation of overall net income or overall gross income by the United States or any foreign jurisdiction or any political subdivision of either thereof under the Laws of which such Lender is organized or has its Lending Office, and (iii) reserve requirements contemplated by ), then from time to time upon demand of such Lender (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent), the Borrower shall pay to such Lender such additional amounts as will compensate such Lender for such increased cost or reduction.
Section 3.01
Section 3.04(c)
(b) If any Lender determines that the introduction of any Law regarding capital adequacy or any change therein or in the interpretation thereof, or compliance by such Lender (or its Lending Office) therewith, has the effect of reducing the rate of return on the capital of such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender as a consequence of such Lender's obligations hereunder (taking into consideration its policies with respect to capital
 
adequacy and such Lender's desired return on capital), then from time to time upon demand of such Lender (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent), the Borrower shall pay to such Lender such additional amounts as will compensate such Lender for such reduction.
(c) The Borrower shall pay to each Lender, as long as such Lender shall be required to maintain reserves with respect to liabilities or assets consisting of or including Eurocurrency funds or deposits (currently known as "Eurocurrency liabilities"), additional interest on the unpaid principal amount of each LIBO Rate Loan equal to the actual costs of such reserves allocated to such Loan by such Lender (as determined by such Lender in good faith, which determination shall be conclusive), which shall be due and payable on each date on which interest is payable on such Loan; the Borrower shall have received at least 15 days' prior notice (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of such additional interest from such Lender. If a Lender fails to give notice 15 days prior to the relevant Interest Payment Date, such additional interest shall be due and payable 15 days from receipt of such notice.
provided
. Upon demand of any Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) from time to time, the Borrower shall promptly compensate such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense incurred by it as a result of:
3.05 Compensation for Losses
(a) any continuation, payment or prepayment of any Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise); or
(b) any failure by the Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to make a Loan) to prepay or continue any Loan on the date or in the amount notified by the Borrower; or
(c) any assignment of a LIBO Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to ;
Section 10.15
including any loss of anticipated profits and any loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such Loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained. The Borrower shall also pay any customary administrative fees charged by such Lender in connection with the foregoing.
For purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Borrower to the Lenders under this each Lender shall be deemed to have funded each LIBO Rate Loan made by it at the LIBO Rate for such Loan by a matching deposit or other borrowing in the London interbank eurodollar market for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such LIBO Rate Loan was in fact so funded.
