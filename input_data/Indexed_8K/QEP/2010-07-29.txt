DENVER  (PR NEWSWIRE), July 27, 2010 -QEP Resources (NYSE:QEP) reported second quarter 2010 production of 53.7 Bcfe compared to 43.4 Bcfe for the 2009 period, a 24% increase.  QEP second quarter 2010 continuing EBITDA (a non-GAAP measure) was $276.0 million, compared to $272.2 million a year earlier, a 1% increase in spite of a 28% decrease in net realized natural gas prices.  Net income from continuing operations increased 53% in the 2nd quarter of 2010 to $68.8 million or $0.39 per diluted share, compared to $44.9 million or $0.26 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2009.  Excluding changes in unrealized gains and losses on natural gas basis-only swaps, gains and losses on non-core asset sales and, certain separation costs related to the spin-off of QEP Resources from Questar Corporation, QEP Resources net income from continuing operations was $58.7 million or $0.33 per diluted share fo r the current quarter compared to $62.6 million or $0.36 per diluted share in the prior-year period.  
QEP Resources (formerly Questar Market Resources) completed its tax-free spin-off from Questar on June 30, 2010.  In conjunction with the spin-off, QEP Resources distributed the common stock of its wholly-owned subsidiary, Wexpro Company, to Questar.  Accordingly, Wexpro's financial results have been presented as discontinued operations in this release.  QEP Resources' principal subsidiaries are QEP Energy Company (formerly Questar Exploration and Production), QEP Field Services Company (formerly Questar Gas Management) and QEP Marketing Company (formerly Questar Energy Trading).

(a)
Net income represents amounts attributable to QEP Resources after deducting non-controlling interest.
"The QEP Resources team continued to execute well in the second quarter," said Chuck Stanley, President and CEO.  "QEP Energy delivered 24% year-over-year production growth, driven by strong results from ongoing Haynesville Shale and Pinedale Anticline development activities, combined with significant contributions from new wells in our Woodford Shale, Granite Wash and Bakken plays.  We are well-positioned to deliver at least 15% year-over-year production growth in 2010.  QEP Field Services also had a good quarter.  Field Services gathering and processing businesses benefitted from growing production at QEP Energy and our third-party customers, and from strong frac-spread margins," Stanley added.  
Second Quarter 2010 Highlights
QEP Energy grew natural gas, oil and NGL production 24% to 53.7 billion cubic feet of natural gas equivalent (Bcfe) compared to 43.4 Bcfe for the 2009 quarter.  Natural gas comprised 89% of reported production volumes.  Second quarter 2010 production was up 4% from first-quarter 2010 volumes.  
QEP Energy second quarter 2010 EBITDA decreased 5% compared to 2009, driven by a 28% decrease in net realized natural gas prices, mostly offset by a 24% increase in production and higher realized oil and natural gas liquids (NGL) prices.  Net natural gas revenues (including the settlement of all natural gas-related derivative contracts) represented 81% of QEP Energy net realized production revenues in the second quarter of 2010.  Net realized natural gas prices at QEP Energy averaged $4.87 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf), down 28% compared to second quarter 2009.  While field-level natural gas prices were higher in the second quarter of 2010, net proceeds from settlement of natural gas-related derivatives were significantly lower than in the 2009 quarter.  Field-level natural gas prices in the second quarter of 2010 were $3.40 per Mcf compared to $2.43 per Mcf i n 2009, a 40% increase.  Natural gas-related derivative settlements increased net revenues $70.1 million in the second quarter of 2010 compared to $166.7 million in the 2009 quarter.
Net realized crude oil and NGL prices averaged $55.87 per barrel, up 26% from the year-ago quarter.  Field-level prices increased 35% to $57.75 per barrel.  Oil hedge settlements reduced revenues $1.8 million compared to a $1.3 million increase in revenues in the second quarter of 2009.
Changes in unrealized gains and losses on natural gas basis-only swaps increased net income $17.2 million in the 2010 quarter compared to a loss of $17.5 million in the year-earlier period.
Production volume-weighted per-unit depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) expense at QEP Energy decreased to $2.59 per Mcfe, compared to $3.07 per Mcfe in second quarter 2009.  The 2009 quarterly rate was impacted by negative price related reserve adjustments.  The 2010 quarterly rate was positively impacted by reserve additions and higher production volumes.  The current quarter rate decreased $0.03 compared to the first-quarter 2010.
QEP Field Services EBITDA increased 46% to $52.1 million in the second quarter of 2010 compared to $35.7 million a year ago, driven by increased gathering and processing margins.  Net income increased to $24.3 million in the second quarter of 2010 compared to $14.5 million in the 2009 quarter, a 68% increase.  Gathering margin increased 29% to $37.6 million and processing margin increased 59% to $22.2 million.  
QEP Resources provides 2010 EBITDA guidance; QEP Energy 2010 production guidance
QEP Resources expects that 2010 continuing EBITDA could range from $1.025 to $1.075 billion while QEP Energy 2010 EBITDA could range from $850 to $900 million based on QEP Energy 2010 production guidance of 218 to 222 Bcfe.
The company's guidance assumes hedges in place on the date of this release.  Other assumptions are summarized in the table below:
For remainder of 2010 unhedged volumes
                       (a)
QEP Energy has hedged about 69% of forecast natural gas and oil-equivalent production for the remainder of 2010 with fixed-price swaps and 5% with collars.  (See table at the end of this release).
QEP Energy Second Quarter Production Up 24%; EBITDA Down on Lower Realized Prices
QEP Energy  a QEP Resources subsidiary that acquires, explores for, develops and produces natural gas and oil  reported production of 53.7 Bcfe in the second quarter of 2010 compared to 43.4 Bcfe in the 2009 quarter, a 24% increase.  The Midcontinent region contributed 51% of QEP Energy production for the second quarter of 2010 compared to 46% in the 2009 quarter.  Second quarter QEP Energy 2010 EBITDA was $222.4 million compared to $234.9 million in the 2009 quarter.  The reduction in current-year EBITDA was primarily the result of a 28% decrease in net realized natural gas prices.  The impact of lower net realized gas prices was mostly offset by a 24% increase in natural gas-equivalent production and higher realized oil and NGL prices.
QEP Energy average total costs per unit of gas-equivalent production decreased 14% compared to the second quarter of 2009, due primarily to reduced depreciation, depletion and amortization expense and reduced lease operating expense.
Production volume-weighted average depreciation, depletion and amortization per Mcfe (the DD&A rate) decreased compared to the second quarter of 2009.  The 2009 quarterly rate was unusually high as the result of negative price related reserve adjustments.
QEP Energy cash cost of production  lease operating expense plus general and administrative expense, allocated interest, and production taxes was $1.58 per Mcfe, compared to $1.79 per Mcfe in the second quarter of 2009.
Lease operating expense per Mcfe in the current periods decreased as the result of increased production combined with lower operating expense.  Growing production from new high-rate, low-operating cost wells in NW Louisiana and declining production from higher cost areas is lowering average lease operating expense.
Production taxes per Mcfe increased in the current periods as the result of higher field-level prices.
QEP Field Services EBITDA and Net Income up in Second Quarter 2010
QEP Field Services (Field Services)  a QEP subsidiary that provides gas gathering and processing services  reported EBITDA of $52.1 million in the second quarter of 2010 compared to $35.7 million in the year-ago period, a 46% increase.  Net income was $24.3 million in the second quarter of 2010 compared to $14.5 million in the 2009 quarter, a 68% increase.  The increases were primarily due to increased gathering and processing margins.
Gathering margin increased 29%, or $8.5 million, in the second quarter of 2010, driven primarily by a 10% increase in total throughput volume to 1.25 million MMBtu per day.
Processing margin increased 59%, or $8.2 million, driven by 66% higher keep-whole processing margins as the result of 46% higher average NGL prices and a 36% increase in fee-based gas-processing volume.
Approximately 77% of Field Services' second quarter 2010 net operating revenue was derived from fee-based contracts, compared to 82% in the 2009 quarter.  The reduced percentage of fee-based revenues in the 2010 quarter reflects a significant improvement in keep-whole processing margins compared to the year-earlier period.  
Second Quarter 2010 Earnings Teleconference
QEP Resources management will discuss second quarter 2010 results and the outlook for the remainder of the year in a conference call with investors Wednesday, July 28, beginning at 11:00 a.m. EDT.  The call can be accessed at www.qepres.com.

This update precedes the release of the company's second quarter financial results which will be issued after the market close on July 27, 2010.  QEP will also hold a conference call at 11AM EDT on July 28, 2010 to discuss second quarter 2010 results.  The conference call can be heard live at QEP Resources website, www.qepres.com.

Second quarter 2010 production 53.7 Bcfe, up 24% from 2009
QEP Resources exploration and production subsidiary QEP Energy reported net production of 53.7 Bcfe in the second quarter of 2010 compared to 43.4 Bcfe in the 2009 quarter, a 24% increase and up 4% from first quarter 2010.  Natural gas comprised 89% of second quarter 2010 equivalent production.  QEP Energy estimated that it exited the second quarter with a net production rate of approximately 655 MMcfed.  Production growth was driven by strong results from core Haynesville and Pinedale assets combined with increased contribution from new wells in the emerging Woodford "Cana" Shale and Granite Wash plays in the Midcontinent and the Bakken oil play in North Dakota.  
"Our asset management teams continued to deliver low-cost production growth in the second quarter" said Chuck Stanley, QEP Resources President and CEO.  "Note that 51% of QEP Energy second quarter 2010 production came from the Midcontinent region, driven by strong performance from our Haynesville and Woodford Cana' shale plays.  Our teams continue their relentless focus on driving down both drilling and completion times in our core resource plays  in a safe and environmentally responsible manner  which translates directly into lower completed well costs " Stanley added.  
QEP Energy raises 2010 production forecast to 218-222 Bcfe
The company now estimates 2010 net production could range from 218 to 222 Bcfe, up 15 to 17% from 2009 production of 189.5 Bcfe.  Prior guidance was 212 to 217 Bcfe.  
Continued strong results from the Haynesville Shale in NW Louisiana
Since the last operations update, QEP Energy has completed and turned to sales 11 additional operated Haynesville wells, each with strong rates and pressures:
*Beginning with the Weyerhaeuser 10H-1 in November 2009, the company modified initial flowback procedures to minimize pressure drawdown at the reservoir; therefore, peak daily rates are not comparable to earlier QEP Energy well results.  Modified flowback wells will typically maintain a flat production profile for the first 4-9 months and then decline.  
** The Conly SR 34H production rate is restricted due to coiled tubing that is stuck in the lateral.
QEP Energy currently has 11 operated wells waiting on completion and 7 operated wells being drilled in the Haynesville play.  The company also participated in 15 outside-operated Haynesville wells that were completed and turned to sales during the second quarter.  Working interest in these wells ranged from 1% to 31%.  QEP Energy also has interests in 11 outside-operated Haynesville wells that are waiting on completion or completing and 2 outside-operated wells currently being drilled.  At June 30, 2010, the company's total operated and non-operated net Haynesville production was 178 MMcfd, and net Cotton Valley/Hosston production totaled 66 MMcfd.  The company has 7 rigs currently operating in the play.
Maps showing QEP Energy Haynesville leasehold and current activity, along with similar maps for other key operating areas discussed in this release can be found on the company's website at www.qepres.com.
Pinedale production growth continues
Since the last update, the company has completed and turned to sales 35 new wells at Pinedale, for a total of 56 to date in 2010.  Improved drilling performance has translated directly into lower well costs with year-to-date 2010 drill times averaging 16.9 days from spud to total drilling depth resulting in average gross completed well costs of under $3.8 million for 2010.  The company expects to complete over 100 wells this year on its Pinedale acreage.  QEP Energy's net Pinedale production was approximately 191 MMcfed on June 30, 2010.  The company has up to 1,400 remaining locations at Pinedale.  
Production from liquids-rich Anadarko Basin Woodford "Cana" Shale play continues to grow
Since the last operational update, QEP Energy completed and turned to sales 1 new operated Woodford "Cana" Shale well in western Oklahoma.  
QEP Energy has 2 operated wells currently being drilled and 1 operated well waiting on completion in the play.  The company currently operates 9 producing wells and has non-operated working interests in over 70 producing wells.  The company also has interests in 7 wells that are currently being drilled and 11 wells that are waiting on completion that are operated by others.  The areal extent of the play appears to be expanding as additional economic wells are being completed outside the original "core" area.  The company's leasehold includes 42,000 net acres in "Tier I" and 24,000 net acres in "Tier II" (see map of Cana Shale acreage on slides accompanying this release for more detail).  On June 30, 2010, QEP Energy net production from the play was approximately 29 MMcfed.  The company participated in an 80-acre density pilot development program that will assist in determining the appropriate well density for optimal reserve recovery.  For the remainder of 2010, QEP Energy anticipates operating up to 2 rigs in the play and will participate in numerous outside-operated wells.
Recent results confirm Granite Wash and Atoka Wash horizontal development potential on QEP acreage in the Texas Panhandle
Since the last update, the company has completed and turned to sales 3 additional QEP Energy operated horizontal wells in Wheeler County, TX:
QEP Energy has 26,540 net acres in the "Wash" plays in the western Anadarko Basin.  At June 30, 2010, net production from the play (combined vertical and horizontal wells) was approximately 34 MMcfed.  The company is currently drilling 2 wells and has 1 well currently completing.  QEP Energy is also participating in 2 outside-operated wells currently being drilled in the play.  The company currently has a working interest in a total of 12 producing horizontal wells in the play and anticipates operating 2 drilling rigs through year-end.
Bakken production growth on company's 89,000 net-acre North Dakota leasehold
QEP Energy has completed and turned to sales 3 additional operated Bakken wells since the last operations update:
QEP Energy has 1 company-operated well currently being drilled and 2 wells waiting on completion.  The company also has interests in 2 outside-operated wells currently being drilled and 7 outside-operated wells completing or waiting on completion.  The company operates 6 producing wells in the play and has a working interest in 36 wells that are operated by others.  On June 30, 2010, QEP Energy's net production from the Bakken play was approximately 1,650 Boepd. The company is currently operating 1 rig in the Bakken play and anticipates adding a second rig in the fourth quarter of 2010.
Second quarter QEP Field Services gathering volumes up 10%; processing volumes up 36%; major projects underway in the Rockies and NW Louisiana
QEP Field Services gathering volumes totaled 114.2 million MMBtu in the second quarter of 2010 compared to 104.1 million MMBtu in the 2009 quarter, a 10% increase.  Fee-based processing volumes totaled 57.1 million MMBtu in the second quarter of 2010 compared to 42.1 million MMBtu in the 2009 quarter, a 36% increase.
QEP Field Services has commenced construction of 2 new cryogenic gas processing plants in the Rocky Mountain region.  In eastern Utah, the 150 MMcfd Iron Horse plant should be operational in the fourth quarter of 2010.  Foundation and other civil work has commenced on the 420 MMcfd Blacks Forks II plant in southwest Wyoming.  When complete, Blacks Fork II will extract an incremental 15,000 bbl per day of NGL net to QEP Field Services.  The plant is expected to commence operations in the fourth quarter of 2011.  In NW Louisiana, construction is underway on the company's 1,000 GPM amine treatment facility.  The facility, located near Hall Summit in QEP Energy's Woodardville Field, is designed to treat approximately 350 MMcfd of raw gas to remove carbon dioxide.  When the facility comes on line late in the fourth quarter of 2010, it will bring Field Services raw gas treating capacity in NW Louisiana to over 600 MMcfd.  &nb sp;
