DENVER  QEP Resources (NYSE:QEP) reported third quarter 2010 production of 61.7 Bcfe compared to 43.8 Bcfe for the 2009 period, a 41% increase. Production volumes in the 2009 quarter were impacted by price-related production curtailments. Accounting for the curtailments, QEP production was up approximately 20% in the third quarter of 2010 compared to the prior year quarter. QEP third quarter 2010 continuing EBITDA (a non-GAAP measure) was $297.5 million, compared to $285.3 million a year earlier, a 4% increase in spite of a 28% decrease in net realized natural gas prices. Net income from continuing operations in the 3rd quarter of 2010 was $71.1 million or $0.40 per diluted share, essentially equal to the $71.4 million or $0.40 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2009. Excluding changes in unrealized gains and losses on natural gas basis-only swaps, gains and losses on non-core asset sales, separation costs and losses on early extinguishment of debt, QEP Resources net income from continuing operations was $57.2 million or $0.32 per diluted share for the current quarter compared to $78.3 million or $0.43 per diluted share in the prior-year period.
 
 
 
 
 
"The QEP Resources team continued to execute well in the third quarter," said Chuck Stanley, President and CEO. "Taking into account price-related curtailments in the third quarter of 2009, QEP Energy delivered approximately 20% year-over-year production growth, driven by strong results from ongoing Haynesville Shale and Pinedale Anticline development activities, combined with significant contributions from new wells in our Woodford Shale, Granite Wash and Bakken plays. We are well-positioned to deliver at least 15% year-over-year production growth in 2010. QEP Field Services also had a good quarter. Field Services gathering and processing businesses benefitted from growing production at QEP Energy and our third-party customers." Stanley added.

QEP Resources increases 2010 EBITDA guidance; QEP Energy 2010 production guidance
QEP Resources now expects that 2010 EBITDA from continuing operations could range from $1.075 to $1.125 billion while QEP Energy 2010 EBITDA could range from $880 to $920 million based on QEP Energy 2010 production guidance of 225 to 227 Bcfe.

Third quarter 2010 production of 61.7 Bcfe
QEP Resources exploration and production subsidiary, QEP Energy, reported net production of 61.7 Bcfe in the third quarter of 2010 compared to 43.8 Bcfe in the 2009 quarter, a 41% increase and up 15% from second quarter 2010. Crude oil and NGL's comprised 11% of third quarter 2010 equivalent production. The company exited the third quarter with net production of approximately 670 MMcfed. QEP production growth was driven by development activities in its Midcontinent plays (Haynesville, Granite Wash, and Woodford "Cana"), Pinedale, and the Bakken oil play in North Dakota.
"Our asset management teams remain focused on driving profitable growth through a returns-focused capital allocation process," said Chuck Stanley, QEP Resources President and CEO. "In spite of service cost inflation, our asset managers continued their relentless focus on efficiency, which is translating directly into industry-leading completed well costs in our core resource plays. Approximately 54% of QEP Energy third quarter 2010 production came from the Midcontinent region, driven by strong performance from our Haynesville, Woodford Cana', and Granite Wash plays," Stanley added.
QEP Energy raises 2010 production forecast to 225-227 Bcfe
The company now estimates 2010 net production could range from 225 to 227 Bcfe, up 19 to 20% from 2009 production of 189.5 Bcfe. Prior guidance was 218 to 222 Bcfe.

QEP's 49,000 net acres are in a concentrated area located in the core of the Haynesville development. Improved drilling performance has translated directly into lower well costs with year-to-date 2010 drill times for operated wells averaging 39 days from spud to total depth resulting in average gross completed well costs of under $8.8 million for 2010. QEP Energy currently has 13 operated wells waiting on completion and 7 operated wells being drilled in the Haynesville play. The company also participated in 8 outside-operated Haynesville wells that were completed and turned to sales during the third quarter. Working interest in these wells ranged from 1% to 48%.
