DENVER  QEP Resources (NYSE: QEP) reported adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP measure) of $305.8 million for the first quarter of 2011 compared to $268.5 million in the 2010 period, a 14% increase. Net realized natural gas prices were 18% lower than a year ago, but were more than offset by a 28% increase in production and higher net realized crude oil prices at QEP Energy, along with increased gathering and processing margins at QEP Field Services.
 
 
QEP Energy  a QEP Resources subsidiary that acquires, explores for, develops and produces natural gas and oil  also reported first quarter net production of 65.9 Bcfe compared to 51.5 Bcfe in the 2010 period and 62.1 Bcfe in the fourth quarter of 2010. The Midcontinent region contributed 59% of QEP Energy current year production compared to 51% in the 2010 period.
Net income from continuing operations for the first quarter was $73.2 million or $0.41 per diluted share, compared to $78.1 million or $0.44 per diluted share in the 2010 period. Excluding changes in unrealized gains and losses on natural gas basis-only swaps and gains and losses on non-core asset sales, QEP Resources adjusted net income from continuing operations (a non-GAAP measure) was $53.6 million or $0.30 per diluted share in the first quarter compared to $56.9 million or $0.32 per diluted share in the 2010 period.
 
 
"The QEP Resources team continued to execute well in the first quarter," said Chuck Stanley, President and CEO. "QEP Energy production was up 28% from the 2010 period and 6% from the fourth quarter of 2010. The production growth was driven by strong results from ongoing Haynesville Shale development activities, combined with significant contributions from new wells in our Woodford Shale, Granite Wash and Bakken plays. Our ongoing strategy to diversify away from our traditional Rockies focus also continued to bear fruit - QEP Energy grew Midcontinent production 48% in the first quarter of 2011 compared to the 2010 period, representing 59% of QEP Energy total production. QEP Field Services also had a good quarter. Field Services gathering and processing businesses benefitted from growing QEP Energy and third-party producer volumes and from strong gas-processing margins," Stanley added.
First Quarter 2011 Highlights
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
QEP Raises 2011 adjusted EBITDA and Production Guidance
QEP now expects 2011 adjusted EBITDA to range from $1,200 to $1,300 million, compared to a previously forecast range of $1,115 to $1,230 million. QEP Energy expects 2011 production should range from 263 to 267 Bcfe, compared to a previously forecast range of 258 to 265 Bcfe.
The company's guidance assumes hedge positions in place on the date of this release and other assumptions summarized in the table below:
 
 
QEP Energy has approximately 62% of forecasted natural gas production and 30% of forecasted oil production for the remainder of 2011 hedged with a combination of fixed price swaps and price collars. On a natural gas equivalent basis, the company has 55% of its forecasted production for the remainder of 2011 hedged. A table with details of the Company's hedge positions is included at the end of this release.
QEP Energy First Quarter Production Up 28%; Adjusted EBITDA Up 12%
QEP Energy increased first quarter production 28% to 65.9 Bcfe (which included a positive 1.6 Bcfe out-of-period adjustment) compared to 51.5 Bcfe in the 2010 period. The Midcontinent region contributed 59% of current year production compared to 51% in the 2010 period. QEP Energy generated adjusted EBITDA of $242.0 million in the first quarter compared to $215.4 million in the 2010 period, a 12% increase. The increase in adjusted EBITDA was primarily the result of higher production and higher net realized crude oil prices which more than offset an 18% decrease in net realized natural gas prices.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
QEP Field Services Adjusted EBITDA Up 22%; Net Income Up 21%
QEP Field Services (Field Services)  a QEP subsidiary that provides gas gathering and processing services  first quarter adjusted EBITDA increased 22% to $61.4 million compared to $50.4 million in the 2010 period. The increase was the result of higher gathering and processing margins.

First quarter 2011 production totaled 65.9 Bcfe
QEP Resources exploration and production subsidiary, QEP Energy, reported net production of 65.9 Bcfe in the first quarter of 2011 (which included a positive 1.6 Bcfe out-of-period adjustment) compared to 51.5 Bcfe in the 2010 quarter, a 28% increase, and 62.1 Bcfe in the fourth quarter of 2010, a 6% increase. Crude oil and natural gas liquids comprised 10% of the first quarter 2011 equivalent production. Production growth is being driven by development activities in the company's Midcontinent region which represented 59% of QEP Energy total volumes in the quarter. Capital investment continues in the core plays of the Haynesville Shale, Pinedale, Woodford "Cana" Shale, North Dakota Bakken, and the Granite Wash/Atoka Wash.
"QEP remains focused on profitable growth and maximizing returns on invested capital," said Chuck Stanley, QEP Resources President and CEO. "Our drilling and completion teams continue their relentless focus on reducing drilling and completion cycle-times which translate directly into industry leading completed well costs in our core producing areas. Field Services had a great quarter, with fee-based processing volumes benefitting from the successful start-up of our Iron Horse cryogenic processing plant in eastern Utah and from growing production volumes in NW Louisiana. Work is progressing rapidly on Field Service's Blacks Fork II cryogenic gas processing plant in western Wyoming, which we anticipate will be on-line in the fourth quarter of this year," Stanley added.
QEP increases 2011 production forecast to 263 - 267 Bcfe
The company now estimates 2011 net production could range from 263 to 267 Bcfe, up 15 to 17% from 2010 production of 229.0 Bcfe. Prior guidance was 258 to 265 Bcfe.
Growth continues in the Haynesville Shale of NW Louisiana
Since the last operations update, QEP has completed and turned to sales 10 additional company- operated Haynesville wells, each with strong production rates and pressures. QEP's 50,750 net acres (an increase of 1,150 net acres) are in a concentrated area located in the core of the Haynesville development. In the first quarter of 2011, QEP drill times averaged 32 days from spud to total depth on
company- operated Haynesville wells, down from 37 days in 2010. Improved drilling performance and completion efficiencies have allowed QEP to remain the lowest cost operator in its portion of the Haynesville play. QEP-operated gross completed well costs averaged $9.1 million in the first quarter of 2011 compared to $9.3 million in 2010. QEP currently has 14 operated wells waiting on completion and 6 operated rigs working in the Haynesville play. The company also participated in 9 outside-operated Haynesville wells that were completed and turned to sales since the last operations update. Working interest in these wells ranged from less than 1% to 42%. QEP has interests in 10 outside-operated Haynesville wells that are waiting on completion and one outside-operated well currently being drilled. During the 1
st
quarter 2011, the company's Haynesville net production averaged approximately 257 MMcfd and Cotton Valley/Hosston net production averaged approximately 56 MMcfd.
Pinedale operations coming out of winter mode
The company has completed and turned to sales 16 new wells at Pinedale since resuming completion operations in mid-March 2011. The company discontinues completion operations at Pinedale during the coldest months of the winter which causes a production decline in the first and second quarters of each year compared to the fourth quarter of the prior year. QEP currently has 50 operated wells waiting on completion. Improved drilling performance has translated directly into lower Pinedale well costs, with first quarter 2011 drill times averaging 14 days from spud to total depth with resultant average gross completed well costs below $3.8 million. The average drill time from spud to total depth in 2010 was 17 days. During the 1
st
quarter 2011, QEP's Pinedale net production averaged approximately 180 MMcfed. The company has 4 rigs currently working at Pinedale as one rig has recently been moved to the North Dakota Bakken play.
Industry activity ramping up in the Woodford "Cana" Shale play
QEP has completed and turned to sales 2 new QEP-operated Woodford "Cana" Shale wells in western Oklahoma. QEP has 3 operated wells currently being drilled and 3 operated wells waiting on completion. The company currently operates 13 producing wells and has a non-operated working interest in 128 producing wells across the play. The company also has interests in 7 wells currently being drilled and 21 wells waiting on completion that are operated by others. The areal extent of the play continues to expand to the northwest as additional economic wells have been completed outside QEP's interpretation of the original "core" or "Tier 1" area. During the 1
st
quarter 2011, QEP net production from the play averaged approximately 34 MMcfed and the company anticipates operating 3 rigs in the play in 2011. QEP has increased its net acreage in the play by 7,300 net acres to 75,300 net acres.
 
Bakken/Three Forks production grows on company's 89,000 acre North Dakota leasehold
QEP has completed and turned to sales 2 additional operated wells in the Williston Basin of North Dakota. QEP has 2 company-operated rigs drilling with a third rig recently moved to the area and rigging up on QEP operated acreage located west of the Nesson Anticline. QEP has 4 operated wells waiting on completion in the play. The company also has interests in 7 outside-operated wells currently being drilled and 9 outside-operated wells waiting on completion. The company operates 13 producing wells in the play and has a working interest in 61 producing wells that are operated by others. During the 1
st
quarter 2011, QEP's Bakken net production averaged approximately 1,900 Boepd. The company anticipates adding 2 additional QEP-operated rigs in the Bakken play by early 2012 to accelerate development of QEP's acreage position via pad drilling.
 
 
 
Liquids-rich Granite Wash and Atoka Wash horizontal development in the Texas Panhandle
Since the last operations update, the company has completed and turned to sales 2 additional QEP operated Atoka formation horizontal wells in Wheeler County, TX. QEP has approximately 41,000 net acres in the "Wash" plays in the western Anadarko Basin including 27,000 acres in the Texas Panhandle. During the 1
st
quarter 2011, net production from this play (vertical and horizontal wells) averaged approximately 36 MMcfed. The company is currently drilling 3 wells and has 3 wells waiting on completion. QEP is also participating in two outside-operated wells currently being drilled and has an interest in one outside-operated well waiting on completion. QEP has a working interest in a total of 38 producing horizontal Granite Wash/Atoka Wash wells and anticipates operating between 1 and 3 rigs in this play during 2011.
 
QEP Field Services 2011 first quarter gathering volumes up 5%, fee-based processing volumes up 6%, NGL sales volume up 12%
QEP Field Services gathering volumes totaled 119.0 million MMBtu for the first quarter of 2011 compared to 113.7 million MMBtu for the first quarter of 2010, a 5% increase. Fee-based processing volumes totaled 57.0 million MMBtu in the 2011 quarter compared to 53.7 million MMBtu in the 2010 quarter, a 6% increase. NGL sales volumes totaled 661.2 thousand barrels during the 2011 quarter compared to 589.8 thousand barrels during the 2010 quarter, a 12% increase.
During the first quarter, the 150 MMcfd Iron Horse cryogenic processing plant in eastern Utah came on line. This plant predominantly provides fee-based processing services to third-parties. Construction of the 420 MMcfd Blacks Forks II cryogenic gas processing plant in southwest Wyoming is on schedule for completion in the 4th quarter of 2011. When operational, the Blacks Fork II plant will have the capacity to extract an incremental 15,000 bbl per day of NGL net to QEP Resources. With the addition of the Blacks Fork II plant, QEP Field Services will own and operate processing plants in the Rocky Mountain region with an aggregate capacity of 1.37 Bcfd of natural gas.
