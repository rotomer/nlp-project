On November 11, 2011 the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of QEP Resources, Inc. (the Company) approved the engagement of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PWC) as the Companys independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2012.   PWC has informed the Company that it completed the prospective client evaluation process on November 15, 2011.  In connection with the selection of PWC, also on November 11, 2011, the Audit Committee informed Ernst & Young LLP (E&Y) that it will be dismissed as the Companys independent registered public accounting firm no later than the date of the filing of the Companys Form 10-K for the 2011 fiscal year.  The decision to change auditors was the result of a request for proposal process that included the largest four public accounting firms, conducted as part of the Companys ongoing efforts to enhance its corporate governance practices.
 
During the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, and through November 17, 2011, neither the Company nor anyone on its behalf has consulted with PWC with respect to either (i) the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed, or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the Registrants consolidated financial statements, and neither written nor oral advice was provided to the Company that PWC concluded was an important factor considered by the Company in reaching a decision as to any accounting, auditing or financial reporting issue; (ii) any matter that was either the subject of disagreement (as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K and the related instructions to Item 304 of Regulation S-K) or a reportable event (as defined by Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K).
 
The report of E&Y on the Companys consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 did not contain an adverse opinion or disclaimer of an opinion, and was not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles, except that the report includes an explanatory paragraph related to the Companys adoption of ASC 810-10-65-1, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, and SEC Release No. 33-8995, Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting.
 
During the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, and through November 17, 2011, there were no disagreements (as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K and the related instructions to Item 304 of Regulation S-K) with E&Y on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of E&Y, would have caused E&Y to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreement in its report on the consolidated financial statements for such year.
 
During the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, and through November 17, 2011, there were no reportable events (as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K).
 
The Company has provided E&Y with a copy of the above disclosures, and E&Y has furnished the Company with a letter addressed to the SEC stating it agrees with the statements made above.  A copy of E&Ys letter dated November 17, 2011 is attached as Exhibit 16.1 to this Report.
