QEP amended its Deferred Compensation Wrap Plan (Wrap Plan) which provides its executive officers and outside directors with the opportunity to defer the receipt of compensation. The material terms of the amended Plan are summarized below.
 
The Wrap Plan is a nonqualified plan that allows the named executive officers, along with certain other key employees, to defer the receipt of compensation. The Wrap Plan includes both a Deferred Compensation Program and a 401(k) Supplemental Program. The Deferred Compensation Program of the Wrap Plan allows officers and certain key employees to defer a portion of their base salaries and actual cash bonuses until termination, an in-service date selected in advance, death or disability. Deferred amounts may be treated as if invested in phantom shares of QEP stock, or as if invested in a variety of other investment options. A specified percentage of amounts deferred receive a matching contribution. The 401(k) Supplemental Program of the Wrap Plan allows officers and certain key employees whose compensation has reached the IRS-imposed limit to continue to defer a percentage of their salaries in excess of this limit and to receive a QEP match on this deferred amount as if that amount had been invested in the 401(k) Plan, but for the compensation limit. Non-employee directors may defer receipt of their fees and have them treated as if invested in QEP stock or various investment options. Non-employee directors may also defer their restricted stock grants in the form of "phantom shares" of QEP stock.
 
Payments of phantom share balances are made in cash upon specified distribution events subject to compliance with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. Deferred fees and/or phantom shares may constitute or provide for a deferral of compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code, and there may be certain tax consequences if the requirements of Section 409A of the Code are not met.
 
This description of the QEP Deferred Compensation Plan is qualified in its entirety by the terms of the plan, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.

1.1           .  QEP Resources, Inc. hereby establishes this QEP Resources, Inc. Deferred Compensation Wrap Plan (the Plan or Wrap Plan) in order to provide specified benefits to a select group of management and highly compensated employees and to allow such employees to defer the receipt of compensation.  The Plan consists of a common Deferred Compensation Wrap Plan containing definitions and other operative provisions and two separate component Programs  the Deferred Compensation Program and the 401(k) Supplemental Program. The Plan is hereby revised effective December __, 2011, to provide certain enhancements and to delete references to the Questar Corporation Deferred Compensation Wrap Plan (the Questar Plan as previously defined in the plan document) and to benefits transferred from the Questar Plan to this Plan. The provisions of the Plan as in effect on December __, 2011, shall govern accounts transferred from the Questar Plan to this Plan for periods prior to December __, 2011.
Purpose

The Plan and its component Programs are also intended to comply with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the regulations and guidance promulgated thereunder.  Finally, each of the component Programs is intended to qualify as a separate plan, program, or arrangement for purposes of 4 U.S.C. 114, thus making payments under the 401(k) Supplemental Program subject to state income tax solely of the state in which the recipient of the payment resides or is domiciled at the time payment is made.

The determination of whether a Separation from Service has occurred shall be governed by the provisions of Treasury Regulation section 1.409A-1, as amended, taking into account the objective facts and circumstances with respect to the level of bona fide services performed by the Participant after a certain date.

If the Committee determines, in its sole and absolute discretion, that any Participant should no longer qualify to participate, the Participant shall cease to be an active Participant in the Plan and future contributions to the Plan made by or on behalf of the Participant shall cease as of the date of such determination by the Committee.  The Committees determination hereunder shall be final and binding on all persons.

All such elections shall be made in accordance with the terms of the Programs and shall remain in effect for all succeeding Plan Years unless timely revoked or modified by the Participant in accordance with this Section.

(b)           .  A Participant may elect to receive a distribution of his or her Account in any of the following forms:

Notwithstanding an actual or deemed election as to the timing of the distribution of a Participants Account, at such times and in such manner as the Committee may determine, a Participant may make an irrevocable election to delay the payment, or the commencement of payment, of his or her Account, but only if such election (i) is made not less than 12 months before the date the payment or commencement of installment payments is scheduled to be paid or to begin; (ii) shall not take effect until at least 12 months after the date the election is made; and (iii) relating to a payment not being made on account of death, Disability or an Unforeseeable Emergency, delays the payment or commencement of payments for a period of at least five years from the date the payment or series of payments was scheduled to be paid or begin.

(d)           . A participant may request that a distribution of amounts credited to his Account may be made due to an Unforeseeable Emergency.
Unforeseeable Emergency Distributions
(i)            In no event shall a distribution due to an Unforeseeable Emergency exceed the balance of the Participants Account, determined as of the end of the month immediately preceding the date of the distribution, less any amounts distributed from or charged to the Participant Account since such date. The Committee may promulgate uniform rules regarding the effective date of any distribution, minimum amounts to be distributed and the frequency of distributions.
 
(ii)           A distribution may be made pursuant to this Section 6.1(d) due to an Unforeseeable Emergency only if the Participant satisfies the Committee that the Participant has an Unforeseeable Emergency and that the distribution is reasonably necessary in order to satisfy the Unforeseeable Emergency.
 
(iii)           A distribution because of an Unforeseeable Emergency may be made for one of the reasons listed in subparagraphs (A) through (C) of this paragraph (iii):

(iv)           A distribution will be considered to be reasonably necessary to satisfy an emergency need of a Participant only if the need may not be satisfied from other resources that are reasonably available to the Participant and the distribution does not exceed the amount needed to satisfy the need. The Committee shall consider all relevant facts and circumstances in determining whether a distribution is necessary in order to satisfy an emergency need. Generally, a distribution shall be deemed necessary if the Participant demonstrates to the Committee that the need cannot be relieved through reimbursement or compensation from insurance or otherwise, by the liquidation of the Participants assets (to the extent that such liquidation would not itself cause severe financial hardship) or by cessation of Deferral Contributions under the  Plan. A distribution will be deemed to be reasonably necessary to satisfy the emergency need of a Participant only if the distribution is not in excess of the amount reasonable necessary to satisfy the emergency need of the Participant (which may include amounts necessary to pay any federal, state, local or foreign income taxes or penalties reasonably anticipated to result from the distribution).
 
6.2           .  Notwithstanding any election made by the Participant under Section 6.1, in the event of a Change in Control, all amounts then credited to the Participants Account shall be distributed to the Participant in a single lump sum within 60 days following the date of such Change in Control.
Change in Control
6.3           .
Calculation of Distributions
(a)           .  All lump sum distributions shall be based on the value of the Participants Account as of the last day of the calendar month preceding the payment date.
Lump Sum
(b)           .  Under an installment payout, the Participants first installment shall be equal to a fraction of the balance credited to his or her Account as of the last day of the calendar month preceding such payment, the numerator of which is one and the denominator of which is the total number of installments selected.  The amount of each subsequent payment shall be a fraction of the balance in the Participants Account as of the last day of the calendar month preceding each subsequent payment, the numerator of which is one and the denominator of which is the total number of installments elected minus the number of installments previously paid.
Installment Distributions
6.4           .  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Plan, no distribution shall be made to a Participant under the Plan on account of the Participants Separation from Service during the 6-month period following such Separation from Service to the extent that the Company determines that the Participant is a specified employee (as defined in Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder) at the time of such Separation from Service and that paying such amounts at the time or times indicated in the Plan would be a prohibited distribution under Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code.  If the payment of any such amounts is delayed as a result of the previous sentence, then on the first business day following the end of such 6-month period (or such earlier date upon which such amount can be paid under Section 409A of the Code without being subject to such additional taxes, including as a result of the Participants death), a lump-sum distribution shall be made to the Participant under the Plan equal to the cumulative amount that would have otherwise been payable to the Participant during such 6-month period.

10.4         .  Nothing in this Plan or its component Programs shall confer upon any Participant the right to continue as an Employee of an Employer.

Nothing contained in this Plan or its component Programs nor any action taken hereunder shall create, or be construed to create, a trust of any kind, or a fiduciary relationship between the Company and the Participants, Beneficiaries, or any other persons.  All Accounts under the Plan and its component Programs shall be maintained for bookkeeping purposes only and shall not represent a claim against specific assets of any Employer.
No Creation of Rights
10.5         .  A Participant or his or her Beneficiary shall cooperate with the Committee by furnishing any and all information requested by the Committee and take such other actions as may be requested in order to facilitate the administration of the Plan and its component Programs and the payment of benefits thereunder.

The Committee may require proof of minority, incompetence, incapacity or guardianship, as it may deem appropriate prior to distribution of the benefit.  Any payment of a benefit shall be a payment for the account of the Participant and the Participants Beneficiary, as the case may be, and shall be a complete discharge of any liability under the Plan and its component Programs for such payment amount.
Payments to Incompetents
10.7         .  The Committee is authorized to make any payments directed by court order in any action in which the Plan or the Committee has been named as a party.

Notwithstanding any provision of this Plan to the contrary, including, without limitation, Article 9 hereof, in the event that the Company reasonably determines that any payments or benefits hereunder are not either exempt from or compliant with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, the Company shall have the right adopt such amendments to this Plan and its component Programs or adopt such other policies and procedures (including amendments, policies and procedures with retroactive effect), or take any other actions, that are necessary or appropriate (i) to preserve the intended tax treatment of the payments and benefits provided hereunder, to preserve the economic benefits with respect to such payments and benefits, and/or (ii) to exempt such payments and benefits from Section 409A of the Code or to comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and thereby avoid the application of penalty taxes thereunder; provided, however, that this Section 10.8 does not, and shall not be construed so as to, create any obligation on the part of the Company to adopt any such amendments, policies or procedures or to take any other such actions or to indemnify any Participant for any failure to do so.
Code Section 409A Savings Clause

10.9         .

The foregoing right to legal fees and expenses shall not apply to any contest brought by a Participant (or other party seeking payment under the Plan) that is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be frivolous or vexatious.  To the extent that any payments or reimbursements provided to the Participant under this Section are deemed to constitute compensation to the Participant, such amounts shall be paid or reimbursed reasonably promptly, but not later than December 31 of the year following the year in which the expense was incurred.  The amount of any payments or expense reimbursements that constitute compensation in one year shall not affect the amount of payments or expense reimbursements constituting compensation that are eligible for payment or reimbursement in any subsequent year, and the Participants right to such payments or reimbursement of any such expenses shall not be subject to liquidation or exchange for any other benefit.
Attorney Fees; Interest
10.10       .  If, for any reason, all or any portion of a Participants benefits under this Plan or any of its component Programs becomes subject to federal income tax with respect to the Participant prior to receipt, a Participant may petition the Committee for a distribution of that portion of his or her benefit that has become taxable, or such lesser amount as may be permitted by Code Section 409A.  Upon the grant of such a petition, which grant shall not be unreasonably withheld, the Employer shall distribute to the Participant immediately available funds in an amount equal to the taxable portion of his or her benefit or such lesser amount as may be permitted by Code Section 409A (which amount shall not exceed a Participants unpaid Account Balances).  If the petition is granted, the tax liability distribution shall be made within 90 days of the date when the Participants petition is granted.  Such a distribution shall affect and reduce the benefits to be paid under this Plan and its component Programs.  Any distribution under this Section 10.10 must meet the requirements of Code Section 409A and related Treasury guidance or Regulations.
Distribution in the Event of Taxation
10.11       .  To the extent not preempted by federal law, this Plan and its component Programs shall be governed by the laws of the State of Colorado without regard to conflicts of law principles.

1.1           .  The Company hereby establishes this revised Deferred Compensation Program under the Wrap Plan, as January 1, 2012.  Unless otherwise defined herein, all capitalized terms herein shall the meanings set forth in the QEP Resources, Inc. Deferred Compensation Wrap Plan.
Establishment of Program
1.2           .  The purposes of the Deferred Compensation Program are (i) to provide Participants with the opportunity to defer receipt of specified portions of their annual Compensation including Bonuses in order to reduce current taxable income and to provide for future financial needs, and (ii) to provide a benefit to each Participant approximately equal to the benefit the Participant would have received under the Investment Plan if the Participant did not elect to defer Compensation under the Deferred Compensation Program but instead contributed an applicable portion of such amount to the Investment Plan.
Purpose
2.1           .  An Employee shall be an Eligible Employee for purposes of this Program if he or she is in a salary classification designated by the Committee as eligible to participate in the Program for a Plan Year or is otherwise designated as an Eligible Employee by the Committee.
Participation
2.2           .  Each Participant shall make elections with regard to the deferral of Compensation and the time and form of payments under the Deferred Compensation Program in accordance with Articles 4 and 6 of the Wrap Plan.
Elections
Each Plan Year, a Participant, electing to defer Compensation under the Deferred Compensation Program for such Plan Year, must defer a minimum of $5,000 and may defer up to a maximum of 50% of his or her Compensation for such Plan Year, or such larger percentage of Compensation or a component thereof as may be designated by the Committee for a Plan Year.
4.1           .  A Participant who makes Deferral Contributions to the Deferred Compensation Program for a Plan Year may receive a Matching Contribution.  The Committee will determine annually the amount, if any, of the Matching Contribution.

4.2           .  A Participant shall be fully vested at all times in the portion of his or her Account attributable to Deferral Contributions and shall be vested in the portion of his or her Account attributable to Matching Contributions to the same extent as such Participant is vested in any matching contributions under the Investment Plan.

5.1           .  The Committee shall establish an Account for each Participant with at least two sub-accounts as follows:
Accounts
(a)           a Deferred Compensation Sub-Account which shall reflect all Deferral Contributions made by the Participant for each Plan Year, together with any adjustments for income, gain or loss and any payments from such sub-account as provided herein;
(b)           a Matching Contribution Sub-Account which shall reflect all Company Matching Contributions made under the Deferred Compensation Program for each Plan Year, together with any adjustments for income, gain or loss and any payments from such sub-account as provided herein.
 
The Committee shall establish such other sub-accounts as it deems necessary or desirable for the proper administration of the Deferred Compensation Program.  Amounts deferred by a Participant under the Deferred Compensation Program shall be credited to the Participants Account as soon as administratively practicable after the amounts would have otherwise been paid to the Participant.
 
5.2           .  Accounts and sub-accounts established hereunder shall be  record-keeping devices utilized for the sole purpose of determining benefits payable under the Deferred Compensation Program, and will not constitute a separate fund of assets but shall continue for all purposes to be part of the general, unrestricted assets of the Employer, subject to the claims of its general creditors.
