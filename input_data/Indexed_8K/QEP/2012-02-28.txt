Section 2 - Financial Information
 
As previously disclosed by QEP Resources, Inc. (the Company) on its Form 8-K filed November 17, 2011, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of QEP approved the engagement of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PWC) on November 11, 2011 as the Companys independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2012.   In connection with the selection of PWC, also on November 11, 2011, the Audit Committee informed Ernst & Young LLP (E&Y) that it would be dismissed as the Companys independent registered public accounting firm no later than the date of the filing of the Companys Form 10-K for the 2011 fiscal year.
 
This Form 8-K/A further amends the Form 8-K filed by the Company on November 17, 2011 to confirm that, upon E&Ys delivery of its Report of Independent Registered Accounting Firm dated February 24, 2012 in connection with the Companys filing of its Annual Report on Form 10-K, E&Y concluded the 2011 fiscal year audit for the Company and completed its engagement.
 
The report of E&Y on the Companys consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 did not contain an adverse opinion or disclaimer of an opinion, and was not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles, except that the report includes an explanatory paragraph related to the Companys adoption of ASC 810-10-65-1, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, and SEC Release No. 33-8995, Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting.
 
During the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, and through February 28, 2012, there were no disagreements (as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K and the related instructions to Item 304 of Regulation S-K) with E&Y on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of E&Y, would have caused E&Y to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreement in its report on the consolidated financial statements for such year.
 
During the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, and through February 28, 2012, there were no reportable events (as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K).
 
The Company has provided E&Y with a copy of the above disclosures, and has requested that E&Y furnish the Company with a letter addressed to the SEC stating whether or not it agrees with the statements made above.  A copy of E&Ys letter dated February 28, 2012 is attached as Exhibit 16.1 to this Report.
 
During the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, and through February 28, 2012, neither the Company nor anyone on its behalf has consulted with PWC with respect to either (i) the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed, or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the Registrants consolidated financial statements, and neither a written nor oral advice was provided to the Company that PWC concluded was an important factor considered by the Company in reaching a decision as to any accounting, auditing or financial reporting issue; or (ii) any matter that was either the subject of disagreement (as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K and the related instructions to Item 304 of Regulation S-K) or a reportable event (as defined by Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K).
