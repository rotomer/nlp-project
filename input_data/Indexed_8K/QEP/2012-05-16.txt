Company

Pursuant to authority conferred upon the Board of Directors of the Company by the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company, on May 14, 2012, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted the following resolutions, which resolutions relate to the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company () previously established:

EXHIBIT 10.1
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Board of Directors of QEP Resources, Inc. recognizes that, as is the case with many publicly held corporations, the possibility of a Change in Control exists.  This possibility, and the uncertainty it creates with executives, may be detrimental to the Company and its shareholders if executives are distracted and/or leave the Company.
 
The Board considers the avoidance of such loss and distraction to be essential to protecting and enhancing the best interests of the Company and its shareholders.  The Board also believes that when a Change in Control is perceived as imminent, or is occurring, the Board should be able to receive and rely on disinterested service from executive employees regarding the best interests of the Company and its shareholders without concern that the executive employees might be distracted or concerned by their personal uncertainties and risks created by the perception of an imminent or occurring Change in Control.
 
In addition, the Board believes that it is consistent with the Companys employment practices and policies and in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to compensate its executive employees whose employment terminates in connection with or following a Change in Control.
 
Accordingly, the Board has determined that appropriate steps should be taken to assure the Company and its Affiliates of the executive employees continued employment and attention and dedication to duty, and to seek to ensure the availability of their continued service, notwithstanding the possibility, threat or occurrence of a Change in Control.
 
In order to fulfill the above purposes, the Board hereby adopts this amended QEP Resources, Inc. Executive Severance Compensation Plan, to be effective as of March 1, 2012.
 
 
As of the Effective Date, the Company hereby adopts its severance compensation plan known as the QEP Resources, Inc. Executive Severance Compensation Plan, as set forth in this document.

For this purpose, a leave of absence constitutes a bona fide leave of absence only if there is a reasonable expectation that the Participant will return to perform services for the Employer.  If the period of leave exceeds six months and the Participant does not retain a right to reemployment under an applicable statute or by contract, the employment relationship will be deemed to terminate on the first date immediately following such six-month period.  For purposes of this Plan, a Separation from Service occurs at the date as of which the facts and circumstances indicate either that, after such date: (i) the Participant and Employer reasonably anticipate the Participant will perform no further services for the Company or an Affiliate (whether as an employee or an independent contractor), or (ii) that the level of bona fide services the Participant will perform for the Company or any Affiliate (whether as an employee or independent contractor) will permanently decrease to no more than 20 percent of the average level of bona fide services performed over the immediately preceding 36- month period or, if the Participant has been providing services to the Company or an Affiliate for less than 36 months, the full period over which the Participant has rendered services, whether as an employee or independent contractor.  The determination of whether a Separation from Service has occurred shall be governed by the provisions of Treasury Regulation section 1.409A-1, as amended, taking into account the objective facts and circumstances with respect to the level of bona fide services performed by the Participant after a certain date.

In addition, Separation Benefits under this Plan shall also be reduced by any amounts that are paid under the Annual Cash Incentive Plans or Long Term Cash Incentive Plan which are contingent on the Participants termination of employment following a Change in Control.

(b)           Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Plan, no compensation or benefits shall be paid to a Participant during the six-month period following his or her Date of Termination to the extent that the Company determines that the Participant is a specified employee as of the Date of Termination and that paying such amounts at the time or times indicated in this Plan would be a prohibited distribution under Code Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i).  If the payment of any such amounts is delayed as a result of the previous sentence, then on the first business day following the end of such six-month period (or such earlier date upon which such amount can be paid under Code Section 409A without being subject to additional taxes, including as a result of the Participants death), the Company shall pay to the Participant a lump-sum amount equal to the cumulative amount that would have otherwise been payable to the Participant during such six-month period.

(c)           To the extent that Section 6.5 requires the Company, partially or wholly, to subsidize any continuation of health insurance benefits following the Participants Date of Termination:
 
(i)            If such continued health insurance benefits are to be provided through third-party insurance maintained by the Company under the Companys benefit plans in a manner that causes such health insurance benefits to be exempt from the application of Code Section 409A under Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(a)(5), the Company shall pay or reimburse such premiums in accordance with the terms of this Plan, subject to Section 6.8(d); provided, however, that if, during the period of health insurance benefits continuation coverage (the Health Benefits Continuation Period), any plan pursuant to which such health insurance benefits are provided is not, or ceases prior to the expiration of the Health Benefits Continuation Period to be, exempt from the application of Code Section 409A under Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(a)(5), then an amount equal to each remaining premium payments shall thereafter be paid to the Participant as currently taxable compensation in substantially equal monthly installments over the remainder of the Health Benefits Continuation Period , accompanied by any additional amounts necessary to offset the taxable nature of such benefit to the extent such amounts are either exempt from or compliant with the requirements of Code Section 409A; or
 
(ii)           If such continued health insurance benefits are to be provided in whole or in part through a self-funded plan maintained by the Company, the benefits of which are not fully-insured by a third-party insurer:
 
(A)           To the greatest extent applicable, such health insurance benefits shall be construed to satisfy the exemption from Code Section 409A pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(v)(B), and
 
(B)           To the extent such health insurance benefits do not satisfy such exemption and/or they do extend beyond the continuation period under COBRA, determined as of the Participants Date of Termination, the Company shall reimburse the premiums relating to such health insurance benefits in accordance with Section 6.8(d).
 
(d)           To the extent that any payments or reimbursements provided to the Participant under Sections 6.5, 6.8(c) or 12.7 are deemed to constitute compensation to the Participant, such amounts shall be paid or reimbursed reasonably promptly, but not later than December 31 of the year following the year in which the expense was incurred.  The amount of any payments or expense reimbursements that constitute compensation in one year shall not affect the amount of payments or expense reimbursements constituting compensation that are eligible for payment or reimbursement in any subsequent year, and the Participants right to such payments or reimbursement of any such expenses shall not be subject to liquidation or exchange for any other benefit.

All of a Participants stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, and other equity incentive awards, including, without limitation, any conversion awards (as defined in the Questar Corporation 2010 Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan) then held by the Participant, shall vest in full immediately prior to a Change in Control.
 
 
8.1           .  Except as set forth below, in the event it shall be determined that any payment or distribution by an Employer to or for the benefit of a Participant pursuant to the terms of this Plan (a Payment) would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code or any interest or penalties would be incurred by the Participant with respect to such excise tax (such excise tax, together with any such interest and penalties, are hereinafter collectively referred to as the Excise Tax), then the Participant shall be entitled  to elect either to (a) receive the full amount of the Payment and be solely responsible for the payment of any Excise Tax due on such payment, or (b) have the payments, distributions or benefits owing to the Participant under this Plan capped or limited to the maximum dollar amount that can be paid from the Plan without the Participants incurring Excise Tax (the Capped Amount).
Participant Choice
 
8.2           .  Subject to the provisions of Section 8.3, all determinations required to be made under this Article VIII, including computation of the Capped Amount, and the assumptions to be utilized in arriving at such determination, shall be made by a nationally recognized certified public accounting firm designated by the Company (the Accounting Firm) which shall provide detailed supporting calculations both to the Company and the Participant within 15 business days after the receipt of notice from the Participant that amounts payable to the Participant could constitute a Payment, or such earlier time as is requested by the Company.  In the event that the Accounting Firm is serving as accountant or auditor for the individual, entity or group effecting the Change in Control, the Company shall appoint another nationally recognized accounting firm to make the determinations required hereunder (which accounting firm shall then be referred to as the Accounting Firm hereunder).  All fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne solely by the Company.  Any costs and expenses incurred by the Company on behalf of the Participant under this Article VIII due to any tax contest, audit or litigation will be paid by the Company by the end of the Participants taxable year following the taxable year in which the taxes that are the subject of the tax contest, audit or litigation are remitted to the taxing authority, or where as a result of such tax contest, audit or litigation no taxes are remitted, the end of the Participants taxable year following the taxable year in which the audit is completed or there is a final and non-appealable settlement or other resolution of the contest or litigation.  Subject to the provisions of Section 8.3 hereof, any determination by the Accounting Firm shall be binding upon the Company and the Participant.
Determination of Capped Amount

8.3           .  In any instance where a Participant has elected under Section 8.1(b) to receive a Capped Payment, the Participant or the Company, as applicable, shall notify the other party in writing of any claim by the Internal Revenue Service that, if successful, would require the payment by the Participant of an Excise Tax.  Such notification shall be given as soon as practicable but no later than ten business days after the Participant or the Company is informed in writing of such claim and shall apprise the other party of the nature of such claim and the date on which such claim is requested to be paid.  The Participant shall not pay such claim prior to the expiration of the 30-day period following the date on which the Participant learns of the claim (or such shorter period ending on the date that any payment of taxes with respect to such claim is due).  If the Company notifies the Participant in writing prior to the expiration of such period that it desires to contest such claim, the Participant shall:
IRS Dispute Procedures
 
(a)           give the Company any information reasonably requested by the Company relating to such claim;
 
(b)           take such action in connection with contesting such claim as the Company shall reasonably request in writing from time to time, including, without limitation, accepting legal representation with respect to such claim by an attorney reasonably selected by the Company;
 
(c)           cooperate with the Company in good faith in order to effectively contest such claim; and
 
(d)           permit the Company to participate in any proceedings relating to such claim;
 
provided, however, that the Company shall bear and pay directly all costs and expenses (including additional interest and penalties) incurred in connection with such contest and shall indemnify and hold the Participant harmless, on an after-tax basis, for any Excise Tax or income tax (including interest and penalties with respect thereto) imposed as a result of such representation and payment of costs and expenses.  Without limitation on the foregoing provisions of this Section 8.3, the Company shall control all proceedings taken in connection with such contest and, at its sole option, may pursue or forgo any and all administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings and conferences with the taxing authority in respect of such claim and may direct the Participant to contest the claim in any permissible manner (other than by paying the tax claimed and suing for a refund), and the Participant agrees to prosecute such contest to a determination before any administrative tribunal, in a court of initial jurisdiction and in one or more appellate courts, as the Company shall determine; provided, however, that any extension of the statute of limitations relating to payment of taxes for the taxable year of the Participant with respect to which such contested amount is claimed to be due is limited solely to such contested amount.
 
 
Page 12
 
 
8.4           .  At any time during the process set out in Section 8.3, the Participant shall be permitted to accept the position taken by the Internal Revenue Service and refund to the Company any distribution made that has been asserted to be subject to an Excise Tax.  Upon a final determination by an administrative tribunal or a court of competent jurisdiction that an Excise Tax is payable because any part of the Capped Amount paid to the Participant is an excess parachute payment, within the meaning of Section 4999 of the Code, such amount shall be refunded to the Company, and the Participant shall not have any right, title or interest in such amount, so that the amount repaid shall not be subject to the Excise Tax.  If , notwithstanding the Participants obligation to refund any such Payment, an Excise tax and interest and penalties are payable on such amount, the Excise Tax and any such interest and penalties shall be paid by the Participant.
Settlement
 
8.5           .  All payments to the Participant in accordance with the provisions of this Plan shall be subject to applicable withholding of local, state, Federal and foreign taxes, as determined in the sole discretion of the Company.

This Plan shall bind any successor of the Company, its assets or its businesses (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise), in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be obligated under this Plan if no succession had taken place.
 
In the case of any transaction in which a successor would not by the foregoing provision or by operation of law be bound by this Plan, the Company shall require such successor expressly and unconditionally to assume and agree to perform the Companys obligations under this Plan, in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform if no such succession had taken place.  In the event of a Change in Control in which the successor fails to expressly and unconditionally assume and agree to perform the Companys obligations under this Plan, each Participant in the Plan immediately prior to such Change in Control shall be deemed to have incurred a qualifying Separation from Service under Section 5.1 and shall be entitled to payment of the cash equivalent of all Separation Benefits set forth in Article VI as if the day prior to the date of such Change in Control were the Participants Date of Termination, in the form of a single lump sum within 60 days following the Change in Control.
 
The term Company, as used in this Plan, shall mean the Company as hereinbefore defined and any successor or assignee to the business or assets which by reason hereof becomes bound by this Plan.
 
 
 
Page 13
 
 
11.1           .  If a Change in Control has not occurred, this Plan shall continue indefinitely unless and until terminated by the Board pursuant to Section 11.2, below.  If a Change in Control occurs while this Plan is in effect, the Plan shall continue in full force and effect for three years following such Change in Control, and shall then automatically terminate; provided, however, that all Participants who become entitled to any payments hereunder shall continue to receive such payments notwithstanding any termination of the Plan.
Duration
 
11.2           .  The Board may amend or terminate this Plan for any reason prior to a Change in Control except that the Plan shall not be terminated or amended to reduce any benefits provided under the Plan at a time when the Board knows or should know that a Change in Control is under consideration, is being negotiated or is otherwise contemplated.  In the event of a Change in Control, this Plan shall automatically terminate as set forth in Section 11.1 but may not be amended or prematurely terminated.
Amendment or Termination
 
11.3           .  Any amendment or termination of this Plan by the Board in accordance with the foregoing shall be made by action of the Board in accordance with the Companys charter and by-laws and applicable law.
Procedure for Extension, Amendment or Termination
 
 
12.1           .  Except as otherwise provided in Section 6.7, the Companys obligation to make the payments provided for under this Plan and otherwise to perform its obligations hereunder shall not be affected by any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other claim, right or action which the Company may have against a Participant or others.  In no event shall a Participant be obligated to seek other employment or take any other action by way of mitigation of the amounts payable to the Participant under any of the provisions of this Plan and such amounts shall not be reduced whether or not the Participant obtains other employment.
Full Settlement
 
12.2           .  This Plan does not constitute a contract of employment or impose on the Participant or the Participants Employer any obligation for the Participant to remain an Employee or change the status of the Participants employment or the policies of the Participants Employer regarding termination of employment.
Employment Status
 
12.3           .  Each Participant shall hold in a fiduciary capacity for the benefit of the Company all secret or confidential information, knowledge or data relating to an Employer, and their respective businesses, which shall have been obtained by the Participant during the Participants employment by the Participants Employer and which shall not be or become public knowledge (other than by acts by the Participant or representatives of the Participant in violation of this Plan).  After termination of a Participants employment with the Company or other Employer, the Participant shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company or as may otherwise be required by law or legal process, communicate or divulge any such information, knowledge or data to anyone other than the Company and those designated by it.  In no event shall an asserted violation of the provisions of this Section 12.3 constitute a basis for deferring or withholding any amounts otherwise payable under this Plan.
Confidential Information

12.4          . The Company is the named fiduciary of the Plan, and shall administer the Plan, acting through the Companys Compensation Committee, which shall be the Plan Administrator.  The Plan Administrator shall have full and complete discretionary authority to administer, construe, and interpret the Plan, to decide all questions of eligibility, to determine the amount, manner and time of payment, and to make all other determinations deemed necessary or advisable for the Plan.

12.5          .
Claim Procedure
 
(a)           .  All claims and inquiries concerning benefits under the Plan must be submitted to the Plan Administrator in writing.  The claimant may submit written comments, documents, records or any other information relating to the claim.  Furthermore, the claimant shall be provided, upon request and free of charge, reasonable access to, and copies of, all documents, records and other information relevant to the claim for benefits.  If an Employee or former Employee makes a written request alleging a right to receive benefits under this Plan or alleging a right to receive an adjustment in benefits being paid under the Plan, the Company shall treat it as a claim for benefits.
Filing a Claim
 
(b)           .  The Plan Administrator shall initially deny or approve all claims for benefits under the Plan.  If any claim for benefits is denied in whole or in part, the Plan Administrator shall notify the claimant in writing of such denial and shall advise the claimant of his right to a review thereof.  Such written notice shall set forth, in a manner calculated to be understood by the claimant, specific reasons for such denial, specific references to the Plan provisions on which such denial is based, a description of any information or material necessary for the claimant to perfect his claim, an explanation of why such material is necessary and an explanation of the Plans review procedure, and the time limits applicable to such procedures.  Furthermore, the notification shall include a statement of the claimants right to bring a civil action under Section 502(a) of ERISA following an adverse benefit determination on review.  Such written notice shall be given to the claimant within a reasonable period of time, which normally shall not exceed 90 days, after the claim is received by the Plan Administrator.
Review of Claims; Claims Denial
 
(c)           .  Any claimant or his duly authorized representative, whose claim for benefits is denied in whole or in part, may appeal such denial by submitting to the Plan Administrator a request for a review of the claim within 60 days after receiving written notice of such denial from the Plan Administrator.  The Plan Administrator shall give the claimant upon request, and free of charge, reasonable access to, and copies of, all documents, records and other information relevant to the claim of the claimant, in preparing his request for review.  The request for review must be in writing.  The request for review shall set forth all of the grounds upon which it is based, all facts in support thereof, and any other matters which the claimant deems pertinent.  The Plan Administrator may require the claimant to submit such additional facts, documents, or other materials as the Plan Administrator may deem necessary or appropriate in making its review.
Appeals
 
 
Page 15
 
 
(d)           .  The Plan Administrator shall act upon each request for review within 60 days after receipt thereof.  The review on appeal shall consider all comments, documents, records and other information submitted by the claimant relating to the claim without regard to whether this information was submitted or considered in the initial benefit determination.
Review of Appeals
 
(e)           .  The Plan Administrator shall give written notice of its decision to the claimant.   If the Plan Administrator confirms the denial of the application for benefits in whole or in part, such notice shall set forth, in a manner calculated to be understood by the claimant, the specific reasons for such denial, and specific references to the Plan provisions on which the decision is based.  The notice shall also contain a statement that the claimant is entitled to receive upon request, and free of charge, reasonable access to, and copies of, all documents, records and other information relevant to the claimants claim for benefits.  Information is relevant to a claim if it was relied upon in making the benefit determination or was submitted, considered or generated in the course of making the benefit determination, whether it was relied upon or not.  The notice shall also contain a statement of the claimants right to bring an action under ERISA Section 502(a).  If the Plan Administrator has not rendered a decision on a request for review within 60 days after receipt of the request for review, the claimants claim shall be deemed to have been approved.  The Plan Administrators decision shall be final and not subject to further review within the Company.  There are no voluntary appeals procedures after appellate review by the Plan Administrator.
Decision on Appeals
 
(f)           .  If the day on which any of the foregoing time periods is to end is a Saturday, Sunday or holiday recognized by the Company, the period shall extend until the next following business day.
Determination of Time Periods
 
12.6         .  All payments pursuant to the Plan shall be made from the general funds of the Company and no special or separate fund shall be established or other segregation of assets made to assure payment.  No Participant or other person shall have under any circumstances any interest in any particular property or assets of the Company as a result of participating in the Plan.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may (but shall not be obligated to) create one or more grantor trusts, the assets of which are subject to the claims of the Companys creditors, to assist it in accumulating funds to pay its obligations under the Plan.
Unfunded Plan Status
 
12.7         .  The Company agrees to pay as incurred, to the full extent permitted by law, and in accordance with Section 6.8(d) hereof, all legal fees and expenses which a Participant may reasonably incur as a result of any contest (regardless of the outcome thereof) by the Company, the Participant, or others of the validity or enforceability of, or liability under, any provision of this Plan or any guarantee of performance thereof (including as a result of any contest by the Participant about the amount of any payment pursuant to this Plan), plus in each case interest on any delayed payment at the applicable Federal rate provided for in Section 7872(f)(2)(A) of the Code.  The foregoing right to legal fees and expenses shall not apply to any contest brought by a Participant (or other party seeking payment under the Plan) that is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be frivolous or vexatious.

12.8         .  The payments and benefits provided hereunder are intended to be exempt from or compliant with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code.  Notwithstanding any provision of this Plan to the contrary, in the event that the Company reasonably determines that any payments or benefits hereunder are not either exempt from or compliant with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, the Company shall have the right to adopt such amendments to this Plan or adopt such other policies and procedures (including amendments, policies and procedures with retroactive effect), or take any other actions, that are necessary or appropriate (i) to preserve the intended tax treatment of the payments and benefits provided hereunder, to preserve the economic benefits with respect to such payments and benefits, and/or (ii) to exempt such payments and benefits from Section 409A of the Code or to comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and thereby avoid the application of penalty taxes thereunder; provided, however, that this Section 12.8 does not, and shall not be construed so as to, create any obligation on the part of the Company to adopt any such amendments, policies or procedures or to take any other such actions or to indemnify any Participant for any failure to do so.
Code Section 409A Savings Clause
 
12.9         .  The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of the Plan shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of the Plan, which shall remain in full force and effect, and any prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.
Validity and Severability
 
12.10       .  The validity, interpretation, construction and performance of the Plan shall in all respects be governed by the laws of Colorado without reference to principles of conflict of law, except to the extent pre-empted by Federal law.

During a career in the oil and gas industry that spanned more than 30 years, including 18 years with QEP Resources and its predecessor company, Dady played a key role in leading multiple strategic acquisitions, contractual negotiations, complex litigation and regulatory matters on behalf of the Company.  Dady also played an integral part in QEPs successful spin-off from its predecessor company in 2010.
Eric has been a valued, trusted advisor during his tenure with our company, stated Chuck Stanley, President and CEO of QEP Resources.  We appreciate his many contributions to QEP and wish him well in his retirement.

Chris is an experienced attorney who shares a deep understanding of the legal and business issues relevant to both QEP and our industry, continued Stanley.  He is well equipped to transition into the role as our new General Counsel, beginning this October.
Scott Gutberlet has been promoted to the position of Vice President, Commercial and Technical Services.  Scott is a petroleum engineer with nearly 25 years of experience in the oil and gas industry, including 6 years with QEP and its predecessor company.
