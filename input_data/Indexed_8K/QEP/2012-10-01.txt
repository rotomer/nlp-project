Item 2.01 Completion of Acquisition of Assets.
On September 27, 2012, QEP Resources, Inc. (the Registrant), through its wholly-owned subsidiary, QEP Energy Company, closed its previously announced transaction with Helis Oil & Gas Company, L.L.C. (Helis) and certain other sellers (the Non-Operated Sellers and, together with Helis, the Sellers). The Registrant acquired certain oil and natural gas interests (the Acquired Properties) in North Dakotas Williams and McKenzie counties pursuant to two related asset purchase agreements with Helis and the Non-Operated Sellers. The aggregate consideration paid to the Sellers for the acquisition was approximately $1.38 billion (the Purchase Price), with approximately 46% of the total Purchase Price attributed to the assets acquired from Helis. The Purchase Price is subject to final purchase price adjustments to be determined based on an effective date of July 1, 2012.
The Acquired Properties consist of approximately 27,600 net acres of producing and undeveloped oil and gas properties in the active play area for the Bakken and Three Forks Formations within the Williston Basin. The Acquired Properties have estimated aggregate net proved and probable reserves of approximately 125 million barrels of oil equivalent.
The Purchase Price was funded with borrowings under the Registrants existing credit facility and proceeds from the issuance of senior notes.
