Exhibit 99.1 News Release FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Contacts: Media: Investor Relations: David Bruce Bob Brunn (305) 500-4999 (305) 500-4053 RYDER ANNOUNCES SECOND QUARTER 2003 RESULTS -Second Quarter 2003 Earnings Increase 18% from Year-Earlier Period- -Supply Chain Operations Drive Earnings Improvement for Second Consecutive Quarter- MIAMI, July 23, 2003 - Ryder System, Inc. (NYSE:R), a global leader in transportation and supply chain management solutions, today announced earnings of $34.7 million for the three months ended June 30, 2003, up 18% compared with $29.5 million in the year-earlier period. Revenue for the second quarter of 2003 was $1.20 billion, down 1% from $1.21 billion in the comparable period last year. Earnings per diluted share (EPS) were $0.55 in the second quarter of 2003, up 17% compared with $0.47 in the year-earlier period. EPS for the period included a $0.01 benefit related to recovery of restructuring and other items. "Ryder increased earnings in the second quarter while also absorbing more than $13 million of additional pension expense," said Ryder Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Gregory T. Swienton. "Most notably, the continuous improvement programs introduced last year within our Supply Chain Solutions operations helped deliver a second consecutive quarter of significantly higher earnings. Improved operating performance within Fleet Management Solutions, however, was offset by the impact of that business segment absorbing the majority of this quarter's increased pension expense." Second quarter 2003 revenue was impacted by continuing soft economic conditions in the U.S., which led to reduced transportation miles run within all business segments, and volume reductions within some sectors of the Supply Chain Solutions (SCS) business segment. These conditions in the U.S. were partially offset by higher fuel prices, as well as improvement in the commercial rental product line and the performance of the Company's Canadian, Latin American and Asian operations. Commercial rental revenue for the second quarter of 2003 grew 1
5% compared with the year-earlier period, marking the third consecutive quarter of year-over-year rental revenue improvement. YEAR-TO-DATE OPERATING RESULTS Revenue for the first half of 2003 was $2.39 billion, up 1% from $2.36 billion for 2002. Ryder's earnings before accounting changes for the six months ended June 30, 2003 were $55.6 million, up 20% from $46.3 million for the comparable period of the prior year. EPS, before accounting changes, were $0.88 for the first six months of 2003, up 19% from $0.74 for the same period of 2002. Net earnings for the first half of 2003 were $54.5 million, up 99% from $27.4 million for the year-earlier period. EPS were $0.86 for the first six months of 2003, up 95% from $0.44 for the same period last year. EPS in the first half of 2003 included a $0.02 non-cash charge related to the cumulative effect of a change in accounting for costs associated with the eventual retirement of long-lived assets (primarily related to components of revenue earning equipment), as required by the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 143. EPS in the year-earlier period included a $0.30 non-cash charge related to the cumulative effect of a change in accounting for goodwill, as required by the adoption of SFAS No. 142. SECOND QUARTER BUSINESS SEGMENT OPERATING RESULTS Ryder's primary measurement of business segment financial performance, Net Before Tax (NBT), allocates Central Support Services to each business segment. FLEET MANAGEMENT SOLUTIONS Ryder's Fleet Management Solutions (FMS) business segment combines several capabilities into a comprehensive package that provides one-stop outsourcing of the acquisition, maintenance, management and disposal of vehicles. Ryder's commercial rental service offers customers a method to expand their fleets in order to address specific or short-term capacity needs. In the FMS business segment, dry revenue (revenue excluding fuel) in the second quarter of 2003 was $645.7 million, down 2% compared with $657.0 2
million in the year-earlier period. Dry revenue was affected by favorable foreign currency exchange rates and the impact of ancillary business not renewed. Fuel revenue for the second quarter of 2003 increased 5% compared with the same period in 2002 due to higher fuel prices. Full service lease and programmed maintenance revenue for the second quarter of 2003 was 1% lower than the same period last year because of continued softness in the U.S. economy. However, Ryder's second quarter 2003 commercial rental revenue grew 5% from the year-earlier period. Also in the second quarter 2003, leasing demand showed signs of modest improvement. The FMS business segment's NBT decreased 6% to $52.1 million in the second quarter of 2003, compared with $55.4 million in the same period of 2002. This decrease was related primarily to the second quarter 2003 pension expense increase of nearly $12 million compared with the same period last year, as well as lower U.S. leasing demand. The impact of these items was partially offset by better rental pricing, improvement in used truck sales and carrying costs, lower interest costs, and improvement in operating expenses stemming from Ryder's cost management and process improvement actions. Business segment NBT as a percentage of dry revenue was 8.1% in the second quarter of 2003 compared with 8.4% in the same quarter a year ago. SUPPLY CHAIN SOLUTIONS Ryder's Supply Chain Solutions (SCS) business segment enables customers to improve shareholder value and their customers' satisfaction by enhancing supply chain performance and reducing costs. The solutions involve management of the logistics pipeline as a synchronized, integrated process - from raw material supply to finished goods distribution. By improving business processes and employing new technologies, the flow of goods and cash is made faster and consumes less capital. In the SCS business segment, second quarter 2003 revenue totaled $345.7 million, down 4% from $358.3 million in the comparable period in 2002. Second quarter 2003 operating revenue (revenue excluding freight under management) was $239.5 million, down 5% from $251.3 million in the comparable period a year ago. The decreases were due primarily to volume reductions resulting from slow 3
economic conditions and the non-renewal of certain customer contracts that were not expected to provide adequate future returns. The SCS business segment's NBT was $7.4 million in the second quarter of 2003, an improvement of almost $9.6 million from the loss of $2.2 million in the same quarter of 2002. Business segment NBT as a percentage of operating revenue was 3.1% in the second quarter of 2003 compared with a negative 0.9% in the same quarter of 2002. Consistent with the first quarter 2003, these increases were driven by reduced overhead spending on a global basis and improved operational performance. DEDICATED CONTRACT CARRIAGE Ryder's Dedicated Contract Carriage (DCC) business segment provides customers with vehicles, drivers, management and administrative support, with the assets committed to a specific customer for a contractual term. DCC supports customers with both basic and sophisticated logistics and transportation needs, including routing and scheduling, specialized driver services, and logistical engineering support. In the DCC business segment, second quarter 2003 revenue totaled $128.0 million, essentially flat compared with $127.7 million in the second quarter of 2002. Operating revenue (revenue excluding freight under management) in the second quarter was $127.1 million, also flat compared with $126.7 million in the year-earlier period. The DCC business segment's NBT decreased in the second quarter of 2003 to $8.3 million compared with $8.4 million in the second quarter of 2002. Business segment NBT as a percentage of operating revenue was 6.5% compared with 6.6% in 2002. CORPORATE FINANCIAL INFORMATION CENTRAL SUPPORT SERVICES Central Support Services (CSS) are overhead costs incurred to support all business segments and product lines. Substantially all CSS costs are allocated to the various business segments. 4
In the second quarter of 2003, total CSS costs decreased to $55.4 million, from $58.3 million in the year-earlier period. This marked the tenth consecutive quarter of reduced CSS costs. The decreases were attributable to reduced spending across all functional areas. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES Capital expenditures were $413 million for the six months ended June 30, 2003, up 48% compared with $280 million for the same period of 2002. The increase in capital expenditures reflects planned higher vehicle replacements, primarily related to the rental product line. On a full-year basis, capital expenditures are forecasted to total approximately $750 million; this is reduced from an original 2003 plan of $890 million. Capital expenditures for the full year 2002 were $600 million. The decrease in capital spending from planned levels reflects lower leasing demand, and higher than anticipated re-deployments and lease extensions. LEVERAGE AND FREE CASH FLOW On-balance-sheet debt as of June 30, 2003 was reduced by $55.4 million compared with year end. The leverage ratio for on-balance-sheet debt as of June 30, 2003 was 126% compared with 140% at year end. Total obligations including securitization to equity as of June 30, 2003 were 173%, down from 201% at year end. Free cash flow for the first half of 2003 is estimated to be $126.3 million compared with $198.4 million for the year-earlier period. Commenting on Ryder's corporate financial performance, Ryder Chief Financial Officer Tracy A. Leinbach stated, "The financial strategies and disciplines that Ryder put in place have allowed us to realize positive cash flow, strengthen the balance sheet, and ensure efficient access to capital in a difficult economic environment. This financial strength positions us well to capitalize on future opportunities for profitable growth." OUTLOOK Commenting on the Company's outlook, Swienton stated, "Ryder's Supply Chain Solutions business delivered strong earnings performance for the second 5
consecutive quarter. We do, however, expect some third quarter impact from reduced automotive production in that business segment. In Fleet Management Solutions, our commercial rental business was up and leasing demand also showed slight improvement this quarter. In view of the economy, we don't expect a significant increase in leasing demand until there is a better sense among customers that a recovery is underway. Balancing this combination of factors, we are forecasting third quarter EPS to be in the range of $0.59 to $0.62." He continued, "Based on our results for the first half of the year, we are increasing our previous $1.95 to $2.00 full-year EPS forecast to the range of $2.04 to $2.10. Even without significant improvement in the overall economy, there are remaining cost management and process improvement opportunities, particularly in the Fleet Management Solutions segment, that should enable us to achieve this forecast."
