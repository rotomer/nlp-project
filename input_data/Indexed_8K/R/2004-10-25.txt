Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition

(the "Company") issued a press release reporting its financial results for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2004 (the "Press Release"). The Company also hosted a conference call and webcast on October 25, 2004, during which a presentation was made on the Company's financial results for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2004 (the "Presentation"). The Press Release and the Presentation are available on the Company's website and are attached hereto as Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2, respectively.
     The Press Release and the Presentation include information regarding the Company's earnings per share excluding gain on headquarters sale which is a non-GAAP financial measure as defined by SEC regulations.

Exhibit 99.1
News Release
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
      Ryder System, Inc. (NYSE:R), a global leader in transportation and supply chain management solutions, today announced earnings of $54.3 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2004, up 34% compared with comparable earnings in the same period of 2003. Earnings per diluted share (EPS) were $0.83 for the third quarter of 2004, up 32% from $0.63 in the third quarter of 2003. Improved performance was driven primarily by the continuing earnings leverage from revenue growth in the Fleet Management Solutions (FMS) business segment.
MIAMI, October 25, 2004
     Revenue for the third quarter of 2004 was $1.31 billion, up 9% from $1.19 billion in the comparable period last year. The revenue increase for the quarter was led by the FMS business segment, which was up nearly 14% compared with the third quarter of 2003. The third quarter 2004 revenue growth was driven primarily by the positive impact of acquisitions, continued improvement in the commercial rental product line, higher fuel revenue driven by higher fuel prices, and favorable foreign exchange rates. Commercial rental revenue for the quarter increased 22% compared with the year-earlier period.
     "We exceeded our third quarter earnings forecast with strong performance in our Fleet Management Solutions business segment, where we continue to deliver strong earnings leverage from acquisitions and outstanding growth in commercial rental," said Ryder Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Greg Swienton. "We were also encouraged that new business wins in the Supply Chain Solutions business segment offset almost all of the anticipated revenue gap we expected due to non-renewals in previous quarters. We will continue to leverage our financial strength and improved operating model to drive profitable revenue growth in each area of our business."
 
     Net earnings for the third quarter of 2004 were $54.3 million, up 45% from $37.5 million in the year-earlier period. Net earnings for the third quarter of 2004 included $1.3 million ($0.01 per share) associated primarily with the gain on sale of the final parcel of the Company's headquarters complex. Net earnings in the year-earlier period included a net recovery of $2.7 million ($0.02 per share) and a net non-cash charge of $3.0 million ($0.05 per share) related to the cumulative effect of a change in accounting for variable interest entities.
     Revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2004 was $3.79 billion, up 6% from $3.59 billion in the comparable period of 2003. Ryder's net earnings through the third quarter of 2004 were $153.0 million, compared with $92.0 million in the year-earlier period. EPS were $2.33 through the third quarter of 2004 compared with $1.45 for the same period of 2003. Year-to-date 2004 EPS included $0.23 of gains from the sale of the Company's corporate headquarters complex and a $0.03 charge related to restructuring activities. EPS in the year-earlier period included a $0.04 credit from net restructuring and other recoveries, and $0.06 in non-cash charges associated with the cumulative effect of a change in accounting for variable interest entities and asset retirement obligations (primarily related to components of revenue earning equipment).
     Ryder's primary measurement of business segment financial performance, Net Before Tax (NBT), allocates Central Support Services to each business segment.
Fleet Management Solutions
     Ryder's Fleet Management Solutions (FMS) business segment combines several capabilities into a comprehensive package that provides one-stop outsourcing of the acquisition, maintenance, management and disposal of vehicles. Ryder's commercial rental service offers customers a method to expand their fleets in order to address specific or short-term capacity needs.
     In the FMS business segment, revenue in the third quarter of 2004 was $918.7 million, up 14% compared with $809.3 million in the year-earlier period. Dry revenue (revenue excluding
 
fuel) in the third quarter of 2004 was $713.6 million, up 9% compared with $655.3 million in the year-earlier period. Fuel revenue for the third quarter of 2004 increased 33% compared with the same period in 2003 due primarily to higher fuel costs and related pricing increases. Revenue comparisons also benefited from acquisitions and favorable foreign currency exchange rates.
     Full service lease and programmed maintenance revenue for the third quarter of 2004 was 6% higher than the same period last year primarily from acquisitions. Ryder's third quarter 2004 commercial rental revenue grew 22% from the year-earlier period. Rental revenue improvement reflects higher pricing, stronger demand, and the impact of acquisitions.
     The FMS business segment's NBT increased to $85.1 million in the third quarter of 2004, compared with $54.1 million in the same period of 2003. This improvement was related primarily to lease growth from acquisitions, better commercial rental performance, higher vehicle sales gains from stronger volume and pricing, and lower pension costs. Business segment NBT as a percentage of dry revenue was 11.9% in the third quarter of 2004 compared with 8.3% in the same quarter a year ago.
Supply Chain Solutions
     Ryder's Supply Chain Solutions (SCS) business segment enables customers to improve shareholder value and their customers' satisfaction by enhancing supply chain performance and reducing costs. The solutions involve management of the logistics pipeline as a synchronized, integrated process  from raw material supply to finished goods distribution. By improving business processes and employing new technologies, the flow of goods and cash is made faster and consumes less capital.
     In the SCS business segment, third quarter 2004 revenue totaled $338.5 million, up 2% from $331.0 million in the comparable period in 2003. Revenue increased because of new business primarily in automotive and transportation management, partially offset by non-renewal of certain customer contracts in prior periods. Third quarter 2004 operating revenue (revenue excluding freight under management) was $233.1 million, down 1% from $236.6 million in the comparable period a year ago.
     The SCS business segment's NBT was $10.1 million in the third quarter of 2004, down from $12.3 million in the same quarter of 2003. Third quarter results for 2003 benefited from more than $2 million in operating tax refunds and the resolution of a customer contractual
 
matter. Business segment NBT as a percentage of operating revenue was 4.3% in the third quarter of 2004, compared with 5.2% in the same quarter of 2003. However, excluding the previously noted exceptional items, business segment NBT in the third quarter of 2003 would have been 4.2%.
Dedicated Contract Carriage
     Ryder's Dedicated Contract Carriage (DCC) business segment provides customers with vehicles, drivers, management and administrative support, with the assets committed to a specific customer for a contractual term. DCC supports customers with both basic and sophisticated logistics and transportation needs including routing and scheduling, specialized driver services, and logistical engineering support.
     In the DCC business segment, third quarter 2004 revenue totaled $125.9 million, a decrease of 1% compared with $127.0 million in the third quarter of 2003. Operating revenue (revenue excluding freight under management) in the third quarter of 2004 was $122.7 million, down 3% compared with $125.9 million in the year-earlier period. The revenue decrease was due to the non-renewal of certain customer contracts, partially offset by fuel cost increases passed through to customers.
     The DCC business segment's NBT in the third quarter of 2004 was $7.9 million compared with $8.0 million in the third quarter of 2003. Business segment NBT as a percentage of operating revenue of 6.4% for the third quarter of 2004 was flat compared with the year-earlier period.
Central Support Services
     Central Support Services (CSS) are overhead costs incurred to support all business segments and product lines. Substantially all CSS costs are allocated to the various business segments. In the third quarter of 2004, CSS costs increased to $55.4 million, from $52.5 million in the year-earlier period. Year-to-date, CSS costs decreased to $157.7 million, from $161.8 million in the same period of 2003.
 
Capital Expenditures
     Capital expenditures excluding acquisition costs were $843 million through the third quarter of 2004, up 47% compared with $575 million in the same period of 2003. As anticipated, the increase in capital expenditures reflects higher vehicle replacements, primarily related to the lease product line. In addition, approximately $149 million was paid in the first nine months of 2004 in connection with Ryder's previously announced acquisitions.
Leverage and Free Cash Flow
     Balance sheet debt as of September 30, 2004 decreased by $96 million compared with year-end 2003. The leverage ratio for balance sheet debt as of September 30, 2004 was 119%, compared with 135% at year-end 2003. Total obligations to equity as of September 30, 2004 were 133%, down from 146% at year-end 2003. Free cash flow through the third quarter of 2004 is estimated to be $161.8 million compared with $258.8 million for the year-earlier period. The decrease in free cash flow reflects acquisitions and higher capital expenditures.
     Commenting on the Company's corporate financial performance, Ryder Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Tracy Leinbach stated, "The initiatives we launched over the past few years related to improving financial processes, strengthening asset management and reducing costs are working in concert to produce higher earnings leverage from new revenue. We continue to launch new initiatives to heighten Ryder's efficiency in many areas, and we believe there is significant remaining capacity for the Company to deliver profitable growth in all areas of our business."
     Commenting on Ryder's outlook for the future, Mr. Swienton said, "Our strong financial position and improved processes have produced encouraging operating performance in many areas throughout the Company. The earnings leverage we continue to generate from acquisitions and the accelerating growth of our transactional business represents the first steps toward our goal of achieving profitable growth in every segment of our business. We have seen some improvement in the willingness of our customers to make long-term business investment
 
decisions, and we are well positioned to meet our objectives as the economy continues to improve."
     He continued"We are forecasting fourth quarter EPS to be in the same range of our last estimate, namely $0.75 to $0.78, resulting in a full-year forecast in the range of $3.08 to $3.11." Forecasted earnings include a restructuring charge related to the transition of the technology services contract terminated in the second quarter of this year. The charge will impact 2004 EPS by $0.03 in the fourth quarter and $0.08 for the full year. For additional clarity, the full-year forecast is equivalent to $2.85 to $2.88, excluding $0.23 in gains from the sale of the Company's headquarters complex.
