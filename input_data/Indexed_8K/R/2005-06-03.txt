Item 8.01. Other Events.
Gregory T. Swienton, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, has established a stock trading plan in accordance with the guidelines specified in Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and our insider trading policy. The plan provides for the exercise of stock options and the subsequent sale of the acquired shares on the open market at prevailing market prices on thirteen trade dates commencing June 15, 2005, and ending on May 15, 2006, subject to specified limitations and minimum price thresholds. No more than 60,000 stock options may be exercised under the plan on any trade date and no more than 550,000 stock options in total may be exercised under the plan. The plan will terminate on May 15, 2006, unless earlier terminated pursuant to the terms of the plan. The plan will be used by Mr. Swienton to diversify his Ryder System, Inc. holdings as part of his estate and tax planning activities. Any transactions effected under the plan will be disclosed publicly through Form 4 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Rule 10b5-1 allows corporate insiders to establish prearranged stock trading plans when they are not in possession of material nonpublic information, and allows such prearranged trades to be made pursuant to the plan regardless of any subsequent material information that the insider may receive.
