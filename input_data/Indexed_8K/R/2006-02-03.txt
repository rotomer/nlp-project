Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On February 3, 2006, we issued a press release reporting our financial results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2005 and our 2006 Forecast (the "Press Release"). We also hosted a conference call and webcast on February 3, 2006 during which we made a presentation on our financial results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2005 and our 2006 Forecast (the "Presentation"). The Press Release and the Presentation are available on our website at www.ryder.com.
The Press Release and the Presentation include information regarding our (i) comparable earnings and comparable earnings per share from continuing operations excluding the gain from our headquarters complex sale and net tax benefits and (ii) earnings before restructuring and income taxes, each of which is a non-GAAP financial measure as defined by SEC regulations. We believe that comparable earnings and comparable earnings per share from continuing operations provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. We present earnings before restructuring and income taxes because we use this measure to evaluate the performance of our business segments and for informational purposes as such measure is often requested by our investors.
The information in this Report, including Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2, is being furnished pursuant to Item 2.02 of Form 8-K and General Instruction B.2 thereunder and shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, except as expressly set forth by specific reference to such filing .
Item 9.01(c) Exhibits
     The following exhibits are furnished as part of this Report on Form 8-K:
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

 
Exhibit 99.1
News Release
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
      Ryder System, Inc. (NYSE:R), a global leader in transportation and supply chain management solutions, today reported earnings per diluted share (EPS) from continuing operations were $0.93 for the three-month period ended December 31, 2005, up 13% from $0.82 of comparable EPS in the year-earlier period. Earnings from continuing operations were $59.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2005, up 11% from $53.4 million of comparable earnings in the year-earlier period. All business segments reported improved results. For comparison purposes, earnings from continuing operations and EPS for the prior year of 2004 exclude a net tax benefit of $9.2 million, or $0.14 per share, related to the resolution of various tax matters.
MIAMI, February 3, 2006
     Net earnings for the fourth quarter of 2005 were $58.8 million, or $0.92 per share, compared with $62.6 million, or $0.96 per share, in the year-earlier period. Net earnings for the fourth quarter of 2005 included a benefit of $1.7 million, or $0.03 per share, for the reduction of insurance reserves related to discontinued operations and a charge of $2.4 million, or $0.04 per share, for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting associated with the adoption of FIN 47 related to the future removal of underground fuel storage tanks.
     Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2005 was $1.54 billion, up 13% from $1.36 billion in the comparable period last year with all business segments reporting revenue growth. Fleet Management Solutions (FMS) business segment revenue grew 7%, driven by higher fuel services revenue. Supply Chain Solutions (SCS) business segment revenue grew 31%, driven by
1
 
increased volume of managed subcontracted transportation as well as new and expanded business in all industry groups. Dedicated Contract Carriage (DCC) business segment revenue increased 11%, primarily due to new and expanded business, and pricing increases associated with higher fuel costs.
     "Our continued focus in the fourth quarter enabled us to deliver our second consecutive quarter of higher earnings and organic operating revenue growth in every segment," said Ryder Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Greg Swienton. "Prior to the third quarter, we had not experienced a quarter of both earnings and revenue growth for all business segments simultaneously in several years. This consistent performance provides momentum for achieving our business objectives for 2006."
     EPS from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2005 included restructuring costs of $0.04 related primarily to severance and the termination of an information technology contract related to global cost-savings initiatives. EPS from continuing operations in the year-earlier period included restructuring costs of $0.03 related primarily to the termination of an information technology infrastructure contract.
     Revenue for the full-year 2005 was $5.74 billion, up 11% from $5.15 billion in the comparable period of 2004. Ryder's full-year 2005 earnings from continuing operations were $227.6 million compared with $215.6 million in the year-earlier period. EPS from continuing operations were $3.53 for 2005, up 8% compared with $3.28 for the same period of 2004. EPS from continuing operations in 2005 included a $0.12 income tax benefit related to a change in Ohio income tax law, as well as $0.03 in net restructuring costs. EPS from continuing operations in the year-earlier period of 2004 included a net tax benefit of $0.14 associated with the resolution of various tax matters, $0.23 of gains from the sale of the Company's corporate headquarters complex and $0.06 in costs related to restructuring activities. For comparison purposes, excluding the noted net tax benefits in 2005 and 2004 and gains from the sale of the corporate headquarters complex in the year-earlier period of 2004, full-year 2005 earnings from continuing operations were $220.0 million, up 15% from $191.0 million in 2004. Comparable full-year 2005 EPS from continuing operations of $3.41 were up 17% from $2.91 in 2004. Ryder's full-year 2005 net earnings also included an after-tax benefit of $1.7 million ($0.03 per
2
 
diluted share) related to discontinued operations and an after-tax charge of $2.4 million ($0.04 per diluted share) for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting related to the adoption of FIN 47.
     Ryder's primary measurement of business segment financial performance, Net Before Tax (NBT), allocates Central Support Services to each business segment.
Fleet Management Solutions
     Ryder's Fleet Management Solutions (FMS) business segment combines several capabilities into a comprehensive package that provides one-stop outsourcing of the acquisition, maintenance, management and disposal of vehicles. Ryder's commercial rental service offers customers a method to expand their fleets in order to address specific or short-term capacity needs.
     In the FMS business segment, revenue in the fourth quarter of 2005 was $1.02 billion, up 7% compared with $950.5 million in the year-earlier period. Operating revenue (revenue excluding fuel) in the fourth quarter of 2005 was $723.6 million, up 1% compared with $719.3 million in the year-earlier period. Fuel services revenue for the fourth quarter of 2005 increased 27% compared with the same period in 2004, due primarily to higher fuel pricing as a result of market cost increases. Revenue comparisons also benefited from favorable foreign currency exchange rates. Full service lease revenue for the fourth quarter of 2005 was up 1% from the year-earlier period due to growth in the U.S. business. Commercial rental revenue was essentially flat compared with the year-earlier period, reflecting higher pricing offset by a smaller fleet. Contract maintenance and contract-related maintenance revenue increased 1% in the fourth quarter of 2005 compared with the same period last year.
     The FMS business segment's NBT increased to $92.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2005, up 3% compared with $89.5 million in the same period of 2004. This improvement was related primarily to improved U.S. commercial rental and lease results and lower overhead costs, partially offset by lower margins in the Company's U.K. operations. Earnings in the quarter were negatively affected by lower fuel margins resulting from the marked decrease in fuel prices (after the unprecedented increases that followed Hurricanes Katrina and Rita) and lower U.S.
3
 
used vehicle sales gains resulting from actions taken during the quarter to reduce used truck inventories. Neither of these impacts is expected to continue. Business segment NBT as a percentage of operating revenue was 12.7% in the fourth quarter of 2005, up 30 basis points compared with 12.4% in the same quarter a year ago.
Supply Chain Solutions
     Ryder's Supply Chain Solutions (SCS) business segment enables customers to improve shareholder value and their customers' satisfaction by enhancing supply chain performance and reducing costs. The solutions involve management of the logistics pipeline as a synchronized, integrated process  from raw material supply to finished goods distribution. By improving business processes and employing new technologies, the flow of goods and cash is made faster and consumes less capital.
     In the SCS business segment, fourth quarter 2005 revenue totaled $482.7 million, up 31% from $367.4 million in the comparable period of 2004. Revenue grew due to increased volume of managed subcontracted transportation, as well as new and expanded business in all industry groups. Operating revenue (revenue excluding subcontracted transportation) was $274.2 million, up 12% from $245.9 million in the comparable period a year ago.
     The SCS business segment's NBT was $14.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2005, up 22% from $11.4 million in the same quarter of 2004. The earnings increase was related to new and expanded business and lower overhead spending. Business segment NBT as a percentage of operating revenue was 5.1% in the fourth quarter of 2005, up 50 basis points compared with 4.6% in the same quarter of 2004.
Dedicated Contract Carriage
     Ryder's Dedicated Contract Carriage (DCC) business segment provides customers with vehicles, drivers, management and administrative support, with the assets committed to a specific customer for a contractual term. DCC supports customers with both basic and sophisticated logistics and transportation needs including routing and scheduling, specialized driver services, and logistical engineering support.
     In the DCC business segment, fourth quarter 2005 revenue totaled $142.5 million, up 11% compared with $128.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2004. Operating revenue (revenue
4
 
excluding subcontracted transportation) in the fourth quarter of 2005 was $137.8 million, up 10% compared with $125.5 million in the year-earlier period. Revenue grew due to new and expanded business and pricing increases associated with higher fuel costs.
     The DCC business segment's NBT in the fourth quarter of 2005 was $10.4 million, up 52% compared with $6.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2004. Business segment NBT was positively impacted by new and expanded business, as well as lower safety costs. Business segment NBT as a percentage of operating revenue was 7.5% in the fourth quarter of 2005, up 200 basis points compared with 5.5% in the year-earlier period.
Central Support Services
     Central Support Services (CSS) are overhead costs incurred to support all business segments and product lines. The majority of CSS costs are allocated to the various business segments.
     In the fourth quarter of 2005, CSS costs were $53.4 million, down from $56.4 million in the year-earlier period. The decrease was due primarily to cost benefits realized from the insourcing and renegotiation of several information technology infrastructure services agreements. Full-year CSS costs were $207.3 million, down from $212.4 million in 2004.
Capital Expenditures
     In Ryder's business, capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue-earning equipment (trucks, tractors and trailers) primarily to support the full service lease product line and secondarily to support the commercial rental product line within Ryder's Fleet Management Solutions business segment. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long-term agreements that result in predictable cash flows to Ryder typically over a three- to seven-year term. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the Company's fleet available for shorter-term use by contractual or occasional customers.
5
 
     Capital expenditures excluding acquisition costs were $1.41 billion for the full-year 2005, compared with $1.17 billion in 2004. Net capital expenditures (including proceeds from the sale of assets) were $1.08 billion, up from $833.1 million in 2004. The increase in capital expenditures reflects higher vehicle replacements primarily related to customer contract extensions and renewals in the lease product line. Heightened lease extension and renewal activity in 2005 helped to lengthen the average remaining term among Ryder's lease customers, thereby improving the overall value of the Company's portfolio of contractual business.
Leverage and Free Cash Flow
     Free cash flow for 2005 was a negative $209.8 million compared with $146.7 million for 2004, primarily due to the funding requirements associated with higher capital spending and income tax payments, which included a $176.0 million payment related to the previously disclosed resolution of the 1998 to 2000 federal tax audit. Balance sheet debt as of December 31, 2005 increased by $402.2 million compared with year-end 2004, due to negative free cash flow, and stock repurchases including the buy back of $109 million of the Company's common stock under the recently announced $175 million share repurchase plan. The leverage ratio for balance sheet debt as of December 31, 2005 was 143% compared with 118% at year-end 2004. Total obligations to equity as of December 31, 2005 were 151%, up from 129% at year-end 2004. The Company's long-term target range for total obligations to equity is 250% to 300%, which largely reflects the liquidity of the Company's vehicle portfolio and the substantial revenue component that is supported by long-term customer contracts related to those assets.
     Ryder forecasts full-year 2006 earnings to be in the range of $3.75 to $3.90 per diluted share. This represents an EPS increase of 10% to 14% over Ryder's comparable full-year 2005 EPS. Full-year 2006 EPS include an $0.08 benefit from the forecasted lower number of diluted shares outstanding, principally driven by the Company's recently announced share repurchase plan; this was more than offset by $0.10 of incremental costs related to the expensing of stock-based compensation. The Company also established a first quarter 2006 EPS forecast of $0.65 to $0.70.

     "We are forecasting Ryder's 2006 revenue to grow by 3% to 4%, and operating revenue to grow by 4% to 5%," said Ryder Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Greg Swienton. "Having completed another year of consistently better performance, including progress in revenue and earnings in every segment, Ryder is well-positioned to deliver on our business objectives for 2006."
     To support the planned replacement of vehicles assigned to long-term lease customers, the Company anticipates 2006 capital expenditures to be approximately $1.6 billion; net capital expenditures (including proceeds from sale of assets) are expected to be approximately $1.2 billion. Free cash flow is expected to be in the range of negative $90 million to negative $170 million in 2006, due to funding requirements associated with higher capital spending.
     Commenting on the Company's financial plan for 2006, Ryder Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Tracy Leinbach said, "We will continue to utilize our balance sheet capacity to support our growth needs. Specifically, we plan investments in sales and operational capabilities as well as building a stronger Asia presence including China Operations to enhance our operating efficiency and enable growth. We continue to identify and target process improvements and cost initiatives in areas throughout the Company. Taken together, these actions should provide additional earnings leverage in 2006 and beyond."
