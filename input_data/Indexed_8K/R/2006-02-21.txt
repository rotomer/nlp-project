Item 4.01 Changes in Registrant's Certifying Accountant.
Explanatory Note: The Registrant filed a Current Report on Form 8-K dated September 22, 2005 to report the decision of the Audit Committee of the Companys Board of Directors to dismiss and replace the Company's independent auditor. This amendment is being filed to update the information as of the date hereof. The Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors solicited proposals from the four major accounting firms and conducted an extensive evaluation process in connection with the selection of the Company's independent auditor for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2006. Following this process, on September 22, 2005, the Audit Committee dismissed KPMG LLP ("KPMG") as its independent auditor for the Company's fiscal year ending December 31, 2006 and appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PwC") to serve as the Company's independent auditor for 2006. KPMG has completed its engagement as the Company's auditor for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2005. KPMG's audit reports on the Company's consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 did not contain an adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, nor were they qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles, except that KPMG's audit report dated February 15, 2006 included an explanatory paragraph related to the change in method of accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations in 2005 and methods of accounting for variable interest entities and asset retirement obligations in 2003 and the report dated February 22, 2005 included an explanatory paragraph related to the change in methods of accounting for variable interest entities and asset retirement obligations in 2003 and method of accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets in 2002. The audit reports of KPMG on management's assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005 and 200 4 did not contain an adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, nor were they qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles. During the Company's two most recent fiscal years and from the period from January 1, 2006 to February 17, 2006, (i) there were no disagreements between the Company and KPMG on any matters of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of KPMG, would have caused KPMG to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreement in its report on the Company's consolidated financial statements, and (ii) there were no "reportable events" as that term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K. The Company has provided KPMG with a copy of the foregoing statements and has requested and received from KPMG a letter addressed to the Securities and Exchange Commission stating whether or not KPMG agrees with the above statements. A copy of the letter from KPMG is attached as Exhibit 16.1 to this Form 8-K/A. During the Companys two most recent fiscal years and from the period from January 1, 2006 to February 17, 2006, neither the Company nor anyone acting on behalf of the Company, consulted PwC regarding any of the matters or events set forth in Item 3.04(a)(2) of Regulation S-K.

Exhibit 16.1
February 21, 2006
Securities and Exchange Commission Washington, D.C. 20549
Ladies and Gentlemen:
We are currently principal accountants for Ryder System, Inc. and, under the date of February 15, 2006, we reported on the consolidated financial statements of Ryder System, Inc. as of and for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, and management's assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005. On September 22, 2005, we were notified that Ryder System, Inc. engaged PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as its principal accountant for the year ending December 31, 2006 and that the auditor-client relationship with KPMG LLP will cease upon completion of the audit of Ryder System, Inc.'s consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2005, management's assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005 and the issuance of our reports thereon. On February 15, 2006, we completed our audit and the auditor-client relationship ceased. We have read Ryder System, Inc's statements included under Item 4.01 of its Form 8-K/A dated February 21, 2006, and we agree with such statements, except that we are not in a position to agree or disagree with Ryder System, Inc.'s statements (i) that the Audit Committee solicited proposals from the four major accounting firms and conducted an extensive evaluation process in connection with the selection of the Company's independent auditor for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2006 and (ii) that PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP were not engaged regarding the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on Ryder System, Inc.'s consolidated financial statements.
Very truly yours,
/s/ KPMG LLP
