Exhibit 99.1
News Release
      Ryder System, Inc. (NYSE: R), a global leader in transportation and supply chain management solutions, today reported net earnings of $47.6 million for the three-month period ended March 31, 2006, up 15% compared with $41.5 million in the same period of 2005. Earnings per diluted share (EPS) were $0.77 for the first quarter of 2006, up 20% compared with $0.64 in the year-earlier period. All business segments reported improved results reflecting better operating performance and continuing leverage from revenue growth. EPS improvement also reflects the impact of a stock repurchase program completed in February of 2006.
MIAMI, April 27, 2006
     Revenue for the first quarter of 2006 was $1.50 billion, up 14% from $1.32 billion in the comparable period last year with all business segments reporting revenue growth. Operating revenue (revenue excluding fuel and subcontracted transportation) in the first quarter of 2006 was $1.06 billion, up 5% compared with $1.01 billion in the year-earlier period. Fleet Management Solutions (FMS) business segment revenue grew 6% driven by higher fuel services revenue and full service lease contract growth. Supply Chain Solutions (SCS) business segment revenue grew 35% in the first quarter of 2006 driven by increased volume of managed subcontracted transportation as well as higher volumes and new and expanded business in all industry groups. Dedicated Contract Carriage (DCC) business segment revenue increased 8% due to new and expanded business and pricing increases associated with higher fuel costs.
     EPS for the first quarter of 2006 included a one-time recovery of $0.02 associated with the recognition of common stock received from mutual insurance companies in a prior year. EPS for the year-earlier quarter included a one-time recovery of $0.02 associated with the reimbursement of project costs incurred in prior years.

     "Our continued focus in the first quarter enabled us to exceed our forecast and again deliver higher earnings and organic operating revenue growth in every segment," said Ryder Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Greg Swienton. "This consistent performance points to the strength and stability of our largely contract-based business model."
     Ryder's primary measurement of business segment financial performance, Net Before Tax (NBT), allocates Central Support Services to each business segment and excludes restructuring items.
Fleet Management Solutions
     Ryder's Fleet Management Solutions (FMS) business segment combines several capabilities into a comprehensive package that provides one-stop outsourcing of the acquisition, maintenance, management and disposal of vehicles. Ryder's commercial rental service offers customers a method to expand their fleets in order to address specific or short-term capacity needs.
     In the FMS business segment, revenue in the first quarter of 2006 was $981.2 million, up 6% compared with $924.6 million in the year-earlier period. Fuel services revenue for the first quarter of 2006 increased 22% compared with the same period in 2005 due primarily to higher fuel pricing as a result of market cost increases. Operating revenue (revenue excluding fuel) in the first quarter of 2006 was $699.4 million, up 1% compared with $693.4 million in the year-earlier period. Full service lease revenue for the first quarter of 2006 was up 2% from the same period last year due primarily to growth in the U.S. business. Commercial rental revenue decreased 2% from the year-earlier period, reflecting an 8% smaller average fleet partially offset by higher pricing. Contract maintenance and contract-related maintenance revenue decreased 3% in the first quarter of 2006 compared with the same period last year, due primarily to lower transactional maintenance services.

     The FMS business segment's NBT increased to $74.9 million in the first quarter of 2006, up 6% compared with $70.9 million in the same period of 2005. This improvement was related primarily to better North American lease and commercial rental performance and lower maintenance and depreciation costs. Those results were partially offset by higher interest due to planned higher debt levels and increased overhead costs, as well as lower margins in the Company's U.K. operations. First quarter 2005 NBT included a one-time reimbursement of approximately $2 million in costs related to a project in prior years. Business segment NBT as a percentage of operating revenue was 10.7% in the first quarter of 2006, up 50 basis points compared with 10.2% in the same quarter a year ago.
Supply Chain Solutions
     Ryder's Supply Chain Solutions (SCS) business segment enables customers to improve shareholder value and their customers' satisfaction by enhancing supply chain performance and reducing costs. The solutions involve management of the logistics pipeline as a synchronized, integrated process  from raw material supply to finished goods distribution. By improving business processes and employing new technologies, the flow of goods and cash is made faster and consumes less capital.
     In the SCS business segment, first quarter 2006 revenue totaled $469.5 million, up 35% from $346.8 million in the comparable period in 2005. Revenue grew primarily due to increased volume of managed subcontracted transportation, as well as higher volumes and new and expanded business in all industry groups. First quarter 2006 operating revenue (revenue excluding subcontracted transportation) was $272.4 million, up 14% compared with $238.1 million in the comparable period a year ago.
     The SCS business segment's NBT was $10.7 million in the first quarter of 2006, up 64% from $6.5 million in the same quarter of 2005. Comparative business segment earnings benefited from higher volumes (including reduced automotive plant shutdowns) and new and expanded business in all U.S. industry groups in 2006. First quarter 2006 NBT for the business segment as a percentage of operating revenue was 3.9%, compared with 2.7% in the same quarter of 2005.

Dedicated Contract Carriage
     Ryder's Dedicated Contract Carriage (DCC) business segment provides customers with vehicles, drivers, management, and administrative support, with the assets committed to a specific customer for a contractual term. DCC supports customers with both basic and sophisticated logistics and transportation needs including routing and scheduling, specialized driver services, and logistical engineering support.
     In the DCC business segment, first quarter 2006 revenue totaled $138.7 million, up 8% compared with $128.0 million in the first quarter of 2005. Operating revenue (revenue excluding subcontracted transportation) in the first quarter of 2006 was $133.6 million, up 7% compared with $124.8 million in the year-earlier period. Revenue grew due to new and expanded business and pricing increases associated with higher fuel costs.
     The DCC business segment's NBT in the first quarter of 2006 was $8.5 million, up 44% compared with $5.9 million in the first quarter of 2005. Business segment NBT was positively impacted by new and expanded business, as well as lower safety costs. Business segment NBT as a percentage of operating revenue was 6.3% in the first quarter of 2006, compared with 4.7% in the year-earlier period.
Central Support Services
     Central Support Services (CSS) are overhead costs incurred to support all business segments and product lines. Substantially all CSS costs are allocated to the various business segments.
     In the first quarter of 2006, CSS costs were $44.6 million, compared with $49.0 million in the year-earlier period. The first quarter 2006 decrease reflects lower information technology spending from ongoing cost containment initiatives and the one-time recovery of $1.9 million associated with the recognition of common stock received from mutual insurance companies in a prior year.

Capital Expenditures
     In Ryder's business, capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue-earning equipment (trucks, tractors, and trailers) primarily to support the full service lease product line and secondarily to support the commercial rental product line within Ryder's Fleet Management Solutions business segment. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long-term agreements that result in predictable revenues and cash flows to Ryder typically over a three- to ten-year term. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the Company's fleet available for shorter-term use by contractual or occasional customers.
     Capital expenditures excluding acquisition costs were $368.9 million for the first quarter of 2006, compared with $506.4 million in the same period of 2005. Net capital expenditures (including proceeds from sale of used vehicles) were $279.9 million for the first quarter of 2006, down from $428.0 million in the year-earlier period. The decrease in capital expenditures reflects the timing of the delivery of new rental vehicle orders in 2005, which occurred earlier than in the current year, and was partially offset by increased lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. The Company anticipates full-year 2006 capital expenditures to be approximately $1.6 billion, up from $1.4 billion in 2005, in order to support the planned replacement and expansion of vehicles assigned to long-term lease customers. Net capital expenditures for the full-year 2006 are expected to be approximately $1.2 billion, up from $1.1 billion in 2005.
Free Cash Flow and Leverage
     Free cash flow in the first quarter of 2006 was negative $107.8 million and improved on a comparative basis from negative $381.8 million for the year-earlier period, primarily due to lower capital spending and lower income tax payments as the year-earlier period included a $176 million payment related to the 1998 to 2000 tax years. Balance sheet debt as of March 31, 2006 increased by $113.4 million compared with year-end 2005, primarily due to negative free cash flow, and stock repurchases of $66 million under a $175 million share repurchase program completed in February 2006. The leverage ratio for balance sheet debt as of March 31, 2006 was 151%, compared with 143% at year-end 2005. Total obligations to equity as of March 31, 2006

were 159%, up from 151% at year-end 2005. The Company's long-term target range for total obligations to equity is 250% to 300%, which largely reflects the liquidity of the Company's vehicle portfolio and the substantial revenue component that is supported by long-term customer contracts related to those assets.
     Commenting on Ryder's outlook, Mr. Swienton said, "Our sales and operations professionals helped Ryder deliver better than expected revenue and earnings for the first quarter and increased our momentum for delivering profitable revenue growth in all business segments in 2006."
     He continued, "We are increasing our full-year 2006 forecast by $0.07 to a range of $3.82 to $3.97 per share. We are forecasting second quarter EPS to be in the range of $0.95 to $1.00." Last year, in the second quarter, the Company earned $0.86 per share, excluding a $0.12 income tax benefit related to a change in Ohio income tax law.
