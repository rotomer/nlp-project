Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On October 25, 2006, we issued a press release reporting our financial results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2006 (the "Press Release"). We also hosted a conference call and webcast on October 25, 2006 during which we made a presentation on our financial results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2006 (the "Presentation"). The Press Release and the Presentation are available on our website at www.ryder.com.
The Press Release and the Presentation include information regarding our net earnings and earnings per share excluding tax changes and pension charge, which are non-GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC regulations. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors as the measures exclude from our GAAP earnings and earnings per share tax changes and a pension charge unrelated to our ongoing business operations. Additional information regarding non-GAAP financial measures can be found in the Press Release, the Presentation and our reports filed with the SEC.
The information in this Report, including Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2, is being furnished pursuant to Item 2.02 of Form 8-K and General Instruction B.2 thereunder and shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, except as expressly set forth by specific reference to such filing.
Item 9.01(d) Exhibits
     The following exhibits are furnished as part of this Report on Form 8-K:
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

 
EXHIBIT 99.1
News Release
      Ryder System, Inc. (NYSE: R), a global leader in transportation and supply chain management solutions, today reported earnings per diluted share (EPS) of $1.06 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2006, up 8% compared with $0.98 in the year-earlier period. Earnings in the current period included a one-time, non-cash after-tax charge of $3.5 million to adjust the accounting for certain pension costs. Excluding this charge, EPS was up 14% to $1.12, compared with the Company's previous EPS forecast range of $1.05 to $1.10 for the third quarter of 2006. EPS improvement reflects better business segment results and the impact of a stock repurchase program completed in February of 2006.
MIAMI, October 25, 2006
     Net earnings for the third quarter of 2006 were $65.3 million compared with $63.3 million in the year-earlier period. Excluding the pension accounting charge, earnings were up 9% to $68.8 million driven by better operating performance and continuing leverage from revenue growth in the Supply Chain Solutions (SCS) and Dedicated Contract Carriage (DCC) segments.
     Revenue for the third quarter of 2006 was $1.62 billion, up 9% from $1.49 billion in the comparable period last year with all business segments reporting revenue growth. Operating revenue (revenue excluding fuel and subcontracted transportation) was $1.14 billion, up 7% compared with $1.07 billion in the year-earlier period. Fleet Management Solutions (FMS) business segment revenue grew 5% driven by higher fuel services revenue and full service lease contract growth. SCS business segment revenue grew 19% in the third quarter of 2006 driven by higher volumes and new and expanded business in all industry groups, and an increase in
     1
 
managed subcontracted transportation. DCC business segment revenue increased 5% due to new and expanded business, and pricing increases associated with higher fuel costs.
     Earnings for the third quarter of 2006 were negatively affected by a one-time, non-cash after-tax charge of $3.5 million recorded to adjust the accounting for prior service costs related to retiree pension benefit improvements made in 1995 and 2000. During the quarter, the Company determined that these costs had not been amortized over the appropriate periods; however, the amounts involved were not material to the Company's financial statements in any individual prior period. The adjustment recorded resulted in a cumulative correction that reduced earnings for the quarter.
     "We delivered a 14% increase in comparable EPS from 7% higher operating revenue, reflecting continued strong earnings on accelerated contractual revenue growth," said Ryder Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Greg Swienton. "We were particularly pleased with the revenue and earnings growth across all industries of our supply chain business, including automotive, industrial, and notably strong performance within the high-tech and consumer sectors."
     Revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2006 was $4.71 billion, up 12% from $4.20 billion in the same period of 2005. Operating revenue (revenue excluding fuel and subcontracted transportation) for the first nine months of 2006 was $3.31 billion, up 6% from $3.12 billion in the same period of 2005. Ryder's 2006 year-to-date net earnings were $183.1 million, compared with $168.1 million in the year-earlier period. EPS was $2.97 through the first nine months of 2006 compared with $2.60 for the same period of 2005. EPS included an $0.11 income tax benefit related to a change in Texas and Canada income tax laws in 2006 and a $0.12 income tax benefit related to a change in Ohio income tax laws in 2005. Excluding the income tax benefits in both years and the previously discussed pension accounting charge, comparable year-to-date net earnings were up 12% to $179.9 million, and EPS was up 17% to $2.91, compared with the year-earlier period.
     Ryder's primary measurement of business segment financial performance, Net Before

Tax (NBT), allocates Central Support Services to each business segment.
Fleet Management Solutions
     Ryder's Fleet Management Solutions (FMS) business segment combines several capabilities into a comprehensive package that provides one-stop outsourcing of the acquisition, maintenance, management, and disposal of vehicles. Ryder's commercial rental service offers customers a method to expand their fleets in order to address short-term capacity needs.
     In the FMS business segment, revenue in the third quarter of 2006 was $1.06 billion, up 5% compared with $1.01 billion in the year-earlier period. Fuel services revenue for the third quarter of 2006 increased 10% compared with the same period in 2005 due primarily to higher fuel pricing as a result of market cost increases. Operating revenue (revenue excluding fuel) in the third quarter of 2006 was $750.1 million, up 3% compared with $728.6 million in the year-earlier period. Full service lease revenue for the quarter was up 4% from the same period last year reflecting growth in all geographic markets. In the quarter, contract maintenance revenue increased 10% due to new sales activity, and contract-related maintenance revenue grew 4% from increased transactional business. Commercial rental revenue decreased 1% from the year-earlier period, reflecting a decline in rental fleet utilization.
     The FMS business segment's NBT increased to $103.7 million in the third quarter of 2006, up 1% compared with $102.6 million in the same period of 2005. This improvement was related primarily to better North American lease and contract maintenance performance and lower depreciation costs. Those results were offset partially by higher marketing expenses, sales force and other compensation-related expenses in North America. Interest expense increased due primarily to planned higher debt levels to support investment in the contractual full service lease fleet, and higher leverage from share repurchases. Business segment NBT as a percentage of operating revenue was 13.8% in the third quarter of 2006, down 30 basis points compared with 14.1% in the same quarter a year ago.
Supply Chain Solutions
     Ryder's Supply Chain Solutions (SCS) business segment enables customers to improve shareholder value and their customers' satisfaction by enhancing supply chain performance and reducing costs. The solutions involve management of the logistics pipeline as a synchronized,
     3
 
integrated process  from raw material supply to finished goods distribution. By improving business processes and employing new technologies, the flow of goods and cash is made faster and consumes less capital.
     In the SCS business segment, third quarter 2006 revenue totaled $513.8 million, up 19% from $433.4 million in the comparable period in 2005. Revenue grew primarily due to higher volumes and new and expanded business in all industry groups, and an increase in managed subcontracted transportation. Third quarter 2006 operating revenue (revenue excluding subcontracted transportation) was $299.1 million, up 18% compared with $254.3 million in the year-earlier period.
     The SCS business segment's NBT was $16.4 million in the third quarter of 2006, up 54% from $10.6 million in the same quarter of 2005. The earnings increase was due to higher volumes and new and expanded business in all U.S. industry groups and better margins in the Company's Brazil operations. Third quarter 2006 NBT for the business segment as a percentage of operating revenue was up 130 basis points at 5.5%, compared with 4.2% in the same quarter of 2005.
Dedicated Contract Carriage
     Ryder's Dedicated Contract Carriage (DCC) business segment provides customers with vehicles, drivers, management, and administrative support, with the assets committed to a specific customer for a contractual term. DCC supports customers with both basic and sophisticated logistics and transportation needs including routing and scheduling, specialized driver services, and logistical engineering support.
     In the DCC business segment, third quarter 2006 revenue totaled $146.4 million, up 5% compared with $139.0 million in the third quarter of 2005. Operating revenue (revenue excluding subcontracted transportation) in the third quarter of 2006 was $140.7 million, up 5% from $134.6 million in the year-earlier period. Revenue increased due to new and expanded business, as well as higher fuel costs passed through to customers.
     The DCC business segment's NBT in the third quarter of 2006 was $11.7 million, up 27% compared with $9.2 million in the third quarter of 2005. Business segment NBT was positively impacted by new and expanded business and lower safety costs. Business segment
     4
 
NBT as a percentage of operating revenue was 8.3% in the third quarter of 2006, up 150 basis points from 6.8% in the year-earlier period.
Central Support Services
     Central Support Services (CSS) are overhead costs incurred to support all business segments and product lines. Substantially all CSS costs are allocated to the various business segments. In the third quarter of 2006, CSS costs were flat at $49.1 million, as lower information technology spending, principally from ongoing cost containment initiatives, was offset by higher share-based compensation from the expensing of stock options and incentive compensation.
Capital Expenditures
     In Ryder's business, capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue-earning equipment (trucks, tractors, and trailers) primarily to support the full service lease product line and secondarily to support the commercial rental product line within Ryder's Fleet Management Solutions business segment. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long-term agreements that result in predictable revenues and cash flows to Ryder typically over a three- to ten-year term. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the Company's fleet available for shorter-term use by contractual or occasional customers.
     Capital expenditures were $1.26 billion for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2006, compared with $1.15 billion in the same period of 2005. Net capital expenditures (including proceeds from the sale of assets) were $1.01 billion for the first nine months of 2006, up from $894.8 million in the same period of 2005. The increase in capital expenditures reflects higher lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets.

Cash Flow and Leverage
     Operating cash flow through September 30, 2006 was $611.6 million, up 30% from $470.8 million in the same period of 2005. Total cash generated (including proceeds from used vehicle sales) through September 30, 2006, was $921.9 million, up 19% from $773.1 million in the same period of 2005. Free cash flow through September 30, 2006 was negative $253.8 million compared with negative $347.8 million for the year-earlier period. The improvement was due primarily to lower income tax payments, as the year-earlier period included a $176 million payment related to the 1998 to 2000 tax years, offset partially by increased capital spending.
     Balance sheet debt as of September 30, 2006 increased by $446.8 million compared with year-end 2005, due primarily to increased capital spending required to support contractual revenue growth, and the impact of share repurchases. The leverage ratio for balance sheet debt as of September 30, 2006 was 160%, compared with 143% at year-end 2005. Total obligations to equity as of September 30, 2006 were 166%, up from 151% at year-end 2005. The Company's long-term target range for total obligations to equity is 250% to 300%, which largely reflects the liquidity of the Company's vehicle portfolio and the substantial revenue component that is supported by long-term customer contracts related to those assets.
     Commenting on Ryder's outlook, Mr. Swienton said, "Going forward, we are focused on optimizing returns on our commercial rental fleet, while accelerating the profitable growth of all of our contractual business within Fleet Management Solutions. We are also committed to the profitable growth of our offerings within Dedicated Contract Carriage and Supply Chain Solutions, which are entirely contract-based."
     He continued, "We are setting our full-year 2006 forecast range at $4.01 to $4.06 per share including the $0.06 pension charge; this is based on a reaffirmation of our fourth quarter 2006 EPS forecast in the range of $1.05 to $1.10." Ryder's current full-year 2006 earnings forecast, excluding the tax changes and pension charge, is raised to the range of $3.96 to $4.01 per share.
