Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On July 25, 2007, we issued a press release reporting our financial results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2007 (the "Press Release"). We also hosted a conference call and webcast on July 25, 2007 during which we made a presentation on our financial results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2007 (the "Presentation"). The Press Release and the Presentation are available on our website at www.ryder.com.
The Press Release and the Presentation include information regarding our 2006 net earnings and earnings per share excluding tax changes, which are non-GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC regulations. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors as the measures exclude from our GAAP earnings and earnings per share tax law changes which provided benefits unrelated to our ongoing business operations. Additional information regarding non-GAAP financial measures can be found in the Press Release, the Presentation and our reports filed with the SEC.
The information in this Report, including Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2, is being furnished pursuant to Item 2.02 of Form 8-K and General Instruction B.2 thereunder and shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, except as expressly set forth by specific reference to such filing.
Item 9.01(d) Exhibits
     The following exhibits are furnished as part of this Report on Form 8-K:
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

 
EXHIBIT 99.1
News Release
RYDER REPORTS SECOND QUARTER 2007 RESULTS
      Ryder System, Inc. (NYSE: R), a global leader in transportation and supply chain management solutions, today reported earnings per diluted share (EPS) for the three-month period ended June 30, 2007 were $1.07, compared with $1.13 in the year-earlier period. EPS in the year-earlier period included an $0.11 income tax benefit related to changes in Texas and Canadian income tax laws. Excluding the tax benefit in 2006, EPS for the second quarter were up 5% from comparable EPS of $1.02 in the year-earlier period. EPS in the current period included $0.01 of restructuring costs related primarily to early debt retirement.
MIAMI, July 25, 2007
     Net earnings for the second quarter of 2007 were $65.1 million, compared with $70.3 million in the year-earlier period. Net earnings in the year-earlier period included an income tax benefit of $6.8 million related to changes in Texas and Canadian income tax laws. Excluding the tax benefit in the prior year, second quarter 2007 net earnings were up 3%.
     Revenue for the second quarter of 2007 was $1.66 billion, up 4% from $1.60 billion in the same period last year driven by contractual revenue growth in the Supply Chain Solutions (SCS) and Fleet Management Solutions (FMS) business segments. Operating revenue (revenue excluding fuel and subcontracted transportation) was $1.16 billion, up 4% compared with $1.11 billion in the year-earlier period. Fleet Management Solutions business segment revenue declined 1% due to substantially lower commercial rental and fuel services revenue which offset contractual revenue growth of 7%. SCS business segment revenue grew 16% in the second quarter, driven by new and expanded business. Dedicated Contract Carriage (DCC) business segment revenue decreased 2% compared with the same period in the prior year driven by lower volumes of managed subcontracted transportation and fuel cost pass-throughs.
 
     Commenting on the Company's second quarter performance, Ryder Chairman and CEO Greg Swienton said, "Our team was able to deliver a solid quarter despite headwinds from a commercial rental market that is considerably weaker than expected. Results continued to be driven by the growth of our core contractual businesses. In view of market conditions, we're particularly pleased with the growth of our contractual Fleet Management Solutions business segment which included a 6% increase in full service lease revenue and growth of 18% in contract maintenance revenue. In our Supply Chain Solutions business, which is also contract based, international operations showed significant growth in the quarter."
     Revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2007 was $3.25 billion, up 5% from $3.09 billion in the same period of 2006. Operating revenue (revenue excluding fuel and subcontracted transportation) for the first half of 2007 was $2.28 billion, up 5% from $2.17 billion in the first half of 2006. Ryder's net earnings in the first half of 2007 were $116.4 million, compared with $117.9 million in the year-earlier period. EPS were $1.90 for the first six months of 2007 compared with $1.91 for the same period of 2006. Excluding the previously discussed income tax benefit in 2006, year-to-date 2007 net earnings and EPS were up 5% and 6%, respectively, compared with the year-earlier period. EPS in the first half of 2007 included $0.02 of restructuring costs related primarily to early debt retirement and costs incurred in connection with previously announced cost-savings initiatives. EPS for the first half of 2006 included a one-time recovery of $0.02 associated with the recognition of common stock received from mutual insurance companies in a prior year.
     Ryder's primary measurement of business segment financial performance, Net Before Tax (NBT), allocates Central Support Services to each business segment and excludes restructuring items.
Fleet Management Solutions
     Ryder's Fleet Management Solutions (FMS) business segment combines several capabilities into a comprehensive package that provides one-stop outsourcing of the acquisition,
 
maintenance, management, and disposal of vehicles. Ryder's commercial rental service offers customers a method to expand their fleets in order to address short-term capacity needs.
     In the FMS business segment, revenue in the second quarter of 2007 was $1.04 billion, down 1% compared with $1.05 billion in the year-earlier period. Fuel services revenue in the second quarter of 2007 decreased 8% compared with the same period in 2006 due primarily to reduced volume. Operating revenue (revenue excluding fuel) in the second quarter of 2007 was $742.2 million, up 2% compared with $730.1 million in the year-earlier period. Operating revenue grew primarily as a result of a 7% increase in contractual revenue, which includes full service lease and contract maintenance, largely offset by a decrease in commercial rental revenue. Full service lease revenue increased 6% in the second quarter of 2007 due to growth in all geographic markets served. Contract maintenance revenue increased 18% in the second quarter of 2007 due primarily to new sales activity. Commercial rental revenue, which accounts for less than 10% of the Company's total revenue, decreased 15% due to weak market demand in North America.
     The FMS business segment's NBT increased to $97.5 million in the second quarter of 2007, up 3% compared with $94.9 million in the same period of 2006. This increase was related primarily to improved contractual business performance as well as lower pension and incentive-based compensation costs. Those results were partially offset by a decline in commercial rental results and higher carrying costs on the Company's increased inventory of used vehicles held for sale. Gains from the sale of used vehicles decreased in the second quarter compared with the year-earlier period, driven by lower pricing, partially offset by a greater number of vehicles sold. Business segment NBT as a percentage of operating revenue was 13.1% in the second quarter of 2007, up 10 basis points compared with 13.0% in the same quarter a year ago.
Supply Chain Solutions
     Ryder's Supply Chain Solutions (SCS) business segment enables customers to improve shareholder value and their customers' satisfaction by enhancing supply chain performance and reducing costs. The solutions involve management of the logistics pipeline as a synchronized, integrated process  from materials and components to finished goods distribution. By improving business processes and employing new technologies, the flow of goods and cash is made faster and consumes less capital.
 
     In the SCS business segment, second quarter 2007 revenue totaled $584.0 million, up 16% from $502.1 million in the comparable period in 2006. Revenue grew primarily due to new and expanded business, and higher volumes particularly in international markets served. Second quarter 2007 operating revenue (revenue excluding subcontracted transportation) was $330.0 million, up 13% compared with $291.3 million in the year-earlier period.
     The SCS business segment's NBT was $15.5 million in the second quarter of 2007, down 14% from $18.1 million in the same quarter of 2006. Excluding a $2.5 million benefit in the year-earlier period related to a contract termination, business segment earnings were flat for the quarter. Comparative business segment earnings benefited from new and expanded business, offset by a significant automotive plant closure. Second quarter 2007 NBT for the business segment as a percentage of operating revenue was 4.7%, compared with 5.3% in the same quarter of 2006 (excluding the contract termination benefit).
Dedicated Contract Carriage
     Ryder's Dedicated Contract Carriage (DCC) business segment provides customers with vehicles, drivers, management, and administrative support, with the assets committed to a specific customer for a contractual term. DCC supports customers with both basic and sophisticated logistics and transportation needs including routing and scheduling, specialized driver services, and logistical engineering support.
     In the DCC business segment, second quarter 2007 revenue totaled $141.1 million, down 2% compared with $143.5 million in the second quarter of 2006. Operating revenue (revenue excluding subcontracted transportation) in the second quarter of 2007 was $138.1 million, down 1% from $139.1 million in the year-earlier period. Revenue decreased due to lower subcontracted transportation revenue and fuel cost pass-throughs.
     The DCC business segment's NBT in the second quarter of 2007 was $12.5 million, up 12% compared with $11.2 million in the second quarter of 2006. Business segment NBT was positively impacted by lower safety and insurance costs and better operating performance. Business segment NBT as a percentage of operating revenue was 9.1% in the second quarter of 2007, up 110 basis points from 8.0% in the year-earlier period.
 
Central Support Services
     Central Support Services (CSS) are overhead costs incurred to support all business segments and product lines. Substantially all CSS costs are allocated to the various business segments. In the second quarter of 2007, CSS costs were $48.2 million, compared with $48.9 million in the year-earlier period. The second quarter of 2007 reflects lower incentive-based compensation partially offset by a charge of $1.8 million related to an adjustment in the amortization period of restricted stock units. The second quarter 2006 costs included a charge of $1.3 million related to the settlement of litigation associated with a discontinued operation.
Capital Expenditures
     In Ryder's business, capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue-earning equipment (trucks, tractors, and trailers) primarily to support the full service lease product line and secondarily to support the commercial rental product line within Ryder's Fleet Management Solutions business segment. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long-term agreements that result in predictable revenues and cash flows to Ryder typically over a three- to ten-year term. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the Company's fleet available for shorter-term use by contractual or occasional customers.
     Capital expenditures were $788.1 million for the first half of 2007, compared with $814.5 million in the same period of 2006. Net capital expenditures (including proceeds from the sale of assets) were $442.7 million for the first half of 2007, down from $634.8 million in the same period of 2006. The decrease in capital expenditures reflects lower lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets.
     The Company anticipates full-year 2007 capital expenditures to be approximately $1.26 billion, down from $1.76 billion in 2006, due to planned lower lease replacement activity. This represents a decrease of approximately $70 million from the Company's previous forecast, due to lower commercial rental spending.
 
Cash Flow and Leverage
     Operating cash flow through June 30, 2007 was $505.2 million, up 69% from $298.3 million in the same period of 2006. Total cash generated (including proceeds from used vehicle sales) through June 30, 2007, was $883.2 million, up 72% from $513.3 million in the same period of 2006. Free cash flow through June 30, 2007 was a negative $2.0 million compared with negative $266.9 million in the same period of 2006, primarily due to lower income tax payments, which declined by $95.3 million, and a $150.3 million sale-leaseback transaction. On a full-year basis, the Company's free cash flow forecast is expected to be $305 million, up from a previous forecast of $235 million.
     Balance sheet debt as of June 30, 2007 increased by $83.0 million compared with year-end 2006, due primarily to stock repurchases. The leverage ratio for balance sheet debt as of June 30, 2007 was 161%, compared with 164% at year-end 2006. Total obligations to equity as of June 30, 2007 were 172%, up from 168% at year-end 2006. The full-year forecast for total obligations to equity is 157%, up from a previous forecast of 140%. The Company's long-term target range for total obligations to equity is 250% to 300%, which largely reflects the liquidity of the Company's vehicle portfolio and the substantial revenue component that is supported by long-term customer contracts related to those assets.
     Commenting on Ryder's outlook, Mr. Swienton said, "We're committed to leveraging our business model improvements and asset management capabilities to navigate effectively through a challenging overall market environment. In Fleet Management Solutions, we're focused on driving continued growth in our contractual services and have taken appropriate steps to align our commercial rental fleet with demand conditions in the short-term rental market. In Supply Chain Solutions, we anticipate continued revenue expansion, although at a modest rate, partly due to the ongoing impact of a significant automotive plant closure. We also remain particularly attuned to cost management opportunities, in view of the current environment."
     He continued, "We are narrowing our full-year 2007 EPS forecast to a range of $4.30 to $4.35 from a previous range of $4.30 to $4.40 per share. Additionally, we are establishing a third quarter EPS forecast range of $1.20 to $1.23." The Company's third quarter EPS forecast
 
excludes any charges related to Michigan tax law changes enacted earlier this month, the earnings impact of which is currently being assessed.
