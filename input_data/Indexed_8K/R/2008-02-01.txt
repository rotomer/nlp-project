Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
     On February 1, 2008, we issued a press release reporting our financial results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2007 (the "Press Release"). We also hosted a conference call and webcast on February 1, 2008 during which we made a presentation on our financial results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2007 (the "Presentation"). The Press Release and the Presentation are available on our website at.
www.ryder.com
     The Press Release and the Presentation include information regarding our comparable net earnings and comparable earnings per share, which are non-GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC regulations. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors as the measures exclude from our GAAP net earnings and earnings per share (i) restructuring charges/recoveries in the third and fourth quarters of 2007, (ii) gain on the sale of property in the third quarter of 2007, (iii) pension accounting charge in the third quarter of 2006 and (iv) the impact of fourth quarter tax law changes in 2007 and tax law changes in 2006, all of which are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. Additional information regarding non-GAAP financial measures can be found in the Press Release, the Presentation and our reports filed with the SEC.
     The information in this Report, including Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2, is being furnished pursuant to Item 2.02 of Form 8-K and General Instruction B.2 thereunder and shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, except as expressly set forth by specific reference to such filing.
Item 9.01(d) Exhibits
     The following exhibits are furnished as part of this Report on Form 8-K:
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

 
Exhibit 99.1
News Release
      Ryder System, Inc. (NYSE: R), a global leader in transportation and supply chain management solutions, today reported earnings per diluted share (EPS) were $1.24 for the three-month period ended December 31, 2007, up 15% from EPS of $1.08 in the year-earlier period. Net earnings for the fourth quarter were $71.9 million, up 9% from $65.8 million in the year-earlier period. EPS and net earnings in the current period included a benefit of $0.06 and $3.6 million, respectively, related primarily to changes in Canadian income tax laws. Excluding the benefit, EPS for the fourth quarter were up 9% to $1.18 and net earnings were up 4% to $68.3 million. EPS growth exceeded earnings growth due to a decrease in the average number of shares outstanding, reflecting the impact of share repurchases. Improved contractual business performance as well as lower operating costs more than offset lower volumes in the Company's commercial rental business related to soft marketplace demand. All business segments reported improved revenue and earnings results.
MIAMI, February 1, 2008
     Total revenue for the fourth quarter of 2007 was $1.67 billion, up 5% from $1.59 billion in the comparable period last year. Operating revenue (revenue excluding fuel and subcontracted transportation) was $1.19 billion, up 4% compared with $1.15 billion in the year-earlier period. Both total and operating revenue benefited from favorable foreign exchange rates related to international operations. Fleet Management Solutions (FMS) business segment total revenue increased 8%, due to higher fuel services revenue, as well as contract revenue growth of 7%, which offset a decline in commercial rental revenue for the quarter. Supply Chain Solutions (SCS) business segment total revenue grew 1%, while operating revenue grew 5%. Dedicated Contract Carriage (DCC) business segment total revenue increased 3%, due to the pass through of higher fuel costs.

     "We're pleased that we were able to deliver earnings growth in a challenging transportation industry environment in 2007. Our financial performance through these tough conditions reflects the significant improvements we've made to our business mix, processes and business controls since the last market downturn," said Ryder Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Greg Swienton. "We increased both earnings and contractual revenue in 2007, while at the same time taking the necessary steps to position the size and mix of the transactional rental fleet to meet the market demand we anticipate in the coming year."
     Total revenue for the full-year 2007 was $6.57 billion, up 4% from $6.31 billion in the comparable period of 2006. Operating revenue of $4.64 billion was also up 4% from $4.45 billion in the same period of 2006. Ryder's full-year 2007 net earnings were $253.9 million compared with $249.0 million in the year-earlier period. EPS were $4.24 for 2007, up 5% compared with $4.04 for the same period of 2006. EPS included a $0.06 income tax benefit related primarily to a change in Canada income tax laws in 2007 and an $0.11 income tax benefit related to a change in Texas and Canada income tax laws in 2006. EPS also included a net charge of $0.03 for restructuring costs partially offset by a gain on sale of property in the third quarter of 2007 and a $0.06 pension accounting charge related to the accounting for prior service costs in 2006. Full-year 2007 comparable net earnings were $251.9 million, up 2% from $245.9 million in 2006. Full-year 2007 comparable EPS of $4.21 were up 6% from $3.99 in 2006.
     Ryder's primary measurement of business segment financial performance, Net Before Tax (NBT), allocates Central Support Services to each business segment and excludes restructuring and other items.
Fleet Management Solutions
     Ryder's Fleet Management Solutions (FMS) business segment combines several capabilities into a comprehensive package that provides one-stop outsourcing of the acquisition, maintenance, management, and disposal of vehicles. Ryder's commercial rental service offers
2
 
customers a method to expand their fleets in order to address short-term capacity needs.
     In the FMS business segment, total revenue in the fourth quarter of 2007 was $1.09 billion, up 8% compared with the year-earlier period. Fuel services revenue for the fourth quarter of 2007 increased 21% compared with the same period in 2006, due to higher fuel prices partially offset by reduced volume from lower miles driven within the commercial rental offering. Operating revenue (revenue excluding fuel) in the fourth quarter of 2007 was $764.8 million, up 3% compared with $741.3 million in the year-earlier period. Both FMS total revenue and operating revenue included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 2%. Full service lease revenue for the fourth quarter of 2007 was up 7% from the year-earlier period reflecting growth primarily in the North American market. In the quarter, contract maintenance revenue increased 10% due to new sales activity. Commercial rental revenue decreased 7% compared with the year-earlier period, due to weak U.S. market demand. As a result of the Company's actions to align the fleet size and mix with market demand, U.S. rental fleet utilization in the fourth quarter of 2007 improved over the prior-year period for the first time in the year.
     The FMS business segment's NBT increased to $102.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2007, up 8% compared with $94.5 million in the same period of 2006. This increase was related primarily to improved contractual business performance and from lower expenses related to pension, safety and insurance, and sales and marketing. Depreciation expense, although higher, benefited from a previously announced annual depreciation policy change. These results were partially offset by a decline in U.S. commercial rental results, as the Company reduced its fleet size by 12% in response to weak U.S. market demand. Commercial rental results were also impacted, to a lesser extent, by reduced pricing. In addition, used vehicle sales results were negatively impacted by wholesaling activity undertaken to reduce higher used truck inventories. Interest expense also increased in the quarter due primarily to stock repurchases. Business segment NBT as a percentage of operating revenue was 13.4% in the fourth quarter of 2007, up 60 basis points compared with 12.8% in the same quarter a year ago.
Supply Chain Solutions
     Ryder's Supply Chain Solutions (SCS) business segment enables customers to improve shareholder value and their customers' satisfaction by enhancing supply chain performance and reducing costs. The solutions involve management of the logistics pipeline as a synchronized,
3
 
integrated process  from raw material supply to finished goods distribution. By improving business processes and employing new technologies, the flow of goods and cash is made faster and consumes less capital.
     In the SCS business segment, fourth quarter 2007 total revenue was $545.8 million, up 1% from $543.1 million in the comparable period of 2006. Revenue grew primarily due to the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates, as well as new and expanded business. Growth was partially offset by net reporting of customer business previously presented on a gross basis, a previously announced automotive plant closure, and reduced business activity with certain high-tech customers. Operating revenue (revenue excluding subcontracted transportation) was $337.2 million, up 5% from $320.1 million in the comparable period a year ago. SCS total revenue and operating revenue included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 4% and 3%, respectively.
     The SCS business segment's NBT was $18.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2007, up 11% from $17.0 million in the same quarter of 2006. Business segment earnings benefited from improved international results, lower safety and insurance costs, and lower incentive-based compensation. These items were partially offset by the impact of lower revenue within the high-tech customer base. Business segment NBT as a percentage of operating revenue was 5.6% in the fourth quarter of 2007, up 30 basis points compared with 5.3% in the same quarter of 2006.
Dedicated Contract Carriage
     Ryder's Dedicated Contract Carriage (DCC) business segment provides customers with vehicles, drivers, management, and administrative support, with the assets committed to a specific customer for a contractual term. DCC supports customers with both basic and sophisticated logistics and transportation needs including routing and scheduling, specialized driver services, and logistical engineering support.
     In the DCC business segment, fourth quarter 2007 total revenue was $144.3 million, up 3% compared with $140.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2006. Operating revenue (revenue excluding subcontracted transportation) in the fourth quarter of 2007 was $140.3 million, up 3% compared with $135.6 million in the year-earlier period. Revenue increased due primarily to the pass through of higher fuel costs.
     The DCC business segment's NBT in the fourth quarter of 2007 was $12.3 million, up 9% compared with $11.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2006. Business segment NBT was
4
 
positively impacted by better operating performance. Business segment NBT as a percentage of operating revenue was 8.7% in the fourth quarter of 2007, up 40 basis points compared with 8.3% in the year-earlier period.
Central Support Services
     Central Support Services (CSS) are overhead costs incurred to support all business segments and product lines. Substantially all CSS costs are allocated to the various business segments. In the fourth quarter of 2007, CSS costs were $51.3 million, up from $48.9 million in the year-earlier period. CSS costs for the fourth quarter of 2007 include the impact of previously announced executive severance. Full-year 2007 CSS costs were $190.5 million, down from $191.0 million in 2006.
Income Taxes
     The Company's effective income tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2007 was 35.6% of pre-tax earnings compared to 35.3% in the year-earlier period. The current period income tax rate reflects a benefit of $3.3 million (3.0% of pre-tax earnings) primarily for the impact of income tax rate changes in Canada. The prior period income tax rate reflects the recognition of tax benefits as a result of audit closures, utilization of foreign net operating losses and adjustments to estimated non-deductible items.
Capital Expenditures
     In Ryder's business, capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue-earning equipment (trucks, tractors, and trailers) primarily to support the full service lease product line and secondarily to support the commercial rental product line within Ryder's Fleet Management Solutions business segment. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long-term agreements that result in predictable revenues and cash flows to Ryder typically over a three- to ten-year term. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the Company's fleet available for shorter-term use by contractual or occasional customers.
5
 
     Capital expenditures were $1.20 billion for the full-year 2007, compared with $1.76 billion in 2006. Net capital expenditures (including proceeds from the sale of assets) were $671 million, down from $1.43 billion in 2006. The decrease in capital expenditures reflects lower lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets. In addition, approximately $75 million was paid in the fourth quarter of 2007 in connection with the previously announced acquisition of Pollock NationaLease.
Cash Flow and Leverage
     Operating cash flow for the full-year 2007 was $1.10 billion, up 29% from $854 million in 2006. Total cash generated (including proceeds from used vehicle sales) for the full-year 2007, was $1.69 billion, up 35% from $1.25 billion in 2006. Free cash flow in 2007 was positive $374.5 million compared with negative $440.4 million in 2006, primarily due to improved operating cash flow, proceeds from a sale-leaseback transaction, and lower capital spending. Free cash flow excludes cash paid for acquisitions.
     Balance sheet debt as of December 31, 2007 decreased by $40.8 million compared with year-end 2006, due primarily to improved free cash flow, offset by stock repurchases. The leverage ratio for balance sheet debt as of December 31, 2007 was 147%, compared with 164% at year-end 2006. Total obligations to equity as of December 31, 2007 were 157%, down from 168% at year-end 2006. The Company's long-term target range for total obligations to equity is 250% to 300%, which largely reflects the liquidity of the Company's vehicle portfolio and the substantial revenue component that is supported by long-term customer contracts related to those assets. In December 2007, the Company announced a $300 million share repurchase program to help move the Company's leverage position toward the long-term target range. To date, there have been no repurchases made under this program.
     Ryder forecasts full-year 2008 earnings to be in the range of $4.50 to $4.65 per diluted share. This represents an EPS increase of 7% to 10% over Ryder's comparable full-year 2007 EPS of $4.21. The Company also is establishing a first quarter 2008 EPS forecast of $0.84 to $0.87. Total revenue for the full-year 2008 is forecast to be $6.18 billion, down 6% from $6.57 billion in 2007. The anticipated decline in total revenue is due to net reporting of revenue
6
 
(previously reported as gross) related to a certain SCS customer transportation services arrangement, in which Ryder's role in the purchase of subcontracted transportation was modified effective January 1, 2008. Under the terms of the new arrangement, Ryder will act as an agent rather than principal in the purchase of subcontracted transportation services. This change does not affect operating revenue or earnings. For comparison purposes, the amount by which this reporting method would have reduced total revenue in full-year 2007 was $640 million. Excluding this item, total revenue would have been forecast to increase by 4% in 2008.
     "We are forecasting Ryder's 2008 operating revenue to grow by 3% to 6%," said Mr. Swienton. "In Fleet Management Solutions, revenue growth is expected to be driven by roughly 5% growth in core contractual leasing and maintenance revenue, with commercial rental revenue that should range from being flat to up by 2%. Supply Chain total revenue is forecast to decrease by 22% to 24%, based on the aforementioned net revenue reporting change, while operating revenue should increase by 5% to 10%. Dedicated Contract Carriage total revenue and operating revenue are expected to increase by 3% to 5%. Based on the progress of our contract-related business in all segments, we enter 2008 reasonably well positioned to deliver on our profitable growth objectives. Even in an anticipated soft overall economic and transportation environment, we expect to continue to deliver solid contractual revenue growth in all of our business segments as well as increased EPS growth for the company."
     The Company anticipates 2008 capital expenditures to be $1.44 billion; net capital expenditures (including proceeds from sale of assets) are expected to be $1.10 billion. Cash from operations is forecast to be $1.22 billion with total cash generated of $1.61 billion and free cash flow of $205 million in 2008.
