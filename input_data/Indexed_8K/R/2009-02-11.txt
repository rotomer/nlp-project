Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers 2009 Compensation Programs On February 6, 2009, the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors approved compensation actions for certain of our "named executive officers" (as defined in Item 402(a)(3) of Regulation S-K). In addition, our independent directors approved certain compensation actions for Gregory T. Swienton, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. 2009 Cash Incentive Awards (Annual Bonus). The Compensation Committee and the independent directors approved the terms and conditions of the 2009 annual cash incentive awards (annual bonus) granted to our CEO and the other named executive officers under the Ryder System, Inc. 2005 Equity Compensation Plan (Plan). Each award provides for the payment of a target bonus amount (expressed as a percentage of the executives base salary) based on the achievement of certain levels of earnings per share. For 2009, the target bonus percentage approved for our CEO was 120% of b ase salary and the target bonus percentage approved with respect to our other named executive officers was 75% of base salary, which is unchanged from the target opportunity in effect for the 2008 annual cash incentive awards. 2009 Long-Term Incentive Awards. The Compensation Committee and the independent directors also approved the 2009 long-term incentive awards for our CEO and named executive officers issued under the Plan. The long-term incentive value approved for the CEO and each named executive officer is awarded 45% in stock options, 35% in performance-based restricted stock rights and 20% in performance-based cash awards. The stock options vest in three equal annual installments and expire seven years from the grant date. The performance-based restricted stock rights (PBRSRs) will vest based on our total shareholder return (generally the change in our stock price over the performance period plus dividends paid) relative to the total shareholder return of the S&P 500 compan ies for the three-year performance period ending on December 31, 2011. The performance-based restricted cash awards (PBCA) will vest based on our total shareholder return (generally the change in our stock price over the performance period plus dividends paid) relative to the total shareholder return of the 33rd percentile of the S&P 500 companies for the three-year performance period ending on December 31, 2011. Total shareholder return for both the PBRSRs and PBCA will be measured by averaging the absolute difference in cumulative Total Shareholder Return for each month of the 36 month performance period over the number of periods measured. The terms and conditions of the 2009 annual incentive cash awards, performance-based restricted stock rights and performance-based cash awards are attached as Exhibits 10.1, 10.2 and 10.3 to this Current Report on Form 8-K. Compliance with Internal Revenue Code Section 409A Except as otherwise indicated, effective January 1, 2009, we amended and restated the following compensation plans and agreements with our named executive officers. The changes are designed to make the plans and agreements comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and generally affect the timing, but not the amount of compensation paid to the named executive officers under specified circumstances.

Exhibit 10.1
The following terms and conditions apply to the 2009 annual incentive cash awards (the "Awards") granted by Ryder System, Inc. under the Ryder System, Inc. 2005 Equity Compensation Plan (the "Plan") a description of which is set forth in the relevant Guide to the Annual Incentive Compensation Program (the "Guide") to which these terms and conditions are appended. No individual shall receive an Award unless the Company has notified the individual of the Award and delivered these Terms and Condition and the Guide to the individual. Certain terms of the Award, including the performance goals and target payout amounts, are set forth in the Guide and the payout grids titled "Incentive Payout Components by Position" ("Payout Grid") applicable to the Participant. The Compensation Committee of the Company's Board of Directors (the "Committee") shall administer the Awards in accordance with the Plan. Capitalized terms used herein and not defined shall have the meaning ascribed to such terms in the Plan or the Guide.
The Award Documents supersede any and all prior oral representations, promises or guarantees relating to short-term incentives or annual bonuses. All provisions of the Award Documents shall apply unless otherwise prohibited by law.
In the event there is an express conflict between the provisions of the Plan and those set forth in the Guide or in these terms and conditions, the terms and conditions of the Plan shall govern. Unless otherwise approved by the Committee, individuals who have written agreements which specifically provide for annual incentive compensation other than that which is provided under the Award or who are participants in any other short-term incentive compensation plan of the Company or its subsidiaries and affiliates are not eligible to receive an Award hereunder. The Company may, in its sole discretion, provide discretionary or other bonuses to Company employees, whether or not they receive an Award.
The terms and conditions contained herein may be amended by the Committee as permitted by the Plan; none of the terms and conditions of the Award may be amended or waived without the prior approval of the Committee. Any amendment or waiver not approved by the Committee will be void and have no force or effect. Any employee or officer of the Company who authorizes any such amendment or waiver without the prior approval of the Committee will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including forfeiture of an Award and/or termination of employment (unless otherwise prohibited by law). All decisions and determinations made by the Committee relating to the Awards shall be final and binding on the Participant, his or her beneficiaries and any other person having or claiming an interest under the Plan.
. The Awards are intended to reward Participants for the attainment by the Company of certain performance goals and, in certain cases, individual performance. The performance metrics (the "Performance Metrics") and performance goals (the "Performance Goals") applicable to a Participant, the weight given to each of the Performance Metrics and any other requirements or limitations of the Awards are approved by the Committee, may vary based on the Participant's Management Level, position and responsibilities and will be set forth in the Guide and the Payout Grid applicable to such Participant.
Financial Performance Goals; Performance Period
Once established, Performance Goals shall not be changed during the year; provided, however, if the Committee determines that external changes or other unanticipated business conditions have materially affected the fairness of the Performance Goals, then appropriate adjustments may be made to the Performance Goals (either up or down) during the year.
The Participant's target incentive award (expressed as a percentage of the Participant's Eligible Base Salary) to be paid under the Award, as approved by the Committee, is also set forth in the Guide.
For purposes of the Award, Eligible Base Salary means the annual rate of pay for the Performance Period, excluding all other compensation paid to the Participant during the year, including but not limited to bonuses, incentives, commissions, car allowance, employee benefits, relocation expenses, and any imputed income for which the Participant may be eligible (all as more fully described in the Guide). As soon as practicable after the end of the Performance Period, the Committee will determine the attainment of the Performance Goals, to the extent applicable, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), provided that, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, exclude or include certain items from actual results in determining performance including (i) changes in accounting principle, standard or policy; (ii) changes in law or regulation; (iii) asset impairments; (iv) restructuring charges; (v) discontinued operations; and (vi) significant non-operational or non-recurring items, in each case, other than those included in the Company's 2009 business plan.
The Committee may increase or decrease a Participant's Payout Amount (as defined below) based on the Participant's individual performance by way of a performance modifier to the extent provided in the Guide; provided, however that in no event may the Payout Amount for a Participant that is in a Management Level of 14 or above be increased by way of a performance modifier.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Participant is terminated by the Company or a Subsidiary prior to the Payment Date and is subsequently re-employed by the Company or a Subsidiary prior to the Payment Date, such Participant shall be eligible to receive a pro-rata payment on the Payment Date based on the number of days during the Performance Period that the Participant was considered to be an active employee as determined by the Company, provided that, any such payment shall be reduced by any amounts previously paid to Participant in connection with his or her termination of employment pursuant to the preceding paragraph or otherwise in lieu of amounts earned under the Award.
In the event that the Participant voluntarily terminates his or her employment with the Company prior to the Payment Date, (i) if the Participant is re-employed by the Company or a Subsidiary within 90 days of the effective date of such termination, but in any event prior to the Payment Date, the Participant shall be eligible to receive a pro-rata payment on the Payment Date based on the number of days during the Performance Period that the Participant was considered to be an active employee as determined by the Company, provided that, any such payment shall be reduced by any amounts previously paid to Participant in connection with his or her termination of employment pursuant to the preceding paragraph or otherwise in lieu of amounts earned under the Award; or (ii) unless otherwise provided for herein, if the Participant is re-employed by the Company or a Subsidiary more than 90 days after the effective date of such resignation, but in any event before the end of the Performance Period, the Participant shall be eligible to receive a pro-rata payment on the Payment Date based on the number of days during the Performance Period that the Participant was considered to be an active employee as determined by the Company after the Participant was re-employed.
(i) any individual, entity or group (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) or 14(d)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "1934 Act")) (a "Person") becomes the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of thirty percent (30%) or more of the combined voting power of the Company's outstanding voting securities ordinarily having the right to vote for the election of directors of the Company; provided, however, that for purposes of this subparagraph (i), the following acquisitions shall not constitute a Change of Control: (A) any acquisition by any employee benefit plan or plans (or related trust) of the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates or (B) any acquisition by any corporation pursuant to a transaction which complies with clauses (A), (B) and (C) of subparagraph (iii) below; or

(iii) there is a reorganization, merger or consolidation of the Company (a "Business Combination"), in each case, unless, following such Business Combination, (A) all or substantially all of the individuals and entities who were the beneficial owners, respectively, of the Company's outstanding Shares and outstanding voting securities ordinarily having the right to vote for the election of directors of the Company immediately prior to such Business Combination beneficially own, directly or indirectly, more than fifty percent (50%) of, respectively, the then outstanding shares of common stock and the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities ordinarily having the right to vote for the election of directors, as the case may be, of the corporation resulting from such Business Combination (including, without limitation, a corporation which as a result of such transaction owns the Company or all or substantially all of the Company's assets either directly or through one or more subsidiaries) in substantially the same proportions as their ownership, immediately prior to such Business Combination, of the Company's outstanding Shares and outstanding voting securities ordinarily having the right to vote for the election of directors of the Company, as the case may be, (B) no Person (excluding any corporation resulting from such Business Combination or any employee benefit plan or plans (or related trust) of the Company or such corporation resulting from such Business Combination and their subsidiaries and affiliates) beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, 30% or more of the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities of the corporation resulting from such Business Combination and (C) at least a majority of the members of the board of directors of the corporation resulting from such Business Combination were members of the Incumbent Board at the time of the execution of the initial agreement, or of the action of the Board, providing for such Business Combination; or

Any employee or officer of the Company who authorizes any such amendment or waiver without the prior approval of the Committee will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including forfeiture of his or her PBRSRs and/or termination of employment (unless otherwise prohibited by law). All decisions and determination made by the Committee relating to the PBRSRs shall be final and binding on the Participant, his or her beneficiaries and any other person having or claiming an interest under the Plan.
Upon vesting, the Shares subject to the vested PBRSRs will be transferred to an account held in the name of the Participant by the Company's independent stock plan administrator and the Participant will receive notice of such transfer together with all relevant account details. The Participant will receive the Shares (net of any applicable taxes) after the issuance has been approved by the Committee or the Board, as the case may be, provided that in no event shall the payment be made after March 15, 2012, unless administratively impracticable to do so.
If the Participant's employment is terminated by the Company or a Subsidiary for Cause (as defined in Section 11), then the Company shall have the right to reclaim and receive from the Participant any Shares delivered to the Participant upon the vesting of any PBRSRs within the one year period before the date of the Participant's termination of employment, or to the extent the Participant has transferred such Shares, the equivalent after-tax value thereof (as of the date the Shares were transferred by the Participant) in cash.

Exhibit 10.4
Ryder System, Inc. (the "Company") adopted the Ryder System, Inc. Executive Severance Plan (the "Plan") to set forth its severance pay policy as it applies to Eligible Employees (as defined in this Plan) of the Company and all of its subsidiaries and affiliates effective as of January 1, 2007 for employees elected and promoted to or employed as an officer on or after January 1, 2007, and January 31, 2008 for employees who were already serving as officers on or before December 31, 2006 (each shall be considered an "Effective Date"), unless otherwise prohibited by law. The Company hereby amends and restates the Plan in order to ensure compliance with Section 409A of the Code and the regulations and guidance promulgated thereunder. As used herein, the masculine pronoun shall include the feminine, and the singular shall include the plural, unless a contrary meaning is clearly intended.
The Plan is intended to fall within the definition of a top hat "employee welfare benefit plan" under Section 3(1) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA").

This document supersedes and replaces any prior plan, summary plan descriptions, agreements (whether oral or written), summaries, policies, publications, memos or notices regarding the Plan and any other severance, termination, or separation benefits (including such benefits payable after a Change of Control) for Eligible Employees.
All rights of Participants to benefits relating to this Plan shall be governed by the Plan and the executed agreement and general release executed by the Company and the Participant in connection with a Participant's termination of employment. Any employee who participates in this Plan shall not be entitled to any severance, separation, notice, or termination benefits under any other severance or change of control policy, plan, agreement or practice of (i) the Company (including any previously executed severance, employment or change of control severance agreements); (ii) any predecessor agreement; or (iii) any respective subsidiary or affiliate thereof, or pursuant to which the Company is bound or obligated to provide such benefits. Except as set forth in this Plan, all such other severance (whether voluntary or involuntary) or change of control policies, plans, agreements and practices of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates in effect for Eligible Employees prior to the applicable Effective Date of this Plan shall be deemed amended and superseded in their entirety by this Plan to the extent that they would provide benefits to Participants upon their termination of employment.
In the event that the terms of the Plan are inconsistent with other documents or other written or verbal communications provided by the Company or its representatives with respect to this severance program, the terms of the Plan shall govern. The Plan may not be amended or changed except in accordance with the provisions set forth below.

Benefits Continuation Period
1.4 "" means: (i) fraud, misappropriation, or embezzlement by the Participant against the Company or any of its subsidiaries and/or affiliates, (ii) conviction of or plea of guilty or nolo contendere to a felony, (iii) conviction of or plea of guilty or nolo contendere to a misdemeanor involving moral turpitude or dishonesty, (iv) willful failure to report to work for more than thirty (30) continuous days not attributable to eligible vacation or supported by a licensed physician's statement, (v) a material breach by the Participant of Section 9 of this Plan (Restrictive Covenants), (vi) willful failure to perform the Participant's key job duties or responsibilities, or (vii) any other activity which would constitute grounds for termination for cause by the Company or its subsidiaries or affiliates, including but not limited to material violations of the Company's Principles of Business Conduct or any analogous code of ethics or similar policy. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Change of Control has occurred within one year preceding a Cause determination, "Cause" shall not include subsections (vi) or (vii) of the preceding sentence, provided that subsections (vi) and (vii) shall continue to apply to any terminations that are deemed to have retroactively occurred pursuant to Section 5.3(b). For the purposes of this Section 1.4, any good faith interpretation by the Company of the foregoing definition of "Cause" shall be conclusive on the Participant. For purposes of the Plan "Cause" shall be determined by such Participant's direct supervisor and the Chief Human Resources Officer ("CHRO"). In the event that a Participant is a direct report to the CHRO, then the decision shall be made by the CHRO and the Chief Financial Officer.

,
(c) there is a reorganization, merger or consolidation of the Company (a "Business Combination"), in each case, unless, following such Business Combination, (i) all or substantially all of the individuals and entities who were the beneficial owners, respectively, of the Company's outstanding common stock and outstanding voting securities ordinarily having the right to vote for the election of directors of the Company immediately prior to such Business Combination beneficially own, directly or indirectly, more than fifty percent (50%) of, respectively, the then outstanding shares of common stock and the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities ordinarily having the right to vote for the election of directors, as the case may be, of the corporation resulting from such Business Combination (including, without limitation, a corporation which as a result of such transaction owns the Company or all or substantially all of the Company's assets either directly or through one or more subsidiaries) in substantially the same proportions as their ownership, immediately prior to such Business Combination, of the Company's outstanding common stock and outstanding voting securities ordinarily having the right to vote for the election of directors of the Company, as the case may be, (ii) no Person (excluding any corporation resulting from such Business Combination or any employee benefit plan or plans (or related trust) of the Company or such corporation resulting from such Business Combination and their subsidiaries and affiliates) beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, 30% or more of the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities of the corporation resulting from such Business Combination and (iii) at least a majority of the members of the board of directors of the corporation resulting from such Business Combination were members of the Incumbent Board at the time of the execution of the initial agreement, or of the action of the Board, providing for such Business Combination; or
(d) there is a liquidation or dissolution of the Company approved by the shareholders; or
(e) there is a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company.
Notwithstanding anything in this Section 1.5 to the contrary, for purposes of Sections 5.3(a), a Change of Control shall only be deemed to occur if such transactions or events would give rise to a "change in ownership or effective control" or a change in the "ownership of a substantial portion of the assets" under Section 409A of the Code, and the rulings and regulations issued thereunder.
1.6 "" means (i) an Involuntary Termination or (ii) a termination of the Participant's employment by the Participant for Good Reason, either of which occurs within twelve (12) months after a Change of Control.
Change of Control Termination
1.7 "" means the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, supplemented or substituted from time to time.
Code
1.8 "" means the Compensation Committee of the Company's Board of Directors.

Disability
1.11 "" means (i) all active officers of the Company employed or residing in the United States in a management level 14 or above (or other classification designating officer status, as those classifications may change from time to time), and (ii) who have not entered into any agreements or arrangements providing severance or change of control benefits with the Company.
Eligible Employees
1.12 "" means the Participant's ability to obtain equity in the Company (or a comparable cash-based incentive program) through a compensatory arrangement. Equity Compensation Opportunities are measured using the valuation method applied by the Company for financial accounting purposes and the Board may take into account in determining that no reduction has occurred any exercises, cashing out, or other liquidity in favor of the Participant that is either triggered by the Participant or occurring in connection with a Change of Control. Changes in the underlying value of the stock shall not be treated as a reduction in the Equity Compensation Opportunities, and the Company may take into account in replacing the value of pre-Change of Control equity compensation with post-Change of Control equity compensation (or a comparable cash-based incentive program) that the Participant may have received value for his equity compensation in the Change of Control.
Equity Compensation Opportunities
1.13 "" means the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, supplemented or substituted from time to time.

For the avoidance of doubt, a change in reporting relationship or title shall not constitute "Good Reason." A Participant's termination of employment shall only constitute a termination for Good Reason if the Participant terminates employment on or prior to the first anniversary of the date on which the circumstances providing a basis for such termination initially occurred. In addition, the Participant's continued employment shall not constitute consent to, or a waiver of rights with respect to, any circumstance surrounding Good Reason until ninety (90) days have elapsed since the occurrence of the circumstance he would assert constitutes Good Reason and the Participant has not provided notice in accordance with Section 1.16 prior to the end of such ninety (90) day period.
Good Reason

7.1 In the event any payment that is either received by the Participant or paid by the Company on his behalf or any property, or any other benefit provided to him pursuant to the terms of the Plan or any other arrangement or agreement with the Company or any other person whose payments or benefits are treated as contingent on a change of ownership or control of the Company (or in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of the Company) or any person affiliated with the Company or such person (but only if such payment or other benefit is in connection with the Participant's employment by the Company) (collectively the "Payment"), is subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code or any interest or penalties are incurred by the Participant with respect to such excise tax (such excise tax, together with any such interest and penalties, hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Excise Tax"), the Participant shall be entitled to receive an additional payment (a "Gross-Up Payment") in an amount such that after payment by the Participant of all taxes (including any interest or penalties imposed with respect to such taxes), including, without limitation, any income taxes (and any interest and penalties imposed with respect thereto) and the Excise Tax imposed upon the Gross-Up Payment, the Participant retains an amount of the Gross-Up Payment equal to the Excise Tax imposed upon the Payments.  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 7 if it shall be determined that the Participant is entitled to a Gross-Up Payment, but that the Payment does not exceed 110% of the greatest amount that could be paid to the Participant without giving rise to any Excise Tax (the "Safe Harbor Amount"), then no Gross-Up Payment shall be made to the Participant and the amounts payable under this Plan shall be reduced so that the Payment, in the aggregate, is reduced to the Safe Harbor Amount.  The reduction shall be made in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 409A. The reduction of the amounts payable hereunder, if applicable, shall be made by first reducing, but not below zero, the cash payments under Sections 5.1(b), 5.3(c)(i), or 6.1(b), as applicable (and in the event that such payments are installment payments, each such installment payment shall be reduced pro-rata, but not below zero), and by next reducing, but not below zero, the cash payments under Sections 5.1(c), 5.3(c)(ii), or 6.1(c), as applicable. In the event that following the reduction of the amounts set forth in the preceding sentence, additional amounts payable to the Participant must be reduced, any payments due to the Participant pursuant to the Company's equity plans shall be reduced on a pro-rata basis, but not below zero.
7.2 All determinations required to be made under this Section 7 including whether and when a Gross-Up Payment is required and the amount of such Gross-Up Payment and the assumptions to be utilized in arriving at such determination, shall be made by a nationally recognized accounting firm selected by the Company (the "Accounting Firm") which shall provide detailed supporting calculations both to the Company and the Participant within ten (10) business days of the receipt of notice from Participant that there has been a Payment, or such earlier time as is requested by the Company; provided that for purposes of determining the amount of any Gross-Up Payment, the Participant shall be deemed to pay federal income tax at the highest marginal rates applicable to individuals in the calendar year in which any such Gross-Up Payment is to be made and deemed to pay state and local income taxes at the highest effective rates applicable to individuals in the state or locality in which the Participant incurs income taxes in the calendar year in which any such Gross-Up Payment is to be made, net of the maximum reduction in federal income taxes that can be obtained from deduction of such state and local taxes, taking into account limitations applicable to individuals subject to federal income tax at the highest marginal rates.  All fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne solely by the Company.  Any Gross-Up Payment, as determined pursuant to this Section 7, shall be paid by the Company to the Participant (or to the appropriate taxing authority on the Participant's behalf) when the applicable tax is due.  If the Accounting Firm determines that no Excise Tax is payable by the Participant, it shall so indicate to the Participant in writing.  Any determination by the Accounting Firm shall be binding upon the Company and the Participant.  As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 of the Code, it is possible that the amount of the Gross-Up Payment determined by the Accounting Firm to be due to (or on behalf of) the Participant was lower than the amount actually due ("Underpayment").  In the event that the Company exhausts its remedies pursuant to Section 7.3 and the Participant thereafter is required to make a payment of any Excise Tax, the Accounting Firm shall determine the amount of the Underpayment that has occurred and any such Underpayment shall be promptly paid by the Company to or for the benefit of Participant.
7.3 The Participant shall notify the Company in writing of any claim by the Internal Revenue Service that, if successful, would require the payment by the Company of any Gross-Up Payment.  Such notification shall be given as soon as practicable but no later than ten (10) business days after the Participant is informed in writing of such claim and shall apprise the Company of the nature of such claim and the date on which such claim is requested to be paid.  The Participant shall not pay such claim prior to the expiration of the thirty (30) day period following the date on which it gives such notice to the Company (or such shorter period ending on the date that any payment of taxes with respect to such claim is due).  If the Company notifies the Participant in writing prior to the expiration of such period that it desires to contest such claim, the Participant shall (i) give the Company any information reasonably requested by the Company relating to such claim, (ii) take such action in connection with contesting such claim as the Company shall reasonably request in writing from time to time, including, without limitation, accepting legal representation with respect to such claim by an attorney reasonably selected by the Company, (iii) cooperate with the Company in good faith in order to effectively contest such claim and (iv) permit the Company to participate in any proceedings relating to such claim; provided, however, that the Company shall bear and pay directly all costs and expenses (including additional interest and penalties) incurred in connection with such contest.  Without limitation on the foregoing provisions of this Section 7.3, the Company shall control all proceedings taken in connection with such contest and, at its sole option, may pursue or forego any and all administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings and conferences with the taxing authority in respect of such claim and may, at its sole option, either direct the Participant to pay the tax claimed and sue for a refund or contest the claim in any permissible manner, and the Participant agrees to prosecute such contest to a determination before any administrative tribunal, in a court of initial jurisdiction and in one or more appellate courts, as the Company shall determine; provided, further, that if the Participant is required to extend the statute of limitations to enable the Company to contest such claim, the Participant may limit this extension solely to such contested amount.  The Company's control of the contest shall be limited to issues with respect to which a Gross-Up Payment would be payable hereunder and the Participant shall be entitled to settle or contest, as the case may be, any other issue raised by the Internal Revenue Service or any other taxing authority.
7.4 If, after the receipt by the Participant of an amount paid or advanced by the Company pursuant to this Section 7, the Participant becomes entitled to receive any refund with respect to a Gross-Up Payment, the Participant shall promptly pay to the Company the amount of such refund received (together with any interest paid or credited thereon after taxes applicable thereto). 
7.5 All payments and benefits due to a Participant pursuant to this Section 7 shall be paid no later than the end of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the related taxes are remitted, or if no taxes are ultimately remitted, the end of the calendar year following the calendar year in which an audit is completed or there is a final and non-appealable settlement or other resolution.
In order to ensure in the event of a Change of Control that timely payment will be made of certain obligations of the Company to the Participant provided for under this Plan, the Company shall, immediately prior to or in connection with the consummation of a Change of Control, irrespective of whether the Change of Control constitutes a "change in ownership or effective control" or a change in the "ownership of a substantial portion of the assets" under Section 409A of the Code, and the rulings and regulations issued thereunder, pay into one or more trust(s) (the "Trust(s)") established between the Company and any financial institution with assets in excess of $100 million selected by the Company prior to the Change of Control, as trustee (the "Trustee"), such amounts and at such time or times as are required in order to fully pay all cash amounts due the Participant hereunder that are payable or as are otherwise required pursuant to the terms of the Trust(s), with payment to be made in cash or cash equivalents. Thereafter, all such payments required to be paid hereunder shall be made out of the Trust(s); provided, however, that the Company shall retain liability for and pay the Participant any amounts or provide for such other benefits due the Participant under this Plan for which there are insufficient funds in the Trust(s), for which no funding of the Trust(s) is required or in the event that the Trustee fails to make such payment to the Participant within the time frames set forth in this Plan. Prior to the Change of Control, and to the extent necessary because of a change in the Trustee, after the Change of Control, the Company shall provide the Participant with the name and address of the Trustee. Nothing in this Plan shall require the Company to maintain the funding required in this section beyond the first anniversary of a Change of Control unless, before such first anniversary, the Participant's employment has terminated in a manner qualifying him for benefits hereunder. The Participant expressly waives any requirement under this Section 8 or otherwise for the Company to fund the Trust(s) if funding would cause him to be taxed under Code Section 409A(b) or any successor law.
For purposes of this Plan, the term "the Company and/or the Trustee" means the Trustee to the extent the Company has put funds in the Trust(s) and the Company to the extent the Company has not funded or fully funded the Trust(s); provided, however, that in accordance with the paragraph above, the Company shall retain liability for and pay the Participant any amounts or provide for such other benefits due the Participant under this Plan for which the Trustee fails to make adequate payment to the Participant within the time frames set forth in this Plan
.
As consideration for the Company's offer of coverage under this Plan to the Participant and for other good and valuable consideration, during his employment and upon termination of employment for any reason, the Participant agrees to comply with the restrictive covenants contained in Section 9 of this Plan. In addition, receipt of the severance payments and benefits set forth in Sections 5 and 6 is expressly conditioned upon the Participant's continued compliance with Section 9.
9.1 . All documents, records, techniques, business secrets and other information of the Company, its subsidiaries and affiliates which have or will come into the Participant's possession from time to time during the Participant's affiliation with the Company and/or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates and which the Company treats as confidential and proprietary to the Company and/or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates shall be deemed as such by the Participant and shall be the sole and exclusive property of the Company, its subsidiaries and affiliates. The Participant agrees that the Participant will keep confidential and not use or divulge to any other individual or entity any of the Company's or its subsidiaries' or affiliates' confidential information and business secrets, including, but not limited to, such matters as costs, profits, markets, sales, products, product lines, key personnel, pricing policies, operational methods, customers, customer requirements, suppliers, plans for future developments, and other business affairs and methods and other information not readily available to the public. Additionally, the Participant agrees that upon his termination of employment, irrespective of the reason for such termination, the Participant shall promptly return to the Company any and all confidential and proprietary information of the Company and/or its subsidiaries or affiliates that is in his possession or control.
Confidentiality
The Participant agrees that the terms and provisions of this Plan, as well as any and all incidents leading to or resulting from this Plan, are confidential and may not be discussed with anyone other than his spouse, domestic partner, attorney or tax advisor without the prior written consent of the Company's Chief Human Resources Officer, except as required by law. In the event that the Participant is subpoenaed, or asked to provide confidential information or to testify as a witness or to produce documents in any existing or potential legal or administrative or other proceeding or investigation formal or informal related to the Company, to the extent permitted by applicable law, the Participant will promptly notify the Company of such subpoena or request and will, if requested, meet with the Company for a reasonable period of time prior to any such appearance or production.
9.2 . During the Participant's employment with the Company, and thereafter during the Participant's Severance Period, if any, the Participant shall not, without the prior written consent of the Board, directly or indirectly engage or become a partner, director, officer, principal, employee in the same or similar capacity as the Participant worked for the Company, consultant, investor, creditor or stockholder in/for any business, proprietorship, association, firm or corporation not owned or controlled by the Company or its subsidiaries or affiliates which is engaged or proposes to engage or hereafter engages in a business competitive directly or indirectly with the business conducted by the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates in any geographic area the Participant worked in or had responsibility over the previous twelve (12) month period; provided, however, that the Participant is not prohibited from owning one percent (1%) or less of the outstanding capital stock of any corporation whose stock is listed on a national securities exchange.
Non-Competition
The Participant and the Company have attempted to limit the Participant's right to compete only to the extent necessary to protect the Company's legitimate business interests. The Participant and the Company recognize however, that reasonable people may differ in making such a determination. Consequently, the Participant and the Company agree that if the scope or enforceability of this Plan is in any way disputed at any time, a court may modify and enforce this Plan to the extent it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances.
9.3 . During the Participant's employment with the Company or any subsidiary or affiliate, and thereafter during the longer of (i) the Severance Period, if any, or (ii) twelve (12) months following the Participant's Termination Date (irrespective of the reason for the Participant's termination and without any reduction or modification), the Participant shall not, directly or indirectly, in any manner or capacity whatsoever, either on the Participant's own account or for any person, firm or company:
Non-Solicitation
(a) take away, interfere with relations with, divert or attempt to divert from the Company any business with any customer or account: (x) which was a customer on the last day of the Participant's employment and/or has been solicited or serviced by the Company within one (1) year prior to the last day of the Participant's employment; and (y) with which the Participant had any contact or association, or which was under the supervision of the Participant, or the identity of which was learned by the Participant, as a result of the Participant's employment with the Company, or
(b) solicit, interfere with or induce, or attempt to induce, any employee or independent contractor of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates to leave his employment or service with the Company or to breach his employment agreement or other agreement, if any.
9.4 . The Participant acknowledges that all ideas, discoveries, inventions and improvements which are made, conceived or reduced to practice by the Participant and every item of knowledge relating to the Company's business interests (including potential business interests) gained by the Participant during the Participant's employment are the sole and absolute property of the Company, and the Participant shall promptly disclose and hereby irrevocably assigns all his right, title and interest in and to all such ideas, discoveries, inventions, improvements and knowledge to the Company for its sole use and benefit, without additional compensation, and shall communicate to the Company, without cost or delay, and without publishing the same, all available information relating thereto. The Participant also hereby waives all claims to moral rights in any such ideas, discoveries, inventions, improvements and knowledge. The provisions of this Section 9 shall apply whether such ideas, discoveries, inventions or knowledge are conceived, made, gained or reduced to practice by the Participant alone or with others, whether during or after usual working hours, whether on or off the job, whether applicable to matters directly or indirectly related to the Company's business interests (including potential business interests), and whether or not within the specific realm of the Participant's duties. Any of the Participant's ideas, discoveries, inventions and improvements relating to the Company's business interests or potential business interests and conceived, made or reduced to practice during the Severance Period shall for the purpose of this Plan, be deemed to have been conceived, made or reduced to practice before the end of the Participant's employment. The Participant shall, upon request of the Company, and without further compensation by the Company but at the expense of the Company, at any time during or after his employment with the Company, sign all instruments and documents requested by the Company and otherwise cooperate with the Company and take any actions which are or may be necessary to protect the Company's right to such ideas, discoveries, inventions, improvements and knowledge, including applying for, obtaining and enforcing patents, copyrights and trademark registrations thereon in any and all countries. To the extent this Section shall be construed in accordance with the laws of any state which precludes a requirement to assign certain classes of inventions made by an employee, this Section shall be interpreted not to apply to any invention which a court rules and/or the Company agrees falls within such classes.
Inventions and Discoveries
9.5 . The Participant agrees not to make any remarks disparaging the conduct or character of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates, their current or former agents, employees, officers, directors, successors or assigns ("Ryder Parties"), except as may be necessary in the performance of his duties or as is otherwise required by law. The Participant agrees to cooperate with the Company in the investigation, defense or prosecution of any claims or actions now in existence or that may be brought in the future against or on behalf of the Company. Such cooperation shall include meeting with representatives of the Company upon reasonable notice at reasonable times and locations to prepare for discovery or any mediation, arbitration, trial, administrative hearing or other proceeding or to act as a witness. The Company shall reimburse the Participant for travel expenses approved by the Company or its subsidiaries or affiliates incurred in providing such assistance. The Participant shall notify the Company if the Participant is asked to assist, testify or provide information by or to any person, entity or agency in any such proceeding or investigation. Nothing in this provision is intended to or should be construed to prevent the Participant from providing truthful information to any person or entity as required by law or his fiduciary obligations.
Non-Disparagement and Cooperation
9.6 . The Participant acknowledges and agrees that if he commits a material breach of the Covenant of Confidentiality or, if applicable, the Covenant Against Competition, the Covenant of Non-Solicitation, or the Covenant of Non-Disparagement and Cooperation, the Company shall have the right to have the covenant specifically enforced through an injunction or otherwise, without any obligation that the Company post a bond or prove actual damages, by any court having appropriate jurisdiction on the grounds that any such breach will cause irreparable injury to the Company, without prejudice to any other rights and remedies that Company may have for a breach of this Plan, and that money damages will not provide an adequate remedy to the Company. The Participant further acknowledges and agrees that the Covenant of Confidentiality, the Covenant Against Competition, the Covenant of Non-Solicitation, and the Covenant of Non-Disparagement and Cooperation contained in this Plan are intended to protect the Company's business interests and goodwill, are fair, do not unreasonably restrict his future employment and business opportunities, and are commensurate with the arrangements set out in this Plan and with the other terms and conditions of the Participant's employment. In addition, in executing this Plan, the Participant makes an election to receive severance pay and benefits pursuant to Sections 5 and 6 and is subject to the covenants above, therefore, the Participant shall have no right to return any amounts or benefits that are already paid or to refuse to accept any amounts or benefits that are payable in the future in lieu of his specific performance of his obligations under the covenants above.
Specific Remedy
Participants in the Plan shall not be entitled to receive any other severance, notice, change of control or termination payments or benefits (or notice in lieu of severance) from the Company. In addition, to the extent permitted by Section 409A of the Code, the Participant's benefits under the Plan will be reduced by the amount of any other severance or termination payments, or pay in lieu of notice, payable by the Company to the Participant on account of his employment, or termination of employment, with the Company, including, but not limited to, (i) any payments required to be paid by the Company to the Participant under any other program, policy, practice, or plan, or (ii) any federal, state, national, municipal, provincial, commonwealth or local law (including any payment pursuant to the Worker Adjustment Retraining and Notification Act or any national, State, local, provincial, municipal, or commonwealth equivalent). A Participant must notify the Plan Administrator if he receives any such payments. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 10, no severance payment paid or payable to a Participant, after giving effect to the provisions of this Section 10, shall be less than one week of Participant's Base Salary.
Except as otherwise provided herein, a Participant, as of his Termination Date, shall cease to participate in and shall cease to be treated as an employee of the Company for all purposes under the employee benefit plans of the Company, including, without limitation, all retirement, welfare, incentive, bonus and other similar plans, policies, programs and arrangements maintained for employees of the Company. Each such Participant's rights under any such plan, policy, program or arrangement shall be governed by the terms and conditions of each thereof, as in effect on such Termination Date.
12.1 . The Plan is administered and operated by the Plan Administrator who has complete authority, with respect to matters within its jurisdiction, in its sole and absolute discretion, to construe the terms of the Plan (and any related or underlying documents or policies), and to determine the eligibility for, and amount of, severance benefits due under this Plan to Participants and their beneficiaries. All such interpretations and determinations (including factual determinations) of the Plan Administrator shall be final and binding upon all parties and persons affected thereby. The Plan Administrator may appoint one or more individuals and delegate such of its powers and duties as it deems desirable to any such individual(s), in which case every reference herein made to the Plan Administrator shall be deemed to mean or include the appointed individual(s) as to matters within their jurisdiction.
Plan Interpretation and Benefit Determinations
12.2 . A Participant or his beneficiary (if applicable) may file a written claim with the Plan Administrator with respect to his rights to receive a benefit from the Plan. The Participant will be informed of the decision of the Plan Administrator with respect to the claim within ninety (90) days after it is filed. Under special circumstances, the Plan Administrator may require an additional period of not more than ninety (90) days to review a claim. If this occurs, the Participant will be notified in writing as to the length of the extension, the reason for the extension, and any other information needed in order to process the claim. If the Participant is not notified within the ninety-day (or one hundred and eighty-day, if so extended) period, he may consider the claim to be denied.
Benefit Claims
If a claim is denied, in whole or in part, the Participant will be notified in writing of the specific reason(s) for the denial, the exact plan provision(s) on which the decision was based, what additional material or information is relevant to his case, and what procedure the Participant should follow to get the claim reviewed again. The Participant then has sixty (60) days to appeal the decision to the Plan Administrator.
The appeal must be submitted in writing to the Plan Administrator. A Participant may request to review pertinent documents, and may submit a written statement of issues and comments. A decision as to a Participant's appeal will be made within sixty (60) days after the appeal is received. Under special circumstances, the Plan Administrator may require an additional period of not more than sixty (60) days to review an appeal. If this occurs, the Participant will be notified in writing as to the length of the extension, not to exceed one hundred and twenty (120) days from the day on which the appeal was received.
If a Participant's appeal is denied, in whole or in part, he will be notified in writing of the specific reason(s) for the denial and the exact plan provision(s) on which the decision was based. The decision on an appeal of the Plan Administrator will be final and binding on all parties and persons affected thereby. If a Participant is not notified within the sixty-day (or one hundred and twenty-day, if so extended) period, he may consider the appeal as denied.

Tax Withholding
13.2 . The Plan is unfunded. The Company shall pay the full cost of the Plan out of its general assets, to the extent not satisfied by the Trust.
Unfunded Plan
13.3 . The Plan shall not be deemed to constitute a contract of employment, or to impose on the Company any obligation to retain any Participant as an employee, to continue any Participant's current employment status or to change any employment policies of the Company; nor shall any provision hereof restrict the right of the Company to discharge any of its employees or restrict the right of any such employee to terminate his employment with the Company.
Not a Contract of Employment
13.4 .
Successors
(a) This Plan is personal to the Participant and the Participant does not have the right to assign this Plan or any interest herein.
(b) This Plan shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the Company and its successors. As used in this Plan, "the Company" shall mean the Company as hereinbefore defined and any successor to its business and/or assets as aforesaid which assumes and agrees to perform this Plan by operation of law, or otherwise.
13.5 . Except as specifically provided otherwise in this Plan, the Company's obligation to make the payments provided for herein and otherwise to perform its obligations hereunder shall not be affected by any circumstances, including, without limitation, any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which the Company may have against the Participant or others. The Participant shall not be obligated to seek other employment by way of mitigation of the amounts payable to the Participant under any of the provisions of this Plan nor, except as specifically provided otherwise in this Plan, shall the amount of any payment provided for under this Plan be reduced by any compensation or benefits earned by the Participant as the result of employment by another employer after the Termination Date.
Full Settlement
13.6 . To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Company shall promptly pay upon submission of statements all legal and other professional fees, costs of litigation, prejudgment interest, and other expenses incurred in connection with any dispute concerning payments, benefits and other entitlements which the Participant may have under Sections 5.1, 5.3(b), 5.3(c), 6.1, or 6.2 subject to a cap of $15,000; provided, however, the Company shall be reimbursed by the Participant (i) for the fees and expenses advanced in the event the Participant's claim is, in a material manner, in bad faith or frivolous and the arbitrator or court, as applicable, determines that the reimbursement of such fees and expenses is appropriate, or (ii) to the extent that the arbitrator or court, as appropriate, determines that such legal and other professional fees are clearly and demonstrably unreasonable. Any payments made pursuant to this Section 13.6 shall be limited to expenses incurred on or prior to December 31 of the second calendar year following the calendar year in which the Termination Date occurs, and any payments made pursuant to this Section 13.6 shall be made on or prior to December 31 of the third calendar year following the calendar year in which the Termination Date occurs.

Code Section 409A
(a) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, this Plan shall be construed and interpreted in a manner so as not to trigger adverse tax consequences under Section 409A of the Code and the rulings and regulations issued thereunder. The Company may amend this Plan in any manner necessary to comply with Code Section 409A or any other applicable laws, with or without the consent of the Participant. Furthermore, to the extent necessary to comply with Code Section 409A, the payment terms for any of the payments or benefits payable hereunder shall be amended without the Participant's consent to comply with Code Section 409A.
(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, A Participant shall not be entitled to any payments or benefits pursuant to the Plan in the event that the occurrence of his termination of employment does not constitute a "separation from service" as defined by Section 409A of the Code and the regulations issued thereunder. For purposes of determining whether a "separation from service", as defined by Section 409A of the Code, has occurred, pursuant to Treas. Reg. 1.409A-1(h)(3), the Company has elected to use "at least 80 percent" each place it appears in Sections 1563(a)(1), (2), and (3) of the Code and in Treas. Reg. 1.414(c)-2.
(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if a Participant is a Specified Employee at the time of his Termination Date, and the deferral of the commencement of any payments or benefits otherwise payable hereunder is necessary in order to prevent any accelerated or additional tax under Section 409A of the Code, then, to the extent permitted by Section 409A of the Code, the Company will defer the commencement of the payment of any such payments or benefits hereunder until the first day following the six-month anniversary of the Termination Date (or the earliest date as is permitted under Section 409A of the Code). If any payments or benefits are deferred due to such requirements, (whether they would have otherwise been payable in a single sum or in installments in the absence of such deferral) they shall be paid or reimbursed to the Participant in a lump sum on the first day following the six-month anniversary of the Termination Date, and any remaining payments and benefits due under this Plan shall be paid or provided in accordance with the normal payment dates specified for them herein.
(d) Except as otherwise provided herein, any reimbursements or in-kind benefits provided under the Plan shall be made or provided in accordance with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, including, where applicable, the requirement that (i) any reimbursement is for expenses incurred during the period of time specified in the Plan (or, if no such period is specified, the Participant's lifetime), (ii) the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in kind benefits provided, during a calendar year may not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in kind benefits to be provided, in any other calendar year, (iii) the reimbursement of an eligible expense will be made no later than the last day of the calendar year following the year in which the expense is incurred, and (iv) the right to reimbursement or in kind benefits is not subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit. In addition, for purposes of the limitations on nonqualified deferred compensation under Section 409A, each payment of compensation under the Plan shall be treated as a separate payment of compensation for purposes of applying the Section 409A deferral election rules and the exclusion from Section 409A for certain short-term deferral amounts and separation pay. Notwithstanding any other provision set forth herein, any payments which are intended to constitute separation pay due to an involuntary separation from service in accordance with Treas. Reg. 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii) shall be paid no later than the last day of the second calendar year following the calendar year in which the Termination Date occurs.
(e) For purposes of this Plan, a Company Entity means any member of a controlled group of corporations or a group of trades or businesses under common control of which the Company is a member. A "controlled group of corporations" means a controlled group of corporations as defined in Section 414(b) of the Code and a "group of trades or businesses under common control" means a group of trades or businesses under common control as defined in Section 414(c) of the Code, without any modifications.
13.8 . The validity, interpretation, construction, and performance of this Plan shall be governed by the laws of the State of Florida without regard to its conflicts of law principles. The Parties agree that any suit, action or other legal proceeding that is commenced to resolve any matter arising under or relating to any provision of this Plan shall be commenced only in a court of the State of Florida (or, if appropriate, a federal court located within the State of Florida), in either case located in Miami, Florida, and the parties consent to the jurisdiction of such court. The parties hereto accept the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of those courts for the purpose of any such suit, action or proceeding.
Choice of Law and Jury Trial Waiver
The Company and the Participant each irrevocably waive any right to a trial by jury in any action, suit or other legal proceeding arising under or relating to any provision of this Plan.
13.9 . If any provision of the Plan is held invalid or unenforceable, such invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision hereof, and such provision shall, to the extent possible, be modified in such manner as to be valid and enforceable but so as to most nearly retain the intent of the Company. If such modification is not possible, the Plan shall be construed and enforced as if such provision had not been included in the Plan.
Effect of Invalidity of Provision
13.10 . The Plan supersedes any and all prior severance arrangements, policies, plans or practices of the Company and its predecessors (whether written or unwritten) and further supersedes any nondisclosure, nonsolicitation, inventions and/or noncompetition agreements covering the Participants; provided, however, that any rights to indemnification, all stock options or other equity granted to the Participant prior to the Effective Date, and all agreements relating thereto shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with their terms except as otherwise modified herein.
Effect of Plan
13.11 . The records of the Company with respect to employment history, Base Salary, absences, and all other relevant matters shall be conclusive for all purposes of this Plan.
Records
13.12 . In no event shall the Company make any payment under this Plan to any assignee or creditor of a Participant, except as otherwise required by law. Prior to the time of a payment hereunder, a Participant shall have no rights by way of anticipation or otherwise to assign or otherwise dispose of any interest under this Plan, nor shall rights be assigned or transferred by operation of law.
Non-transferability
13.13 . No amount accrued or paid under this Plan shall be deemed compensation for purposes of computing a Participant's benefits under any retirement plan of the Company or its subsidiaries, nor affect any benefits under any other benefit plan now or subsequently in effect under which the availability or amount of benefits is related to the Participant's level of compensation.
Other Benefits
The Plan may be amended or terminated, in whole or in part, (i) at any time, with or without prior notice to Participants, by action of the Committee or its designees in order to comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations and (ii) at any time with notice to Participants by action of the Committee.
15.1 . A Participant in the Plan is entitled to certain rights and protections under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). ERISA provides that all Plan participants shall be entitled to:
Participants' Rights Under ERISA
- Examine, without charge, at the Plan Administrator's office, all Plan documents, and copies of all documents filed by the Plan with the U.S. Department of Labor, such as detailed annual reports and Plan descriptions.
- Obtain copies of Plan documents and other Plan information upon written request to the Plan Administrator. The Plan Administrator may make a reasonable charge for the copies.
- Receive a summary of the Plan's annual financial report if the Plan covers 100 or more people. The Plan Administrator is required by law to furnish each Participant with a copy of this summary annual report.
In addition to creating rights for Plan participants, ERISA imposes duties upon the people who are responsible for the operation of the Plan. The people who operate the Plan, called "fiduciaries" of the Plan, have a duty to do so prudently and in the interest of Plan participants and beneficiaries. No one, including the Company or any other person, may fire a Participant or otherwise discriminate against him in any way to prevent him from obtaining a welfare benefit or exercising his rights under ERISA. If a Participant's claim for a benefit is denied in whole or in part, he must receive a written explanation of the reason for the denial. The Participant has the right to have the Plan review and reconsider his claim. Under ERISA, there are steps a Participant can take to enforce the above rights.
For instance, if a Participant requests materials from the Plan and does not receive them within 30 days, he may file suit in a federal court. In such a case, the court may require the Plan Administrator to provide the materials and pay the Participant up to $110 a day until the he receives the materials, unless the materials were not sent because of reasons beyond the control of the Plan Administrator.
If the Participant's claim for benefits is denied or ignored, in whole or in part, he may file suit in a state or federal court. If a Participant is discriminated against for asserting his rights, he may seek assistance from the U.S. Department of Labor, or may file suit in a federal court. The court will decide who should pay court costs and legal fees. If the Participant is successful, the court may order the person the Participant sued to pay these costs and fees. If the Participant loses, the court may order him to pay these costs and fees, for example, if it finds the Participant's claim is frivolous. If a Participant has any questions about the Plan, he should contact the Plan Administrator. If the Participant has any questions about this statement or about his rights under ERISA, he should contact the nearest office of the Employee Benefits Security Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, listed in the telephone directory or the Division of Technical Assistance and Inquires, Employee Benefits Security Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue N.W., Washington, D.C. 20210.
The Plan Administrator keeps records of the Plan and is responsible for the administration of the Plan. The Plan Administrator will also answer any questions you may have about the Plan.
Service of legal process may be made upon the Plan Administrator.
No individual may, in any case, become entitled to additional benefits or other rights under this Plan after the Plan is terminated. Under no circumstances, will any benefit under this Plan ever vest or become nonforfeitable.

Changes in the underlying value of the stock shall not be treated as a reduction in the Equity Compensation Opportunities, and the Company may take into account in replacing the value of pre-Change of Control equity compensation with post-Change of Control equity compensation (or a comparable cash-based incentive program) that the Executive may have received value for his equity compensation in the Change of Control.

The Company and the Executive shall continue to be liable to each other for all of their other respective obligations under this Agreement. In the event that the Executive was a Specified Employee on his Termination Date, if the sum of the payments which the Executive previously received in accordance with Section 5(c)(i)(B) and the payment set forth in this Section 5(c)(ii) exceeds the Separation Pay Limit, any amounts in excess of the Separation Pay Limit shall be paid on the later of (A) the first day following the six-month anniversary of the Termination Date and (B) within seven (7) calendar days after the Change of Control.

(iii) If a Change of Control occurs and (A) the Executive experienced an Involuntary Termination within twelve (12) months prior to the date on which the Change of Control occurs and (B) it is reasonably demonstrated by the Executive that such termination of employment either (a) was at the request of a third party who has taken steps reasonably calculated to effect a Change of Control or (b) otherwise arose in connection with or in anticipation of a Change of Control, then in addition to the payments and benefits set forth in Section 5(c)(i), the Executive shall be entitled to the following: (x) a lump sum payment equal to 50% of the Executive's Base Salary, payable as soon as practicable but no later than sixty (60) days following the Change of Control; provided that if the Executive was a Specified Employee on his Termination Date, such payment shall be paid on the later of (1) as soon as practicable but no later than sixty (60) days following the Change of Control and (2) the first day following the six-month anniversary of the Executive's Termination Date; (y) the difference between the Target Bonus payment which the Executive would have received if the Severance Multiple had been three (3) and the Target Bonus amount paid to the Executive pursuant to Section 5(c)(i)(C), which shall be paid as soon as practicable following the Change of Control but no later than March 15 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the Change of Control occurs; and (z) for purposes of determining the Severance Period for benefits provided under Sections 5(c)(i)(D), (F), and (G), the Executive's Severance Period shall be defined as the thirty-six (36) month period following the Termination Date.

If applicable, the Release shall contain provisions required by federal, state or local law (e.g., the Older Worker's Benefit Protection Act) to effectuate a general release of all claims. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no payments or continued benefits on account of termination of employment hereunder (other than any Accrued Benefits payable in accordance with their terms) shall be made to the Executive prior to the Release Effective Date. In the event that the Executive does not execute the Release within fifty (50) days following the Termination Date or the Release Effective Date does not occur within sixty (60) days following the Termination Date, the Executive shall not be entitled to any payments or benefits hereunder (other than the Accrued Benefits payable pursuant to their terms); provided that, if the Executive becomes entitled to payments and benefits pursuant to Section 5(c)(iv), the Executive shall not be entitled to any payments or benefits hereunder in the event the Executive does not execute the Release within fifty (50) days following the Change of Control or the Release Effective Date does not occur within sixty (60) days following the date of the Change of Control.
(ii) As consideration for the Company's offer of this Agreement to the Executive and for other good and valuable consideration, during his employment and upon termination of employment for any reason, the Executive agrees to comply with the restrictive covenants contained in Section 10 of this Agreement. In addition, receipt of the severance payments and benefits set forth in Section 5 is expressly conditioned upon the Executive's continued compliance with Section 10. If the Executive is receiving severance payments and/or benefits under Section 5, and (A) if the Executive is reemployed by the Company (or any subsidiary, affiliate or successor) or breaches this Agreement or the Release, or (B) if the Company (or any subsidiary, affiliate or successor) discovers information that would have permitted the Company to terminate the Executive for Cause or if the Company or any subsidiary, affiliate or successor discovers a breach of Section 10, severance payments and benefits shall immediately cease with respect to such termination. If the severance payments and benefits cease because of re-employment and the Company has paid severance in a lump sum, the Company (or any subsidiary or successor) shall have the right to require that the Executive repay to the applicable entity the value of the severance benefits that would not yet have been paid before re-employment if he had been receiving the severance in semi-monthly installments, and the Executive shall no longer be entitled to any severance payments and benefits with respect to such termination. If severance payments and benefits cease because of a Cause determination or a breach of Section 10, the Company (or any subsidiary or successor) shall have the right to require that the Executive repay to the applicable entity the full value of any previously received severance. The remedies described in this paragraph are in addition to any other remedies that may be available to the Company in the event of the occurrence of any of the circumstances described in this paragraph.
(iii) Upon termination of employment for any reason, the Executive agrees to promptly return all Company property that has come into his possession or control, including, without limitation, computer equipment (including, without limitation, computer hardware, laptop and other computers, software and printers, wireless handheld devices, cellular telephones, pagers, etc.), client and customer information, client and customer lists, employee lists, Company files, notes, contracts, records, business plans, financial information, specifications, computer-recorded information, tangible property, credit cards, entry cards, identification badges, keys, and any other materials of any kind which contain or embody, in whole or in part, any proprietary or confidential material of the Company (and all reproductions thereof), except that Company property shall not include items, if any, listed in a written document signed by the Executive and the Company at or before the time of the Executive's termination from employment as items to be retained by the Executive. The Executive further agrees that he will leave intact all electronic Company documents, including those which the Executive developed or helped develop during his employment, and that he will promptly cancel all accounts for his benefit, if any, in the Company's name including, without limitation, credit cards, telephone charge cards, cellular telephone accounts, pager accounts, and computer accounts.
(iv) Upon any termination of employment, upon the request of the Company, the Executive shall resign in writing, from all offices, directorships and fiduciary positions of the Executive in which the Executive is serving.
(v) The Executive agrees that, following his Termination Date, except as set forth herein, he shall not be eligible for or entitled to any other incentive compensation award, including any pro rata incentive compensation award, pursuant to the Company's and/or its subsidiaries' or affiliates' incentive compensation plans. The Executive's agreement to this provision is a material consideration for the Company's executing this Agreement.
(g) In the event of the Executive's termination for death or Disability, the Executive and, to the extent applicable, his legal representatives, executors, heirs, legatees and beneficiaries shall have no rights under this Agreement, other than the right to Accrued Benefits, and their sole recourse, if any, shall be under the death or disability provisions of the plans, programs, policies and practices of the Company and/or its subsidiaries and affiliates, as applicable to the Executive. If the Executive dies prior to payment of all severance benefits to which he is entitled, all Company obligations under the Agreement shall cease except for the Accrued Benefits (if unpaid at the time of death).
6. TRUSTS
(a) In order to ensure in the event of a Change of Control that timely payment will be made of certain obligations of the Company to the Executive provided for under this Agreement, the Company shall, immediately prior to or in connection with the consummation of a Change of Control, irrespective of whether the Change of Control constitutes a "change in ownership or effective control" or a change in the "ownership of a substantial portion of the assets" under Section 409A of the Code, and the rulings and regulations issued thereunder, pay into one or more trust(s) (the "Trust(s)") established between the Company and any financial institution with assets in excess of $100 million selected by the Company prior to the Change of Control, as trustee (the "Trustee"), such amounts and at such time or times as are required in order to fully pay all cash amounts due the Executive hereunder that are payable or as are otherwise required pursuant to the terms of the Trust(s), with payment to be made in cash or cash equivalents. Thereafter, all such payments required to be paid hereunder shall be made out of the Trust(s); provided, however, that the Company shall retain liability for and pay the Executive any amounts or provide for such other benefits due the Executive under this Agreement for which there are insufficient funds in the Trust(s), for which no funding of the Trust(s) is required or in the event that the Trustee fails to make such payment to the Executive within the time frames set forth in this Agreement. Prior to the Change of Control, and to the extent necessary because of a change in the Trustee, after the Change of Control, the Company shall provide the Executive with the name and address of the Trustee. Nothing in this Agreement shall require the Company to maintain the funding required in this section beyond the second anniversary of a Change of Control unless, before such second anniversary, the Executive's employment has terminated in a manner qualifying him for benefits hereunder. The Executive expressly waives any requirement under this Section 6 or otherwise for the Company to fund the Trust(s) if funding would cause him to be taxed under Code Section 409A(b) or any successor law.
(b) For purposes of this Agreement, the term "the Company and/or the Trustee" means the Trustee to the extent the Company has put funds in the Trust(s) and the Company to the extent the Company has not funded or fully funded the Trust(s). However, in accordance with subsection (a) above, the Company shall retain liability for and pay the Executive any amounts or provide for such other benefits due the Executive under this Agreement for which the Trustee fails to make adequate payment to the Executive within the time frames set forth in this Agreement.
7. INVENTIONS AND IMPROVEMENTS.
The Executive acknowledges that all ideas, discoveries, inventions and improvements which are made, conceived or reduced to practice by the Executive and every item of knowledge relating to the Company's business interests (including potential business interests) gained by the Executive during the Employment Term are the sole and absolute property of the Company, and the Executive shall promptly disclose and hereby irrevocably assigns all his right, title and interest in and to all such ideas, discoveries, inventions, improvements and knowledge to the Company for its sole use and benefit, without additional compensation, and shall communicate to the Company, without cost or delay, and without publishing the same, all available information relating thereto. The Executive also hereby waives all claims to moral rights in any such ideas, discoveries, inventions, improvements and knowledge. The provisions of this Section 7 shall apply whether such ideas, discoveries, inventions or knowledge are conceived, made, gained or reduced to practice by the Executive alone or with others, whether during or after usual working hours, whether on or off the job, whether applicable to matters directly or indirectly related to the Company's business interests (including potential business interests), and whether or not within the specific realm of the Executive's duties. Any of the Executive's ideas, discoveries, inventions and improvements relating to the Company's business interests or potential business interests and conceived, made or reduced to practice during the Severance Period shall for the purpose of this Agreement, be deemed to have been conceived, made or reduced to practice before the end of the Employment Term. The Executive shall, upon request of the Company, and without further compensation by the Company but at the expense of the Company, at any time during or after his employment with the Company, sign all instruments and documents requested by the Company and otherwise cooperate with the Company and take any actions which are or may be necessary to protect the Company's right to such ideas, discoveries, inventions, improvements and knowledge, including applying for, obtaining and enforcing patents, copyrights and trademark registrations thereon in any and all countries. To the extent this section shall be construed in accordance with the laws of any state which precludes a requirement to assign certain classes of inventions made by an employee, this Section shall be interpreted not to apply to any invention which a court rules and/or the Company agrees falls within such classes.
8. NO ASSIGNMENTS.
This Agreement shall not be assignable by the Executive. This Agreement shall be assignable by the Company only by merger or in connection with the sale or other disposition of a substantial portion of the assets of the Company. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit and be binding upon the personal or legal representatives, executors, administrators, successors, heirs, distributees, devisees, legatees and permitted assignees of the parties hereto. The Company shall require any successor to all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company, whether directly or indirectly, by purchase, merger, consolidation, acquisition of stock, or otherwise, expressly to assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent as the Company would be required to perform if no such succession had taken place, by a written agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Executive, delivered to the Executive within five (5) business days after such succession. As used in this Agreement, "Company" shall mean the Company as hereinbefore defined and any successor to its business and/or assets as aforesaid which assumes and agrees to perform this Agreement by operation of law, or otherwise.

In the event that the Executive is subpoenaed, or asked to provide confidential information or to testify as a witness or to produce documents in any existing or potential legal or administrative or other proceeding or investigation formal or informal related to the Company, to the extent permitted by applicable law, the Executive will promptly notify the Company of such subpoena or request and will, if requested, meet with the Company for a reasonable period of time prior to any such appearance or production.
(b) COVENANT AGAINST COMPETITION. During the Executive's employment with the Company or any subsidiary or affiliate, and thereafter during the longer of: (i) the Severance Period, if any, or (ii) twelve (12) months following the Executive's Termination Date (irrespective of the reason for the Executive's termination and without any reduction or modification), the Executive shall not, without the prior written consent of the Board directly or indirectly engage or become a partner, director, officer, principal, employee, consultant, investor, creditor or stockholder in/for any business, proprietorship, association, firm or corporation not owned or controlled by the Company or its subsidiaries or affiliates which is engaged or proposes to engage or hereafter engages in a business competitive directly or indirectly with the business conducted by the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates in any geographic area in which the Company is or was engaged in or actively planning to engage in business as of the Executive's Termination Date or during the previous twelve (12) month period; provided, however, that the Executive is not prohibited from owning one percent (1%) or less of the outstanding capital stock of any corporation whose stock is listed on a national securities exchange.
(c) COVENANT OF NON-SOLICITATION. During the Executive's employment with the Company or any subsidiary or affiliate, and thereafter during the longer of (i) the Severance Period, if any, or (ii) twelve (12) months following the Executive's Termination Date (irrespective of the reason for the Executive's termination and without any reduction or modification), the Executive shall not, directly or indirectly, in any manner or capacity whatsoever, either on the Executive's own account or for any person, firm or company:
(i) take away, interfere with relations with, divert or attempt to divert from the Company any business with any customer or account: (x) that was a customer or account on the last day of the Employment Term and/or has been solicited or serviced by the Company within one (1) year prior to the last day of the Employment Term; and (y) with which the Executive had any contact or association, or that was under the supervision of the Executive, or the identity of which was learned by the Executive, as a result of the Executive's employment with the Company, or
(ii) solicit, interfere with or induce, or attempt to induce, any employee or independent contractor of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates to leave his employment or service with the Company or to breach his employment agreement or other agreement, if any.
(d) COVENANT OF NON-DISPARAGEMENT AND COOPERATION. The Executive agrees not to make any remarks disparaging the conduct or character of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates, their current or former agents, employees, officers, directors, successors or assigns ("Ryder Parties"), except as may be necessary in the performance of his duties or as is otherwise required by law. The Executive agrees to cooperate with the Company in the investigation, defense or prosecution of any claims or actions now in existence or that may be brought in the future against or on behalf of the Company. Such cooperation shall include meeting with representatives of the Company upon reasonable notice at reasonable times and locations to prepare for discovery or any mediation, arbitration, trial, administrative hearing or other proceeding or to act as a witness. The Company shall reimburse the Executive for travel expenses approved by the Company or its subsidiaries or affiliates incurred in providing such assistance. The Executive shall notify the Company if the Executive is asked to assist, testify or provide information by or to any person, entity or agency in any such proceeding or investigation. Nothing in this provision is intended to or should be construed to prevent the Executive from providing truthful information to any person or entity as required by law or his fiduciary obligations.
(e) SPECIFIC REMEDY. The Executive acknowledges and agrees that if the Executive commits a material breach of the Covenant of Confidentiality or, if applicable, the Covenant Against Competition, the Covenant of Non-Solicitation, or the Covenant of Non-Disparagement and Cooperation, the Company shall have the right to have the covenant specifically enforced through an injunction or otherwise, without any obligation that the Company post a bond or prove actual damages, by any court having appropriate jurisdiction on the grounds that any such breach will cause irreparable injury to the Company, without prejudice to any other rights and remedies that Company may have for a breach of this Agreement, and that money damages will not provide an adequate remedy to the Company. The Executive further acknowledges and agrees that the Covenant of Confidentiality, the Covenant Against Competition, the Covenant of Non-Solicitation, and the Covenant of Non-Disparagement and Cooperation contained in this Agreement are intended to protect the Company's business interests and goodwill, are fair, do not unreasonably restrict his future employment and business opportunities, and are commensurate with the arrangements set out in this Agreement and with the other terms and conditions of the Executive's employment. In addition, in executing this Agreement, the Executive makes an election to receive severance pay and benefits pursuant to Section 5 and is subject to the covenants above, therefore, the Executive shall have no right to return any amounts or benefits that are already paid or to refuse to accept any amounts or benefits that are payable in the future in lieu of his specific performance of his obligations under the covenants above.
(f) SURVIVAL OF PROVISIONS. The obligations contained in this Section 10 shall survive the termination or expiration of the Executive's employment with the Company for any reason (including Section 5(d) hereof) and shall be fully enforceable thereafter. If it is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that any restriction in this Section 10 is excessive in duration or scope or extends for too long a period of time or over too great a range of activities or in too broad a geographic area or is unreasonable or unenforceable under the laws of the State of Florida, it is the intention of the parties that such restriction may be modified or amended by the court to render it enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by the laws of the State of Florida.
11. NO MITIGATION/NO OFFSET.
In the event of any termination of employment under this Agreement, the Executive shall be under no obligation to seek other employment and there shall be no offset against any amounts due the Executive under this Agreement on account of any remuneration attributable to any subsequent employment that the Executive may obtain. The amounts payable hereunder shall not be subject to setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other rights which the Company may have against the Executive or others, except as specifically set forth in Sections 5(c)(i)(D), 5(c)(iv)(C), 5(e)(i)(D), 5(f), 10, and 15, or upon obtaining by the Company of a final unappealable judgment against the Executive, in each case to the extent permitted by Section 409A of the Code.

Any payments made pursuant to this Section 12 shall be limited to expenses incurred on or prior to December 31 of the second calendar year following the calendar year in which the Termination Date occurs, and any payments by the Company made pursuant to this Section 12 shall be made on or prior to December 31 of the third calendar year following the calendar year in which the Termination Date occurs.

The Company shall withhold from any and all amounts payable under this Agreement such federal, state and local taxes as may be required to be withheld pursuant to any applicable law or regulation.
15. CODE SECTION 409A
(a) CONSTRUCTION AND INTERPRETATION. This Agreement shall be construed and interpreted in a manner so as not to trigger adverse tax consequences under Section 409A of the Code and the rulings and regulations issued thereunder. The Company may amend this Agreement in any manner necessary to comply with Code Section 409A or any successor law, without the consent of the Executive. Furthermore, to the extent necessary to comply with Code Section 409A, the payment terms for any of the payments or benefits payable hereunder may be delayed without the Executive's consent to comply with Code Section 409A.
(b) SEPARATION FROM SERVICE REQUIREMENTS. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Executive shall not be entitled to any payments or benefits pursuant to this Agreement in the event that his termination of employment does not constitute a "separation from service" as defined by Section 409A of the Code and the regulations issued thereunder. For purposes of determining whether a "separation from service", as defined by Section 409A of the Code, has occurred, pursuant to Treas. Reg. 1.409A-1(h)(3), the Company has elected to use "at least 80 percent" each place it appears in Sections 1563(a)(1), (2), and (3) of the Code and in Treas. Reg. 1.414(c)-2.
(c) DELAYED COMMENCEMENT OF BENEFITS. If the Executive is a Specified Employee at the time of his Termination Date, and the deferral of the commencement of any payments or benefits otherwise payable hereunder is necessary in order to prevent any accelerated or additional tax under Section 409A of the Code, then, to the extent permitted by Section 409A of the Code, the Company will defer the commencement of the payment of any such payments or benefits hereunder until the first day following the six-month anniversary of the Termination Date (or the earliest date as is permitted under Section 409A of the Code). If any payments or benefits are deferred due to such requirements, (whether they would have otherwise been payable in a single sum or in installments in the absence of such deferral) they shall be paid or reimbursed to the Executive in a lump sum on the first day following the six-month anniversary of the Termination Date, and any remaining payments and benefits due under this Agreement shall be paid or provided in accordance with the normal payment dates specified for them herein.
(d) PAYMENTS AND REIMBURSEMENTS. Except as otherwise provided herein, any reimbursements or in-kind benefits provided under this Agreement shall be made or provided in accordance with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, including, where applicable, the requirement that (i) any reimbursement is for expenses incurred during the period of time specified in this Agreement (or, if no such period is specified, the Executive's lifetime), (ii) the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in kind benefits provided, during a calendar year may not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in kind benefits to be provided, in any other calendar year, (iii) the reimbursement of an eligible expense will be made no later than the last day of the calendar year following the year in which the expense is incurred, and (iv) the right to reimbursement or in kind benefits is not subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit. In addition, for purposes of the limitations on nonqualified deferred compensation under Section 409A, each payment of compensation under this Agreement shall be treated as a separate payment of compensation for purposes of applying the Section 409A deferral election rules and the exclusion from Section 409A for certain short-term deferral amounts and separation pay. Notwithstanding any other provision set forth herein, any payments which are intended to constitute separation pay due to an involuntary separation from service in accordance with Treas. Reg. 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii) shall be paid no later than the last day of the second calendar year following the calendar year in which the Termination Date occurs.
(e) COMPANY ENTITY. For purposes of this Agreement, Company Entity means any member of a controlled group of corporations or a group of trades or businesses under common control of which the Company is a member; for purposes of this Section 15(e), a "controlled group of corporations" means a controlled group of corporations as defined in Section 414(b) of the Code and a "group of trades or businesses under common control" means a group of trades or businesses under common control as defined in Section 414(c) of the Code, without any modifications.
16. SECTION HEADINGS.

18. CHOICE OF LAW; JURISDICTION; JURY TRIAL WAIVER.
The validity, interpretation, construction, and performance of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Florida without regard to its conflicts of law principles. The parties agree that any suit, action or other legal proceeding that is commenced to resolve any matter arising under or relating to any provision of this Agreement shall be commenced only in a court of the State of Florida (or, if appropriate, a federal court located within the State of Florida), in either case located in Miami, Florida, and the parties consent to the jurisdiction of such court. The parties hereto accept the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of those courts for the purpose of any such suit, action or proceeding. The Company and the Executive each hereby irrevocably waive any right to a trial by jury in any action, suit or other legal proceeding arising under or relating to any provision of this Agreement.
19. SEVERABILITY.
The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof.

No agreements or representations, oral or otherwise, express or implied, with respect to the subject matter hereof have been made by either party which are not expressly set forth in this Agreement.
22. GENDER.

In the event that the Executive was a Specified Employee on his Termination Date, if the sum of the payments which the Executive previously received in accordance with Section 5(c)(i)(B) and the payment set forth in this Section 5(c)(ii) exceeds the Separation Pay Limit, any amounts in excess of the Separation Pay Limit shall be paid on the later of (A) the first day following the six-month anniversary of the Termination Date and (B) within seven (7) calendar days after the Change of Control. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event that the provisions of this Section 5(c)(ii) become effective, they shall supersede the provisions of Section 5(c)(i)(B).
(iii) If a Change of Control occurs and (A) the Executive experienced an Involuntary Termination within twelve (12) months prior to the date on which the Change of Control occurs and (B) it is reasonably demonstrated by the Executive that such termination of employment either (a) was at the request of a third party who has taken steps reasonably calculated to effect a Change of Control or (b) otherwise arose in connection with or in anticipation of a Change of Control, then in addition to the payments and benefits set forth in Section 5(c)(i), the Executive shall be entitled to the following: (x) a lump sum payment equal to 50% of the Executive's Base Salary, payable as soon as practicable but no later than sixty (60) days following the Change of Control; provided that if the Executive was a Specified Employee on his Termination Date, such payment shall be paid on the later of (1) as soon as practicable but no later than sixty (60) days following the Change of Control and (2) the first day following the six-month anniversary of the Executive's Termination Date; (y) the difference between the Target Bonus payment which the Executive would have received if the Severance Multiple had been two (2) and the Target Bonus amount paid to the Executive pursuant to Section 5(c)(i)(C), which shall be paid as soon as practicable following the Change of Control but no later than March 15 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the Change of Control occurs; and (z) for purposes of determining the Severance Period for benefits provided under Sections 5(c)(i)(D), (F), and (G), the Executive's Severance Period shall be defined as the twenty-four (24) month period following the Termination Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that (A) a Change of Control occurs and payments and benefits become payable to the Executive pursuant to this Section 5(c)(iii); and (B) such Change of Control does not constitute a "change in ownership or effective control" or a change in the "ownership of a substantial portion of assets" under Section 409A of the Code and the rules and regulations issued thereunder, the lump sum payment set forth in (x) above shall be paid on the first anniversary of the Executive's Termination Date.

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no payments or continued benefits on account of termination of employment hereunder (other than any Accrued Benefits payable in accordance with their terms) shall be made to the Executive prior to the Release Effective Date. In the event that the Executive does not execute the Release within fifty (50) days following the Termination Date or the Release Effective Date does not occur within sixty (60) days following the Termination Date, the Executive shall not be entitled to any payments or benefits hereunder (other than the Accrued Benefits payable pursuant to their terms); provided that, if the Executive becomes entitled to payments and benefits pursuant to Section 5(c)(iv), the Executive shall not be entitled to any payments or benefits hereunder in the event the Executive does not execute the Release within fifty (50) days following the Change of Control or the Release Effective Date does not occur within sixty (60) days following the date of the Change of Control.
(ii) As consideration for the Company's offer of this Agreement to the Executive and for other good and valuable consideration, during his employment and upon termination of employment for any reason, the Executive agrees to comply with the restrictive covenants contained in Section 10 of this Agreement. In addition, receipt of the severance payments and benefits set forth in Section 5 is expressly conditioned upon the Executive's continued compliance with Section 10. If the Executive is receiving severance payments and/or benefits under Section 5, and (A) if the Executive is reemployed by the Company (or any subsidiary, affiliate or successor) or breaches this Agreement or the Release, or (B) if the Company (or any subsidiary, affiliate or successor) discovers information that would have permitted the Company to terminate the Executive for Cause or if the Company or any subsidiary, affiliate or successor discovers a breach of Section 10, severance payments and benefits shall immediately cease with respect to such termination. If the severance payments and benefits cease because of re-employment and the Company has paid severance in a lump sum, the Company (or any subsidiary or successor) shall have the right to require that the Executive repay to the applicable entity the value of the severance benefits that would not yet have been paid before re-employment if he had been receiving the severance in semi-monthly installments, and the Executive shall no longer be entitled to any severance payments and benefits with respect to such termination. If severance payments and benefits cease because of a Cause determination or a breach of Section 10, the Company (or any subsidiary or successor) shall have the right to require that the Executive repay to the applicable entity the full value of any previously received severance. The remedies described in this paragraph are in addition to any other remedies that may be available to the Company in the event of the occurrence of any of the circumstances described in this paragraph.

The Executive further agrees that he will leave intact all electronic Company documents, including those which the Executive developed or helped develop during his employment, and that he will promptly cancel all accounts for his benefit, if any, in the Company's name including, without limitation, credit cards, telephone charge cards, cellular telephone accounts, pager accounts, and computer accounts.
(iv) Upon any termination of employment, upon the request of the Company, the Executive shall resign in writing, from all offices, directorships and fiduciary positions of the Executive in which the Executive is serving.

6. TRUSTS
(a) In order to ensure in the event of a Change of Control that timely payment will be made of certain obligations of the Company to the Executive provided for under this Agreement, the Company shall, immediately prior to or in connection with the consummation of a Change of Control, irrespective of whether the Change of Control constitutes a "change in ownership or effective control" or a change in the "ownership of a substantial portion of the assets" under Section 409A of the Code, and the rulings and regulations issued thereunder, pay into one or more trust(s) (the "Trust(s)") established between the Company and any financial institution with assets in excess of $100 million selected by the Company prior to the Change of Control, as trustee (the "Trustee"), such amounts and at such time or times as are required in order to fully pay all cash amounts due the Executive hereunder that are payable or as are otherwise required pursuant to the terms of the Trust(s), with payment to be made in cash or cash equivalents. Thereafter, all such payments required to be paid hereunder shall be made out of the Trust(s); provided, however, that the Company shall retain liability for and pay the Executive any amounts or provide for such other benefits due the Executive under this Agreement for which there are insufficient funds in the Trust(s), for which no funding of the Trust(s) is required or in the event that the Trustee fails to make such payment to the Executive within the time frames set forth in this Agreement. Prior to the Change of Control, and to the extent necessary because of a change in the Trustee, after the Change of Control, the Company shall provide the Executive with the name and address of the Trustee. Nothing in this Agreement shall require the Company to maintain the funding required in this section beyond the second anniversary of a Change of Control unless, before such second anniversary, the Executive's employment has terminated in a manner qualifying him for benefits hereunder. The Executive expressly waives any requirement under this Section 6 or otherwise for the Company to fund the Trust(s) if funding would cause him to be taxed under Code Section 409A(b) or any successor law.
(b) For purposes of this Agreement, the term "the Company and/or the Trustee" means the Trustee to the extent the Company has put funds in the Trust(s) and the Company to the extent the Company has not funded or fully funded the Trust(s). However, in accordance with subsection (a) above, the Company shall retain liability for and pay the Executive any amounts or provide for such other benefits due the Executive under this Agreement for which the Trustee fails to make adequate payment to the Executive within the time frames set forth in this Agreement.
7. INVENTIONS AND IMPROVEMENTS.
The Executive acknowledges that all ideas, discoveries, inventions and improvements which are made, conceived or reduced to practice by the Executive and every item of knowledge relating to the Company's business interests (including potential business interests) gained by the Executive during the Employment Term are the sole and absolute property of the Company, and the Executive shall promptly disclose and hereby irrevocably assigns all his right, title and interest in and to all such ideas, discoveries, inventions, improvements and knowledge to the Company for its sole use and benefit, without additional compensation, and shall communicate to the Company, without cost or delay, and without publishing the same, all available information relating thereto. The Executive also hereby waives all claims to moral rights in any such ideas, discoveries, inventions, improvements and knowledge. The provisions of this Section 7 shall apply whether such ideas, discoveries, inventions or knowledge are conceived, made, gained or reduced to practice by the Executive alone or with others, whether during or after usual working hours, whether on or off the job, whether applicable to matters directly or indirectly related to the Company's business interests (including potential business interests), and whether or not within the specific realm of the Executive's duties. Any of the Executive's ideas, discoveries, inventions and improvements relating to the Company's business interests or potential business interests and conceived, made or reduced to practice during the Severance Period shall for the purpose of this Agreement, be deemed to have been conceived, made or reduced to practice before the end of the Employment Term. The Executive shall, upon request of the Company, and without further compensation by the Company but at the expense of the Company, at any time during or after his employment with the Company, sign all instruments and documents requested by the Company and otherwise cooperate with the Company and take any actions which are or may be necessary to protect the Company's right to such ideas, discoveries, inventions, improvements and knowledge, including applying for, obtaining and enforcing patents, copyrights and trademark registrations thereon in any and all countries. To the extent this section shall be construed in accordance with the laws of any state which precludes a requirement to assign certain classes of inventions made by an employee, this Section shall be interpreted not to apply to any invention which a court rules and/or the Company agrees falls within such classes.
8. NO ASSIGNMENTS.
This Agreement shall not be assignable by the Executive. This Agreement shall be assignable by the Company only by merger or in connection with the sale or other disposition of a substantial portion of the assets of the Company.

Reg. 1.409A-1(h)(3), the Company has elected to use "at least 80 percent" each place it appears in Sections 1563(a)(1), (2), and (3) of the Code and in Treas. Reg. 1.414(c)-2.

If the Executive is a Specified Employee at the time of his Termination Date, and the deferral of the commencement of any payments or benefits otherwise payable hereunder is necessary in order to prevent any accelerated or additional tax under Section 409A of the Code, then, to the extent permitted by Section 409A of the Code, the Company will defer the commencement of the payment of any such payments or benefits hereunder until the first day following the six-month anniversary of the Termination Date (or the earliest date as is permitted under Section 409A of the Code). If any payments or benefits are deferred due to such requirements, (whether they would have otherwise been payable in a single sum or in installments in the absence of such deferral) they shall be paid or reimbursed to the Executive in a lump sum on the first day following the six-month anniversary of the Termination Date, and any remaining payments and benefits due under this Agreement shall be paid or provided in accordance with the normal payment dates specified for them herein.
(d) PAYMENTS AND REIMBURSEMENTS. Except as otherwise provided herein, any reimbursements or in-kind benefits provided under this Agreement shall be made or provided in accordance with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, including, where applicable, the requirement that (i) any reimbursement is for expenses incurred during the period of time specified in this Agreement (or, if no such period is specified, the Executive's lifetime), (ii) the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in kind benefits provided, during a calendar year may not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in kind benefits to be provided, in any other calendar year, (iii) the reimbursement of an eligible expense will be made no later than the last day of the calendar year following the year in which the expense is incurred, and (iv) the right to reimbursement or in kind benefits is not subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit. In addition, for purposes of the limitations on nonqualified deferred compensation under Section 409A, each payment of compensation under this Agreement shall be treated as a separate payment of compensation for purposes of applying the Section 409A deferral election rules and the exclusion from Section 409A for certain short-term deferral amounts and separation pay. Notwithstanding any other provision set forth herein, any payments which are intended to constitute separation pay due to an involuntary separation from service in accordance with Treas. Reg. 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii) shall be paid no later than the last day of the second calendar year following the calendar year in which the Termination Date occurs.

Reg.  1.409A-1(c)(2); provided further that, if the Participant is a Key Employee at the time of such Separation from Employment, to the extent required by Section 409A of the Code, no payment may be made earlier than 6 months following the date of Separation from Employment, and any payments which would have otherwise been made during such 6 month period shall be distributed on the January 1 of the following year.

(1) The monthly benefit to which the Participant would have been entitled at his normal retirement date and at each early retirement date will be computed in accordance with the terms of the Retirement Plan, where such amount shall be computed without regard to limitations under Sections 401(a)(17) and 415 of the Code or any other Code requirement and shall be computed by counting such Participant's Tax-Deferred Contributions (as defined by the Deferred Compensation Plan) under the Deferred Compensation Plan in the year of deferral. For this purpose, each Participant will be deemed to have met the applicable requirements to be eligible for the maximum early retirement benefit that could be payable under the terms of the Retirement Plan in which he or she participates.
(2) The amount of benefit payable under the Retirement Plan will be computed at each applicable early and normal retirement age.
(3) After subtracting the amount in (2) above from the amount determined in (1) above at each applicable early or normal retirement age, a lump sum cash payment amount shall be determined by applying the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) annuity rates, in effect as of January 1 of the year that includes the date of the Change of Control, to the resulting benefit payable at each of the retirement ages. The result which produces the largest lump sum amount shall be the cash amount payable under this Plan.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a Change of Control occurs prior to a Participant's Benefit Commencement Date, which does not give rise to a change in the "ownership or effective control" or in the "ownership of a substantial portion of the assets" under Section 409A of the Code and the rulings and regulations issued thereunder, a Participant's BRP Benefits shall be calculated in accordance with Section 3.02 and distributed in accordance with Article IV without regard to Section 4.06.
(b)
Adjustment to Payment to Cover Participant's Tax Liability
(1) In addition to the cash payment determined under 3.03(a) above, in the event of a Change of Control prior to a Participant's Benefit Commencement Date, an additional amount shall be payable to the Participant such that the total cash payment amount to the Participant shall be equal to the amount that would (after adjusting for the assumed amount of federal income tax applicable to the total cash payment) result in a net cash after-tax amount to the Participant equal to the cash payment amount determined in 3.03(a) above, as determined by an independent tax advisor or accounting firm. Such amount shall be paid to the Participant as soon as practicable following the Change of Control but in no event later than the end of the calendar year following the calendar year in which such taxes are remitted to the appropriate taxing authority.
(2) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a Change of Control occurs prior to a Participant's Benefit Commencement Date, which does not give rise to a change in the "ownership or effective control" or in the "ownership of a substantial portion of the assets" under Section 409A of the Code and the rulings and regulations issued thereunder, a Participant shall not be entitled to any further payments or benefits pursuant to this Section 3.03(b).

Thereafter, all Delayed Payments shall be paid out of the Trust(s); provided, however, that the Company shall retain liability for and pay the applicable Participant any amounts or provide for such other benefits due the Participant under the Plan for which there are insufficient funds in the Trust(s), for which no funding of the Trust(s) is required, or in the event that the Trustee fails to make such payment to the Participant within the timeframes set forth in the Plan.
Change of Control Funding
(d)  In the event a Participant receives distribution of his BRP Benefits pursuant to Section 3.03(a) and 3.03(b)(1), any future benefits payable under this Plan to the Participant shall be actuarially adjusted to reflect the benefits paid under such provisions. The purpose of this Section 3.03(d) is to avoid the duplication of benefit payments on behalf of a Participant.
No Duplication of Benefits
3.04 . The amount of BRP Benefits determined hereunder shall be subject to adjustments to reflect any changes in the application of the limitations imposed by Sections 401(a)(17) and 415 of the Code or any other Code requirement with respect to the computations of benefits under the Retirement Plan.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the requirements set forth in Section 4.02(d)(i), (ii), and (iii) shall not apply to elections by an individual other than the Participant with respect to distributions to an individual other than the Participant, to the extent such elections are reflected in, or made in accordance with, the terms of a domestic relations order (as defined in Section 414(p)(1)(B) of the Code).
4.03 . If a Participant becomes Disabled prior to his Separation from Service and commencement of payment of BRP Benefits in accordance with any other section of this Article IV, the Participant's Benefit Commencement Date shall be the first day of the month which occurs 2 years and 5 months following the date of the Participant's Disability; provided that, the Participant notifies the Company of his Disability, which notice shall include notice of the Participant's eligibility for receipt of disability benefits from the Social Security Administration, prior to December 31 of the calendar year in which the Participant receives such notice from the Social Security Administration.

(b) If a Participant dies prior to commencement of payment of BRP Benefits in accordance with any other section of this Article IV, the Benefit Commencement Date for BRP Benefits payable to his Eligible Spouse shall be the later of: (i) the first day of the month following the date the Participant would have attained age 65; or (ii) the first day of the month following the date of the Participant's death. If the Participant is not survived by an Eligible Spouse, no BRP Benefits shall be payable from the Plan.
4.05 . Upon the written request of a Participant and in the event the Committee determines that an Unforeseeable Emergency has occurred with respect to a Participant, the Participant may be permitted to receive a partial or full payment of his vested BRP Benefits, to the extent they were not accrued and vested on December 31, 2004, as long as the amounts distributed with respect to the Unforeseeable Emergency do not exceed the amounts reasonably necessary to satisfy such emergency (including amounts necessary to pay income taxes or penalties reasonably anticipated to result from the distribution), after taking into account the extent to which such Unforeseeable Emergency is or may be relieved through reimbursement or compensation from insurance or otherwise or by liquidation of the Participant's assets (to the extent the liquidation of such assets would not itself cause severe financial hardship). Distribution of BRP Benefits pursuant to this Section 4.05 shall not exceed the lesser of (i) the amount the Committee deems to be necessary to meet the emergency or (ii) the Actuarially Equivalent value of the Participant's vested BRP Benefits (excluding BRP Benefits which were accrued and vested on December 31, 2004).
Distributions upon the Occurrence of an Unforeseeable Emergency
4.06 . In the event of a Change of Control prior to commencement of payment of BRP Benefits in accordance with any other section of this Article IV, a Participant shall receive an immediate cash lump sum payment in the amount calculated pursuant to Section 3.03(a) herein.
Payment in the event of a Change of Control
4.07 . Notwithstanding any provision of this Article IV to the contrary, in the event that on the date of a Participant's Separation from Service, the Actuarially Equivalent lump sum value of a Participant's vested BRP Benefits, excluding BRP Benefits which were accrued and vested on December 31, 2004, does not exceed the limit set forth in Section 402(g)(1)(B) of the Code on such date, subject to Section 4.09, the Participant's vested BRP Benefits shall be payable in the form of an Actuarially Equivalent lump sum upon the Participant's Separation from Service; provided that, the payment results in the termination and liquidation of the entirety of the Participant's interest in the Plan, including all agreements, methods, programs, or other arrangements with respect to which deferrals of compensation are treated as having been deferred under a single nonqualified deferred compensation plan under Treas. Reg.  1.409A-1(c)(2).
Payment of Small Benefits
4.08 . The Committee may accelerate the time or schedule of a payment to an individual other than a Participant to the extent necessary to fulfill a domestic relations order (as defined in Section 414(p)(1)(B) of the Code).
Domestic Relations Orders
4.09 . Notwithstanding any provision contained herein, in the event that the Participant is a Specified Employee upon his Separation from Service, and the deferral of the commencement of any payments or benefits otherwise payable hereunder is necessary in order to prevent any accelerated or additional tax under Section 409A of the Code, then to the extent permitted by Section 409A of the Code, his Benefit Commencement Date shall not occur prior to the first day following the 6 month anniversary of his Separation from Service (or, if earlier, upon the Participant's death). If BRP Benefits to a Participant are delayed in order to comply with this Section 4.09, any payments which would have otherwise been made to the Participant during such 6 month period shall be paid on the first day following the 6 month anniversary of the Participant's Separation from Service, without interest. If the Participant dies during such 6 month period, the amount withheld on account of Section 409A shall be paid to the Participant's Beneficiary within 30 days of the Participant's death.
Payments to Specified Employees
5.01 . The Committee shall administer this Plan. The Committee shall have, and shall exercise and perform, all the powers, rights, authorities and duties set forth in the Retirement Plan with the same effect as if set forth in full herein with respect to this Plan; provided that, the Committee's exercise of such powers, rights, authorities, and duties shall at all times comply with Section 409A of the Code. Any determination or decision by the Committee shall be conclusive and binding on all persons who at any time have or claim to have any interest whatsoever under this Plan. The Committee may appoint a plan administrator who will be responsible for and who will perform all duties and obligations delegated to him by the Committee. The Committee shall have the power to delegate those duties it deems necessary and appropriate for the plan administrator to perform.
Administration
5.02 .
Amendment or Termination
(a) Ryder intends the Plan to be permanent but reserves the right, by resolution of the Compensation Committee of the Board (the "Compensation Committee") to amend or terminate the Plan when, in the sole opinion of the Board or the Compensation Committee, such amendment or termination is advisable; provided, however, that no amendment or termination of the Plan shall reduce a Participant's BRP Benefits as of the effective date of such amendment or termination, without the prior written consent of each affected Participant. Any such amendment or termination shall be made pursuant to a resolution of the Compensation Committee, and shall be effective as of the date stated therein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may amend the Plan if and to the extent required to comply with applicable laws or regulations.
(b) Upon termination of the Plan, each Participant shall become 100% vested in his BRP Benefits, and the distribution of BRP Benefits shall be made to the Participant or his Beneficiary in the manner and at the time described in Articles III and IV of the Plan; provided, however, that no Participant shall accrue any further BRP Benefits subsequent to the date of such termination.
(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Plan is terminated, Participants shall be entitled to a distribution of their BRP Benefits if such termination is on account of a Change of Control, corporate dissolution or other permitted distribution event under Treas. Reg. 1.409A-3(j)(4)(ix)(A), (B), (C), or (D) (or any successor provision) and the requirements, as applicable, of such regulations are met with respect to the termination of the Plan and distribution of benefits hereunder.
A person who believes that he is being denied a benefit to which he is entitled under the Plan may file a written claim for such benefit which will be governed by the claims procedures set forth in the Retirement Plan.
7.01 . No right, title or interest of any kind in the Plan shall be transferable or assignable by any Participant or Beneficiary or any other person or be subject to alienation, anticipation, encumbrance, garnishment, attachment, execution or levy of any kind, whether voluntary or involuntary, and no such right, title or interest may be taken, either voluntarily or involuntarily for the satisfaction of debts of, or other obligations or claims against, any Participant or Beneficiary, including claims in bankruptcy proceedings. Any attempt to alienate, sell, transfer, assign, pledge, garnish, attach or otherwise encumber or dispose of any interest in the Plan shall be void. Except as provided in Section 3.03(c), benefits shall be paid from the Company's general funds or as otherwise determined by the Compensation Committee.
Spend Thrift Clause
7.02 . The establishment of this Plan shall not be construed as giving to any Participant, employee or any person whomsoever, any legal, equitable or other rights against the Company, or its officers, directors, agents or shareholders, or its giving to any Participant or Beneficiary any equity or other interest in the assets, business or shares of the Company. Subject to the rights of the Company to terminate this Plan or any benefit hereunder, the rights of a Participant hereunder shall be solely those of an unsecured creditor of the Company. Nothing contained in the Plan shall constitute a guaranty by the Company or any other person or entity that the assets of the Company will be sufficient to pay any benefit hereunder.
Rights Against the Company
7.03 . If any Participant or Beneficiary is, in the judgment of the Committee, legally, physically or mentally incapable of personally receiving and receipting for any payment due hereunder, payment may be made to the guardian or other legal representative of such Participant or Beneficiary or, if none, to such person or institution who, in the opinion of the Committee, is then maintaining or has custody of such Participant or Beneficiary. Such payments shall constitute a full discharge with respect thereto.
Indirect Payment of Benefits
7.04 . Any benefit payable under the Retirement Plan shall be paid solely in accordance with the terms and provisions thereof, and nothing in this Agreement shall operate or be construed in any way to modify, amend or affect the terms and provisions of the Retirement Plan.
Retirement Plan Benefits
7.05 . The establishment of the Plan shall not be construed as conferring any legal or other rights upon any Participant or any person for a continuation of employment, nor shall it interfere with the rights of the Company to discharge any Participant or otherwise act with relation to him. The Company may take any action (including discharge) with respect to any Participant or other person and may treat him without regard to the effect such action or treatment might have upon him as a Participant in the Plan.
No Right to Continued Employment
7.06 . Each person entitled to a benefit under the Plan must file with the Company, in writing, his post office address and each change of post office address which occurs between the date of his Separation from Service and the date he ceases to be a Participant. Any communication, statement, or notice addressed to such a person at his latest reported post office address will be binding upon him for all purposes of the Plan and neither the Committee, nor the Company shall be obligated to search for or ascertain his whereabouts.
Notice of Address
7.07 . Any notice required or permitted to be given hereunder to a Participant or Beneficiary will be properly given if delivered or mailed, postage prepaid, to the Participant or Beneficiary at his last post office address as shown on the Company's records. Any notice to the Committee or the Company shall be properly given or filed upon receipt by the Committee or the Company, as the case may be, at such address as may be specified from time to time by the Committee.
Notices
7.08 . Any notice required hereunder may be waived by the person entitled thereto.
Waiver of Notice
7.09 . Notwithstanding any of the preceding provisions of the Plan, neither the Company, the Committee, nor any individual acting as employee or agent of the Company or the Committee shall be liable to any Participant, former Participant or other person for any claim, loss, liability or expense incurred in connection with the Plan.
Limitations on Liability
7.10 . The Company shall have the right to make such provisions as it deems necessary or appropriate to satisfy any obligations it may have to withhold Federal, state or local income or other taxes incurred by reason of payments pursuant to the Plan. In lieu thereof, the Company shall have the right to withhold the amount of such taxes from any other sums due or to become due from the Company to the Participant upon such terms and conditions as the Committee may prescribe.
Withholding of Taxes
7.11 . In the event that any provision of this Plan shall be declared illegal or invalid for any reason, said illegality or invalidity shall not affect the remaining provisions of this Plan but shall be fully severable, and this Plan shall be construed and enforced as if said illegal or invalid provision had never been inserted herein.
Severability
7.12 . The article and section headings and numbers are included only for convenience of reference and are not to be taken as limiting or extending the meaning of any of the terms and provisions of this Plan. Whenever appropriate, words used in the singular shall include the plural or the plural may be read as the singular, and references to the masculine gender shall include the feminine gender.
Construction of Agreement
7.13 . Except to the extent preempted by ERISA or other federal law, the Plan shall be construed and administered under the laws of the State of Florida.
Governing Law
7.14 . Except as provided in Section 3.03(c), this Plan is not funded, escrowed or trusteed in any way or form, and the establishment of any bookkeeping account or entry or private investment by the Company to assist it in providing the benefits contemplated hereunder shall not give any Participant, Beneficiary or other party whomsoever any interest in or right to such account, entry or investment. It is Ryder's intention that this Plan be a plan which is unfunded and maintained primarily for the purpose of restoring benefits that exceed the limits prescribed under the Code.
No Requirement to Fund
Ryder has caused this Plan to be signed by its duly appointed officers and its corporate seal to be hereunto affixed as of the day of December, 2008.
