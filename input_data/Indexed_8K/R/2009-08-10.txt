Exhibit 99.1
News Release
     MIAMI, August 10, 2009  Ryder System, Inc.(NYSE: R) has commenced a cash tender offer to purchase up to $100 million aggregate principal amount of certain of its outstanding notes as described below (the "Offer"). The terms and conditions of the tender offer are described in Ryder's Offer to Purchase dated August 10, 2009 (the "Offer to Purchase") and the related Letter of Transmittal. Ryder expects to purchase the notes with commercial paper borrowings.
The Tender Offer
     Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase and the related Letter of Transmittal, Ryder is offering to purchase up to $100 million aggregate principal amount of (1) 5.95% Notes due May 2011 ("May 2011 Notes"), (2) 5.0% Notes due April 2011 ("April 2011 Notes") and (3) 4.625% Notes due April 2010 ("April 2010 Notes" and together with the May 2011 Notes and the April 2011 Notes, the "Notes"). The amount of each series of Notes that is purchased in the Offer will be based on the order of priority (the "Acceptance Priority Level") for such series, subject to a cap of $50 million on the aggregate principal amount of May 2011 Notes and April 2011 Notes, on a combined basis, that may be purchased.
 
     If there are sufficient remaining funds to purchase some, but not all, of the Notes of a series of an applicable Acceptance Priority Level, the amount of Notes purchased in that series will be prorated based on the aggregate principal amount of Notes of such series validly tendered and not validly withdrawn in the Offer.
     Holders of Notes that are validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or before 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on August 21, 2009 (the "Early Tender Date") and accepted for purchase will receive the Total Consideration specified in the table above for each $1,000 principal amount of Notes purchased, which will include the applicable early tender payment set forth in the table above per $1,000 principal amount of Notes purchased (the "Early Tender Payment"). Holders of Notes that are validly tendered after 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Early Tender Date, but at or before 12:00 midnight, New York City time, on September 4, 2009 (the "Expiration Date") and accepted for purchase will receive the Total Consideration less the Early Tender Payment (the "Late Tender Offer Consideration"). In addition to the Total Consideration or Late Tender Offer Consideration, as the case may be, payable in respect of Notes accepted for purchase, holders will receive accrued and unpaid interest on their purchased
 
Notes from the applicable last interest payment date to, but not including, the date of payment for purchased Notes. Tenders of Notes may be validly withdrawn at any time up to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on August 21, 2009 (the "Withdrawal Date") but, except as required by law, after such time may not be validly withdrawn.
     The Offer is scheduled to expire at 12:00 midnight, New York City time, on the Expiration Date, unless extended. The Offer is not subject to the receipt of any minimum amount of tenders but is subject to the general conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase and the related Letter of Transmittal.
     Provided that the conditions to the Offer have been satisfied or waived, payment for Notes purchased in the Offer will be made promptly after the Expiration Date, which is expected to be two business days following the Expiration Date, or September 9, 2009.
     Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer, we will notify the Tender Agent, D.F. King & Co., Inc., promptly after the Expiration Date, of which Notes tendered are accepted for purchase and payment pursuant to the Offer. If you validly tender your Notes and do not validly withdraw them and we accept them for purchase, subject to the terms and conditions of the Offer, including the proration procedures set forth in the Offer to Purchase, we will pay you the Total Consideration or Late Tender Offer Consideration, as applicable, together with accrued and unpaid interest on the tendered Notes from the last interest payment date applicable to the Notes to, but not including, the Settlement Date ("Accrued Interest").
