     On September 8, 2009, Ryder System, Inc. ("Ryder") issued a press release announcing that approximately $289 million aggregate principal amount of its outstanding 5.95% Notes due May 2011, 5.0% Notes due April 2011 and 4.625% Notes due April 2010 (collectively, the "Notes") had been validly tendered and not validly withdrawn in the previously announced cash tender offer (the "Offer") for up to $100 million aggregate principal amount of Notes.

A copy of the press release announcing the results of the Offer is furnished hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
     From time to time in the future, Ryder may acquire Notes that were not purchased in the Offer, or other outstanding notes, through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, tender offers, exchange offers or otherwise, upon such terms and at such prices as Ryder may determine, which may be more or less than the price to be paid pursuant to the Offer and could be for cash or other consideration. Alternatively, Ryder may, subject to certain conditions, redeem any or all of the Notes not purchased pursuant to the Offer at any time that it is permitted to do so under the respective indentures governing the Notes.

     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Exhibit 99.1 News Release
     MIAMI, September 8, 2009  Ryder System, Inc. (NYSE: R) today announced the final results of the previously announced cash tender offer (the "Offer") for up to $100 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding 5.95% Notes due May 2011, 5.0% Notes due April 2011, and 4.625% Notes due 2010 (collectively, the "Notes"). As of 12:00 midnight, New York City time, on September 4, 2009 (the "Expiration Date"), approximately $289 million aggregate principal amount of Notes had been validly tendered and not validly withdrawn in the Offer.
     The amounts of each series of Notes accepted for purchase in the Offer were determined based on (i) the order of priority (the "Acceptance Priority Level") for such series, (ii) a cap of $50 million on the aggregate principal amount of May 2011 Notes and April 2011 Notes, on a combined basis, that may be purchased, and (iii) a maximum tender cap of $100 million on the aggregate principal amount of Notes that may be purchased in the Offer. Because the aggregate principal amount of May 2011 Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn exceeded $50 million, no April 2011 Notes will be purchased. Because the aggregate principal amount of May 2011 Notes and April 2010 Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn exceeded the respective principal amounts being accepted for purchase pursuant to the Offer, tendered May 2011 Notes and April 2010 Notes will be purchased on a pro rata basis.
 
     The following table sets forth the amount of each series of Notes validly tendered as of the Expiration Date, the amount accepted for purchase and the applicable approximate proration factors.
 
     The terms and conditions of the Offer are described in the Offer to Purchase dated August 10, 2009 and the related Letter of Transmittal (the "Offer Documents").
     The Dealer Managers for the Offer were Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Jefferies & Company, Inc. and SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
