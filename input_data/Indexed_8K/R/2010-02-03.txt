Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On February 3, 2010, we issued a press release reporting our financial results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2009 (the "Press Release"). We also hosted a conference call and webcast on February 3, 2010 during which we made a presentation on our financial results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2009 (the "Presentation"). The Press Release and the Presentation are available on our website at .
www.ryder.com
The Press Release and Presentation include information regarding comparable earnings from continuing operations, comparable earnings per share from continuing operations and comparable tax rate from continuing operations for both fourth quarter and full year 2009 and 2008, which are non-GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC regulations. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors, and allow for better year-over-year comparison, as the measures exclude from our GAAP earnings from continuing operations, earnings per share from continuing operations and tax rate from continuing operations, as applicable, (1) restructuring charges, (2) the reversal of contingent income tax accruals, (3) certain tax benefits, including a benefit in the fourth quarter of 2009 related to changes in Canadian income tax laws and (4) impairment charges taken on an asset in our international operations, all of which are unrelated to our ongoing business operations.
Additional information regarding non-GAAP financial measures can be found in the Press Release, the Presentation and our reports filed with the SEC.
The information in this Report, including Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2, is being furnished pursuant to Item 2.02 of Form 8-K and General Instruction B.2 thereunder and shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, except as expressly set forth by specific reference to such filing.
Item 9.01(d) Exhibits
     The following exhibits are furnished as part of this Report on Form 8-K:
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Exhibit 99.1
News Release
 Ryder System, Inc. (NYSE: R)
MIAMI, February 3, 2010
     Ryder System, Inc. (NYSE: R), a leader in transportation and supply chain management solutions, today reported earnings per diluted share (EPS) from continuing operations for the three-month period ended December 31, 2009 were $0.43, compared with $0.91 in the year-earlier period. Earnings from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2009 were $23.7 million, compared with $50.5 million in the year-earlier period. EPS and earnings from continuing operations in the current period included a net benefit of $0.02 and $1.5 million, respectively, related to changes in Canadian income tax laws, partially offset by restructuring and other items. EPS and earnings from continuing operations in the year-earlier period included a net charge of $0.19 and $11.1 million, respectively, related to restructuring and other items, partially offset by the reversal of contingent income tax accruals. Excluding these items, comparable EPS from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2009 were $0.41, down 63% from $1.10 in the year-earlier period, and comparable earnings from continuing operations of $22.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2009 were down 64% from $61.6 million in the year-earlier period. Results reflect significantly lower pre-tax earnings in the Fleet Management Solutions (FMS) business segment. The decline was driven by decreased global results in full service lease, higher pension expense, reduced commercial rental performance, and
1
 
lower results from used vehicle sales operations. Higher pension expense reduced EPS by $0.18, primarily impacting the FMS business segment. To a lesser extent, Company earnings in Supply Chain Solutions (SCS) and Dedicated Contract Carriage (DCC) were impacted by higher self-insurance costs.
     The Company previously announced a plan to discontinue SCS operations in South America and Europe. During the third quarter of 2009, the Company ceased customer operations in all South American markets and part of Europe. During the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company ceased SCS customer operations in all of Europe. Accordingly, results of these operations are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. EPS from discontinued operations totaled losses of $0.28 in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared with losses of $0.72 in same period of the prior year. Results from discontinued operations for 2009 included accumulated foreign currency translation losses of $14.2 million ($14.2 million after tax or $0.26 per diluted share) associated with the liquidation of investments in certain discontinued operations.
     Net earnings per diluted share (including discontinued operations) for the three-month period ended December 31, 2009 were $0.15 versus $0.19 in the year-earlier period. Net earnings for the fourth quarter of 2009 were $8.2 million versus $10.6 million in the year-earlier period.
     Total revenue from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2009 was $1.25 billion, down 7% from $1.34 billion in the same period in the prior year. Total revenue comparisons were adversely impacted by lower fuel volumes, partially offset by favorable foreign exchange rate movements. Operating revenue (revenue excluding FMS fuel and all subcontracted transportation) from continuing operations was $1.02 billion, down 6% compared with $1.09 billion in the year-earlier period. Operating revenue comparisons included a favorable fourth quarter 2009 foreign exchange impact of 1%. FMS business segment total revenue decreased 8% due primarily to lower fuel services revenue. FMS operating revenue decreased 5% due to lower revenue in full service lease and commercial rental, partially offset by favorable foreign exchange rate movements. Full service lease revenue was negatively impacted by customer fleet downsizing. SCS business segment total revenue from continuing operations decreased 5% and operating revenue decreased 9% due to lower automotive volumes, partially offset by favorable foreign exchange rate movements. DCC business segment total revenue
2
 
decreased 6% and operating revenue decreased 8% due to the non-renewal of customer contracts and reduced freight volumes.
     Commenting on the Company's performance, Ryder Chairman and CEO Greg Swienton said, "We continued to manage the business effectively through the challenges of the prolonged multi-year freight recession which extended through the fourth quarter. Fleet Management Solutions customers continued to cope with reduced freight activity by downsizing their fleets, primarily at the end of their contractual term. There were a number of areas that showed some positive improvement. Lease miles per vehicle continued to stabilize and we continued to maintain pricing levels on new lease sales in line with return targets. While rental demand remained soft, utilization improved due to our fleet right-sizing actions. Used vehicle sales inventories were reduced from third quarter levels and are in line with our targets. Used vehicle pricing was lower, although more stable in the second half of the year. As expected, Supply Chain Solutions automotive volumes were lower compared with the prior year. Additionally, we incurred shutdown costs from the termination of certain automotive operations. In line with our previously announced strategic actions, we also successfully completed all of our plans to disengage from underperforming Supply Chain Solutions operations in South America and Europe. For the full year, we leveraged our improved processes and business model to deliver record free cash flow of $630 million. Our solid balance sheet also enabled us to repurchase 2.7 million shares and make a substantial voluntary pension contribution of more than $100 million, while maintaining a very strong liquidity position."
     Total revenue from continuing operations for the full year 2009 was $4.89 billion, down 19% from $6.0 billion in the same period of 2008. Operating revenue from continuing operations for the full year 2009 was $4.06 billion, down 11% from $4.59 billion in 2008.
     Ryder's 2009 earnings from continuing operations were $90.1 million, compared with $257.6 million in the year-earlier period. EPS from continuing operations were $1.62 for 2009, versus $4.52 for the same period of 2008. Comparable 2009 earnings from continuing operations were $94.6 million, down from $267.1 million in the same period of 2008. Comparable EPS from continuing operations of $1.70, declined from $4.68 in the year-earlier period. Comparable earnings and EPS from continuing operations excluded restructuring and
3
 
other items, and certain tax benefits in both 2009 and 2008.
     Ryder's 2009 net earnings (including loss from discontinued operations) were $61.9 million, compared with $199.9 million in the year-earlier period. EPS were $1.11 for 2009, compared with $3.50 for the same period of 2008. Net earnings included the impact of discontinued SCS operations in South America and Europe.
     Operating cash flow from continuing operations for the full year 2009 was $1 billion, down 20% from $1.25 billion in the comparable period of 2008, due to lower cash-based earnings and voluntary pension contributions. Free cash flow from continuing operations in 2009 was $629.7 million, up 85% from $341.0 million in the same period of 2008, primarily due to lower net cash paid for capital expenditures.
     Ryder's primary measurement of business segment financial performance, Net Before Tax (NBT) from continuing operations, allocates Central Support Services to each business segment and excludes restructuring and other items.
Fleet Management Solutions
     Ryder's Fleet Management Solutions (FMS) business segment combines several capabilities into a comprehensive package that provides one-stop outsourcing of the acquisition, maintenance, management, and disposal of vehicles. Ryder's commercial rental service offers customers a method to expand their fleets in order to address short-term capacity needs.
     In the FMS business segment, total revenue in the fourth quarter of 2009 was $900.2 million, down 8% compared with $977.1 million in the year-earlier period. Fuel services revenue in the fourth quarter of 2009 decreased 16%, compared with the same period in 2008 due primarily to reduced gallons pumped at Ryder's fuel service centers and, to a lesser extent, lower fuel prices. Operating revenue (revenue excluding fuel) in the fourth quarter of 2009 was $699.5 million, down 5% compared with $737.5 million in the year-earlier period. FMS total revenue and operating revenue included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 1% and 2%, respectively. Contractual revenue, which includes full service lease and contract maintenance, decreased 2% in the fourth quarter of 2009 because of customer fleet downsizing, partially offset by favorable foreign exchange rate movements. Commercial rental revenue decreased 14%
4
 
reflecting weak global market demand and lower pricing. However, as a result of the Company's actions to align the fleet size and mix with market demand, rental fleet utilization in the fourth quarter of 2009 improved over the prior-year period for the first time in 2009.
     The FMS business segment's NBT was $31.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2009, down 63% from $86.1 million in the same period of 2008. NBT results were related primarily to lower global full service lease results, higher pension expense, a decline in global commercial rental demand and lower used vehicle sales results. These items were partially offset by cost reduction initiatives, including workforce reductions implemented in early 2009. Full service lease results were adversely impacted by the protracted length and severity of the current freight recession, which has resulted in reduced customer demand for new leases, downsizing of customer fleets, and lower fuel gallons sold. Lease mileage comparisons showed sequential improvement compared with the third quarter 2009 and continued to improve throughout the fourth quarter. Pension expense significantly increased in 2009 primarily because of poor performance in the overall stock market in 2008. Commercial rental results were impacted by weak global demand, which drove lower fleet levels and reduced pricing. Used vehicle sales results were also impacted by weak market demand which drove lower pricing, as well as higher average quarterly inventory levels compared with the prior-year period. However, the Company's year end used vehicle inventory levels were 10% below the prior year. Business segment NBT as a percentage of operating revenue was 4.6% in the fourth quarter of 2009, down 710 basis points compared with 11.7% in the same quarter a year ago.
Supply Chain Solutions
     Ryder's Supply Chain Solutions (SCS) business segment enables customers to improve shareholder value and their customers' satisfaction by enhancing supply chain performance and reducing costs. The solutions involve management of the logistics pipeline as a synchronized, integrated process  from materials and components to finished goods distribution. By improving business processes and employing new technologies, the flow of goods and cash is made faster and consumes less capital.
     In the SCS business segment, fourth quarter 2009 total revenue was $302.1 million, down 5% from $319.0 million in the comparable period in 2008. Fourth quarter 2009 operating revenue (revenue excluding subcontracted transportation) was $247.6 million, down 9%
5
 
compared with $271.1 million in the comparable period a year ago. Both total revenue and operating revenue declined primarily due to lower automotive and other freight volumes, partially offset by favorable foreign exchange rate movements.
     The SCS business segment's NBT was $11.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2009, down 31% from $17.1 million in the same quarter of 2008. Business segment earnings were impacted by $4 million of higher self-insurance costs, compared with favorable claims experience in the prior year. Business segment earnings were also impacted by costs of $2 million related to the termination of certain North American automotive operations. Fourth quarter 2009 NBT for the business segment as a percentage of operating revenue was 4.7%, down 160 basis points compared with 6.3% in the same quarter of 2008.
Dedicated Contract Carriage
     Ryder's Dedicated Contract Carriage (DCC) business segment provides customers with vehicles, drivers, management, and administrative support, with the assets committed to a specific customer for a contractual term. DCC supports customers with both basic and sophisticated logistics and transportation needs, including routing and scheduling, specialized driver services, and logistical engineering support.
     In the DCC business segment, fourth quarter 2009 total revenue was $119.3 million, down 6% compared with $126.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. Operating revenue (revenue excluding subcontracted transportation) in the fourth quarter of 2009 was $113.4 million, down 8% from $123.6 million in the year-earlier period. Total revenue and operating revenue decreased due to the non-renewal of customer contracts and reduced freight volumes.
     The DCC business segment's NBT in the fourth quarter of 2009 was $6.9 million, down 46% compared with $12.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. Business segment earnings were impacted by higher self-insurance costs of $3 million, compared with favorable claims experience in the prior year. Business segment earnings were also impacted by the decline in revenue. Business segment NBT as a percentage of operating revenue was 6.1% in the fourth quarter of 2009, down 420 basis points from 10.3% in the year-earlier period.

Central Support Services
     Central Support Services (CSS) are overhead costs incurred to support all business segments and product lines. Substantially all CSS costs are allocated to the various business segments. In the fourth quarter of 2009, CSS costs were $45.5 million, compared with $45.6 million in the year-earlier period. Although CSS spending was lower across all functional areas, these reductions were offset by professional fees associated with cost-savings initiatives.
Restructuring and Other Items
     Pre-tax restructuring and other items from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2009 totaled $2.7 million (also $2.7 million after tax), or $0.05 per diluted share. This consisted principally of an impairment charge related to an international supply chain facility which is expected to be sold in the first quarter of 2010.
     Pre-tax restructuring and other items from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2008 totaled $23.1 million ($19.1 million after tax), or $0.33 per diluted share. The Company recognized a pre-tax restructuring charge of $11.2 million ($7.2 million after tax) associated with a workforce reduction of approximately 700 positions implemented in early 2009. In 2008, the Company also recognized a non-cash, pre-tax impairment charge of $11.9 million (also $11.9 million after tax), related to the write-down of goodwill associated with the European FMS business segment and other long-term international assets.
Income Taxes
     The Company's effective income tax rate from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2009 was 25.6% of related pre-tax earnings, compared with 33.0% in the year-earlier period. The current period income tax rate reflects an income tax benefit of $4.1 million (12.9% of pre-tax earnings), or $0.07 per diluted share, from the impact of income tax rate changes in Ontario, Canada. In the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company recognized an income tax benefit of $7.9 million (10.5% of pre-tax earnings), or $0.14 per diluted share, associated with the reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions primarily as a result of expiring statutes of limitation.
7
 
Discontinued Operations
     The Company previously announced a plan to discontinue SCS operations in South America and Europe. During the third quarter of 2009, the Company ceased customer operations in all South American markets and part of Europe. During the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company ceased SCS customer operations in all of Europe. Accordingly, results of these operations are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Pre-tax losses from discontinued operations totaled $15.2 million ($15.4 million after tax or $0.28 per diluted share) for the three months ended December 31, 2009, compared with a loss of $42.2 million ($39.8 million after tax or $0.72 per diluted share) in the year-earlier period. Results of discontinued operations for 2009 included accumulated foreign currency translation losses of $14.2 million ($14.2 million after tax or $0.26 per diluted share) associated with the liquidation of investments in certain discontinued operations.
Capital Expenditures
     In Ryder's business, capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, and trailers) primarily to support the full service lease product line and secondarily to support the commercial rental product line within Ryder's FMS business segment. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long-term agreements that result in ongoing revenues and cash flows to Ryder, typically over a three- to ten-year term. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the Company's fleet available for shorter-term use by contractual or occasional customers.
     Capital expenditures from continuing operations were $611.4 million for 2009, reduced from $1.27 billion in the same period of 2008. The decrease in capital expenditures reflects reduced full service lease vehicle spending due to lower new and replacement sales in the current global economic environment, as well as increased use of lease term extensions and used vehicle redeployments. Additionally, the decrease reflects planned minimal spending on transactional commercial rental vehicles. Net capital expenditures (including proceeds from the sale of assets) were $395.8 million for 2009, down 61% from $1 billion in the same period of 2008.
8
 
Cash Flow
     Operating cash flow from continuing operations in 2009 was $1 billion, down 20% from $1.25 billion in the same period of 2008, primarily due to lower cash-based earnings and voluntary pension contributions. Total cash generated (including proceeds from used vehicle sales) from continuing operations in 2009, was $1.28 billion, down 18% from $1.57 billion in the same period of 2008. Free cash flow from continuing operations in 2009 was $629.7 million, up 85% from $341.0 million in the same period of 2008, primarily due to lower net cash paid for capital expenditures, partially offset by lower cash-based earnings and voluntary pension contributions.
     As previously announced, in the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company resumed two existing share repurchase programs, both of which expired in December 2009. Under these programs, the Company repurchased and retired 2.7 million shares in the fourth quarter of 2009 at an aggregate cost of $116.3 million.
Leverage
     Balance sheet debt as of December 31, 2009 decreased by $365.1 million compared with year-end 2008, due primarily to the utilization of free cash flow to repay debt. The leverage ratio for balance sheet debt as of December 31, 2009 was 175%, compared with 213% at year-end 2008. Total obligations to equity as of December 31, 2009 were 183%, down from 225% at year end 2008.
     Ryder forecasts full year 2010 earnings to be in the range of $1.80 to $1.95 per diluted share. Full year comparable EPS were $1.70 in 2009. The anticipated EPS growth is expected from improved commercial rental performance, productivity initiatives, better used vehicle sales operations, stronger SCS results, lower annual pension expense and the benefit of 2009 stock repurchases. These items are partially offset by significantly reduced full service lease results, increased vehicle depreciation expense resulting from residual value changes, and some currently intended compensation restoration. The Company is also establishing a comparable EPS forecast of $0.17 to $0.22 for the first quarter of 2010, compared with $0.30 in the same period of 2009. These
9
 
expected results reflect the impact of lower full service lease fleet levels because of customer fleet downsizings in the prior year, partially offset by improved commercial rental performance, better used vehicle sales operations, and stronger SCS results.
     Total revenue for the full-year 2010 is forecast to be approximately $4.9 billion which is flat compared with 2009. Operating revenue for the full year 2010 is forecast to be $4.0 billion compared with $4.1 billion in 2009. In FMS, core contractual leasing and maintenance revenue is expected to decline 4%, or down 5% excluding foreign exchange, reflecting the cumulative effect of customer fleet downsizing. Commercial rental revenue is forecast to grow by 9%, driven by moderately higher demand, somewhat higher pricing, and improved utilization. Total SCS revenue is forecast to decrease by 2%. SCS operating revenue is anticipated to decrease by 3%, or 6% excluding the impacts of foreign exchange and fuel, reflecting the impact of non-renewed contracts. Total DCC revenue is expected to be unchanged. DCC operating revenue is expected to decrease by 1%.
     Commenting on the Company's outlook, Mr. Swienton said, "We expect 2010 economic conditions to be fairly stable, with some modest improvement in the second half of the year. Headwinds that Ryder faces in 2010 include the cumulative negative impact of full service lease customer fleet downsizing decisions over the past year, as well as added vehicle depreciation expense. To help mitigate these negative factors, we are implementing productivity initiatives and other process enhancements. Ryder enters 2010 properly situated for marketplace demand, with both rental and used vehicle sales fleets at appropriate levels. As a result of these fleet right-sizing actions, we expect improved returns in both the commercial rental and used vehicle sales product lines of our Fleet Management Solutions business. Despite the moderate economic outlook, we expect to deliver improved returns in our Supply Chain Solutions business, resulting from recovering automotive volumes, new initiatives and strategic decisions undertaken in 2009. Based on our strong and stable cash flow and liquidity levels, we plan to make investments this year to strengthen our long-term market position. These include the refreshment of our rental fleet, which is likely to be an important resource for customers as the economy improves, as well as the implementation of new technologies."
     The Company anticipates 2010 capital expenditures to be approximately $1.1 billion, including an estimated $270 million to refresh the commercial rental fleet. Net capital expenditures (including proceeds from sale of assets) are expected to be approximately $900
10
 
million. Cash from operations is forecast to again be $1 billion with total cash generated of approximately $1.3 billion and free cash flow of $250 million in 2010. Total obligations to equity are forecast to decline from 183% at year-end 2009 to approximately 160% at year-end 2010.
