Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.
In connection with upcoming investor presentations, we are releasing revised Business Segment Key Performance Indicators. Investors should refer to these revised Key Performance Indicators in lieu of the Key Performance Indicators set forth on page 5 of the tables contained in our recent press release filed on October 21, 2010 in connection with our third quarter 2010 results. The Key Performance Indicators filed today have been revised as follows: (i) amounts in the 2009 columns reflecting the percentage change for the miles per unit per day for the full service lease business have been corrected to be consistent with the method that we have previously used in calculating this information and is utilized in the 2010 amounts and (ii) the percentage of rental rate change for the commercial rental business has been revised to reflect the rental rate change on a global basis, whereas the percentage of rental rate change included in the October 21, 2010 press release was based solely on U.S. operations.
The information in this Report, including Exhibit 99.1, is being furnished pursuant to Item 7.01 of Form 8-K and General Instruction B.2 thereunder and shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, except as expressly set forth by specific reference to such filing.
