Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On February 3, 2011, we issued a press release reporting our financial results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2010 (the "Press Release"). We also hosted a conference call and webcast on February 3, 2011 during which we made a presentation on our financial results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2010 (the "Presentation"). The Press Release and the Presentation are available on our website at .
www.ryder.com
The Press Release and Presentation include information regarding comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per share from continuing operations for both fourth quarter and full year 2010 and 2009, which are non-GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC regulations. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors, and allow for better year-over-year comparison, as the measures exclude from our GAAP earnings from continuing operations and earnings per share from continuing operations, as applicable, (1) restructuring charges in 2009, (2) certain tax benefits, including a benefit in the fourth quarter of 2010 related to the settlement of prior tax years and the expiration of a statute of limitations, and a benefit in the fourth quarter of 2009 related to changes in Canadian income tax laws, (3) the gain on the sale of an international asset in the fourth quarter of 2010, and impairment charges on the same international asset in the fourth quarter of 2009 and (4) costs related to an acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2010, all of which are unrelated to our ongoing business operations.
Additional information regarding non-GAAP financial measures can be found in the Press Release, the Presentation and our reports filed with the SEC.
The information in this Report, including Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2, is being furnished pursuant to Item 2.02 of Form 8-K and General Instruction B.2 thereunder and shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, except as expressly set forth by specific reference to such filing.
Item 9.01(d) Exhibits
     The following exhibits are furnished as part of this Report on Form 8-K:
 
          Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Exhibit 99.1
News Release
      Ryder System, Inc. (NYSE: R), a leader in transportation and supply chain management solutions, today reported earnings per diluted share from continuing operations for the three-month period ended December 31, 2010 were $0.80, compared with $0.43 in the year-earlier period. Earnings from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2010 were $41.5 million, compared with $23.7 million in the year-earlier period. Earnings per diluted share and earnings from continuing operations in the current period included a net benefit of $0.15 and $7.6 million, respectively, related to certain tax benefits, partially offset by restructuring and other items. Earnings per diluted share and earnings from continuing operations in the year-earlier period included a net benefit of $0.02 and $1.5 million, respectively, related to changes in Canadian income tax laws, partially offset by restructuring and other items. For the fourth quarter of 2010, excluding these items, comparable earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were $0.65, up 59% from $0.41 in the year-earlier period, and comparable earnings from continuing operations of $33.8 million increased 52% from $22.2 million in the year-earlier period. The improvement in earnings reflects the impact of significantly stronger results in the Company's Fleet Management Solutions (FMS) business segment, driven primarily by better commercial rental performance and used vehicle sales results. These increases were partially offset by lower full service lease performance resulting

from higher maintenance costs due to fleet aging and the cumulative impact of customer fleet reductions. Fourth quarter 2010 results also included a $1.5 million pension settlement charge, spread equally between the FMS and SCS business segments. Earnings per diluted share growth exceeded earnings growth due to the impact of previously announced share repurchase programs.
     Total revenue from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2010 was $1.31 billion, up 5% from $1.25 billion in the same period in the prior year. Operating revenue (revenue excluding FMS fuel and all subcontracted transportation) from continuing operations of $1.06 billion, rose 4% from $1.02 billion in the year-earlier period. FMS business segment total revenue improved 5% due primarily to higher commercial rental revenue and fuel services revenue passed through to customers. FMS operating revenue grew 4% due to higher commercial rental revenue, partially offset by lower full service lease revenue reflecting the impact of customer fleet downsizing. In the Company's Supply Chain Solutions (SCS) business segment, total revenue increased 8% due to higher subcontracted transportation and operating revenue. SCS operating revenue rose 4% due to improved high-tech and automotive volumes, and new business. DCC business segment total revenue grew 2% and operating revenue grew 5% reflecting the pass-through of higher fuel costs and new business.
     In 2009, the Company discontinued SCS operations in South America and Europe. Accordingly, results of these operations are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Earnings per diluted share from discontinued operations totaled a loss of $0.08 in the fourth quarter of 2010 compared with a loss of $0.28 in the same period of the prior year.
     Net earnings per diluted share, including discontinued operations, for the three-month period ended December 31, 2010 were $0.72 versus $0.15 in the year-earlier period. Net earnings for the fourth quarter of 2010 were $37.1 million versus $8.2 million in the year-earlier period.
     Commenting on the Company's performance, Ryder Chairman and CEO Greg Swienton said, "In view of our measurable performance across many areas, 2010 was a very successful year for Ryder. In what was an uneven, slow economic recovery, we achieved revenue growth and very good earnings leverage, including a 24% increase in comparable earnings. Our steady progress throughout the year, culminating in a particularly strong fourth quarter, helped us deliver total shareholder returns of 31% during 2010, more than double the performance of the S&P 500 during that same period.

     "In the fourth quarter, in Fleet Management Solutions, our commercial rental performance continued to improve and command much better pricing due to rising demand in the overall marketplace. Used vehicle sales results improved in the quarter because of better pricing, stemming from a lower supply of vehicles for sale in the marketplace and higher demand. Our full service lease product line continued to improve in miles driven per vehicle; however, customers still remain cautious on entering long-term leases.
     "Our Supply Chain Solutions business delivered solid margins in the fourth quarter, with particularly strong results from our high-tech accounts. Operating revenue in both Supply Chain Solutions and Dedicated Contract Carriage grew due to both volume increases and new business.
     "Our solid balance sheet and strong cash flow enabled us to announce several strategic acquisitions in the fourth quarter which will help grow and expand capabilities in all three reporting business segments. We also continued to increase shareholder value by repurchasing shares under the previously announced stock buyback programs during the quarter.
     "In view of these factors, even in what is likely to be a gradual economic recovery, Ryder enters 2011 very well positioned to profitably accelerate growth in our business."
     Total revenue from continuing operations for the full-year 2010 was $5.14 billion, up 5% from $4.89 billion in the same period of 2009. Operating revenue from continuing operations for the full-year 2010 was $4.16 billion, up 2% from $4.06 billion in 2009.
     Ryder's 2010 earnings from continuing operations were $124.6 million, compared with $90.1 million in the year-earlier period. Earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were $2.37 for 2010, up 46% versus $1.62 for the same period of 2009. Comparable 2010 earnings from continuing operations were $117.0 million, an improvement of 24% from $94.6 million in the same period of 2009. Comparable earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $2.22 rose 31% from $1.70 in the year-earlier period. Comparable earnings and earnings per share from continuing operations excluded restructuring and other items, and certain tax benefits in both 2010 and 2009.
     Ryder's 2010 net earnings, including discontinued operations, were $118.2 million, up 91% compared with $61.9 million in the year-earlier period. Earnings per diluted share were $2.25 for 2010, an improvement of 103% from $1.11 in the same period of 2009.

Fleet Management Solutions
     In the FMS business segment, total revenue in the fourth quarter of 2010 was $948.1 million, up 5% compared with the year-earlier period. Fuel services revenue in the fourth quarter of 2010 increased 10%, compared with the same period in 2009 due to higher fuel costs. Operating revenue (revenue excluding fuel) in the fourth quarter of 2010 was $726.3 million, up 4% compared with the year-earlier period. Contractual revenue, which includes full service lease and contract maintenance, decreased 2% in the fourth quarter of 2010 because of the cumulative impact of customer fleet downsizing. Commercial rental revenue grew 31% reflecting improving global market demand and higher pricing. Rental power fleet utilization improved 550 basis points, to 78% in the fourth quarter of 2010.
     The FMS business segment's NBT was $49.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2010, up 55% from $31.9 million in the same period of 2009. This increase reflected significantly better commercial rental performance, improved used vehicle sales results and lower retirement plans expense. These items were partially offset by lower full service lease results, higher compensation, and investments in sales and information technology initiatives. Commercial rental performance improved as a result of increased market demand and higher pricing. Used vehicle sales results were favorably impacted by higher pricing, as well as lower average quarterly inventory levels compared with the prior-year period. Used vehicle sales results benefited from a lower supply of vehicles in the overall marketplace. As expected, retirement plans expense decreased in the fourth quarter of 2010 primarily due to better investment performance in 2009 versus 2008. Full service lease results continued to be adversely impacted by higher maintenance costs on a relatively older fleet, as well as the cumulative effects of the long-term economic downturn, which resulted in downsizing of customer fleets. Lease mileage comparisons improved reflecting increased usage of existing customer leased fleets. Business segment NBT as a percentage of operating revenue was 6.8% in the fourth quarter of 2010, up
4
 
220 basis points compared with 4.6% in the same quarter a year ago.
Supply Chain Solutions
     In the SCS business segment, fourth quarter 2010 total revenue was $325.1 million, up 8% due to higher subcontracted transportation and better operating revenue. Fourth quarter 2010 operating revenue (revenue excluding subcontracted transportation) was $258.3 million, an increase of 4% from the comparable period a year ago. SCS total and operating revenue comparisons benefited from improved high-tech and automotive volumes and new business.
     The SCS business segment's NBT of $12.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2010, rose 5% from $11.7 million in the same quarter of 2009. Business segment earnings benefited from better operating performance particularly in high-tech accounts and were partially offset by higher compensation and pension expenses. Fourth quarter 2010 NBT for the business segment as a percentage of operating revenue was 4.8%, up 10 basis points from 4.7% in the same quarter of 2009.
Dedicated Contract Carriage
     In the DCC business segment, fourth quarter 2010 total revenue of $121.8 million, improved 2% compared with the fourth quarter of 2009. Operating revenue (revenue excluding subcontracted transportation) in the fourth quarter of 2010 was $119.3 million, an increase of 5% from the year-earlier period. Total revenue and operating revenue grew due to the pass-through of higher fuel costs, and new business.
     The DCC business segment's NBT in the fourth quarter of 2010 was $6.5 million, down 6% compared with $6.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2009, due to higher driver costs. Business segment NBT as a percentage of operating revenue was 5.5% in the fourth quarter of 2010, declined 60 basis points from 6.1% in the year-earlier period.
Central Support Services
     Central Support Services (CSS) are overhead costs incurred to support all business segments and product lines. Substantially all CSS costs are allocated to the various business
5
 
segments. In the fourth quarter of 2010, CSS costs were $48.0 million, compared with $45.5 million in the year-earlier period, primarily reflecting higher compensation costs and information technology investments.
Restructuring and Other Items
     Pre-tax restructuring and other items from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2010 totaled $3.2 million (also $3.2 million after tax), or $0.06 per diluted share. The charge included costs incurred on the acquisition of Total Logistic Control in December 2010, partially offset by a gain on the sale of an international supply chain facility. In the fourth quarter of 2009, Ryder recognized an impairment charge of $2.7 million (also $2.7 million after tax), or $0.05 per diluted share, related to this facility.
Income Taxes
     The Company's effective income tax rate from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2010 was 16.4% of pre-tax earnings, compared with 25.6% in the year-earlier period. The current period income tax rate reflects a benefit of $10.8 million (21.7% of pre-tax earnings), or $0.21 per diluted share, related to the favorable settlement of prior tax years as well as the expiration of a statute of limitations. The prior period income tax rate reflects a benefit of $4.1 million (12.9% of pre-tax earnings), or $0.07 per diluted share, from the impact of income tax rate changes in Canada.
Capital Expenditures
     As planned, capital expenditures from continuing operations were $1.09 billion for 2010, compared with $611.4 million in the same period of 2009. The increase in capital expenditures particularly reflects higher commercial rental spending to refresh and appropriately grow the rental fleet. Net capital expenditures (including proceeds from the sale of assets) were $853.0 million for 2010, up from $395.8 million in the same period of 2009.
Cash Flow
     Operating cash flow from continuing operations in 2010 was $1.03 billion, up 4% from the same period of 2009, primarily due to changes in working capital. Total cash generated
 
(including proceeds from used vehicle sales) from continuing operations in 2010 was $1.33 billion, up 5% from $1.27 billion in the same period of 2009. Free cash flow from continuing operations in 2010 was $257.6 million, down 58% from $614.1 million in the same period of 2009, primarily due to higher vehicle investments for rental and full service lease.
     During the fourth quarter the Company completed a previously announced $100 million share repurchase program. The Company continues to have an ongoing two million share anti-dilutive repurchase program which is used to offset compensation and benefit-related stock issuances. In the fourth quarter, the Company repurchased and retired approximately 710,000 shares at an aggregate cost of $31.2 million. From inception through 2010, a total of 3.0 million shares have been repurchased under these programs at an aggregate cost of $123.2 million.
Leverage
     Balance sheet debt as of December 31, 2010 increased by $249.3 million compared with year-end 2009, due primarily to higher vehicle capital spending, as well as acquisitions and share repurchases. The leverage ratio for balance sheet debt as of December 31, 2010 was 196%, compared with 175% at year-end 2009. Total obligations to equity as of December 31, 2010 were 203%, up from 183% at year end 2009, below Ryder's long-term target range of 250% to 300%.
Discontinued Operations
     In 2009, the Company discontinued SCS operations in South America and Europe. Accordingly, results of these operations are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Pre-tax losses from discontinued operations totaled $5.3 million ($4.3 million after tax or $0.08 per diluted share) for the three months ended December 31, 2010, compared with a loss of $15.2 million ($15.4 million after tax or $0.28 per diluted share) in the year-earlier period. Results of discontinued operations for 2010 included a loss on a leased facility, which Ryder no longer operates, and losses related to adverse legal developments. Results of discontinued operations for the fourth quarter of 2009 included accumulated foreign currency translation losses associated with the liquidation of investments in certain discontinued operations.

     Ryder forecasts full-year 2011 comparable earnings to be in the range of $2.80 to $2.90 per diluted share. This represents an increase of 26% to 31% over Ryder's comparable full-year 2010 earnings from continuing operations of $2.22 per diluted share. The Company also is establishing a first quarter 2011 earnings forecast of $0.40 to $0.44 per diluted share. Total revenue for the full-year 2011 is forecast to be $5.73 billion, up 12% from $5.14 billion in 2010. Operating revenue (revenue excluding FMS fuel and all subcontracted transportation) for the full-year 2011 is forecast to be $4.63 billion, up 11% from $4.16 billion in 2010.
     "We took a big step forward in 2010 with performance that was substantially better than our 2009 results," said Mr. Swienton. "Although we have not yet experienced a return to growth in every product line, we completed an extremely good year of progress with revenue growth in all segments and higher overall earnings. For 2011, we expect the continuation of many of the same positive trends we saw in 2010. We are forecasting a double digit increase in both revenue and earnings resulting from our previously announced acquisitions and organic growth. In Fleet Management Solutions, we expect continuing strong demand and pricing in both commercial rental and used vehicle sales. Additionally, we plan to expand our commercial rental fleet during the year, as appropriate, to accommodate higher demand. We anticipate the improvements in FMS to be partially offset by higher maintenance costs on an older full service lease fleet. In Supply Chain Solutions and Dedicated Contract Carriage, we expect strong new sales. We further expect volume improvement to occur in Supply Chain Solutions. We are making investments in our fleet, maintenance technology, and sales and marketing to increase the efficiency and competitiveness of our offerings and position us for accelerated growth. In 2011, even in a gradual recovery with the lingering effects of a deep freight recession still apparent, we plan to accelerate revenue growth and deliver very solid results. Over the longer term, we expect that the substantial pent-up demand for lease fleets, due to a range of factors including new, more expensive EPA-mandated engine technologies, will result in future contractual revenue and earnings growth."

Transportation Average and the Standard & Poor's 500 Index. The Company's financial performance is reported in the following three, inter-related business segments:
In Ryder's business, capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, and trailers) primarily to support the full service lease product line and secondarily to support the commercial rental product line within Ryder's FMS business segment. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long-term agreements that result in ongoing revenues and cash flows to Ryder, typically over a three- to ten-year term. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the Company's fleet available for shorter-term use by contractual or occasional customers.
