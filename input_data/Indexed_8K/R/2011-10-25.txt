Item 2.02
Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On October 25, 2011, we issued a press release reporting our financial results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011 (the "Press Release"). We also hosted a conference call and webcast on October 25, 2011 during which we made a presentation on our financial results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011 (the "Presentation"). The Press Release and the Presentation are available on our website at www.ryder.com.
The Press Release and Presentation include information regarding (1) comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per share from continuing operations and (2) comparable income tax rate, in each case for the third quarter and year to date 2011, which are non-GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC regulations. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors, and allow for better year-over-year comparison, as the measures exclude from our GAAP net earnings, earnings per share and income tax rate, all from continuing operations, as applicable, (1) 2011 acquisition-related transaction costs, (2) a third quarter 2011 income tax benefit from prior year acquisition-related transaction costs, (3) 2011 charges related to tax law changes and (4) 2011 restructuring charges, which are not representative of our ongoing business operations.
Additional information regarding non-GAAP financial measures can be found in the Press Release, the Presentation and our reports filed with the SEC.
The information in this Report, including Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2, is being furnished pursuant to Item 2.02 of Form 8-K and General Instruction B.2 thereunder and shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, except as expressly set forth by specific reference to such filing.
Item 9.01(d) Exhibits
The following exhibits are furnished as part of this Report on Form 8-K:
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99.1
News Release
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
 
 
 
 Ryder System, Inc. (NYSE: R), a leader in transportation and supply chain management solutions, today reported earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $1.10 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2011, up 45% from $0.76 in the year-earlier period. Earnings from continuing operations were $56.9 million, up 44% from $39.7 million in the year-earlier period. Earnings per diluted share and earnings from continuing operations for the third quarter of 2011 included a tax benefit of $0.01 or $0.6 million associated with acquisition-related transaction costs. Excluding this item, comparable earnings per diluted share from continuing operations for the third quarter of 2011 were $1.09, up 43% from $0.76 in the third quarter of 2010. Comparable earnings from continuing operations of $56.4 million for the third quarter of 2011 were up 42% from $39.7 million in the year-earlier period. The increase in comparable earnings primarily reflects strong organic growth in commercial rental, the benefit of acquisitions, and improved used vehicle sales results.
MIAMI, October 25, 2011
Total revenue for the third quarter of 2011 was $1.57 billion, up 19% from $1.32 billion in the same period last year, reflecting the benefit of acquisitions and organic growth. Operating revenue (revenue excluding Fleet Management Solutions fuel and all subcontracted transportation) was $1.26 billion, up 17% compared with $1.07 billion in the year-earlier period. Fleet Management Solutions (FMS) business segment total revenue increased 16% due primarily to higher operating revenue and fuel services revenue. FMS operating revenue increased 12% due to the benefit of acquisitions and higher commercial rental revenue. In the Company's
Supply Chain Solutions (SCS) business segment, total and operating revenue increased 26%
largely reflecting the favorable impact of an acquisition. Dedicated Contract Carriage (DCC) business segment total revenue increased 31% and operating revenue increased 26%, primarily reflecting an acquisition, and the pass through of higher fuels costs.
Net earnings per diluted share (including discontinued operations) for the three-month period ended September 30, 2011 were $1.10 versus $0.74 in the year-earlier period. Earnings per diluted share from discontinued operations (previously announced in 2009) for the year-earlier period totaled a loss of $0.02. Net earnings for the third quarter of 2011 were $56.5 million versus $38.8 million in the year-earlier period.
Ryder Chairman and CEO Greg Swienton commented, "We exceeded our own expectations for the third quarter in an uncertain, slow growth business environment by delivering on our targets within Fleet Management Solutions, and exceeding our plans in Supply Chain Solutions. We generated a very strong operating revenue increase of 17%, as well as earnings growth of 46%, reflecting both acquisitions and organic growth. Our acquisition teams have significantly contributed to our performance by successfully integrating operations and transitioning newly acquired customers.
"In Fleet Management Solutions, we saw continuing strong demand and higher pricing for our commercial rental and used vehicle sales offerings. Continuing positive new lease sales have led to the largest organic U.S. lease fleet growth in the last 11 quarters. As anticipated, these improvements continue to be partially offset by higher maintenance costs on an older lease fleet.
"Our Supply Chain Solutions business delivered better-than-expected results in the quarter, reflecting the benefit of acquisitions, as well as strong performance within existing accounts and new business.
"Despite the economic volatility and general marketplace uncertainty that's been present throughout the year, we've remained focused on delivering value to our customers and on addressing a wide range of factors that we can impact. Even in this tenuous economic environment, Ryder delivered double-digit revenue growth and a more than 50% increase in earnings through the first nine months of 2011."
 
Fleet Management Solutions
In the FMS business segment, total revenue in the third quarter of 2011 was $1.10 billion, up 16% compared with the year-earlier period, due to higher operating revenue and fuel services revenue. Fuel services revenue increased 28% due to higher fuel prices passed through to customers. Operating revenue (revenue excluding fuel) increased 12% to $824.7 million. Full service lease revenue increased 5% due to acquisitions. Commercial rental revenue increased 40% reflecting global market demand and higher pricing.
The FMS business segment's pre-tax earnings were $74.2 million in the third quarter of 2011, up 35% compared with $54.8 million in the same period of 2010. Increased earnings reflect significantly better commercial rental performance, improved used vehicle sales results, and the benefit of the four FMS acquisitions closed in 2011. These items were partially offset by increased compensation-related expenses, as well as higher maintenance costs on an older lease fleet. Commercial rental performance improved as a result of increased market demand on a 30% larger average fleet (12% excluding acquisitions) and higher pricing. Rental power fleet utilization was 79.3% for the third quarter of 2011, an improvement of 10 basis points from the year-earlier period. Used vehicle sales results were favorably impacted primarily by higher pricing. Business segment pre-tax earnings as a percentage of operating revenue were 9.0% in the third quarter of 2011, up 150 basis points compared with 7.5% in the same quarter a year ago.
Supply Chain Solutions
In the SCS business segment, third quarter 2011 total revenue was $406.1 million, up 26% from the comparable period in 2010. Operating revenue (revenue excluding subcontracted transportation) was $326.8 million, up 26% compared with the same quarter a year ago. SCS total revenue and operating revenue comparisons benefited from the acquisition of Total Logistic Control (TLC) in December of 2010. Operating revenue also benefited from higher volumes and new business.
The SCS business segment's pre-tax earnings in the third quarter of 2011 were $22.4 million, up 47% from $15.2 million in the same quarter of 2010. The improvement was driven
 
by the TLC acquisition, higher volumes and new business, partially offset by increased compensation-related expenses. Additionally, SCS results benefited from favorable insurance developments and gains related to foreign exchange and the sale of a facility. Third quarter 2011 pre-tax earnings for the business segment as a percentage of operating revenue were 6.9%, up 100 basis points compared with 5.9% in the same quarter of 2010.
Dedicated Contract Carriage
In the DCC business segment, third quarter 2011 total revenue of $158.9 million was up 31% compared with the year-earlier period. Operating revenue (revenue excluding subcontracted transportation) in the third quarter of 2011 was $149.5 million, up 26%. Total revenue and operating revenue increased due to the acquisition of The Scully Companies (Scully) in January 2011 and the pass-through of higher fuel costs.
The DCC business segment's pre-tax earnings in the third quarter of 2011 were $8.4 million, down 3% from $8.6 million in the third quarter of 2010. The improvement from the Scully acquisition and better operating performance was more than offset by increased compensation-related expense and legal claims. Business segment pre-tax earnings as a percentage of operating revenue were 5.6% in the third quarter of 2011, down 170 basis points compared with 7.3% in the year-earlier period.
Central Support Services
Central Support Services (CSS) are overhead costs incurred to support all business segments and product lines. Most CSS costs are allocated to the various business segments. In the third quarter of 2011, CSS costs were $54.6 million, up from $47.7 million in the year-earlier period, reflecting higher compensation-related expenses and information technology investments.
Income Taxes
The Company's effective income tax rate from continuing operations for the third quarter of 2011 was 35.0% of pre-tax earnings compared with 36.0% in the year-earlier period. The
 
third quarter 2011 tax rate reflects a benefit of $0.6 million (0.6% of pre-tax earnings) from prior year acquisition-related transaction costs, which increased earnings per share by $0.01 in the quarter.
Capital Expenditures
As planned, 2011 year-to-date capital expenditures from continuing operations increased to $1.17 billion, compared with $861 million in the same period of 2010. Net capital expenditures (including proceeds from the sale of assets) from continuing operations were $1.03 billion, up from $733 million in the same period of 2010. The increase in capital expenditures primarily reflects planned investment to refresh and modestly grow the commercial rental and lease fleets.
Cash Flow
Operating cash flow from continuing operations through September 30, 2011, was $782 million, down from $804 million in the same period of 2010, due to increased working capital needs. Total cash generated (including proceeds from used vehicle sales) from continuing operations through September 30, 2011, was $1.05 billion, compared with $1.01 billion in the same period of 2010. As anticipated, free cash flow from continuing operations through September 30, 2011, was negative $113 million, down from a positive $153 million for the same period of 2010, primarily due to increased vehicle investments.
Leverage
Balance sheet debt as of September 30, 2011, increased by $452 million compared with year-end 2010, due primarily to recent acquisitions and increased investment in vehicles. The leverage ratio for balance sheet debt as of September 30, 2011, was 220% compared with 196% at year-end 2010. Total obligations to equity as of September 30, 2011, were 225% compared with 203% at year-end 2010, below Ryder's target range of 250% to 300%.
Revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2011, was $4.51 billion, up 18% from $3.82 billion in the same period of 2010. Operating revenue (revenue excluding FMS fuel and all subcontracted transportation) for the first nine months of 2011 was $3.58 billion, up 16%
 
from $3.10 billion in the first nine months of 2010. Ryder's 2011 year-to-date earnings from continuing operations were $123.7 million, up 49% compared with $83.1 million in the year-earlier period. Earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were $2.39 for the first nine months of 2011, up 52% compared with $1.57 for the same period of 2010. Comparable 2011 year-to-date earnings from continuing operations of $130.5 million increased 57% from $83.1 million in the year-earlier period. Comparable earnings per diluted share from continuing operations for the first nine months of 2011 were $2.52, up 61% from $1.57 in the same period of 2010. Comparable 2011 year-to-date earnings and earnings per diluted share from continuing operations exclude acquisition-related transaction costs and tax benefits, charges related to tax law changes and restructuring charges. Year-to-date net earnings, including discontinued operations, were $121.7 million, up 50% compared with $81.0 million in the year-earlier period. Earnings per diluted share were $2.35 for the first nine months of 2011 and increased 54% compared with $1.53 for the same period of 2010.
Commenting on Ryder's outlook, Mr. Swienton said, "Through three quarters, we have substantially outperformed the general economic environment, GDP trends, and the plans we set forth at the start of 2011. The value propositions of our outsourced transportation and logistics solutions continue to be highly attractive to businesses looking for new ways to increase efficiency and enhance performance both now and over the long-term.
"We anticipate continued strong performance in commercial rental and used vehicle sales, solid volumes in our supply chain business, and organic expansion in lease fleet levels. Additionally, we expect the five acquisitions completed since December 2010 to remain strong contributors to our overall performance. Therefore, we expect Ryder to produce significantly higher year-over-year earnings in the fourth quarter.
"Taking all of these factors into consideration, we are establishing a fourth quarter earnings forecast range of $0.92 to $0.97 per share. We are also raising our full-year 2011 comparable earnings per share forecast to a range of $3.44 to $3.49 from a previous range of $3.33 to $3.43."

Pre-Tax Earnings
In Ryder's business, capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, and trailers) primarily to support the full service lease product line and secondarily to support the commercial rental product line within Ryder's FMS business segment. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long-term agreements that result in ongoing revenues and cash flows to Ryder, typically over a three- to ten-year term. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the Company's fleet available for shorter-term use by contractual or occasional customers.
