Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On February 2, 2012, we issued a press release reporting our financial results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2011 (the "Press Release"). We also hosted a conference call and webcast on February 2, 2012 during which we made a presentation on our financial results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2011 (the "Presentation"). The Press Release and the Presentation are available on our website at .
www.ryder.com
The Press Release and Presentation include information regarding comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per share from continuing operations for both fourth quarter and full year 2011 and 2010, which are non-GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC regulations. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors, and allow for better year-over-year comparison, as the measures exclude from our GAAP earnings from continuing operations and earnings per share from continuing operations, as applicable, (1) for the fourth quarter of 2011, acquisition-related transaction costs and restructuring charges related to the integration of an acquisition, (2) for full year of 2011, charges related to tax law changes, an income tax benefit from prior year acquisition-related transaction costs, acquisition-related transaction costs and restructuring charges, (3) for the fourth quarter and full year of 2010, a gain on the sale of an international asset, tax benefits related to the settlement of prior tax years and the expiration of a statute of limitations, and acquisition-related transaction costs, all of which are unrelated to our ongoing business operations.
Additional information regarding non-GAAP financial measures can be found in the Press Release, the Presentation and our reports filed with the SEC.
The information in this Report, including Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2, is being furnished pursuant to Item 2.02 of Form 8-K and General Instruction B.2 thereunder and shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, except as expressly set forth by specific reference to such filing.

News Release
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Ryder System, Inc. (NYSE: R), a leader in transportation and supply chain management solutions, today reported earnings per diluted share from continuing operations for the three-month period ended December 31, 2011 were $0.92, compared with $0.80 in the year-earlier period. Earnings from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2011 were $47.7 million, compared with $41.5 million in the year-earlier period. Earnings per diluted share and earnings from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2011 included a charge of $0.05 and $2.4 million, respectively, for planned restructuring costs related to the integration of an acquisition. Earnings per diluted share and earnings from continuing operations in the year-earlier period included a net benefit of $0.15 and $7.6 million, respectively, related to certain tax benefits, partially offset by restructuring and other items. Excluding these items in both periods, comparable earnings per diluted share from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2011 were $0.97, up 49% from $0.65 in the year-earlier period, and comparable earnings from continuing operations of $50.1 million increased 48% from $33.8 million in the year-earlier period. The increase in comparable earnings primarily reflects strong organic growth in commercial rental, the benefit of acquisitions in all business segments, better used vehicle sales results, as well as organic growth in the Supply Chain Solutions (SCS) segment.
MIAMI, February 2, 2012
Total revenue for the fourth quarter of 2011 was $1.54 billion, up 17% from $1.31 billion in the same period in the prior year, reflecting the benefit of acquisitions, organic growth and
 
fuel services. Operating revenue (revenue excluding Fleet Management Solutions fuel and all subcontracted transportation) from continuing operations of $1.24 billion, rose 16% from $1.06 billion in the year-earlier period. Fleet Management Solutions (FMS) business segment total revenue improved 13% due to higher operating revenue, and to a lesser extent increased fuel services revenue. FMS operating revenue grew 12% due to acquisitions and higher organic commercial rental revenue. In the Company's SCS business segment, total and operating revenue increased 26% due to an acquisition and new business. DCC business segment total revenue grew 29% and operating revenue grew 23% reflecting an acquisition, and the pass-through of higher fuel costs.
Net earnings per diluted share, including discontinued operations for the three-month period ended December 31, 2011 were $0.93 versus $0.72 in the year-earlier period. Earnings per diluted share from discontinued operations (previously announced in 2009) for the fourth quarter of 2011 totaled $0.01 compared with a loss of $0.08 in the same period of 2010. Net earnings for the fourth quarter of 2011 were $48.1 million versus $37.1 million in the year-earlier period.
Commenting on the Company's full-year 2011 performance, Ryder Chairman and CEO Greg Swienton said, "In 2011, we delivered significantly higher, double-digit growth in both revenue and earnings despite volatile economic conditions. Our transactional products, including commercial rental and used vehicle sales, continued to perform exceptionally well, showing improvement not only in volumes, but commanding better pricing as well. In our contractual business, our largest product line, full service lease, began to show organic fleet growth in the latter part of the year, and we also saw significant organic improvement in Supply Chain Solutions. Although Dedicated Contract Carriage earnings showed an increase for the year, segment results were lower than our expectations. We generated very strong performance from the integration of five immediately accretive acquisitions completed since December of 2010. We also achieved a positive spread between our return on capital and cost of capital, and improved our return on equity by 350 basis points to 11.9%. In view of these factors, we have entered 2012 with good momentum, specific initiatives in place to accelerate organic growth, and confidence in our ability to deliver increased revenue and earnings even with only modest economic improvement anticipated in 2012."
 
Fleet Management Solutions
In the FMS business segment, total revenue in the fourth quarter of 2011 was $1.07 billion, up 13%. Fuel services revenue in the fourth quarter of 2011 increased 18%, due to higher fuel prices passed through to customers. Operating revenue (revenue excluding fuel) in the fourth quarter of 2011 was $813.3 million, up 12%. Full service lease revenue increased 5%, driven by acquisitions. Commercial rental revenue grew 38%, reflecting improving global market demand and higher pricing.
The FMS business segment's earnings before tax (EBT) were $69.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2011, up 41% from $49.5 million in the same period of 2010. Increased earnings reflect significantly better commercial rental performance, the benefit of the four FMS acquisitions closed in 2011 and improved used vehicle sales results. These items were partially offset by higher maintenance costs on an older lease fleet, investments in sales and marketing initiatives and higher compensation-related expenses. Commercial rental performance improved as a result of increased market demand on a 31% larger average fleet (13% excluding acquisitions) and higher pricing. Rental power fleet utilization was 79% for the fourth quarter of 2011, an improvement of 100 basis points from the year-earlier period. Used vehicle sales results were favorably impacted by higher pricing. Business segment earnings before tax as a percentage of operating revenue were 8.6% in the fourth quarter of 2011, up 180 basis points compared with 6.8% in the same quarter a year ago.
Supply Chain Solutions
In the SCS business segment, fourth quarter 2011 total revenue was $408.7 million, up 26%. Fourth quarter 2011 operating revenue (revenue excluding subcontracted transportation) was $324.7 million, an increase of 26%. SCS total revenue and operating revenue comparisons benefited from the acquisition of Total Logistic Control (TLC) in December of 2010. Operating revenue also benefited from new business.
The SCS business segment's earnings before tax of $17.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 rose 44%, from $12.3 million in the same quarter of 2010. The improvement was driven by the TLC acquisition, favorable insurance claims development and new business. Fourth quarter 2011 earnings before tax for the business segment as a percentage of operating revenue were 5.5%, up 70 basis points from 4.8% in the same quarter of 2010.
 
Dedicated Contract Carriage
In the DCC business segment, fourth quarter 2011 total revenue of $156.6 million improved 29%. Operating revenue (revenue excluding subcontracted transportation) in the fourth quarter of 2011 was $147.1 million, an increase of 23%. Total revenue and operating revenue increased due to the acquisition of The Scully Companies in January 2011 and the pass-through of higher fuel costs.
The DCC business segment's earnings before tax in the fourth quarter of 2011 were $7.0 million, up 7% compared with $6.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. The improvement was driven by favorable insurance claims development, partially offset by lower operating performance. Business segment earnings before tax as a percentage of operating revenue were 4.8% in the fourth quarter of 2011, down 70 basis points from 5.5% in the year-earlier period.
Central Support Services
Central Support Services (CSS) are overhead costs incurred to support all business segments and product lines. Most CSS costs are allocated to the business segments.In the fourth quarter of 2011, CSS costs were $52.0 million, compared with $48.0 million in the year-earlier period, primarily driven by higher compensation-related expenses, investments in information technology initiatives, and increased professional fees.
Restructuring and Other Items
Pre-tax restructuring and other items from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2011 totaled $3.3 million ($2.4 million after tax), or $0.05 per diluted share. The charge represents restructuring costs associated with the integration of the Hill Hire acquisition. In the first quarter of 2012, Ryder expects restructuring and other items of approximately $1.4 million ($0.9 million after tax), or $0.02 per diluted share, related to the integration of the Hill Hire acquisition. Pre-tax restructuring and other items from continuing operations in the fourth
 
quarter of 2010 totaled $3.2 million (also $3.2 million after tax), or $0.06 per diluted share. The charge included costs incurred on the acquisition of Total Logistic Control in December 2010, partially offset by a gain on the sale of an international supply chain facility.
Income Taxes
The Company's effective income tax rate from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2011 was 34.8% of pre-tax earnings, compared with 16.4% in the year-earlier period. The year-earlier period income tax rate reflected a benefit of $10.8 million (21.7% of pre-tax earnings), or $0.21 per diluted share, related to the favorable settlement of prior tax years as well as the expiration of a statute of limitations. Excluding the prior year benefit, the effective income tax rate from continuing operations decreased in 2011 primarily due to adjustments related to annual foreign and state tax filings.
Capital Expenditures
As planned, capital expenditures from continuing operations were $1.76 billion for 2011, compared with $1.09 billion in the same period of 2010. Net capital expenditures (including proceeds from the sale of assets) were $1.42 billion for 2011, up from $853.0 million in the same period of 2010. The increase in capital expenditures reflects investments to refresh and grow the lease and commercial rental fleets.
Cash Flow
Operating cash flow from continuing operations in 2011 was $1.04 billion, up 1% from $1.03 billion in the same period of 2010, due primarily to higher cash-based earnings, partially offset by changes in working capital needs. Total cash generated (including proceeds from used vehicle sales) from continuing operations in 2011 was $1.44 billion, up 9% from $1.33 billion in the same period of 2010. Free cash flow from continuing operations in 2011 was negative $256.8 million, down from a positive $257.6 million in the same period of 2010, due primarily to increased vehicle investments.
 
Leverage
Balance sheet debt as of December 31, 2011 increased by $635.1 million compared with year-end 2010, due primarily to acquisitions and increased investment in vehicles. The leverage ratio for balance sheet debt as of December 31, 2011 was 257%, compared with 196% at year-end 2010. Total obligations to equity as of December 31, 2011 were 261%, up from 203% at year end 2010. This increase reflects growth in the business and a pension equity charge. Total obligations to equity remain within Ryder's long-term target range of 250% to 300%.
Total revenue from continuing operations for the full-year 2011 was $6.05 billion, up 18% from $5.14 billion in 2010. Operating revenue from continuing operations for the full-year 2011 was $4.81 billion, up 16% from $4.16 billion in 2010.
Ryder's 2011 earnings from continuing operations were $171.4 million, compared with $124.6 million in the year-earlier period. Earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were $3.31 for 2011, up 40% versus $2.37 in 2010. Comparable 2011 earnings from continuing operations were $180.6 million, an improvement of 54% from $117.0 million in 2010. Comparable 2011 earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $3.49 rose 57% from $2.22 in 2010. Comparable earnings and earnings per share from continuing operations excluded restructuring and other items, and certain tax items in both 2011 and 2010.
Ryder's 2011 net earnings, including discontinued operations, were $169.8 million, up 44% compared with $118.2 million in 2010. Earnings per diluted share were $3.28 for 2011, an improvement of 46% from $2.25 in 2010.
Commenting on the Company's outlook, Mr. Swienton said, "We expect to build on the significant progress Ryder made in 2011. Even with an economic outlook that calls for only modest growth in 2012, we plan to deliver increased revenue and solid earnings leverage. In Fleet Management Solutions, we are forecasting organic growth in our full service lease fleet, with maintenance costs continuing at somewhat higher levels, resulting from a slightly older fleet. Our commercial rental product should continue to perform very well and we plan to grow
 
that portion of our fleet, while also maintaining improved pricing. Our used vehicle sales activity is expected to generate higher volumes with stable pricing. During the first half of the year, Fleet Management Solutions earnings comparisons will also reflect the benefit of the Hill Hire acquisition completed in June of 2011. In our Supply Chain Solutions business segment, which is now integrated to include all dedicated activity, we expect 2012 performance to benefit from new business and higher volumes. We are forecasting pension expense to increase by $0.18, well above our prior assumption. This increase is based on lower actual and projected pension asset returns. The impact of increased pension expense is already included in our forecast. At this early stage of the multi-year vehicle replacement cycle, we plan to invest significant capital to refresh and grow both the lease and commercial rental fleets. These investments will benefit revenue and earnings in 2012 as well as in future years."
Based on this outlook, Ryder forecasts full-year 2012 comparable earnings to be in the range of $4.00 to $4.10 per diluted share, excluding $0.02 per share of acquisition-related restructuring costs anticipated in the first quarter. This represents a mid-point increase of 16% over Ryder's comparable full-year 2011 earnings from continuing operations of $3.49 per diluted share. The Company is also establishing a first quarter 2012 comparable earnings forecast of $0.55 to $0.58 per diluted share. Total revenue for the full-year 2012 is forecast to be approximately $6.3 billion, up 4% from $6.05 billion in 2011. Operating revenue (revenue excluding FMS fuel and all subcontracted transportation) for the full-year 2012 is forecast to be approximately $5.1 billion, up 6% from $4.81 billion in 2011.
Ryder System, Inc. is a FORTUNE 500 commercial transportation, logistics and supply chain management solutions company. Ryder's stock (NYSE: R) is a component of the Dow Jones Transportation Average and the Standard & Poor's 500 Index.

Ryder's primary measurement of business segment financial performance, earnings before tax (EBT), allocates Central Support Services to each business segment and excludes restructuring and other items.
Earnings Before Tax (EBT):
In Ryder's business, capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, and trailers) primarily to support the full service lease product line and secondarily to support the commercial rental product line within Ryder's FMS business segment. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long-term agreements that result in ongoing revenues and cash flows to Ryder, typically over a three- to ten-year term. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the Company's fleet available for shorter-term use by contractual or occasional customers.
