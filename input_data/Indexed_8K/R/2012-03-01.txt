Ryder System, Inc. ("Ryder") posted a presentation on its website (www.ryder.com) containing an overview and certain additional information relating to its pension plan. A copy of this presentation is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
 
As discussed on Ryder's earnings conference call on February 2, 2012, Ryder is combining its financial reporting for its Supply Chain Solutions ("SCS") and Dedicated Contract Carriage ("DCC") segments to reflect how the businesses are run from both an operational and sales perspective.
