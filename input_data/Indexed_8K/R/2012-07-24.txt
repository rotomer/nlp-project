Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On July 24, 2012, we issued a press release reporting our financial results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2012 (the "Press Release"). We also hosted a conference call and webcast on July 24, 2012 during which we made a presentation on our financial results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2012 (the "Presentation"). The Press Release and the Presentation are available on our website at www.ryder.com.
The Press Release and Presentation include information regarding comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per share from continuing operations for both second quarter and year to date 2012, which are non-GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC regulations. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors, and allow for better year-over-year comparison, as the measures exclude from our GAAP net earnings from continuing operations and earnings per share from continuing operations, as applicable, (i) second quarter and year to date 2012 restructuring charges, (ii) 2012 tax benefits, (iii) a second quarter 2011 charge from a tax law change, (iv) second quarter 2011 acquisition related transaction costs and (v) 2011 restructuring charges, which are not representative of our ongoing business operations.
Additional information regarding non-GAAP financial measures can be found in the Press Release, the Presentation and our reports filed with the SEC.
The information in this Report, including Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2, is being furnished pursuant to Item 2.02 of Form 8-K and General Instruction B.2 thereunder and shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, except as expressly set forth by specific reference to such filing.
Item 9.01(d) Exhibits
The following exhibits are furnished as part of this Report on Form 8-K:
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99.1
News Release
 
 
 
 
 
 Ryder System, Inc. (NYSE: R), a leader in transportation and supply chain management solutions, today reported earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $0.91 for the three-month period ended June 30, 2012, up 15% from earnings per diluted share of $0.79 in the year-earlier period. Earnings from continuing operations were $46.8 million, up 14% from $40.9 million in the year-earlier period. Earnings per diluted share and earnings from continuing operations for the current year included a restructuring charge of $0.09 or $7.1 million. Earnings per diluted share and earnings from continuing operations for the year-earlier period in 2011 included a charge from a tax law change of $0.10 or $5.4 million and acquisition-related transaction costs of $0.03 or $1.6 million. Excluding these items, comparable earnings per diluted share from continuing operations for the second quarter of 2012 were $1.00, up 9% from $0.92 in the second quarter of 2011. Comparable earnings from continuing operations of $51.3 million for the second quarter of 2012 were up 7% from $47.8 million in the year-earlier period. The increase in comparable earnings primarily reflects the benefit of a Fleet Management Solutions (FMS) acquisition and organic growth in the Supply Chain Solutions (SCS) segment.
MIAMI, July 24, 2012
Total revenue for the second quarter of 2012 was $1.56 billion, up 3% from $1.51 billion in the same period last year. Operating revenue (revenue excluding FMS fuel and all subcontracted transportation), was $1.27 billion, up 6% compared with $1.19 billion in the year-earlier period, reflecting organic growth and the benefit of acquisitions. FMS operating revenue
increased 7% due to stronger organic full service lease and commercial rental revenue, as well as the Hill Hire acquisition. FMS business segment total revenue increased 3% due primarily to higher operating revenue, partially offset by lower fuel revenue. SCS business segment total and operating revenue increased 6% largely reflecting improved customer volumes and new business.
Second quarter results exceeded the Company's most recent forecast due to better than anticipated retail and wholesale pricing on used vehicle sales, lower maintenance costs resulting from ongoing operational initiatives, as well as lower discretionary overhead spending. While medical expenses were slightly lower than previously forecast, these costs still remained unusually elevated over year-earlier levels. Commercial rental demand was generally in line with expectations from the Company's most recent forecast.
Net earnings per diluted share (including discontinued operations) for the three-month period ended June 30, 2012 were $0.91 versus $0.77 in the year-earlier period. Earnings per diluted share from discontinued operations (previously announced in 2009) totaled a loss of $0.02 in the year-earlier period. Net earnings for the second quarter of 2012 were $46.7 million versus $40.0 million in the year-earlier period.
Ryder Chairman and CEO Greg Swienton said, "In the second quarter, Ryder continued to deliver solid year-over-year increases including 9% higher earnings and 6% growth in revenue, despite an uneven and challenging demand environment. Second quarter results were somewhat better than expected in our most recent forecast, reflecting stronger used vehicle pricing, lower maintenance costs, as well as lower discretionary spending. In addition, we are pleased that our contractual full service lease and supply chain offerings continued to perform well and in line with expectations. We have taken actions and made a number of timely adjustments that not only contributed to our results in the second quarter, but will better position our business going forward."
Fleet Management Solutions
In the FMS business segment, total revenue in the second quarter of 2012 was $1.10 billion, up 3% compared with the year-earlier period due to higher operating revenue. Fuel
 
services revenue in the second quarter of 2012 decreased 5% compared with the same period in 2011 due to lower fuel prices passed through to customers and fewer gallons sold. Operating revenue (revenue excluding fuel) in the second quarter of 2012 was $830.9 million, up 7% compared with the year-earlier period. Full service lease revenue increased 5% in the second quarter of 2012 due primarily to higher prices on replacement vehicles and organic fleet growth. Full service lease revenue also benefited from the Hill Hire acquisition, which closed in early June 2011. Commercial rental revenue increased 10% reflecting acquisitions and higher pricing; however, results were partially offset by lower commercial rental demand in North America.
The FMS business segment's earnings before taxes (EBT) were $76.7 million in the second quarter of 2012, up 7% compared with $71.5 million in the same period of 2011. Increased earnings reflect lower management incentive compensation, the benefit of the Hill Hire acquisition and organic growth of the lease fleet. These items were partially offset by lower rental performance, due primarily to lower utilization on a 17% larger average fleet (5% excluding acquisitions). Rental power fleet utilization was 75% for the second quarter of 2012, a decline of 370 basis points from the year-earlier period. Business segment earnings before tax as a percentage of operating revenue were 9.2% in the second quarter of 2012, unchanged from the year-earlier period.
Supply Chain Solutions
In the SCS business segment, which includes all activity related to the Company's dedicated contract carriage services, second quarter 2012 total revenue was $570.3 million, up 6% from the comparable period in 2011. Second quarter 2012 operating revenue (revenue excluding subcontracted transportation) was $485.7 million, up 6% compared with the same period a year ago. SCS total revenue and operating revenue comparisons benefited from increased automotive volumes and new business. SCS revenue in the current period also benefited from increased dedicated contract carriage activity. Additionally, SCS revenue benefited from comparisons with the year-earlier period, which included automotive production cuts related to the natural disasters in Japan.
The SCS business segment's earnings before tax of $30.4 million rose 9% compared with $27.8 million in the same quarter of 2011. SCS earnings performance in the second quarter of 2012 reflects higher operating revenue. The improved SCS earnings also reflect the 2011
 
automotive production cuts related to the natural disasters in Japan, which lowered earnings in the year-earlier period by approximately $2.7 million. The improved 2012 performance was partially offset by unusually high second quarter 2012 medical benefit costs of $2.8 million. Second quarter 2012 earnings before tax for the business segment as a percentage of operating revenue were 6.3%, up 20 basis points compared with 6.1% in the same quarter of 2011.
Central Support Services
Central Support Services (CSS) are overhead costs incurred to support all business segments and product lines. Most CSS costs are allocated to the various business segments. In the second quarter of 2012, the unallocated portion of CSS costs was $11.2 million, unchanged from the year-earlier period.
Non-Service Pension Costs
Beginning in 2012, the non-service components of pension costs have been excluded from segment earnings before tax in order to more accurately reflect the operating performance of the business segments. Non-service pension costs totaled $7.7 million in the second quarter of 2012, up from $4.8 million in the year-earlier period. This reflected primarily lower than expected pension asset returns in 2011, and lower assumed returns for 2012.
Restructuring and Other Items
Pre-tax restructuring charges totaled $7.1 million ($4.5 million after tax), or $0.09 per diluted share, and were associated with workforce reductions of approximately 350 employees, which was one of the Company's cost reduction initiatives implemented at the end of the second quarter. In addition, the Company eliminated approximately 100 open and temporary positions. In the year-earlier quarter, pre-tax restructuring and other items from continuing operations totaled $1.7 million ($1.6 million after tax), or $0.03 per diluted share related to Hill Hire transaction costs.
 
Income Taxes
The Company's effective income tax rate from continuing operations for the second quarter of 2012 was 36.6% of earnings before tax compared with 45.5% in the year-earlier period. The year-earlier period income tax rate was adversely impacted by a tax law change in Michigan, which increased income taxes by $5.4 million (7.1% of pre-tax earnings) and reduced earnings per share by $0.10 in the year-earlier period. The current period income tax rate was positively impacted by a higher proportionate amount of earnings in lower tax rate jurisdictions.
Capital Expenditures
Capital expenditures from continuing operations were $1.32 billion for the second quarter of 2012, compared with $880 million in the same period of 2011. Net capital expenditures (including proceeds from the sale of assets) from continuing operations were $988 million, up from $737 million in the same period of 2011. The increase in capital expenditures primarily reflects planned investments primarily to fulfill contractual full service lease sales to customers that are renewing and growing their fleets with Ryder.
Cash Flow
Operating cash flow from continuing operations through June 30, 2012 was $472 million, essentially flat compared with the same period of 2011. Total cash generated (including proceeds from used vehicle sales) from continuing operations through June 30, 2012 was $834 million, compared with $646 million in the same period of 2011. The increase in total cash generated during the quarter reflected a $130 million sale-leaseback of revenue earning equipment, as well as higher used vehicle sales proceeds. As expected, free cash flow from continuing operations through June 30, 2012 was negative $370 million, compared with negative $172 million for the same period of 2011, due primarily to the refreshment and growth of the full service lease fleet. Due to the sale-leaseback transaction, Ryder's full-year 2012 free cash flow is now forecast to be negative $270 million to $330 million.
Leverage
Balance sheet debt as of June 30, 2012 increased by $364 million compared with year-end 2011, due primarily to increased investments in vehicles. The leverage ratio for balance
 
sheet debt as of June 30, 2012 was 271%, compared with 257% at year-end 2011. Total obligations to equity as of June 30, 2012 were 284%, compared with 261% at year-end 2011. Total obligations to equity remain within Ryder's long-term target range of 250% to 300%.
Revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2012 was $3.10 billion, up 5% from $2.94 billion in the same period of 2011. Operating revenue (revenue excluding FMS fuel and all subcontracted transportation) for the first six months of 2012 was $2.50 billion, up 8% from $2.32 billion in the first six months of 2011. Ryder's 2012 year-to-date earnings from continuing operations were $81.6 million, up 22% compared with $66.8 million in the year-earlier period. Earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were $1.59 for the first six months of 2012 compared with $1.29 for the same period of 2011. Comparable year-to-date earnings from continuing operations were up 10% to $81.8 million, and comparable earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were up 12% to $1.59. Year-to-date net earnings, including discontinued operations, were $81.0 million, compared with $65.2 million in the year-earlier period. Net earnings per diluted share were $1.58 for the first six months of 2012 compared with $1.26 for the same period of 2011.
Commenting on Ryder's outlook, Mr. Swienton said, "Our timely responses, including many cost management actions throughout the Company, as well as adjustments to our fleet, position us to perform effectively in an uneven economic environment. The actions we have already taken are forecast to benefit earnings by approximately $0.18 per share in the second half of this year. The commercial rental product line is now aligned with current market demand, in terms of fleet size, mix, and age. In used vehicle sales, we will continue to balance our focus on maximizing proceeds, while managing our vehicle inventory to appropriate levels. In both Supply Chain Solutions and Fleet Management Solutions, we anticipate continued solid contractual growth. The near-term economic conditions are likely to remain uneven and challenging, particularly for our transactional offerings. However, the long-term trends driving increased use of Ryder's industry leading transportation and logistics services remain solidly in place and offer very attractive growth opportunities."
 
"Taking all of these factors into consideration, we are raising our full-year 2012 comparable earnings forecast to $3.75 to $3.90 per share, up from the previous range of $3.65 to $3.85. Additionally, we are forecasting third quarter 2012 earnings to be in the range of $1.15 to $1.22 per share, up 6% to 12% from comparable earnings of $1.09 per share in the third quarter of 2011."
Ryder System, Inc. is a FORTUNE 500 commercial transportation, logistics and supply chain management solutions company. Ryder's stock (NYSE: R) is a component of the Dow Jones Transportation Average and the Standard & Poor's 500 Index. The Company's financial performance is reported in the following two, inter-related business segments:
 
 
Ryder's primary measurement of business segment financial performance, earnings before tax (EBT), allocates Central Support Services to each business segment and excludes restructuring and other items, as well as non-service pension costs.
Earnings Before Tax (EBT):
In Ryder's business, capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, and trailers) primarily to support the full service lease product line and secondarily to support the commercial rental product line within Ryder's FMS business segment. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long-term agreements that result in ongoing revenues and cash flows to Ryder, typically over a three- to ten-year term. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the Company's fleet available for shorter-term use by contractual or occasional customers.
