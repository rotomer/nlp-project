Item 8.01 Other Events.
Gregory T. Swienton, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, has established a stock trading plan in compliance with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and our insider trading policy. Mr. Swienton's previous trading plan expired by its own terms on May 31, 2012. The new plan provides for the exercise of up to 83,563 stock options which are scheduled to expire in February 2013, and the subsequent sale of the acquired shares on the open market at prevailing market prices. The plan will commence on September 5, 2012 and continue until February 12, 2013, subject to specified limitations, minimum price thresholds and early termination or suspension upon the occurrence of certain specified events. The plan will be used by Mr. Swienton to provide for an orderly disposition of expiring stock options. The plan will not reduce Mr. Swienton's ownership of our stock below his stock ownership requirement. Any transactions effected under the plan will be disclosed publicly through Form 4 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Except as may be required by law, we do not undertake to report stock trading plans by other company officers or directors, nor to report modifications or termination of any publicly-announced plan, including Mr. Swienton's plan.
