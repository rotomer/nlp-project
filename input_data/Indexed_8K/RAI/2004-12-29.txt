ITEM 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
     On November 30, 2004, the board of directors of Reynolds American Inc., referred to as RAI, amended the Reynolds American Inc. Annual Incentive Award Plan, effective July 30, 2004 (the "Plan"), to eliminate the option to defer payment of future awards under the Plan, and to clarify the determination of awards under the Plan when a Plan participant is transferred to a non-participating company, returns to active employment while on salary continuation or severance pay or has his or her salary continuation or severance pay interrupted in the short term. A copy of the Plan, as amended on November 30, 2004, is attached as Exhibit 10.1 to this report.
     On November 30, 2004, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee of the Board of Directors of RAI approved the following compensation for the position of Non-Executive Chairman of the Board: an annual retainer of $114,000; Board meeting attendance fees of $2,500 per meeting; an initial grant of 3,500 deferred stock units under the Equity Incentive Award Plan for Directors of Reynolds American Inc. and Subsidiaries (the "EIAP") upon election as Non-Executive Chairman; an annual grant of 2,000 deferred stock units under the EIAP; and quarterly grants of deferred stock units equal in value to $20,000 per quarter under the EIAP.
