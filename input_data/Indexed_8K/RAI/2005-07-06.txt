Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
            On June 29, 2005, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Holdings, Inc ("RJR"), a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Reynolds American Inc. ("RAI"), completed the offering (the "Offering") of $300 million aggregate principal amount of RJR's 6.500% Secured Notes due 2010 (the "2010 Notes") and $200 million aggregate principal amount of RJR's 7.300% Secured Notes due 2015 (the "2015 Notes," and together with the 2010 Notes, the "Notes") pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act") and Regulation S under the Securities Act. The Notes are guaranteed by RAI and certain subsidiaries of RJR (the "Guarantors") and secured by certain assets of RJR and the Guarantors. In connection with the Offering, RJR and the Guarantors entered into a Registration Rights Agreement dated as of June 29, 2005, with the initial purchasers of the Notes (the "Initial Purchasers"). Under the terms of the Registration Rights Agreement, RJR agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission and cause to become effective a registration statement relating to an offer (the "Exchange Offer") to (i) exchange the Notes for registered notes (the "Exchange Notes") having substantially the same terms as the Notes, and (ii) exchange the guarantees related to the Notes for registered guarantees relating to the Exchange Notes having substantially the same terms as the original guarantees. RJR has agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Exchange Offer to be completed within 240 days after the issuance of the Notes. If the Exchange Offer is not so completed, the annual interest rate on the Notes will increase by 0.5% until this requirement is met. In addition, in certain circumstances, RJR has agreed to file a shelf registration statement that would allow certain holders to offer some or all of the Notes to the public. If this shelf registration statement is not effective in certain circumstances, the annual interest rate on the Notes will increase by 0.5% until the shelf registration statement is effective. Under the Registration Rights Agreement, RJR has agreed to indemnify the Initial Purchasers and the holders of the Notes against certain liabilities in connection with the Exchange Offer or registration statement, as the case may be, or contribute to payments that the Initial Purchasers may be required to make in respect of those liabilities. The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates have performed or may perform in the future various financial advisory, investment banking and commercial banking services from time to time for RJR and its affiliates, for which they have received or will receive customary compensation.
            A copy of the press release relating to the announcement of the closing of the Notes is attached to this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 99.1.
Item 2.03 Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Agreement of a Registrant.
            On June 29, 2005, RJR completed the Offering. The 2010 Notes issued in the Offering mature on July 15, 2010, and the 2015 Notes mature on July 15, 2015. Interest on the Notes will be payable semi-annually on July 15 and January 15 of each year, beginning on January 15, 2006. RJR may redeem all or a part of the Notes from time to time at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus a make-whole premium.
            The Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture (the "Indenture"), dated as of May 20, 2002, among RJR, as issuer, RJR Acquisition Corp. and R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, as guarantors, and The Bank of New York, as trustee, as amended by a first supplemental indenture dated as of June 30, 2003, pursuant to which R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., RJR Packaging, LLC, FHS, Inc. and GMB, Inc. became parties to such indenture as guarantors, and a second supplemental indenture dated as of July 30, 2004, pursuant to which RAI and BWT Brands, Inc. became parties to such indenture as guarantors.
            The Indenture contains covenants that restrict the ability of RJR and certain of its subsidiaries to mortgage or pledge certain of their assets to secure indebtedness, engage in sale/leaseback transactions or consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of their property and assets. The Indenture does not contain any cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions. The Indenture does not limit the ability of RJR to incur additional indebtedness.
            The Notes are guaranteed by RAI and by certain direct and indirect subsidiaries of RJR, all of which also currently guarantee the obligations of RJR under its revolving credit facility and under most of RJR's existing notes. Any Guarantor of the Notes that is released from its guarantee under RJR's revolving credit facility also will be automatically released from its guarantee of the Notes. RJR's revolving credit facility does not provide for the release of the guarantees of RJR's obligations thereunder in the event RJR's long-term debt is rated investment grade, although it does provide for the release of the security for the obligations of RJR and the Guarantors thereunder, as discussed below.
 
            Upon issuance, the Notes and the related guarantees will be secured by the stock of RJR and the subsidiary Guarantors and certain of their subsidiaries, indebtedness of subsidiaries of RJR and the Guarantors (to the extent owed to RJR or a Guarantor) and principal property (as defined in the Indenture) of RJR and the subsidiary Guarantors as and to the extent described herein. These assets constitute a portion of the security for the obligations of RJR and the Guarantors under RJR's revolving credit facility (which is secured by substantially all the assets of these entities) and secure most of RJR's existing notes and related guarantees. If these assets are no longer pledged as security for the obligations of RJR and the Guarantors under RJR's revolving credit facility (or any other indebtedness) for any reason, generally, they will automatically be released as security for the Notes and the related guarantees and for RJR's currently existing secured notes and related guarantees. Under the terms of RJR's revolving credit facility, generally, the security therefor will be automatically released at such time, if any, as certain debt of RJR is rated investment grade by each of Moody's Investors Service, Inc. and Standard & Poor's Rating Services. In addition, whether or not there is any change in the rating of any debt of RJR, the lenders under the revolving credit facility have the right, at any time, in their sole discretion, to instruct the collateral agent thereunder to release all or any portion of the security for both the revolving credit facility and the Notes without obtaining any consent or approval from any holders of the Notes. Further, RJR intends to seek the release of its stock or the stock of one or more subsidiaries that is currently pledged as collateral for the revolving credit facility; should such stock be released it will not secure the Notes.
            The Notes are RJR's unsubordinated obligations, ranking equally in right of payment with RJR's revolving credit facility and other unsubordinated obligations of RJR and, while secured, ranking equally in right of security to the extent the assets securing the Notes are the same as the assets securing RJR's other indebtedness. The guarantees of the Notes are the unsubordinated obligations of each Guarantor, ranking equally in right of payment with the obligations of such Guarantor under RJR's revolving credit facility and other unsubordinated obligations of such Guarantor and, while secured, ranking equally in right of security to the extent the assets securing such guarantee are the same as the assets securing such Guarantor's other indebtedness.
            In addition to serving as trustee under the Indenture, The Bank of New York also serves as trustee under the indentures related to RJR's existing notes, participates in RJR's revolving credit facility and is the transfer agent for the common stock of RAI. From time to time, RAI or RJR may enter into other relationships with the trustee or its affiliates.
            A copy of the press release relating to the announcement of the closing of the Notes is attached to this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 99.1.

Defaults and Remedies
            If an Event of Default described in clauses (a), (b), (c), (d) or (h) above (if the Event of Default under clause (d) or (h) is with respect to less than all series of Securities then outstanding) occurs and is continuing, then, and in each and every such case, except for any series of Securities the principal of which shall have already become due and payable, either the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of each such affected series then outstanding under the Indenture (voting as a single class) by notice in writing to the Company (and to the Trustee if given by Securityholders), may declare the entire principal of all Securities of
 
all such affected series, and the interest accrued thereon, if any, to be due and payable immediately, and upon any such declaration the same shall become immediately due and payable. If an Event of Default described in clause (d) or (h) (if the Event of Default under clauses (d) or (h), as the case may be, is with respect to all series of Securities then outstanding), (e), (f) or (g) occurs and is continuing, then and in each and every such case, unless the principal of all the Securities shall have already become due and payable, either the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of all the Securities then outstanding hereunder (treated as one class), by notice in writing to the Company (and to the Trustee if given by Securityholders), may declare the entire principal of all the Securities then outstanding and interest accrued thereon, if any, to be due and payable immediately, and upon any such declaration the same shall become immediately due and payable.

Each Holder of Notes by accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes. Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the federal securities laws and it is the view of the SEC that such a waiver is against public policy.
No Recourse Against Others

     The Company and the Guarantors agree to use their reasonable best efforts to keep the Shelf Registration Statement continuously effective until the expiration of the period referred to in Rule 144(k) under the Securities Act with respect to the Registrable Securities or such shorter period that will terminate when all the Registrable Securities covered by the Shelf Registration Statement have been sold pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement or otherwise cease to be Registrable Securities (the "Shelf Effectiveness Period"). The Company and the Guarantors further agree to supplement or amend the Shelf Registration Statement and the related Prospectus if required by the rules, regulations or instructions applicable to the registration form used by the Company for such Shelf Registration Statement or by the Securities Act or by any other rules and regulations thereunder for shelf registration or if reasonably requested by a Holder of Registrable Securities with respect to information relating to such Holder, and to use their reasonable best efforts to cause any such amendment to become effective and such Shelf Registration Statement and Prospectus to
 
become usable as soon as thereafter practicable. The Company and the Guarantors agree to furnish to the Holders of Registrable Securities copies of any such supplement or amendment promptly after its being used or filed with the SEC.
     (c) The Company and the Guarantors shall pay all Registration Expenses in connection with the registration pursuant to Section 2(a) and Section 2(b) hereof. Each Holder shall pay all underwriting discounts and commissions, brokerage commissions and transfer taxes, if any, relating to the sale or disposition of such Holder's Registrable Securities pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement or the Exchange Offer Registration Statement.
     (d) An Exchange Offer Registration Statement pursuant to Section 2(a) hereof or a Shelf Registration Statement pursuant to Section 2(b) hereof will not be deemed to have become effective unless it has been declared effective by the SEC.
     In the event that either the Exchange Offer is not completed on or prior to February 24, 2006, or the Shelf Registration Statement, if required hereby, is not declared effective on or prior to the 60 day after the Company and Guarantors are first requested to file the Shelf Registration Statement pursuant to Section 2(b)(iii) hereof, the interest rate on the Registrable Securities will be increased by 0.5% per annum until the Exchange Offer is completed or the Shelf Registration Statement, if required hereby, is declared effective by the SEC or the Registrable Securities become freely tradable under the Securities Act.
th
     If the Shelf Registration Statement has been declared effective and thereafter either ceases to be effective or the Prospectus contained therein ceases to be usable at any time during the Shelf Effectiveness Period, and such failure to remain effective or usable exists for more than 90 days (whether or not consecutive) in any 12-month period, then the interest rate on the Registrable Securities will be increased by 0.5% per annum commencing on the 31 day in such 12-month period and ending on such date that the Shelf Registration Statement has again been declared effective or the Prospectus again becomes usable.
st
     A circumstance that requires an increase in the interest rate on the Registrable Securities pursuant to this Section 2(d) is referred to as a "Registration Default."
     (e) Without limiting the remedies available to the Initial Purchasers and the Holders, the Company and the Guarantors acknowledge that any failure by the Company or the Guarantors to comply with their obligations under Section 2(a) and Section 2(b) hereof may result in material irreparable injury to the Initial Purchasers or the Holders for which there is no adequate remedy at law, that it will not be possible to measure damages for such injuries precisely and that, in the event of any such failure, the Initial Purchasers or any Holder may obtain
 
such relief as may be required to specifically enforce the Company's and the Guarantors' obligations under Section 2(a) and Section 2(b) hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the additional interest provided for in Section 2(d) shall be the exclusive monetary remedy available to holders of Registrable Securities in respect of Registration Defaults.
     3. . In connection with their obligations pursuant to Section 2(a) and Section 2(b) hereof, the Company and the Guarantors shall as expeditiously as possible, until the last day on which an Exchange Offer Registration Statement must be kept effective pursuant to Section 2(a) hereof in the case of an Exchange Registration, or on which a Shelf Registration Statement must be kept effective pursuant to Section 2(b) hereof in the case of a Shelf Registration:

other transaction, business development or event involving the Company or the Guarantors that may require disclosure in the Shelf Registration Statement, or if required to be kept effective after consummation of the Exchange Offer, the Exchange Offer Registration Statement, or (B) obtaining any financial statements relating to an acquisition or business combination required to be included in the Shelf Registration Statement, or if required to be kept effective after consummation of the Exchange Offer, the Exchange Offer Registration Statement, would be impracticable;

     (i) in the case of a Shelf Registration, upon the occurrence of any event contemplated by Section 3(e)(v) hereof, use their reasonable best efforts to prepare and file with the SEC a supplement or post-effective amendment to a Registration Statement or the related Prospectus or any document incorporated therein by reference or file any other required document so that, as thereafter delivered to purchasers of the Registrable Securities, such Prospectus will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; and the Company and the Guarantors shall notify the Holders of Registrable Securities to suspend use of the Prospectus as promptly as practicable after the occurrence of such an event, and such Holders hereby agree to suspend use of the Prospectus until the Company and the Guarantors have amended or supplemented the Prospectus to correct such misstatement or omission;
     (j) a reasonable time prior to the filing of any Registration Statement, any Prospectus, any amendment to a Registration Statement or amendment or supplement to a Prospectus or of any document that is to be incorporated by reference into a Registration Statement or a Prospectus after initial filing of a
 
Registration Statement (other than reports and statements filed by the Company or the Guarantors pursuant to the Exchange Act), provide copies of such document to the Initial Purchasers and their counsel (and, in the case of a Shelf Registration Statement, to the Holders of Registrable Securities and their counsel included in such Shelf Registration) and make such of the representatives of the Company and the Guarantors as shall be reasonably requested by the Initial Purchasers or their counsel (and, in the case of a Shelf Registration Statement, the Holders of Registrable Securities or their counsel included in such Shelf Registration) available for discussion of such document; and the Company and the Guarantors shall not, at any time after initial filing of a Registration Statement, file any Prospectus, any amendment of or supplement to a Registration Statement or a Prospectus, or any document that is to be incorporated by reference into a Registration Statement or a Prospectus (other than reports and statements filed by the Company or the Guarantors pursuant to the Exchange Act), of which the Initial Purchasers and their counsel (and, in the case of a Shelf Registration Statement, the Holders of Registrable Securities and their counsel included in such Shelf Registration) shall not have previously been advised and furnished a copy or to which the Initial Purchasers or their counsel (and, in the case of a Shelf Registration Statement, the Holders or their counsel of Registrable Securities included in such Shelf Registration) shall reasonably object;
     (k) obtain a CUSIP number for all Exchange Securities or Registrable Securities, as the case may be, not later than the effective date of a Registration Statement;
     (l) cause the Indenture to be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act, if not so qualified, in connection with the registration of the Exchange Securities or Registrable Securities, as the case may be; cooperate with the Trustee and the Holders to effect such changes to the Indenture as may be required for the Indenture to be so qualified in accordance with the terms of the Trust Indenture Act; and execute, and use their reasonable best efforts to cause the Trustee to execute, all documents as may be required to effect such changes and all other forms and documents required to be filed with the SEC to enable the Indenture to be so qualified in a timely manner;

     (n) in the case of a Shelf Registration, if reasonably requested by any Holder of Registrable Securities covered by a Shelf Registration Statement, promptly incorporate in a Prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment such information with respect to such Holder as such Holder reasonably requests to be included therein and make all required filings of such Prospectus supplement or such post-effective amendment as soon as practicable after the Company has received notification of the matters to be incorporated in such filing; and
     (o) in the case of a Shelf Registration, enter into such customary agreements and take all such other actions in connection therewith (including those reasonably requested by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Registrable Securities being sold) in order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of such Registrable Securities including, but not limited to, an Underwritten Offering and in such connection, (i) to the extent possible, make such representations and warranties to the Holders (if such Holders may reasonably have a due diligence defense under the Securities Act) and any Underwriters of such Registrable Securities with respect to the business of the Company and its subsidiaries, the Registration Statement, Prospectus and documents incorporated by reference or deemed incorporated by reference, if any, in each case, in form, substance and scope as are reasonable and customarily made by issuers to underwriters in underwritten offerings of debt securities similar to the Securities, and confirm the same if and when requested, (ii) obtain opinions of counsel to the Company and the Guarantors addressed to each selling Holder (if such Holders may reasonably have a due diligence defense under the Securities Act) and Underwriter of Registrable Securities, covering the matters customarily covered in opinions requested in underwritten offerings of debt securities similar to the Securities (which opinions and counsel, in form, scope and substance, shall be customary and reasonably satisfactory to the Holders and such Underwriters and their respective counsel), (iii) obtain "comfort" letters from the independent certified public accountants of the Company and the Guarantors (and, if necessary, any other certified public accountant of any subsidiary of the Company or any Guarantor, or of any
 
business acquired by the Company or any Guarantor for which financial statements and financial data are or are required to be included in the Registration Statement) addressed to each selling Holder (if such Holders may reasonably have a due diligence defense under the Securities Act) and Underwriter of Registrable Securities, such letters to be in customary form and covering matters of the type customarily covered in "comfort" letters in connection with underwritten offerings of debt securities similar to the Securities and (iv) deliver such documents and certificates as may be reasonably requested by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Registrable Securities being sold (if such Holders may reasonably have a due diligence defense under the Securities Act) or the Underwriters, and which are customarily delivered in underwritten offerings of debt securities similar to the Securities, to evidence the continued validity of the representations and warranties of the Company and the Guarantors made pursuant to clause (i) above and to evidence compliance with any customary conditions contained in an underwriting agreement.
     In the case of a Shelf Registration Statement, the Company may require each Holder of Registrable Securities to furnish to the Company such information regarding such Holder and the proposed disposition by such Holder of such Registrable Securities as the Company and the Guarantors may from time to time reasonably request in writing.
     Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in the case of a Shelf Registration Statement, or an Exchange Offer Registration Statement in connection with which a Participating Broker-Dealer has a prospectus delivery requirement, each Holder of Registrable Securities agrees that, upon receipt of any notice from the Company and the Guarantors of the happening of any event of the kind described in Section 3(e)(iii), 3(e)(v) or 3(e)(vii) hereof, such Holder will forthwith discontinue disposition of Registrable Securities pursuant to a Registration Statement until such Holder's receipt of the copies of the supplemented or amended Prospectus contemplated by Section 3(i) hereof or notice from the Company or the Guarantors that dispositions of Registrable Securities pursuant to the Registration Statement may be resumed and, if so directed by the Company and the Guarantors, such Holder will deliver to the Company and the Guarantors all copies in its possession, other than permanent file copies then in such Holder's possession, of the Prospectus covering such Registrable Securities that is current at the time of receipt of such notice. Any notice provided pursuant to Section 3(e)(v) or 3(e)(vii) shall not be required to disclose any possible acquisition, business combination or other transaction, business development or event if the Company or the Guarantors determine in the exercise of their reasonable judgment that such acquisition or business combination or other transaction, business development or event should remain confidential.
     If the Company and the Guarantors shall give any such notice to suspend the disposition of Registrable Securities pursuant to a Registration Statement, the Company and the Guarantors shall extend the period during which the
 
Registration Statement shall be maintained effective pursuant to this Agreement by the number of days during the period from and including the date of the giving of such notice to and including the date when the Holders shall have received copies of the supplemented or amended Prospectus necessary to resume such dispositions. The Company and the Guarantors may give any such notice only twice during any 365-day period and any such suspensions shall not exceed 60 days for each suspension and there shall not be more than two suspensions in effect during any 365-day period.
     The Holders of Registrable Securities covered by a Shelf Registration Statement who desire to do so may sell such Registrable Securities in an Underwritten Offering. In any such Underwritten Offering, the investment banker or investment bankers and manager or managers (the "Underwriters") that will administer the offering will be selected by the Majority Holders of the Registrable Securities included in such offering.
     4. . (a) The Staff of the SEC has taken the position that any broker-dealer that receives Exchange Securities for its own account in the Exchange Offer in exchange for Securities that were acquired by such broker-dealer as a result of market-making or other trading activities (a "Participating Broker-Dealer") may be deemed to be an "underwriter" within the meaning of the Securities Act and must deliver a prospectus meeting the requirements of the Securities Act in connection with any resale of such Exchange Securities.
Participation of Broker-Dealers in Exchange Offer
     The Company and the Guarantors understand that it is the Staff's position that if the Prospectus contained in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement includes a plan of distribution containing a statement to the above effect and the means by which Participating Broker-Dealers may resell the Exchange Securities, without naming the Participating Broker-Dealers or specifying the amount of Exchange Securities owned by them, such Prospectus may be delivered by Participating Broker-Dealers to satisfy their prospectus delivery obligation under the Securities Act in connection with resales of Exchange Securities for their own accounts, so long as the Prospectus otherwise meets the requirements of the Securities Act.
     (b) In light of the above, and notwithstanding the other provisions of this Agreement, the Company and the Guarantors agree to amend or supplement the Prospectus contained in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement, as would otherwise be contemplated by Section 3(i), for a period ending upon the earlier of (i) 180 days after the closing of the Exchange Offer and (ii) the first day after the consummation of the Exchange Offer when Participating Broker-Dealers no longer have a prospectus delivery obligation under the interpretations of the Staff of the SEC referenced in Section 4(a) (as such period may be extended pursuant to the penultimate paragraph of Section 3 of this Agreement), if requested by the Initial Purchasers or by one or more Participating Broker-Dealers, in order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of
 
any Exchange Securities by Participating Broker-Dealers consistent with the positions of the Staff recited in Section 4(a) above. The Company and the Guarantors further agree that Participating Broker-Dealers shall be authorized to deliver such Prospectus during such period in connection with the resales contemplated by this Section 4, subject to the Company's and the Guarantors' ability to suspend the disposition of Registrable Securities as set forth in Section 3.
     (c) The Initial Purchasers shall have no liability to the Company, any Guarantor or any Holder with respect to any request that they may make pursuant to Section 4(b) above.
     5. . (a) The Company and each Guarantor, jointly and severally, agree to indemnify and hold harmless each Initial Purchaser and each Holder, their respective affiliates, directors and officers and each Person, if any, who controls any Initial Purchaser or any Holder within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, reasonable legal fees and other expenses incurred in connection with any suit, action or proceeding or any claim asserted, as such fees and expenses are incurred), joint or several, that arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Registration Statement or any Prospectus or any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with any information relating to any Initial Purchaser or information relating to any Holder furnished to the Company in writing through J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., Citigroup Global Markets Inc. or any selling Holder expressly for use therein, that with respect to any such untrue statement in or omission from any preliminary prospectus relating to a Registration Statement, the indemnity agreement contained in this paragraph (a) shall not inure to the benefit of any Holder to the extent that the sale to the Person asserting any such loss, claim, damage or liability was an initial resale by such Holder and any such loss, claim, damage or liability of or with respect to such Holder results from the fact that both (i) a copy of the final Prospectus was not sent or given to such Person at or prior to the written confirmation or the sale of such Securities to such Person and (ii) the untrue statement in or omission from such preliminary prospectus was corrected in the final Prospectus relating to such Registration Statement unless, in either case, such failure to deliver the Prospectus was a result of non-compliance by the Company or any of the Guarantors with the provisions of Section 3 hereof. In connection with any Underwritten Offering permitted by Section 3, the Company and the Guarantors, jointly and severally, will also indemnify the Underwriters, if any, selling brokers, dealers and similar securities industry professionals participating in the
Indemnification and Contribution
provided
 
distribution, their respective affiliates and each Person who controls such Persons (within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act) to the same extent as provided above with respect to the indemnification of the Holders, if requested in connection with any Registration Statement.
     (b) Each Holder agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the Guarantors, the Initial Purchasers and the other selling Holders, their respective affiliates, the directors of the Company and the Guarantors, each officer of the Company and the Guarantors who signed the Registration Statement and each Person, if any, who controls the Company, the Guarantors, any Initial Purchaser and any other selling Holder within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the indemnity set forth in paragraph (a) above, but only with respect to any losses, claims, damages or liabilities that arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with any information relating to such Holder furnished to the Company in writing by such Holder expressly for use in any Registration Statement and any Prospectus.
     (c) If any suit, action, proceeding (including any governmental or regulatory investigation), claim or demand shall be brought or asserted against any Person in respect of which indemnification may be sought pursuant to either paragraph (a) or (b) above, such Person (the "Indemnified Person") shall promptly notify the Person against whom such indemnification may be sought (the "Indemnifying Person") in writing; that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have under this Section 5 except to the extent that it has been materially prejudiced (through the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses) by such failure; and , , that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to an Indemnified Person otherwise than under this Section 5. If any such proceeding shall be brought or asserted against an Indemnified Person and it shall have notified the Indemnifying Person thereof, the Indemnifying Person shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person to represent the Indemnified Person and any others entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Section 5 that the Indemnifying Person may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel related to such proceeding, as incurred upon receipt of appropriate supporting documentation. In any such proceeding, any Indemnified Person shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Person unless (i) the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person shall have mutually agreed in writing to the contrary; (ii) the Indemnifying Person has failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person; (iii) the Indemnified Person shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it that are different from or in addition to those available to the Indemnifying Person; or (iv) the named parties in any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the Indemnifying Person and the

Indemnified Person and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood and agreed that the Indemnifying Person shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceeding in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all Indemnified Persons, and that all such fees and expenses shall be reasonable and reimbursed as they are incurred upon the receipt by the Indemnifying Person of an invoice therefor. Any such separate firm (x) for any Initial Purchaser, its affiliates, directors and officers and any control Persons of such Initial Purchaser shall be designated in writing by J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. or Citigroup Global Markets Inc., (y) for any Holder, its affiliates, directors and officers and any control Persons of such Holder shall be designated in writing by the Majority Holders and (z) in all other cases shall be designated in writing by the Company. The Indemnifying Person shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the Indemnifying Person agrees to indemnify each Indemnified Person from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an Indemnified Person shall have requested that an Indemnifying Person reimburse the Indemnified Person for reasonable fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by this paragraph, the Indemnifying Person shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by the Indemnifying Person of such request and (ii) the Indemnifying Person shall not have reimbursed the Indemnified Person in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No Indemnifying Person shall, without the written consent of the Indemnified Person, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Person is or could have been a party and indemnification could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Person, unless such settlement (A) includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Person, from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (B) does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any Indemnified Person.
     (d) If the indemnification provided for in paragraphs (a) and (b) above is unavailable to an Indemnified Person or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each Indemnifying Person under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Person thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantors from the offering of the Securities and the Exchange Securities, on the one hand, and by the Holders from receiving Securities or Exchange Securities registered under the Securities Act, on the other hand, or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by
 
applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) but also the relative fault of the Company and the Guarantors on the one hand and the Holders on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the Company and the Guarantors on the one hand and the Holders on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company and the Guarantors or by the Holders and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
     (e) The Company, the Guarantors and the Holders agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 5 were determined by allocation (even if the Holders were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in paragraph (d) above. The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Person as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in paragraph (d) above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 5, in no event shall a Holder be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities or Exchange Securities sold by such Holder exceeds the amount of any damages that such Holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
pro
rata
     (f) The remedies provided for in this Section 5 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies that may otherwise be available to any Indemnified Person at law or in equity.
     (g) The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in this Section 5 shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of the Initial Purchasers or any Holder, their respective affiliates or any Person controlling any Initial Purchaser or any Holder, or by or on behalf of the Company or the Guarantors, their respective affiliates or the officers or directors of or any Person controlling the Company or the Guarantors, (iii) acceptance of any of the Exchange Securities and (iv) any sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to a Shelf Registration Statement.
