Exhibit 99.1
Reynolds American Inc. P.O. Box 2990 Winston-Salem, NC 27102-2990
Reynolds American Inc. (NYSE: RAI) today reported strong full-year and fourth-quarter 2005 financial results, and announced its full-year guidance for 2006.
WINSTON-SALEM, N.C.  Feb. 8, 2006 
"Reynolds American is off to a great start," said Susan M. Ivey, RAI's chairman, chief executive officer and president. "In 2005, we successfully rolled out R.J. Reynolds' portfolio strategy, captured an additional $350 million in merger synergies and completed the majority of our integration efforts. Our fourth-quarter and full-year 2005 results demonstrate the significant progress we are making in building a stronger business that delivers sustained earnings growth."
In addition, Ivey said, "To further enhance shareholder value, we raised our dividend by 31 percent, to $5.00 a share. In doing so, we established a dividend that returns approximately 75 percent of Reynolds American's net income to shareholders."
RAI's fourth-quarter and full-year results follow in two sections: one that presents measurements reported in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP); and a second section that provides certain GAAP measurements, to provide additional perspective on the company's performance.
pro forma
 
 
Fourth Quarter Financial Results (GAAP)
On a GAAP basis, fourth-quarter 2005 net sales were $2.05 billion, up 2.3 percent from the prior-year period. The increase was due to improved pricing and a prior-year returned goods charge, partially offset by volume declines.
Fourth-quarter 2005 operating income was $218 million, up 344.9 percent from the prior-year period. This was primarily due to the factors that affected net sales, as well as the benefits of incremental merger-related synergies, reduced merger-related costs and lower restructuring charges. These were partially offset by a Phase II growers trust benefit in the prior-year quarter. In addition, fourth-quarter operating income was reduced by approximately $200 million in non-cash impairment charges in both 2005 and 2004.
Net income was $297 million, up 290.8 percent compared with the prior-year quarter. This reflected the after-tax impact of the factors cited above, as well as an additional net benefit from favorable settlements of prior years' tax matters that were recorded during the fourth quarters of both years. Fourth-quarter earnings per diluted share were $2.01, up 294.1 percent from the prior-year period.
A table that details significant items that were included in GAAP results during the fourth-quarter periods of 2004 and 2005 is attached.
Full Year Financial Results (GAAP)
For full-year 2005, net sales were $8.26 billion, up 28.3 percent from 2004. The increase was primarily due to incremental revenues resulting from the July 30, 2004, business combination of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company and the U.S. business of Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation (B&W), as well as improved pricing.
Operating income for the full year was $1.46 billion, up 65.4 percent from the year-ago period. This reflected the same factors that impacted net sales, as well as merger-related synergies and lower merger-related costs. These were partially offset by higher MSA and tobacco quota buyout expenses, as well as charges related to settlements and the sale of R.J. Reynolds' packaging business.
Full-year 2005 net income of $1.04 billion was up 51.5 percent from the prior year. This reflected the after-tax net benefit of the full-year factors cited above, partially offset by a reduction in the amount of income from favorable tax resolutions recorded in 2005 compared with that in 2004. Earnings per diluted share were $7.06, up 14.4 percent from 2004.
 
Operating Company Volume
The following table summarizes fourth-quarter and full-year 2005 U.S. cigarette shipment volume for RAI's operating companies. The full-year volume increases were driven by the addition of former B&W brands and Lane Limited brands, beginning July 30, 2004.
 
Industry Volume and Mix
Based on information from Management Science Associates, Inc. (MSAi), industry volume for the fourth quarter of 2005 was 93.9 billion units, down 5.2 percent from the prior-year period. The industry's full-price mix was 71.1 percent for the fourth quarter of 2005, up 1.8 percentage points from the year-ago quarter.
Full-year 2005 industry volume was 381.0 billion units, down 3.4 percent from the prior-year period. Industry full-price mix for the year was 71.2 percent, up 1.6 percentage points compared with 2004.
The following results are presented as if the business combination had been completed as of Jan. 1, 2004 (GAAP basis). A table that reconciles GAAP to GAAP is attached. This table also details significant adjustments that were included in GAAP earnings during the fourth-quarter and full-year periods of 2004 and 2005.

"With net income growing 29 percent on a basis, our 2005 results clearly demonstrate the success of the merger," said Dianne M. Neal, RAI's chief financial officer. "We exceeded $1 billion in net income, and we reached that despite significant incremental charges."

Fourth Quarter Financial Results (
Pro Forma
GAAP)
Even though the merger was completed prior to the fourth quarter of 2004, results for that quarter differ from GAAP results for the same quarter. That is because GAAP results show certain acquisition-related costs in the fourth quarter of 2004, when they were incurred, whereas guidelines require that those costs be recognized beginning Jan. 1, 2004.

On a GAAP basis, fourth-quarter 2005 net sales were $2.05 billion, up 2.3 percent from the prior-year period. Fourth-quarter 2005 operating income of $218 million was up 175.9 percent from the prior-year period. Net income for the fourth quarter of 2005 of $297 million was up 216.0 percent from the prior-year period on a GAAP basis.

Full Year Financial Results (Pro Forma GAAP)
Full-year GAAP results are computed as if the merger had been completed on Jan. 1, 2004. As a result, the 2004 results include 12 months of operations at B&W and certain adjustments related to acquisition costs, compared with only five months of B&W operations included in the GAAP results. Other than these differences, the comparisons reflect all of the same dynamics that were discussed for GAAP results.

R.J. Reynolds' Retail Share (
Pro Forma
)
"Our 2005 market-share results show that our new brand-portfolio strategy is making a difference in the marketplace," said Lynn J. Beasley, R.J. Reynolds' president and chief operating officer. "Our focus on Camel and Kool as investment brands is delivering strong results, with both brands accelerating their growth and ending the year at their highest share levels in years.
"Camel's filtered styles exited the year with more than 7 percent of the U.S. market, which helped the brand achieve a full-year share of 6.68 percent  their highest ever," she said. "Kool ended the year with a national share of more than 3 percent, and had a full-year share of 2.98 percent, its highest full-year share since 1999. On a combined basis, Camel and Kool increased their full-year share by 0.58 share points in 2005  more than double their combined growth in 2004."
Beasley said that Camel and Kool's gains were the result of the increased support those brands receive as investment brands  with a strategy that focuses on strong brand positionings, product and packaging innovations, and superior retail execution and presence.
She noted that the company's new portfolio strategy is not only accelerating investment brand growth, it is also making headway in moderating overall company share declines. On a basis, the total company share decline for 2005 was 0.84 share points, versus a 1.27 share-point decline during the previous year.

"We are pleased with Reynolds American's performance and results in 2005, and 2006 will be another year of dynamic growth," Neal said. "R.J. Reynolds will continue to generate investment-brand growth and capture additional merger synergies  bringing us to our goal of achieving $600 million in annualized savings by the end of 2006.
"In addition," she said, "we will begin to realize savings from new productivity initiatives that will produce approximately $325 million in savings over the next five years. These savings, coupled with other elements of our new business model, will allow us to deliver annual EPS percentage growth in the low single digits, beginning in 2007."
In announcing the following 2006 forecast, Neal noted that Reynolds American has decided to provide earnings guidance on the basis of full-year GAAP earnings per diluted share. For 2006, Neal said, Reynolds American forecasts diluted earnings per share of $8.00 to $8.40. This estimate includes the after-tax effect of:
 
Neal said the company projects a 2006 volume decline of approximately 5 percent.
"We expect our balance sheet to remain strong in 2006," Neal said. "We should end the year with cash and short-term investments of about $2.7 billion, which includes merger-related cash costs of about $150 million. We expect debt at year-end of $1.6 billion."
