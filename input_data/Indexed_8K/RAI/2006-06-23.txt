Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
Exchange Offer
     On June 20, 2006, Reynolds American Inc. ("RAI") completed an exchange offer (the "Exchange Offer") for up to $1.45 billion aggregate principal amount of the 6.500% Notes due 2007, 7.875% Notes due 2009, 6.500% Secured Notes due 2010, 7.250% Notes due 2012 and 7.300% Secured Notes due 2015 (collectively, the "RJR Notes") issued by RAI's direct, wholly owned subsidiary, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Holdings, Inc. ("RJR").
     Pursuant to the terms of the Offer to Exchange and Consent Solicitation Statement, dated May 19, 2006 (the "Offer to Exchange"), validly tendered RJR Notes were exchanged for newly issued series of notes issued by RAI (the "RAI Notes"). Of the total aggregate principal amount of RJR Notes outstanding, approximately $1.29 billion, or 88.9%, were exchanged. The RAI Notes mature on the same date, and are in the same principal amount, as the RJR Notes for which they were exchanged. Interest on the RAI Notes accrues from the last interest payment date on which interest was paid on the RJR Notes exchanged for such RAI Notes. Interest on the RAI Notes is payable semiannually, in arrears, on the dates on which interest was payable on the RJR Notes exchanged for such RAI Notes. The RAI Notes are guaranteed by certain subsidiaries of RAI (the "Guarantors") and secured by certain assets of RAI and the Guarantors.
     Holders of the RJR Notes were eligible to participate in the Exchange Offer only if they were either: (1) "institutional accredited investors" as defined in Rule 501(a)(1),(2),(3) and (7) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and also "qualified institutional buyers" as defined in Rule 144A under the Securities Act; or (2) non-U.S. persons outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act.
     The aggregate principal amount of each series of RAI Notes issued in the Exchange Offer, and the interest rates and maturity and interest payment dates for the five series of RAI Notes (which are the same as for the corresponding series of RJR Notes for which the RAI Notes were issued in exchange), are as follows:
     The RAI Notes were issued pursuant to the indenture (the "2006 RAI Indenture") entered into on May 31, 2006, by and among RAI, the Guarantors, and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the "Trustee"). Debt securities issued under the 2006 RAI Indenture rank equally with each other and will be treated as a single class for certain purposes under the 2006 RAI Indenture, including with respect to any amendments of the 2006 RAI Indenture and any defaults affecting all series of debt securities issued under the 2006 RAI Indenture.
     The RAI Notes are redeemable, in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at the option of RAI, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (1) 100% of the principal amount of the RAI Notes, and (2) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the RAI Notes discounted to the date of redemption on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the applicable Treasury Rate (as defined in the 2006 RAI Indenture), plus accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount being redeemed to the redemption date plus a spread equal to the
 
optional redemption spread for the corresponding RJR Notes for which the RAI Notes were issued in exchange, as follows:
     The Guarantors fully and unconditionally guarantee, on a joint and several basis, the full and prompt payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on debt securities issued under the 2006 RAI Indenture. The Guarantors consist of RAI's material domestic subsidiaries, other than RJR. Under the terms of the 2006 RAI Indenture, if, in the future, any other direct or indirect subsidiary of RAI guarantees the obligations of RAI under its new credit facilities entered into on May 31, 2006, such guarantor will also be required to guarantee the debt securities issued under the 2006 RAI Indenture. Under the terms of the 2006 RAI Indenture, if any Guarantor ceases to be a guarantor under RAI's new credit facilities, that Guarantor will, generally, be automatically released from all of its obligations under the 2006 RAI Indenture, and its guarantee of debt securities issued under the 2006 RAI Indenture will terminate.
     The RAI Notes and the related guarantees are secured by certain assets of RAI and the Guarantors as and to the extent described in the 2006 RAI Indenture. These assets also constitute a portion of the security for the obligations of RAI and the Guarantors under RAI's new credit facilities (which are secured by substantially all the assets of these entities). If these assets are no longer pledged as security for the obligations of RAI and the Guarantors under RAI's new credit facilities (or any other indebtedness) for any reason, generally, they will automatically be released as security for the RAI Notes and the related guarantees. Under the terms of RAI's new credit facilities, generally, the security therefor will be automatically released at such time, if any, as RAI's six-year $1.55 billion senior secured term loan is paid in full and RAI obtains investment grade corporate ratings (with not worse than stable outlooks) from each of Moody's Investors Service, Inc. and Standard & Poor's, a division of the McGraw Hill Companies, Inc.
     The 2006 RAI Indenture contains covenants that (1) restrict the ability of RAI and certain of its subsidiaries to (a) mortgage or pledge certain of their assets to secure indebtedness without pledging the same assets as security for their obligations under debt securities issued under the 2006 RAI Indenture, (b) engage in sale/leaseback transactions, or (c) consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of their property and assets and (2) prohibit RJR from incurring certain indebtedness at any time it does not guarantee the obligations of RAI under debt securities issued under the 2006 RAI Indenture.
     The RAI 2006 Indenture does not contain any cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions, and does not limit the ability of RAI or any of its subsidiaries (other than RJR, as described above) to incur additional indebtedness.
     The 2006 RAI Indenture was filed as Exhibit 4.1 to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by RAI on June 6, 2006, and is incorporated herein by reference. The forms of the five series of RAI Notes are filed as Exhibits 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5 to this Report, and are incorporated herein by reference. This summary of the provisions of the RAI Notes is qualified in its entirety by reference to the 2006 RAI Indenture and the forms of RAI Notes.
Consent Solicitation
     In conjunction with the Exchange Offer and pursuant to the Offer to Exchange, RAI solicited consents (the "Consent Solicitation") to amend (the "Amendments") the indentures governing the RJR
 
Notes, dated May 15, 1999 (the "1999 RJR Indenture") and May 20, 2002 (the "2002 RJR Indenture" and, together with the 1999 Indenture, the "RJR Indentures") from the holders of the RJR Notes. The requisite consents to adopt the Amendments were obtained, and the Trustee, RJR as issuer, and RAI and the other guarantors of the RJR Notes consequently entered into a Sixth Supplemental Indenture to the 1999 RJR Indenture and a Fourth Supplemental Indenture to the 2002 RJR Indenture, effecting the Amendments.
     The Amendments provide for the elimination of substantially all of the restrictive covenants and a bankruptcy event of default from the RJR Indentures. These covenants, among other things, limited the ability of RJR and certain of its subsidiaries to mortgage or pledge as security for any indebtedness any shares of stock, indebtedness or other obligations of a subsidiary or certain principal property of RJR or certain subsidiaries, and to enter into sale/lease-back transactions.
     The Trustee and its affiliates have in the past provided, and are currently providing, banking, trust and other services to RAI and its affiliates, including as participants in RAI's credit facilities and as transfer agent for RAI's common stock. The Trustee served as exchange agent in the Exchange Offer and Consent Solicitation.
     The Sixth Supplemental Indenture and Fourth Supplemental Indenture are filed as Exhibits 4.6 and 4.7, respectively, to this Report and are incorporated herein by this reference. This summary of the provisions of these supplemental indentures is qualified in its entirety by reference to the supplemental indentures.
Registration Rights Agreement
     In connection with the completion of the Exchange Offer, RAI and the Guarantors entered into a Registration Rights Agreement dated as of June 20, 2006 (the "Registration Rights Agreement"), with the Trustee. Under the terms of the Registration Rights Agreement, RAI and the Guarantors agreed to use their reasonable best efforts to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission and cause to become effective a registration statement relating to an offer (the "Registered Exchange Offer") to (1) exchange the RAI Notes for registered notes (the "Exchange Notes") having substantially the same terms as the RAI Notes, and (2) exchange the guarantees related to the RAI Notes for registered guarantees relating to the Exchange Notes having substantially the same terms as the original guarantees. RAI and the Guarantors have agreed to use their reasonable best efforts to cause the Registered Exchange Offer to be completed within 210 days after the issuance of the RAI Notes. If the Registered Exchange Offer is not so completed, the annual interest rate on the RAI Notes will increase by 0.5% until this requirement is met. In addition, in certain circumstances, RAI and the Guarantors have agreed to file a shelf registration statement that would allow certain holders to offer some or all of the RAI Notes and related guarantees to the public. If this shelf registration statement is not effective in certain circumstances, the annual interest rate on the RAI Notes will increase by 0.5% until the shelf registration statement is effective. Under the Registration Rights Agreement, RAI and the Guarantors have agreed to indemnify the Trustee and the holders of the RAI Notes against certain liabilities in connection with the Registered Exchange Offer or registration statement, as the case may be, or contribute to payments that the Trustee and the holders of the RAI Notes may be required to make in respect of those liabilities.
     The Registration Rights Agreement is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Report and is incorporated herein by reference. This summary of the provisions of the Registration Rights Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Registration Rights Agreement.

Optional Redemption
     "Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any redemption date, (1) the yield, under the heading which represents the average for the immediate preceding week, appearing in the most recently published statistical release designated "H.15 (519)" or any successor publication which is published weekly by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and which establishes yields on actively traded U.S. Treasury securities adjusted to constant maturity under the caption
     "Treasury Constant Maturities," for the maturity corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue (if no maturity is within three months before or after the Remaining Life, yields for the two published maturities most closely corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue will be determined and the Treasury Rate will be interpolated or extrapolated from such yields on a straight line basis, rounding to the nearest month) or (2) if such release (or any successor release) is not published during the week preceding the calculation date or does not contain such yields, the rate per annum equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, calculated using a price for the Comparable Treasury Price for such redemption date. The Treasury Rate will be calculated on the third business day preceding the redemption date.
     "Comparable Treasury Issue" means the U.S. Treasury security selected by an Independent Investment Banker as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term ("Remaining Life") of the notes to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of such notes.
     "Independent Investment Banker" means any of Lehman Brothers Securities Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. or Citigroup Global Markets Inc. or, if all such firms are unwilling or unable to select the Comparable Treasury Issue, an independent investment banking institution of national standing appointed by the trustee after consultation with RAI.
     "Comparable Treasury Price" means (1) the average of five Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such redemption date, after excluding the highest and lowest Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (2) if the Independent Investment Banker obtains fewer than five such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such quotations.
 
     "Reference Treasury Dealer" means (1) Lehman Brothers Securities Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and their respective successors; provided, however, that if either of the foregoing shall cease to be a primary U.S. Government securities dealer in New York City (a "Primary Treasury Dealer"), RAI will substitute for such initial purchaser another Primary Treasury Dealer and (2) any other Primary Treasury Dealer selected by the Independent Investment Banker after consultation with RAI.
     "Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any redemption date, the average, as determined by the Independent Investment Banker, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Independent Investment Banker at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third business day preceding such redemption date.
     6. . The Company shall not be required to make sinking fund payments with respect to the Notes.
No Sinking Fund
     7. . Notice of redemption shall be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each Holder whose Notes are to be redeemed at its registered address. Notes in denominations equal to or larger than $2,000 may be redeemed in part but only in whole multiples of $1,000, unless all of the Notes held by a Holder are to be redeemed. On and after the redemption date interest ceases to accrue on Notes or portions thereof called for redemption.
Notice of Redemption
     8. . The Notes are in registered form without coupons in minimum denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000. The transfer of Notes may be registered and Notes may be exchanged as provided in the Indenture. The Registrar and the Trustee may require a Holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents and the Company may require a Holder to pay any taxes and fees required by law or permitted by the Indenture. The Company need not exchange or register the transfer of any Note or portion of a Note selected for redemption, except for the unredeemed portion of any Note being redeemed in part. Also, the Company need not exchange or register the transfer of any Notes for a period of 15 days before a selection of Notes to be redeemed or during the period between a record date and the corresponding Interest Payment Date.
Denominations, Transfer, Exchange
     9. . The registered Holder of a Note may be treated as its owner for all purposes.
Persons Deemed Owners
     10. . Subject to certain exceptions, the Indenture or the Notes may be amended or supplemented with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the time outstanding of all series affected by such amendment or supplement, voting as a single class, and any existing Default or compliance with any provision of the Indenture or the Notes may be waived with the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the time outstanding of all series affected by such Default, voting as a single class. Without the consent of any Holder of a Note, the Indenture or the Notes may be amended or supplemented to convey, transfer, assign, mortgage or pledge to the Trustee as security for the Notes any property or assets; to

Morgan Securities Inc. and Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and their respective successors; provided, however, that if either of the foregoing shall cease to be a primary U.S. Government securities dealer in New York City (a ''Primary Treasury Dealer"), RAI will substitute for such initial purchaser another Primary Treasury Dealer and (2) any other Primary Treasury Dealer selected by the Independent Investment Banker after consultation with RAI.
     "Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any redemption date, the average, as determined by the Independent Investment Banker, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Independent Investment Banker at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third business day preceding such redemption date.

EXHIBIT 99.1
Winston-Salem, N.C.  June 19, 2006  Reynolds American Inc. (NYSE: RAI) announced today the expiration of its previously announced offer to exchange, in a private offering, its new senior secured notes (the "RAI Exchange Notes") for up to $1.45 billion aggregate principal amount outstanding of notes (the "RJR Notes") previously issued by RAI's direct, wholly owned subsidiary, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Holdings, Inc. ("RJR"), and the related consent solicitation (the "Consent Solicitation") to amend the indentures under which the RJR Notes were issued. The exchange offer expired at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on June 16, 2006 (the "Expiration Date"). The RJR Notes consist of: $300 million aggregate principal amount of 6.500% Notes due 2007; $200 million aggregate principal amount of 7.875% Notes due 2009; $300 million aggregate principal amount of 6.500% Secured Notes due 2010; $450 million aggregate principal amount of 7.250% Notes due 2012; and $200 million aggregate principal amount of 7.300% Secured Notes due 2015. As of the Expiration Date, approximately $1.29 billion aggregate principal amount of the RJR Notes (approximately 88.9% of the total outstanding) had been validly tendered for exchange and not withdrawn, including: $236.4 million aggregate principal amount of 6.500% Notes due 2007 (78.8% of that series); $185.7 million aggregate principal amount of 7.875% Notes due 2009 (92.9%); $299.3 million aggregate principal amount of 6.500% Secured Notes due 2010 (99.8%); $367.9 million aggregate principal amount of 7.250% Notes due 2012 (81.8%); and $199.4 million aggregate principal amount of 7.300% Secured Notes due 2015 (99.7%).
RAI will accept all of these RJR Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn as of the Expiration Date. Settlement of the exchange offer is expected to occur on June 20, 2006. Upon settlement of the exchange offer, RAI will issue its new series of RAI Exchange Notes, in the aggregate principal amount of approximately $1.29 billion, each of which series will have identical terms as the corresponding series of RJR Notes exchanged with respect to principal amounts, interest rates, redemption terms and interest payment and maturity dates.
Holders of the RJR Notes were eligible to participate in the exchange offer only if they were either: (a) "institutional accredited investors" as defined in Rule 501(a)(1),(2),(3) and (7) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and also "qualified institutional buyers" as defined in Rule 144A under the Securities Act; or (b) non-U.S. persons outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act.
The RAI Exchange Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws. Therefore, the RAI Exchange Notes may not be offered or sold
 
in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and any applicable state securities laws. This press release does not constitute an offer to purchase or sell any securities or a solicitation of an offer to purchase or sell any securities.
In conjunction with the exchange offer, consents were solicited to eliminate substantially all of the restrictive covenants and a bankruptcy event of default contained in the two indentures governing the RJR Notes. As of the Expiration Date, the requisite number of consents to adoption of the proposed amendments to both indentures had been validly delivered and not validly revoked. Accordingly, The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as trustee under the indentures, RJR as issuer, and RAI and the other guarantors of the RJR Notes will enter into supplemental indentures effecting the amendments, which will be operative upon RAI's acceptance of the RJR Notes validly tendered in the exchange offer and not validly withdrawn.
