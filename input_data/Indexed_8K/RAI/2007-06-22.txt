Indemnification of the Underwriters
 
or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with any information relating to any Underwriter furnished to the Company and the Guarantors in writing by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein.
     (b) . Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the Guarantors and their respective directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls the Company or any Guarantor within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the indemnity set forth in paragraph (a) above, but only with respect to any losses, claims, damages or liabilities that arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with any information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company and the Guarantors in writing by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use in any of the Registration Statement, the Prospectus and the Time of Sale Information (or any amendment or supplement thereto); it being understood that the only such information consists of the following: (i) the list of Underwriters and their respective participation in the sale of the Securities immediately after the first paragraph under the heading "Underwriting", (ii) the second sentence of the third paragraph of text under the heading "Underwriting", (iii) the fourth paragraph of text under the heading "Underwriting" and (iv) the seventh paragraph of text under the heading "Underwriting" related to stabilization, syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids in any Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus.
Indemnification of the Company and the Guarantors
     (c) . If any suit, action, proceeding (including any governmental or regulatory investigation), claim or demand shall be brought or asserted against any person in respect of which indemnification may be sought pursuant to either paragraph (a) or (b) above, such person (the "") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnification may be sought (the "") in writing; that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve such Indemnifying Person from any liability that it may have under this Section 7 except to the extent that it has been materially prejudiced (through the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses) by such failure; and , that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to an Indemnified Person otherwise than under this Section 7. If any such proceeding shall be brought or asserted against an Indemnified Person and it shall have notified the Indemnifying Person thereof, the

Indemnified Person
Indemnifying Person
provided
provided, further
 
Indemnifying Person shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person to represent the Indemnified Person and any others entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Section 7 that the Indemnifying Person may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel related to such proceeding, as incurred upon the receipt by the Indemnifying Person of an invoice therefor. In any such proceeding, any Indemnified Person shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Person unless (i) the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person shall have mutually agreed to the contrary; (ii) the Indemnifying Person has failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person; (iii) the Indemnified Person shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it that are different from or in addition to those available to the Indemnifying Person; or (iv) the named parties in any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood and agreed that the Indemnifying Person shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceeding in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all Indemnified Persons, and that all such reasonable fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred upon the receipt by the Indemnifying Person of an invoice therefor. Any such separate firm for any Underwriter, its affiliates, directors and officers and any control persons of such Underwriter shall be designated in writing by the Representatives and any such separate firm for the Company, the Guarantors and any control persons of the Company and the Guarantors shall be designated in writing by the Company and the Guarantors. The Indemnifying Person shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the Indemnifying Person agrees to indemnify each Indemnified Person from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an Indemnified Person shall have requested that an Indemnifying Person reimburse the Indemnified Person for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by this paragraph, the Indemnifying Person shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 60 days after receipt by the Indemnifying Person of such request, (ii) the Indemnifying Person shall have received notice of the terms of such settlement at least 10 days prior to such settlement being entered into and (iii) the Indemnifying Person shall not have reimbursed
 
the Indemnified Person in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No Indemnifying Person shall, without the written consent of the Indemnified Person, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Person is or could have been a party and indemnification could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Person, unless such settlement (x) includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Person, from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (y) does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any Indemnified Person.
     (d) . If the indemnification provided for in paragraphs (a) and (b) above is unavailable to an Indemnified Person or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each Indemnifying Person under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Person thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantors on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) but also the relative fault of the Company and the Guarantors on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantors on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds (before deducting expenses) received by the Company from the sale of the Securities and the total discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters in connection therewith, as provided in this Agreement, bear to the aggregate offering price of the Securities. The relative fault of the Company and the Guarantors on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Guarantors or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
Contribution
 
     (e) . The Company, the Guarantors and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in paragraph (d) above. The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Person as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in paragraph (d) above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any reasonable legal or other expenses incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with any such action or claim subject to the receipt by the Indemnifying Person of an invoice therefor. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, in no event shall an Underwriter be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total discounts and commissions received by such Underwriter with respect to the offering of the Securities exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to their respective purchase obligations hereunder and not joint.
Limitation on Liability
pro rata
     (f) . The remedies provided for in this Section 7 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies that may otherwise be available to any Indemnified Person at law or in equity.
Non-Exclusive Remedies
     8. 
Termination
     This Agreement may be terminated in the absolute discretion of the Representatives, by notice to the Company and the Guarantors, if after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date (a) trading generally shall have been suspended or materially limited on the New York Stock Exchange or the over-the-counter market; (b) trading of any securities issued or guaranteed by the Company or the Guarantors shall have been suspended on any exchange or in any over-the-counter market; (c) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities shall have been declared by federal or New York State authorities; (d) a material disruption in securities settlement, payment or clearance services in the United States shall have occurred; or (e) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities or any change in financial markets or any calamity or crisis, either within or outside the United States, that,
 
in the judgment of the Representatives, is material and adverse and makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offering, sale or delivery of the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated by this Agreement, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus and the Time of Sale Information.
     9. 
Defaulting Underwriter
     (a) If, on the Closing Date, any Underwriter defaults on its obligation to purchase the Securities that it has agreed to purchase hereunder, the non-defaulting Underwriters may in their discretion arrange for the purchase of such Securities by other persons satisfactory to the Company and the Guarantors on the terms contained in this Agreement. If, within 36 hours after any such default by any Underwriter, the non-defaulting Underwriters do not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the Company and the Guarantors shall be entitled to a further period of 36 hours within which to procure other persons satisfactory to the non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase such Securities on such terms. If other persons become obligated or agree to purchase the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter, either the non-defaulting Underwriters or the Company and the Guarantors may postpone the Closing Date for up to five full business days in order to effect any changes that in the opinion of counsel for the Company and the Guarantors or counsel for the Underwriters may be necessary in the Time of Sale Information, the Prospectus or in any other document or arrangement, and the Company and the Guarantors agree to promptly prepare any amendment or supplement to the Prospectus that effects any such changes. As used in this Agreement, the term "Underwriter" includes, for all purposes of this Agreement unless the context otherwise requires, any person not listed in Schedule 2 hereto that, pursuant to this Section 9, purchases Securities that a defaulting Underwriter agreed but failed to purchase.
     (b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the non-defaulting Underwriters and the Company and the Guarantors as provided in paragraph (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities that remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, then the Company and the Guarantors shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Securities that such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder plus such Underwriter's pro rata share (based on the principal amount of Securities that such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder) of the Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made.
 
     (c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the non-defaulting Underwriters and the Company and the Guarantors as provided in paragraph (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities that remains unpurchased exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, or if the Company and the Guarantors shall not exercise the right described in paragraph (b) above, then this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of the non-defaulting Underwriters. Any termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9 shall be without liability on the part of the Company or the Guarantors, except that the provisions of Section 7 hereof shall not terminate and shall remain in effect.
     (d) Nothing contained herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter of any liability it may have to the Company, the Guarantors or any non-defaulting Underwriter for damages caused by its default.
     10. 
Payment of Expenses
     (a) Whether or not the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated or this Agreement is terminated, the Company and the Guarantors jointly and severally agree to pay or cause to be paid all costs and expenses incident to the performance of their respective obligations hereunder, including without limitation, (i) the costs incident to the authorization, issuance, sale, preparation and delivery of the Securities and any taxes payable in that connection; (ii) the costs incident to the preparation and printing of the Registration Statement, the Prospectus and the Time of Sale Information (including any amendment or supplement thereto) and the distribution thereof; (iii) the costs of reproducing and distributing each of the Transaction Documents and the Indenture; (iv) the fees and expenses of the Company's and the Guarantors' counsel and independent accountants; (v) the fees and expenses incurred in connection with the registration or qualification and determination of eligibility for investment of the Securities under the laws of such jurisdictions as the Representatives may designate and the preparation, printing and distribution of a Blue Sky Memorandum (including the related fees and expenses of counsel for the Underwriters); (vi) any fees charged by rating agencies for rating the Securities; (vii) the fees and expenses of the Trustee and any paying agent (including related fees and expenses of any counsel to such parties); (viii) all expenses and application fees incurred in connection with the approval of the Securities for book-entry transfer by DTC; and (ix) all expenses incurred by the Company and the Guarantors in connection with any "road show" presentation to potential investors.
 
     (b) If (i) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8, (ii) the Company for any reason fails to tender the Securities for delivery to the Underwriters or (iii) the Underwriters decline to purchase the Securities for any reason permitted under this Agreement other than pursuant to Section 9, the Company and the Guarantors jointly and severally agree to reimburse the Underwriters for all out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including the reasonable fees and expenses of their counsel upon the receipt by the Company of an invoice therefor) reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in connection with this Agreement and the offering contemplated hereby.
     11. 
Persons Entitled to Benefit of Agreement
     This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective successors and any controlling persons referred to herein, and the affiliates, officers and directors of each Underwriter, the Company, and the Guarantors referred to in Section 7 hereof. Nothing in this Agreement is intended or shall be construed to give any other person any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this Agreement or any provision contained herein. No purchaser of Securities from any Underwriter shall be deemed to be a successor merely by reason of such purchase.

Dated: June 21, 2007
, as Trustee
THE BANK OF NEW YORK TRUST COMPANY, N.A.
 
     References herein to the "Notes" mean the Company's Floating Rate Senior Secured Notes due 2011 and not to any other series. Other capitalized terms used, but not defined, herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture and attached hereto unless otherwise indicated.
Schedule I
     1.  The Company promises to pay interest on the principal amount of this Note. The Company will make interest payments on the Notes quarterly, in arrears, on March 15, June 15, September 15, and December 15 of each year, commencing on September 15, 2007 (each, an "Interest Payment Date") to the Holders of record at the close of business on the preceding March 1, June 1, September 1 and December 1, respectively, whether or not such record dates are Business Days. Interest on the Notes will be calculated on the basis of the actual number of days in the applicable Interest Period and a 360-day year.
Interest.
     The Notes will bear interest at a variable rate determined by the Calculation Agent. The interest rate for a particular Interest Period will be an annual rate equal to three-month LIBOR as determined on the applicable Interest Determination Date plus 0.70%. The interest rate will be reset on the first day of each Interest Period other than the initial Interest Period (each an "Interest Reset Date"). An "Interest Period" will be the period commencing on an Interest Payment Date (or the date of initial issuance in the case of the initial Interest Period) and ending on the day immediately preceding the next following Interest Payment Date. The "Interest Determination Date" will be June 19, 2007 in the case of the first Interest Period and the second London Banking Day preceding the beginning of the Interest Period in the case of each other Interest Period.
     On any Interest Determination Date, "LIBOR" will be determined by the Calculation Agent as follows:
 
     A "London Banking Day" is any day on which dealings in U.S. dollars are transacted or, with respect to any future date, are expected to be transacted in the London interbank market.
     All percentages resulting from calculation of the interest rate with respect to the floating rate Notes will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one-hundred thousandth of a percentage point, with five one-millionth of a percentage point rounded upward (e.g., 9.876545% (or .09876545) would be rounded to 9.87655% (or .0987655) and 9.876544% (or .09876544) would be rounded to 9.87654% (or .0987654)), and all dollar amounts in or resulting from any such calculation will be rounded to the nearest cent (with one-half cent or more being rounded upward).
     Promptly upon determination, the Calculation Agent will inform the Trustee and the Company of the interest rate for the next Interest Period. The Calculation Agent will also, upon the request of the holder of any Notes, provide the interest rate in effect for the then-current Interest Period and, if it has been determined, the interest rate to be in effect for the next Interest Period. All calculations made by the Calculation Agent in the absence of willful misconduct, bad faith or manifest error will be conclusive for all purposes and binding on the Company and the Holders of the Notes.
     Interest on the Notes will accrue from the date of initial issuance or, if interest has already been paid on the Notes, from and including the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or provided for, to, but excluding the relevant Interest Payment Date. If an Interest Payment Date (other than the maturity date) falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the Interest Payment Date shall be postponed to the next succeeding Business Day, unless such next succeeding Business Day would fall in the next calendar month, in which case the Interest Payment Date will be the immediately preceding Business Day. If the maturity date of the Notes falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the Company will make the required payment of principal and interest on the immediately succeeding Business Day, as if it were made on the date the payment was due. Interest will not accrue as a result of any postponed or delayed payment in accordance with this paragraph.
     The interest rate on the Notes will in no event be higher than the maximum rate permitted by New York law.
 
     2. . The Company shall pay interest on the Notes (except defaulted interest) to the Persons who are registered Holders of Notes at the close of business on the March 1, June 1, September 1 or December 1 immediately preceding the Interest Payment Date (except that interest payable at maturity of the Notes shall be paid to the same persons to whom principal of such Notes is payable), even if such Notes are canceled after such record date and on or before such Interest Payment Date, except as provided in Section 2.13 of the Indenture with respect to defaulted interest. The Notes shall be payable as to principal, premium, if any, and interest at the office or agency of the Company maintained for such purpose within the Borough of Manhattan of the City of New York, or, at the option of the Company, payment of interest may be made by check mailed to the Holders at their addresses set forth in the register of Holders, and provided that payment by wire transfer of immediately available funds shall be required with respect to principal of and interest and premium, if any, on, all Global Notes and all other Notes the Holders of which shall have provided wire transfer instructions to the Company or the Paying Agent. Such payment shall be in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts.
Method of Payment
     3. . Initially, The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., the Trustee under the Indenture, shall act as Paying Agent and Registrar. The Company may change any Paying Agent or Registrar without notice to any Holder. The Company or any of its Subsidiaries may act in any such capacity.
Paying Agent and Registrar
     4. . The Company issued the Notes under an Indenture dated as of May 31, 2006 among the Company, as issuer, certain direct and indirect subsidiaries of the Company, as guarantors, and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the .

To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control Repurchase Event provisions of the Notes, the Company will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations hereunder by virtue of such conflict. On the Change of Control Repurchase Event payment date, the Company will, to the extent lawful (i) accept for payment all Notes or portions of Notes (in excess of $2,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000) properly tendered pursuant to the Company's offer; (ii) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the aggregate repurchase price in respect of all Notes or portions of Notes properly tendered; and (iii) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee the Notes properly accepted, together with an Officers' Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Notes being purchased by the Company. The Paying Agent will promptly mail to each Holder of Notes properly tendered the repurchase price for the Notes, and the Trustee will promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) to each Holder a new Note equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of any Notes surrendered; provided that each new Note will be in a principal amount of $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000. The Company will not be required to make an offer to repurchase the notes upon a Change of Control Repurchase Event if a third party makes such an offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements for an offer made by the Company, and such third party purchases all Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under its offer.

If an Event of Default described in clause (d) or (i) (if the Event of Default under clauses (d) or (i), as the case may be, is with respect to all series of Securities then outstanding), (e), (f), (g) or (h) occurs and is continuing, then and in each and every such case, unless the principal of all the Securities shall have already become due and payable, either the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of all the Securities then outstanding under the Indenture (treated as one class), by notice in writing to the Company (and to the Trustee if given by Securityholders), may declare the entire principal of all the Securities then outstanding and interest accrued thereon,
 
if any, to be due and payable immediately, and upon any such declaration the same shall become immediately due and payable.
     The foregoing provisions, however, are subject to the condition that if, at any time after the principal of the Securities of any series (or of all the Securities, as the case may be) shall have been so declared due and payable, and before any judgment or decree for the payment of the moneys due shall have been obtained or entered as hereinafter provided, the Company or any Guarantor shall pay or shall deposit with the Trustee a sum sufficient to pay all matured installments of interest upon all the Securities of each such series (or of all the Securities, as the case may be) and the principal of any and all Securities of each such series (or of all the Securities, as the case may be) which shall have become due otherwise than by acceleration (with interest upon such principal and, to the extent that payment of such interest is enforceable under applicable law, on overdue installments of interest, at the same rate as the rate of interest specified in the Securities of each such series to the date of such payment or deposit) and such amount as shall be sufficient to cover reasonable compensation to the Trustee and each predecessor Trustee, their respective agents, attorneys and counsel, and all other expenses and liabilities incurred, and all advances made, by the Trustee and each predecessor Trustee except as a result of gross negligence or willful misconduct, and if any and all Events of Default under the Indenture, other than the non-payment of the principal of Securities which shall have become due by acceleration, shall have been cured, waived or otherwise remedied as provided herein, then and in every such case the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of all the Securities of each such series, or of all the Securities, in each case voting as a single class, then outstanding, by written notice to the Company and to the Trustee, may waive all defaults with respect to each such series (or with respect to all the Securities, as the case may be) and rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences, but no such waiver or rescission and annulment shall extend to or shall affect any subsequent default or shall impair any right consequent thereon.
     12. . The Trustee, in its individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Securities, and may otherwise deal with the Company, as if it were not the Trustee.
Trustee Dealings with Company
     13. .

Each Holder of Notes by accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes. Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the federal securities laws and it is the view of the Securities and Exchange Commission that such a waiver is against public policy.
No Recourse Against Others
     14. . This Note shall not be valid until authenticated by the manual signature of the Trustee or an authenticating agent and in accordance with the Indenture.
Authentication
     15. . This Note will be entitled to the benefits of certain Guarantees made for the benefit of the Holders. Subject to the terms of the Indenture, each Guarantor of the Indenture fully, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees, as primary obligor and not merely as surety, jointly and severally, to each Holder of the Notes and the Trustee the full and punctual payment

     In rendering our opinions below, we have also assumed that: (i) the Trustee is and has been duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization and is duly qualified to engage in the activities contemplated by the 2006 Indenture; (ii) the 2006 Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by, and constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of, the Trustee, enforceable against the Trustee in accordance with its terms; (iii) the Trustee is in compliance, generally and with respect to acting as a trustee under the 2006 Indenture, with all applicable laws and regulations; (iv) the Trustee had and has the requisite organizational and legal power and authority to perform its obligations under the 2006 Indenture; and (v) the Debt Securities (which include any Guarantees) will be duly authenticated by the Trustee in the manner provided in the 2006 Indenture.
     Subject to the foregoing and other matters set forth herein, it is our opinion that as of the date hereof:
     1. The Notes have been authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of RAI and, when executed by RAI and authenticated by the Trustee in accordance with the provisions of the 2006 Indenture and delivered and paid for as provided in the Underwriting Agreement, will be legal, valid and binding obligations of RAI, enforceable against RAI in accordance with their terms.
     2. The Guarantee of each Guarantor has been authorized by all necessary corporate or limited liability company action, as the case may be, on the part of such Guarantor and, when the Notes are executed by RAI and authenticated by the Trustee in accordance with the provisions of the 2006 Indenture and issued and delivered in the manner described in the Registration Statement, the Guarantee of each Guarantor will be the legal, valid and binding obligation of such Guarantor, enforceable against such Guarantor in accordance with its terms.
     We are opining herein as to the effect on the subject transaction only of the federal laws of the United States, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (and the applicable provisions of the Delaware Constitution and reported judicial decisions interpreting the Delaware General Corporation Law), the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act, the laws of the State of North Carolina and the laws of the State of New York. We express no opinion with respect to the applicability thereto, or the effect thereon, of the laws of any other jurisdiction.

("RAI") in an underwritten public offering pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on June 18, 2007 (Registration No. 333-143827) (the "Registration Statement'), as described in a prospectus supplement dated June 18, 2007 filed with the SEC on June 19, 2007. The Notes contain guarantees (the "Guarantees") by SFNTC and other subsidiaries of RAI (the "Guarantors"), and the Notes and the Guarantees will be issued pursuant to an indenture dated as of May 31, 2006, among RAI, as issuer, the Guarantors, as guarantors, and The Bank of New York, as trustee (the "2006 Indenture"), as amended by a first supplemental indenture dated as of September 30, 2006 (the "First Supplemental Indenture"). RAI and the Guarantors have entered into an Underwriting Agreement dated as of June 18, 2007, with J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., Lehman Brothers Inc., Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated and Citigroup Global Markets Inc., for themselves and on behalf of the Underwriters listed on Schedule 2 thereto, relating to the sale of the Notes and the Guarantees.
     We have examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of the documents and agreements covered by our opinions below, and have made such other examinations as we have, in our professional judgment, deemed
 
appropriate with respect to the subject matter of this opinion. As to any facts relevant to our opinions, we have relied upon certificates of officers of SFNTC. Except as may be expressly described herein, we have not undertaken any independent investigation to determine the existence or absence of any facts, and no inference as to our knowledge of the existence or absence of facts should be drawn from our representation of SFNTC. In such examinations we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures not witnessed by us, the conformity to originals of all documentation submitted to us as certified or photostatic copies thereof, the authority of the person or persons who executed any such documents on behalf of any person or entity (other than SFNTC) and the legal capacity of all natural persons.
     Based upon and subject to the foregoing and the further limitations and qualifications hereinafter expressed, we are of the opinion that:
     1. The 2006 Indenture and the First Supplemental Indenture have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by SFNTC.
     2. The Guarantee of SFNTC has been authorized by all necessary corporate action of SFNTC and has been duly executed and delivered by SFNTC.
     In rendering the foregoing opinions, our examination of matters of law has been limited to the laws of the State of New Mexico.
     This opinion is furnished to you in connection with the filing by RAI of a Current Report on Form 8-K, which will be incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement. We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion with the SEC as exhibit 5.2 to such Form 8-K. We also hereby consent to the reliance upon this opinion of Kilpatrick Stockton LLP, counsel for RAI and the Guarantors, in connection with its opinion to RAI filed as exhibit 5.1 to such Form 8-K. We further hereby consent to the reference to our firm under the heading "Legal Matters" in the Prospectus Supplement. In giving this consent, we do not thereby admit that we are in the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act or the rules and regulations of the SEC.
